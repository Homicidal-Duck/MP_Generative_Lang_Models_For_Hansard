<title>SALMON PRESERVATION IN UK WATERS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00243"><member>Lord BALFOUR of INCHRYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so I would apologise to some noble Lords, for it is clear that I should have added Wales, as has been forcefully pointed out to me by various noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00244">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00245">To ask Her Majesty's Government what further steps they propose either by legislation or order, for better preservation of salmon in the rivers of Scotland and England and the surrounding sea waters within the control of the United Kingdom.</p>
<col>2</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00246"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, SCOTTISH OFFICE (The Earl of Mansfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland is reviewing the law and the administration of salmon fisheries in Scotland, and he expects to make an announcement in due course. Informal consultations have recently taken place with representative bodies on a number of policy issues, including salmon protection, relating to inland and coastal fisheries in England and Wales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00247"><member>Lord BALFOUR of INCHRYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the Minister for that reply, may I ask whether he is aware that Norway, Iceland, Ireland and Canada have already updated their conservation legislation in order to meet the increasing danger from new technology to the diminishing stocks in in-season rivers? Could he further say that this country will not have to wait for some international convention but feels the need for urgent unilateral action to stop the present danger of the extinction of salmon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00248"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend's Question falls into two parts: first, what I might call the domestic front; that is, the taking of salmon in the sea not so far from our coasts. The whole question of salmon protection is currently under review. In the meantime the fisheries departments are seeking to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0010"/>
<col>3</col>
improve operational co-ordination of existing protection measures on both sides of the border. In an international sense, because British salmon are indeed taken many hundreds of miles from our coasts, the Government are at present considering proposals from the United States Government for an international convention to control salmon fishing at sea. I do not believe therefore that unilateral action on our part is either possible or desirable at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00249"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that, because salmon returning to their rivers to spawn swim close to the surface, they could virtually be wiped out by unrestricted continuous drift netting round the mouths of rivers and that this threat has arisen only within the last 20 years because of the new man-made fibres? Previously, the salmon were strong enough to break the mesh.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00250"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is referring to mono-filament nets; but better scientific evidence of the effect of these nets is needed. The question is being kept under review.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00251"><member>Lord CLIFFORD of CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the fact that salmon from our rivers go off to Greenland and elsewhere? And would it not be possible to have some international agreement whereby we can stop the salmon being (shall I use the word?) poached off Greenland before they come back to our rivers in this island?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00252"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, this is the international part of the reply which I was attempting to make to the supplementary question of my noble friend Lord Balfour of Inchrye. There are two parts. There is the domestic salmon protection and also international measures. It is these which at the moment the Government are considering in the light of various proposals made by the United States Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00253"><member>The Earl of ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if, as I believe is the case, it is the Danes who are the major culprits in fishing salmon in their feeding grounds between Canada and Greenland&#x2014;and they, the Danes, have no natural salmon spawning rivers and
<col>4</col>
have no interest in keeping salmon spawning rivers&#x2014;can my noble friend undertake that this will be brought very much into the consideration of Her Majesty's Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00254"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have our differences with the Danes over various fishing matters, but I think that it is right to say that there has been considerable co-operation between Her Majesty's Government and the Danish Government for some considerable time as to the fishing off Greenland. But I agree with my noble friend that this is not a question that we can ever put aside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00255"><member>Lord LEONARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister be so kind as to let me know whether this is an auspicious opening for the House of Lords, or have you your priorities right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00256"><member>The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Lord Soames)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having heard that supplementary question, I think that it would be a good idea if we moved on to the next Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00257"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we do so, as only three minutes have passed, can my noble friend confirm that, because salmon fishings are highly rated as in paying local rates in Scotland, a great deal of finance comes in to local authorities and it is an important element in the economy in Scotland?</membercontribution></p>

<title>LICENSING COMPENSATION<lb/>FUND: DISPOSAL</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00258">2.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00259"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00260">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00261">To ask Her Majesty's Government what they propose to do about the disposal of the Licensing Compensation Fund when the Brewers' Society have submitted revised proposals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00262"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, revised proposals have been received from the Brewers' Society and have been
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0011"/>
<col>5</col>
discussed with them. Further consultations within Government will need to take place before a decision can be reached on the disposal of the funds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00263"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I thank my noble friend for that Answer? I think it is the thirteenth in four years. Does he not agree that it is time the Brewers' Society proposals were put into action? Further, does he not agree that some of the money should go towards rehabilitating the unfortunate alcoholic in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00264"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his interest in an important fund. If I may first reply to the first part of his supplementary question, we have taken a step forward. We now have proposals from the Brewers' Society and we really do have to look at them to see that they are practicable and not too costly to administer. Regarding the second part of my noble friend's question, the Government attach importance to the principle accepted by other parties to the discussions that the money should be used, at least in part, for public purposes such as those that the Erroll Committee had in mind some seven years ago. These include the types of purpose which I know my noble friend has in mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00265"><member>Lord PAGET of NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the Government's need for early and urgent popularity, is there not a case for devoting this fund to reducing the price of beer? It would be the only price that is reduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00266"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, maybe that would help with alcoholic troubles; maybe it would not. From the time that the Erroll Committee sat, most people have felt that at least part of these funds should be devoted to trying to help generally with the problem of alcoholism.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00267"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord inform the House for how many years this fund has been held up? The charities&#x2014;which are very well deserving&#x2014;need the money. When he meets the Brewers' Society again will he explain why this matter has taken so many years? How many more years is it going to take before the charities benefit from the fund?</membercontribution></p>
<col>6</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00268"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think I wish to go back to the time of pre-1904 licences. But, to be more helpful to the noble Lord, a genuine answer is that the Brewers' Society scheme has to be looked at carefully&#x2014;and we received it only in July&#x2014;first of all to see whether it is too costly to administer. The question of administering a trust has to be worked out, and I must be blunt and say that the distribution of these moneys will need legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00269"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister say how much money there is in this fascinating "kitty"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00270"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: Over &#x00A3;4 million, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00271"><member>Lord HAMNETT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister able to give the House any information as to when there are likely to be any enactments arising from the Erroll Committee Report?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00272"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that that goes a little wider than the Question I was asked. If the noble Lord cares to put a Question down, I shall do my best to reply to him.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GENEVA DISARMAMENT COMMITTEE: PROGRESS REVIEW</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00273">2.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00274"><member>Lord BROCKWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00275">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00276">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will report on the progress of the Geneva Disarmament Committee which is considering the recommendations of the United Nations Special Assembly on Disarmament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00277"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have already done so. A review of the work of the committee can be found in the first issue of the Government's Arms Control and Disarmament Newsletter and in the speech made by my honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to the First Committee of the United Nations on
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0012"/>
<col>7</col>
October 17th. Copies of both are in the Library of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00278"><member>Lord BROCKWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, should not the House and the public be made more aware of what has been happening at this committee? Has it not discussed the test ban treaty, nuclear disarmament and a ban on chemical, radiological and new weapons of destruction? Surely, this House and the public ought to have more information. What has occurred since the speech of the Foreign Secretary at the United Nations Assembly?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00279"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord that the proceedings of this committee ought to be more widely disseminated, but I do not think there is anything more we can do than we have done already.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00280"><member>Lord BROCKWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask two specific questions arising from these discussions. First, the negotiations regarding a ban on chemical weapons between the US and the USSR having dragged on for four years, is it not possible for the Geneva Committee itself to prepare a convention? Secondly, with regard to the objection of the West to a ban on new weapons of destruction until a weapon has been identified&#x2014;is that not too late? Cannot research on new weapons of destruction be put into operation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00281"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may take up the point made by the noble Lord concerning chemical weapons, the committee on disarmament has not yet been able to start negotiating a treaty text because of the need to avoid impeding the bilateral US and USSR talks. While we acknowledge the pressure for the committee to start multilateral negotiations on chemical weapons, we believe such negotiations will be useful only if both the United States and the Soviet Union are in broad agreement.<lb/>
On the more general point of restricting new weapons before they are even developed, I think the noble Lord has a point, but I would remind him that in this, as in many other spheres of disarmament negotiation, we are anxious that any treaty we negotiate is effective and must include proper confirmatory arrangements.</membercontribution></p>
<col>8</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00282"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I put two points to the Minister. First, does he agree that while it is essential that the United States and the Soviet Union should be in fundamental agreement on all practical forms of disarmament, including the banning of chemical weapons, which has been raised this afternoon, nevertheless it is also essential for the enlarged committee in Geneva to have a say in these matters? In the past there has been a suspicion that disarmament talks have been confined to the negotiations of the two super powers without the rest of the world being properly consulted. I hope the Minister will confirm that Her Majesty's Government will take that view in regard to the work of the Geneva Committee.<lb/>
The second point is this: relating to our ambassadorial representation in Geneva for this purpose, can we take it that our permanent representative in Geneva for disarmament purposes will continue to have ambassadorial status and that his base will be Geneva rather than London?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00283"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two points again: I shall have to take advice on the precise diplomatic status of our representative in Geneva and I will write to the noble Lord, if I may. On the question of whether we should proceed with negotiations for a multilateral treaty on, for example, chemical weapons while bilateral talks between the US and the USSR are in progress, that is a matter of judgment, I think; and our judgment is certainly that these bilateral talks would be impeded if we were to proceed on a multilateral basis at this time.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GATWICK AIRPORT: SECOND RUNWAY AGREEMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00284">2.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00285"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00286">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00287">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they were consulted in advance by the British Airports Authority as to that authority's intention to give an undertaking to the West Sussex County Council not to build the second runway
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0013"/>
<col>9</col>
at Gatwick for 40 years and whether they regard themselves as bound by this undertaking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00288"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the present Government were not consulted about the agreement and are not parties to it. Not being parties to the agreement, the Government cannot be bound by it. The Government will reach their view on this and other matters concerning expansion of London's airports when they receive shortly the reports of the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy and the Study Group on South-East Airports.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00289"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that wholly satisfactory reply. may I ask him to confirm what I think is his implication&#x2014;namely, that if, either as a result of the current review of the London airports or for other reasons at any time during the subsequent 40 years, while the Government will no doubt be in office, they will regard themselves as wholly free to direct the British Airports Authority to construct a second runway if in the judgment of the Government it is required?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00290"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in some difficulty in replying to that supplementary, because of the quasi-judicial functions of my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Trade in relation to the forthcoming inquiry into a second terminal at Gatwick. I think it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to express a view such as that for which the noble Lord asks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00291"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend, I think, misunderstood my Question. I did not ask him to confirm what the Government would do; I asked him to confirm that the Government could, if they so wished, give such a direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00292"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think I can go further than my original Answer, and perhaps I might quote just one sentence from it:
<quote>"Not being parties to the agreement, the Government cannot be bound by it".</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00293"><member>Baroness BURTON of COVENTRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could the Minister see that publicity is given to that welcome reply?
<col>10</col>
Is he aware that the opinion of people who are interested in these matters is that really it has been no use pursuing the question of the second runway, because the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, has tried on many occasions and we have always been met with the fact that the British Airports Authority would not con-done it? May I ask him, finally, whether he would not agree that it is probably even more important to have a second runway at Gatwick than to have a second terminal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00294"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have not yet reached their conclusion in this matter. As I said in my original Answer, we are awaiting the reports of the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy and of the Study Group on South-East Airports. Until those reports are received we have an open mind on these matters, and certainly we have reached no conclusion as to whether or not there should be a second runway at Gatwick. When our predecessors were in office they announced in the 1978 White Paper that they saw, if my memory serves me aright, "no future" in the proposal for a second runway at Gatwick. We reserved our position on that White Paper when we were in Opposition, and are not yet in a position to announce our conclusions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00295"><member>Lord HARVEY of PRESTBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the cargo village at Gatwick was built on land that might have been available for the second runway? Is he aware that, even if the Airports Authority and others concerned were to agree that a second runway was necessary, it probably could not be built?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00296"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware that the cargo village recently constructed at Gatwick is along the line of one of the possible sites for a second runway.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00297"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord not aware of the fact that obviously the building of runways at airports is a very explosive matter for a lot of people living in the area? Will the Minister make sure that the West Sussex County Council and the British Airports Authority are informed that the Government are not bound by their decision?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0014"/>
<col>11</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00298"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in fact certain that the British Airports Authority and the West Sussex County Council are well aware of the thoughts contained in my Answer today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00299"><member>The Earl of ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord not aware that large numbers, if not the majority, of people both in Sussex and in Surrey, where I live, would be wholly opposed to the building of a second runway at Gatwick airport, especially after this pledge by the county council concerned that a second runway would not be built? Is the noble Lord aware that local feeling runs very, very high indeed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00300"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the position is not entirely one for the local authority. There are other people concerned, including the Government and the British Airports Authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00301"><member>Lord HAWKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I confirm what my noble friend Lord Onslow has said&#x2014;<lb/>
Several Noble Lords: No! Question!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00302"><member>Lord HAWKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that his answer will be received with the greatest regret by all the inhabitants of West Sussex? Does this mean that any bargain done with the aid of a Government agency can be repudiated by the central Government if they wish to do so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00303"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the final conclusion in this matter must rest with the Government and we have not yet made our decision.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00318">In the Title, line 24, leave out ("preliminaries to marriage") and insert ("the validity of marriages").</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00319">The noble Earl said: My Lords, with the permission of the House&#x2014;and it will be for its convenience&#x2014;I shall move all the Amendments&#x2014;that is to say, Amendments Nos. 1 to 4&#x2014;together. These amendments have been drafted in response to comments made by the Law Society of Scotland, which pointed out that the provisions of Clause 18 as introduced did not go far enough. They suggested that the clause should amend the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 in such a way as to validate all marriages which had been duly registered, but which might theoretically be open to challenge on the ground of procedural defect or even non-capacity on the part of the celebrant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00320">As such defects are, almost invariably, the fault of clergymen or officials, the marrying parties being themselves in no way to blame, it is considered right that the opportunity should now be taken to remove any possible question about the validity of any marriage where such defects have occurred. These amendments make it clear that any such marriages are valid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00321">Amendment No. 1 effectively replaces the whole of subsection (1) of Clause 18 of the Bill, and is in four parts. Paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> amend Sections 6 and 8 of the 1977 Act, which state that marriages "may be solemnised only" in accordance with their provisions, by inserting a reference to the new Section 23A inserted by paragraph <i>(d).</i> These amendments make it clear that, even if in a particular marriage the provisions of Sections 6 and 8 are contravened, that marriage will be valid. Paragraph <i>(c)</i> provides for subsections (2) and (3) of Section 13 of the 1977 Act to cease to have effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00322">Paragraph <i>(d)</i> inserts into the 1977 Act a new Section 23A which validates in general terms marriages at which both parties were present and which were duly registered. This validation does not extend to marriages which contravene the provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of the 1977 Act, which deal with the substantive matters of minimum age of marriage
<col>14</col>
and forbidden degrees of marriage. It is also without prejudice to subsection (1) of Section 24 of the 1977 Act, which, <i>inter alia,</i> makes the solemnisation of a marriage in certain circumstances an offence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00323">Amendment No. 2 is a drafting amendment consequential upon Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 3 gives formal effect to the repeal of Section 13(2) and (3), already removed by paragraph <i>(c)</i> of Amendment No. 1. Amendment No. 4 amends the Bill's Long Title by substituting a reference to "the validity of marriages" for the present reference to marriage preliminaries. This arises from Amendment No. 1.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00324">It may be proper of me to say that I sent to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, who has spoken for noble Lords opposite at previous stages of this Bill, a copy of the amendments before they were tabled, plus an explanation. I am glad to say that, while official duties keep him beyond the Border, he has expressed himself in writing to me as satisfied as to their propriety. My Lords, I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00326"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if legislation putting right defects which are almost invariably the fault of clergymen or officials can be said to be anything but beneficial, yes, my Lords, it is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00327"><member>Lord DRUMALBYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, was I right in understanding my noble friend to say&#x2014;I hope that I was not&#x2014;that the effect of one of these amendments would be to validate a marriage which it was an offence to solemnise?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00328"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. I think I am right in saying that the amendment is without prejudice to subsection (1) of Section 24 of the 1977 Act, which in itself makes the solemnisation of a marriage in certain circumstances an offence. What these amendments do is to validate a situation which might exist through no fault of the parties, but through

<title>ECC 16th REPORT: LAWS ON CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00330">3.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00331"><member>Baroness WHITE</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the Sixteenth Report of the European Communities Committee on the approximation of laws relating to construction products (R/3289/78) (H.L. 64). The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move that this House takes note of the 16th Report of the Select Committee on the European Communities which deals with construction products. This may sound rather a dull subject for those who are not specialists in the matter, but in fact this report on a draft Directive and a draft resolution considers matters of quite considerable importance in the constitutional and administrative arrangements of the European Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00332">In an accompanying memorandum, included in the report from the Department of the Environment, it is made quite clear that these documents may be regarded as a test case, and therefore it was the view of the Select Committee that we should draw the attention of your Lordships' House to these matters. The report was published on 23rd August and a Press notice was issued&#x2014;again, because we felt that the matter was of concern not merely to those directly interested in the construction industry in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, but also because it raised these wider matters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00333">This is one of the relatively few occasions when I may express gratitude to the other place, because they had in fact looked at these draft documents before we did. We decided that it would be a waste of the time and effort of all concerned if we took further evidence from certain bodies who had already communicated to the appropriate committee in the other place. We obtained consent to take cognisance of those documents, and to that extent therefore this is a joint effort of both Houses of Parliament. The committee in the other place had, I think, hoped to have
<col>16</col>
a debate but other matters intervened, and this was frustrated in the interests of the General Election.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00334">As I said, we should make it plain that this is not just a run-of-the-mill draft Directive. There are, in fact, two documents directly before us; namely, a proposal for a draft Directive and a further one for a resolution which deals with the list of priority products which should be included in this operation. These documents were issued on 4th December last year, since when there have been further documents proposing some slight amendments to both the Directive and the resolution, to which I may turn in a moment. I am hoping that my noble friend Lord Hinton will deal with what I might call the practicalities of these matters, because I think no one in your Lordships' House could claim to have greater experience of harmonisation and standardisation of products than my noble friend. But I shall leave him to speak for himself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00335">I hope to deal more particularly with the procedural matters which are of more general interest and require, if I may say so, rather less specialist and technical knowledge than I possess. When I mention that I should perhaps, just by way of illustration, produce one item of information for your Lordships' House. There are no fewer than 17 pages of printed matter on the rule for the assessment of punched metal plate timber fasteners and, if you apply comparable instructions for every product that you can think of in the construction industry, you will see that to deal with that adequately you need an expertise which few of us possess.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00336">Before I deal with the two principal documents in front of your Lordships, I think I should draw your attention to an extremely useful little periodical called <i>European File</i> which is issued by the Commission of the European Communities, the Directorate-General for Information. It is No. 12 in the current year's issue and it deals directly with the matter which is the substance of these proposals; namely, the removal of technical barriers to trade. It was issued in June of this year and was followed by two other booklets in the series which are also germane: No. 13, <i>The European Community and Consumers</i> and No. 14, <i>European Competition Policy.</i> For those of us who are not directly concerned with
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0017"/>
<col>17</col>
these matters but who like to keep ourselves as well informed as possible, these booklets are very useful.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00337">No. 12, <i>The Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade</i>&#x2014;which is what this exercise is all about&#x2014;gives a very persuasive background, urging that this is a desirable exercise. It starts by suggesting that standardisation will help large-scale production, which ultimately, therefore, by economies of scale, should help the consumer. It is also necessary within the Community to protect consumers' health and to promote users' safety, and it continues:
<quote>"These norms should theoretically help to expand trade, but this is not always the case".</quote>
It points out, further, that each country sets its own norms but that rarely are these different national norms compatible with each other; and the creation of national norms sometimes has the undeclared objective of protecting national manufacturers, which can be very tempting in periods of economic crisis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00338">It gives various examples, one of which interested me as a housewife. Swiss producers have adopted standardised and completely original dimensions for their kitchen units and the structures into which they are to be fitted. The Swiss housewife can thereby not use kitchen units produced abroad alongside those manufactured in her own country. We can think of many situations in which similar practices might well prove very tempting indeed. It then points out that as early as 1969 the Community began this attempt to harmonise the norms in force in Member countries, with the objective of eliminating the technical barriers which restrict trade. There are a number of other non-tariff barriers to trade, but I think that we all agree that technical barriers are indeed among the most important.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00339">If one were successful in this mammoth task of harmonising these various products which may be subject to trade between the members of the Community, then one would have an Economic Community of some 260 million consumers, and that might indeed be regarded as one of the main objectives of the Community. However, it is made very clear that this is bound to be an extremely slow process. Our booklet says that the elimination of technical barriers is a long-term project.
<col>18</col>
It indicates that in the 10 years which have elapsed there have been no more than about 130 harmonisation exercises which are now actually operative&#x2014;a not very rapid rate of progress&#x2014;and it considers that there should be a minimum objective of 300 harmonisation Directives in the industrial field. They give no justification whatsoever for this particular number but simply seem to assume that that is about the limit of what is practicable, given the staff at their disposal in Brussels. They point out that no sooner have you settled one harmonisation exercise than another one comes up on the horizon. New barriers are, of course, being created every day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00340">As at the time of writing this descriptive booklet they had only, I think, 30 persons engaged on this exercise&#x2014;who also had to keep up with updating earlier harmonisation proposals&#x2014;the speed with which one can do anything is bound to be extremely slow. As they rightly say, it only needs one national civil servant to lay down a technical norm incompatible with those in other countries to create a technical barrier to trade. So the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00341">It was because of the slow progress that was being made that the nominated European Parliament which was dissolved in the summer made some very vehement protests at the snail's pace at which this desirable procedure was being conducted and made it very clear that in their view a different procedure really must be adopted. The proposals which are before us this afternoon are partly, at any rate, the fruit of those protests at the slow pace at which these matters were being dealt with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00342">It is very easily understandable why our colleagues in Brussels have made the proposals that we are considering this afternoon. Originally, one would have had to use the procedure of Article 100 of the Treaty whereby these matters would go to the appropriate Council of Ministers who would have to decide, on a unanimity basis, as to whether or not the proposals were acceptable. It is quite plain from what I have already indicated that you cannot expect Councils of Ministers to go into the sort of details which have to be considered in draft Directives of this kind. Therefore the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0018"/>
<col>19</col>
proposal now before us is that implementing committees should be established which would have representatives of all the Member States but which would proceed, not by a unanimity rule but by a qualified majority. This would be under Article 155.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00343">It is this proposal which has caused such considerable heart-searching among the members of our own Select Committee on the European Communities. It would alter very considerably the weight of authority in the Community and would have, in our view, certain extremely important practical disadvantages. At the present time, if we have the kind of draft Directive to which we are accustomed it is published in full text and can be, and is, commented on, and in our case is reported, if required, to your Lordships' House. And consultations can take place openly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00344">What we are very much concerned about with this new proposal is that we have no guarantee at all that the full details will be published, that the consultations will be open and that it will be possible, if necessary, to report more information to the parliamentary institutions in the Member States. So we are very much concerned both about the principle and to a somewhat lesser degree as to whether in fact this test case has been brought forward in an appropriate field; namely, the field of construction products.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00345">I should perhaps say that, in the consultations which we have had with the interested parties in the United Kingdom, differing views have been expressed as to whether this is in fact an appropriate area in which to conduct this new and to some extent experimental procedure. The National Council of Building Materials Producers are quite blunt about it. They wrote to us as follows:
<quote>"We find it very difficult to understand the need for this directive when work is currently and satisfactorily proceeding towards the harmonisation of standards for a very wide variety of products".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00346">On the other hand, only this morning I received correspondence from the British representative on the European Union of Agr&#x00E9;ment, which deals with innovatory products&#x2014;new products which have not been fully accepted by the standards institutions in the various countries but
<col>20</col>
which are nevertheless passed as being suitable for use or operation. They point out that the building materials producers in this country are among the more conservative element in the building trades, whereas their members are the active exporters, and they suggest that their members might perhaps see greater advantages in the proposed harmonisation than our building materials producers seem to find evident.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00347">The chairman of the European Union of Agr&#x00E9;ment says:
<quote>"There might be opposition to the EEC framework directive from the traditional sector who have no interest in export but who expect that the imposition of international standards might in some instances allow the use of materials in the United Kingdom of a lower quality than before".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00348">The letter proceeds:
<quote>"It is difficult to say to what extent exports might increase if barriers in Europe were removed. The Agr&#x00E9;ment Board knows of a number of cases where the time and cost of obtaining approval in Germany or France has made manufacturers decide to forego export to those countries.</quote>
I am in no position to judge as between these two organisations, or others who have expressed opinions, but it is clear that there are some differences of view and not unnaturally they vary largely according to whether one is or is not directly engaged in the export business.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00349">To revert to the major matter of procedure, I should perhaps have pointed out, as we do in our report, that whether or not one is directly engaged in the export business the construction industry is a major component of our industrial scene, with some 14,000 firms employing nearly half a million people and with a turnover of over &#x00A3;6,500 million a year. So it is an area where what happens in the EEC context is of some considerable consequence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00350">I do not wish to go into too much detail on the procedural proposals that are before us because I think they are set out with great lucidity in the 16th Report which we are considering and I should be most interested to hear the views of other Members of your Lordships' House on the matters which are worrying us. I should perhaps make clear that in the procedure which is now proposed the aim might be total harmonisation which would be obligatory for all the products covered in all the Member States. Or there could be optional harmonisation; this would
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0019"/>
<col>21</col>
mean that the Member States could not object to the import of products from other Member States which comply with the implementing Directives, but they could nevertheless permit the use of other products or plant which did not comply with the European standards but which were permitted under the national standards. If the proposal for the construction industries were for total harmonisation, then frankly I think we should be in serious difficulty, but fortunately the attitude of the Commission, so far at least, is that total harmonisation should normally be reserved for matters where either health or safety are at risk and that for industrial products of a more general nature the optional rule should prevail.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00351">What we are really most concerned about is that we are apprehensive that rules may be accepted without adequate publicity and with no right of appeal. That is really the gravamen of the situation so far as we can understand it. It is true that in the amendments issued last month to the proposals before us it is suggested that the implementing committee should issue an annual report of what it has done, but of course that is <i>ex post facto</i> and is not going to help very much, apart from just having it on the record. It was also suggested that the committee should indicate the areas in which it is likely to proceed with harmonisation during the next two years, but there is no indication&#x2014;still less any guarantee&#x2014;that this will be more than a general indication of an area or a group of products in which it will be operating. That is a very different thing from publishing and having completely open to view to all concerned the precise proposals which are intended. If you are in the trade or business what you need are not general indications but the precise details of what it is you are going to be obliged to comply with. We feel that this is the very least one should insist upon if any matter is to be considered by this implementing committee, which is either able to make this decision itself on a qualified majority vote or is able, if it prefers, to send it up to the Council of Ministers and, if the Council of Ministers does nothing about it for a period of three months, the proposal becomes operative notwithstanding.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00352">So we feel that absolutely maximum publicity is essential. We do not think it
<col>22</col>
is sufficient to say that there will be consultation with experts or with interested parties, because there is no guarantee as to who is going to be consulted. If it is carried on behind closed doors we think it will be a grossly unsatisfactory way of conducting the matter and we believe in any case that, at least until we have had greater experience of this type of procedure, even if the matter is delegated to an implementing committee&#x2014;which would indeed save a great deal of time at the ministerial level&#x2014;we should adopt the unanimity rule and not the qualified majority rule, if only until we see how this kind of operation works and how satisfactory it is. So we make this point plain in our report, that if there were a total harmonisation&#x2014;which we are not dealing with in this particular report&#x2014;it should go to the Council under Article 100 as it does now. If it is optional we can see the point of having a committee of implementation, but it should publish its precise proposals at the outset and it should adopt the unanimity rule. We suggest that there should be a review of the procedure, we say possibly after five years, to see how we are getting on. It might then be that we would have such confidence in the way things were being conducted in Brussels that we could agree to a qualified majority rule, but at the present time we think that that is premature.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00353">My Lords, I hope I have indicated the reasons why we have apprehensions about this particular procedure. We see the possible advantages in certain areas. I would not myself wish to go into the second document this afternoon, which gives the proposed list of priority products to be dealt with, beyond saying that again there are strong differences of view as to whether or not those particular products are the right ones to start with; but I would regard that as being too technical to be appropriate for discussion. I hope that your Lordships will agree, from what I have very briefly indicated to be the main problems in this area, that the committee was justified in bringing it to your attention. I beg to move.</p>

<col>23</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00355">3.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00356"><member>Lord HINTON of BANKSIDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady White, has indicated, there was some debate in your sub-committee as to whether the procedure which is proposed in this Directive was entirely appropriate. I do not propose to deal with that question, but rather to leave it to those Members of this House who are better qualified to talk about it than I am. My intention is to confine myself to the purely practical problems of standardisation. It so happens that I have been more than normally exposed to those problems during my career.<lb/>
Although the British Standards Institution was formed in the late 1920s, the first real attempt at firm standardisation was made by Imperial Chemical Industries in the early years of the 1930s. At that time I was chief engineer of their alkali division and I was given the additional task of doing standardisation for the whole of ICI. That work was done by a committee which was made up of representatives from all of their divisions. It was a herculean job. It took several years, and it was not merely outstandingly successful but also was taken as a model by many other firms who wished to have true standardisation in their organisation.<lb/>
At the outbreak of war I was seconded to the Ministry of Supply and there I was in charge of the Royal Filling Factories and carried through a standardisation scheme for all the small tools and the many thousands of fillers' components that are used in the final assembly of explosives stores. After that I moved to atomic energy where I standardised all of the general stores and engineering materials for their industrial establishments. From there I moved on to the Central Electricity Generating Board where I did a similar job. So I have seen something of standardisation in my time.<lb/>
It is, I think, almost axiomatic that if you have one supplier and one purchaser standardisation is easy. If you have two suppliers and two purchasers, it becomes quite extraordinarily more difficult, and the difficulty of standardisation increases pretty well exponentially as the number of suppliers and number of purchasers increases. But not only does the difficulty of standardisation increase with the increase of numbers of suppliers and
<col>24</col>
purchasers who are concerned, the quality of the standards specifications also tends to fall. There is a very good and simple reason for that. All standardisation is a compromise between the views of a number of manufacturers and a number of buyers, and the more manufacturers and the more buyers you have concerned the more compromises you have to make and the more flabby your standard specification becomes.<lb/>
Your sub-committee was told in evidence that there are in the United Kingdom some 14,000 firms producing materials for the building trades, and the number of purchasers for those trades must be even greater. The difficulty of standardising with such a large number of manufacturers and such a large number of purchasers is, I think, obvious. It is true that there is some rudimentary standardisation in the building regulations, although it is interesting to note that they are not standardised for the whole country in that the London building regulations are different from those in the Provinces. But that standardisation under building regulations aims only to ensure the stability, the safety, the sanitation and the fireproofness of the building and does not attempt to go further than that. If I can give a simple example of how far it falls short of true standardisation; my own house, which was built within the last 20 years under LCC building regulations, has got, I can easily count, six different doors in it and not merely do those doors differ in method of construction but they differ also in outside dimensions.<lb/>
Your committee was told that the British Standards Institution have got a staff of 23 working on standardisation of construction materials, and in addition to that technical staff of 23 there is a supporting staff of about 40. But what matters most is that that staff merely supports and services the committees which do the actual standardisation, and the number of members of those committees which are considering standardisation within the construction industries is something between 2,000 and 3,000 men. If a working force of 2,000 to 3,000 people fails to do full standardisation of building construction materials for a small country like ours, the imagination almost boggles when one tries to think of the size of the organisation which would
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0021"/>
<col>25</col>
be needed to do similar standardisation for all the nine countries of the EEC. There are, it is true, national standardisation organisations in most if not in all of the Member countries of the EEC, and the work of those national standardisation organisations is co-ordinated by a body which is known as the <i>Comit&#x00E9; Europ&#x00E9;en de Normalisation,</i> CEN for short. Standardisation over a still greater number of countries is carried out by the International Standards Organisation (ISO). In addition there is, as the noble Baroness mentioned, a body called Agr&#x00E9;ment, but its decisions have far less force and are far less useful than the decisions of the two standardising organisations.<lb/>
I am told that the standards which are produced by both CEN and ISO are less precise than those produced by the British Standards Institution. That is naturally the case because they have more bodies with whom they have to reach compromises and therefore decisions become more difficult to reach and more flabby when they are reached. Both CEN and ISO are producing results less quickly than is desired by the EEC and it is for that reason that the proposals contained in the Directive are put forward. I think that none of us would dispute the desirability of obtaining normalisation between the components concerned as quickly as possible.<lb/>
On first reading, the Directive appeared to imply that the EEC desired to set up its own co-ordinating organisation, thus duplicating the work which is being done by CEN and ISO. If such a new organisation was initially in the minds of the Commission, I understand that that is no longer its intention and that its present proposal is to expedite the production of international standards by encouraging and helping collaboration with CEN and ISO, rather than by setting, up its own new organisation. I understand that fruitful discussions between the EEC, CEN and ISO are going on and I suggest that they should be allowed to take their course, with some encouragement. But in no case would I feel that it was wise for the EEC to build up a staff of its own to expedite the standardisation of construction materials and components for the whole Community.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EXCHANGE CONTROL: <lb/>REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00357">3.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00358"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, TREASURY (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Statement reads as follows: <lb/>
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a Statement about exchange control.<lb/>
"In my Budget Statement on 12th June I announced our intention progressively to dismantle these controls. I made a number of relaxations at that time; and again on 18th July, when I informed the House of the first major move towards liberalising outward portfolio investment.<lb/>
"I have now decided to remove all the remaining exchange control restrictions from midnight tonight, apart from those still needed, I hope not for long, in relation to Rhodesia.<lb/>
"With that single exception, there will from tomorrow be full freedom to buy, retain and use foreign currency for travel, gifts and loans to non-residents, buying property overseas and investment in all foreign currency securities. Portfolio investment will be wholly freed; and the requirement to deposit foreign currency securities with an Authorised Depositary is abolished. Foreign currency accounts can be held here or abroad. Passport marking for travel funds can now be abolished. The necessary Treasury orders are being laid this afternoon.<lb/>
"The removal of controls will lead to public expenditure savings of about &#x00A3;14&#x00B7;5 million a year, which represents the current cost of about 750 staff at present employed on exchange control work at the Bank of England and about 25 at the Treasury. I would like to thank all those who have had the task of administering the controls&#x2014;not only in the Treasury, the Bank of England and Customs and Excise, but also those in the private sector, whose co-operation has enabled the system to work.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0022"/>
<col>27</col>
"Under arrangements announced in this House in 1971, exchange control has been used to prevent United Kingdom tax incentives supporting the leasing abroad of foreign equipment. I propose to introduce in the 1980 Finance Bill provisions, which will take effect from tomorrow, to continue to prevent this. Further details on this matter are available in the Vote Office."<lb/>
Perhaps I might add in parenthesis that they are available in the Printed Paper Office as well. The Statement continues: <lb/>
"From tomorrow, we shall be meeting in full our Community obligations on the freedom of capital movements.<lb/>
"Exchange controls have been with us in one form or another for just over 40 years. They have now outlived their usefulness. The essential condition for maintaining confidence in our currency is a Government determined to maintain the right monetary and fiscal policies. This we shall do."<lb/>
That is the end of the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00359"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, for repeating the Statement. I personally am grateful for the short notice which I had of the Statement, and for the provision of a copy of it. Detailed comment examining all its economic, political and social implications will probably have to be made on a later occasion.<lb/>
I am astonished at the Government's sense of priorities in making a Statement of this nature. The Government have made their decision within the context of rising unemployment; the highest inflation rate in Europe; a shortage in industrial finance of some &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;38 billion, according to today's <i>Financial Times;</i> the <i>Financial Times</i> index going down by noon today a further 3&#x00B7;3 points to a new figure of 463&#x00B7;4; and a declining market for gilts. That is the context within which the Government Statement is made. No real reason is given for the steps being taken, apart from the somewhat derisory, although significant, amount of &#x00A3;14&#x00B7;5 million that will be saved on some 775 staff&#x2014;750 at the Bank of England and 25, we are given to understand, at the
<col>28</col>
Treasury. It works out on average, as your Lordships will note, at some &#x00A3;20,000 per annum each. The other reason given is, of course, that it brings us within the Community obligations. We are most grateful for the additional indication of the Government's fidelity to a Community spirit, especially at a time when some countries, particularly France, seem bent on avoiding every regulation that is put forward within the EEC. One comes to the final reason: the controls have outlived their usefulness. Time alone will show whether or not they have outlived their usefulness. Sometimes when a gesture of this kind is made and controls are freed, for the first two or three days it is perhaps interpreted in the outside world as meaning that the Government have supreme confidence, and even the rate of exchange might go up. It is when the outflow occurs that the trouble will begin.<lb/>
I want to ask the noble Lord some questions, which I hope he will be able to answer. What outflow of funds do the Government envisage as a result of this abolition of controls? What concept have they formed as to how much of the outflow will go into personal and other property investment abroad?&#x2014;particularly at a time when we are suffering from severe accommodation shortages in the United Kingdom. How much outflow will go into industries abroad, particularly in countries such as Korea and Brazil, which are setting up industries on the basis of being able to employ labour at one-eighth of the cost of labour in the United Kingdom, and of re-exporting products to the United Kingdom in competition with our own industries? How big a dagger is being thrust at the heart of some of Britain's industries? What impact does the noble Lord, or his right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, think this will have on the rate of inflation?<lb/>
It may well be that part of the intention&#x2014;one does not know because no reason is given&#x2014;is slightly to ease the position of sterling against the dollar and against other European currencies. If that is so, this of course will increase the cost of imports into the United Kingdom. One thing we can conclude from this extraordinary announcement is that it rules out the possibility of any decline in the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0023"/>
<col>29</col>
minimum lending rate for the next foreseeable period. I hope that noble Lords opposite and their supporters in another place will be busily telling that to small businesses in the United Kingdom. The result is that it will leave the United Kingdom highly vulnerable.<lb/>
This is not the abolition of one or two controls; this is the abolition of a whole system of controls that has been built up over 40 years for the protection of sterling. Are the Government so sure that over the next year, or perhaps even less, they will be in such firm circumstances that they will not need to exercise exchange control again? If they do find that necessary, will the noble Lord give some indication as to how they propose to proceed in those unfortunate circumstances?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00360"><member>Baroness SEEAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the Minister for the Statement that he has made this afternoon and I welcome it. We believe that controls have been excessive and that this is a very desirable step in the direction of free movement of capital which is long overdue and which honours our EEC commitments. However, I would ask the Minister what the anticipated effect will be on the exchange rate of sterling, and in what way, if any, the dollar premium will be affected by the introduction of this change.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00361">3.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00362"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, referred to this Statement as having been made against a background of rising unemployment, a high rate of inflation and pressures on company liquidity. This is, of course, the price that we are having to pay for five years of Labour Government and if, therefore, what my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced this afternoon represents a complete break from the policies which were followed by the previous Administration&#x2014;which led to the disastrous results which the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, has outlined&#x2014;I should have thought that that was the strongest possible argument in support of what we are now doing.<lb/>
These controls have long outlived their usefulness. They impose considerable burdens on industry and
<col>30</col>
on private individuals. There is no reason to suppose that they assist the national economy in any way. Our belief is that it is important that we should get growth back again into the national economy, and this represents an important and desirable step in that direction. The noble Lord specifically asked what outflow was expected as a result of the abolition of control. Very simply, the answer is that there will be flows across the exchanges in both directions; there will be flows in as well as flows out. At this stage nobody can say precisely what the net effect will be, but we do not expect it to he very great.<lb/>
We have proceeded in this matter with caution and responsibility. There were two earlier major relaxations which have brought no untoward effects, and we believe that the third one will be taken by the British economy with benefit. The noble Lord also asked what would be the effect on the rate of inflation. He did not seem to be able to make up his mind whether it was a good thing for the rate of exchange to go up or for it to go down. We do not think that in itself this measure will have a great effect on the rate of exchange, which depends upon much more important and fundamental factors, particularly the creation of a sense of confidence in British industry and in the British economy generally, which lies at the heart of our policy.<lb/>
I greatly appreciate what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, when she welcomed this move towards freedom. On this matter our views are much the same as those of the party which she represents. The noble Baroness asked specifically what the anticipated effect on the exchange rate would be. I can only say that this depends upon the size of the flows across the exchanges. There may be some immediate effect one way or the other&#x2014;we cannot say which way&#x2014;but we believe that in the long run the rate of exchange depends upon the strength of the British economy, and that is what we propose restoring.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00363"><member>Lord PLANT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has said that this will benefit the British economy. As the action which the Government propose will stifle investment in Britain, will he please explain that statement?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0024"/>
<col>31</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00364"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no reason whatever to suppose that this measure will stifle investment in the British economy. Investment in the British economy depends as much as anything on the prospects for the British economy, and particularly the prospects for profits. We are doing everything we can to restore confidence in the British economy. All the evidence of the past is that direct investment overseas by British companies, and, indeed, by British individuals, has tended in the long run to benefit the British economy by creating greater export opportunities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00365"><member>Lord HANKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister reply to the interesting point raised by my noble friend Lady Seear as to whether this will affect the investment premium? Will that continue?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00366"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for not having answered that point. I was endeavouring to make a large number of notes, and unfortunately I did not reply to it. The investment dollar premium market is a private market for which the Government have no responsibility at all. It is difficult to believe that in the absence of exchange control such a market will continue.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ECC 16th REPORT: LAWS ON CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00367">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00368">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00369"><member>The PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CHAIRMAN of COMMITTEES (Lord Greenwood of Rossendale)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, if I may, in taking the House back to the report of the Select Committee, to thank my noble friend Lady White for the clear way in which she explained to your Lordships the contents of the report of the Select Committee, and also to say how much we look forward to hearing Lord Bellwin's reactions to the points which have been made in our short debate.<lb/>
When the Directive and the Resolution swam into my ken earlier this year I expected that I should be able to spend a number of happy hours studying the very real problems of an industry in which for some time I have played some
<col>32</col>
part. But as I got down to the Resolution and the Directive I realised that the significance of the report and the significance of the suggestions of the Commission were much more important than those which applied simply to the building industry, grave as those problems are. Today we are, therefore, touching on subjects of much greater importance.<lb/>
It seems to me that unless a firm stand is taken by Her Majesty's Government this could be starting, as it were, a seeping process eroding the powers of the Council, and perhaps through that eroding the powers of the national Parliaments. I believe myself that the Council is of the very greatest importance because it is through the Council that the national Parliaments can make their views felt. If we start going behind the backs of the national Parliaments, then of course we are going to destroy the faith a lot of us have been trying to build up in the concept of a democratic European constitution.<lb/>
Yesterday, in order to clear my mind on this problem, I tried to analyse what exactly is involved in the proposals that have come to us from Brussels. I think I can best put it like this: if the present proposal was adopted without amendment a series of Directives laying down common EEC standards for construction products could be adopted by a qualified majority vote without reference to the Council of Ministers, where our national ministerial representatives have a right of veto under the Luxembourg Convention.<lb/>
The Directive would set up a special committee consisting of representatives of Member States to which draft implementing Directives could be referred. This was the committee to which my noble friend referred in her speech. Votes of the Member States would be weighted, and 41 votes out of 58 would be sufficient for a proposal to be adopted. Proposals not adopted by the committee will be referred to the Council of Ministers, which would also act by a qualified majority. If the Council did not act within three months, draft Directives would automatically be adopted. This procedure would not only eliminate the Member States' right of veto under Article 100, which we have discussed on other occasions, but also result in there being no publication of the Directives concerned while they were still in draft.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0025"/>
<col>33</col>
It is not surprising, if one accepts that analysis as a fair one&#x2014;and that is what I have tried to make it&#x2014;to find the Consumers' Association, in their excellent document of 2nd March, ending:
<quote>"In view of the great issues of principle and the serious flaws in detail, the whole Directive should go back to the drawing board".</quote>
The Select Committee went very thoroughly into that possibility. I think if anything we may have tried too hard to make helpful suggestions which would facilitate the reaching of some agreement. But certainly the proposals in the report&#x2014;and my noble friend Lady White deserves most of the credit for those proposals&#x2014;are genuinely intended to make things a great deal easier for the Community.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will be prepared to look at the matter with as critical eyes as we had in looking at it on the Select Committee, but will also be quite adamant in insisting that none of the rights of this Parliament, or this country, shall be in any way eroded. So, therefore, I endorse very much the speech which my noble friend made, and also the views of the Consumers' Association. I hope very much indeed that Her Majesty's Government, and their representatives, will take very seriously indeed a case which can be a precedent of the greatest importance, and I hope we shall not be allowed to drift into a situation wherein the rights of this House and another place can be impaired.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00370">4.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00371"><member>Lord THOMSON of MONIFIETH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join in the thanks to my noble friend Lady White and to the Select Committee for the work that they have done on this particular Directive. I think that Parliament, the nation, and indeed the European Community ought to feel grateful for the vigilance with which they detected the important issue of principle and pursued the issue of principle beneath what, on the surface, is an extremely technical and complex Directive.<lb/>
Perhaps I might preface my remarks by a general comment. What worries me about this Directive is that is shows a tendency on the part of the European Commission towards an excessive degree of zeal for an excessive degree of harmonisation in terms of daily life within the European Community. As your Lord
<col>34</col>
ships know, I myself feel strongly about the importance of the European Community in world affairs, and the importance of British membership within the Community. But I think that the European Community ought to be principally about a limited number of big issues: of deploying the united economic power of the European Community in the great negotiations which go on in terms of world economic affairs; of creating a customs union; of using the influence and resources of the European Community in new forms of partnership with the Third World; of promoting an increased degree of monetary co-operation. These are things that the European Community ought to be about.<lb/>
There is a danger of the European Community&#x2014;and perhaps particularly of the European Commission within the Community&#x2014;these days being tempted to get too bogged down in the details of everyday life, details that are best left to national Administrations. I do not think that the European Community, about which I remain enthusiastic and indeed passionate, ought to spend too much of its time and resources on the approximation of laws with regard to the components for waste evacuation installations. The report mentions the recent draft Directive on lawnmower noise, to which the Select Committee has given some attention. I used to be the Commissioner for Regional Affairs in the European Community and I saw a good deal of the Community from one end to another. I would rather see the Community engaging its activities on things other than lawnmower noise.<lb/>
I noticed in Greenland, when I was there, that no igloo was complete without its motor lawnmower! In Sicily the problem was far more to get enough water to make the grass grow than to cut it. I am told by my old colleagues, that the wits around the European Commission&#x2014;I do not know whether it is true or not&#x2014;say that in its original form the draft Directive on lawnmower noise sought to lay down an approximation of the hours when we should all use our motor lawnmowers, and that this arose because some earnest Commission official was much disturbed early on a Sunday morning by his neighbour's habits with his motor lawnmower! More seriously, repeat that I think there is a danger of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0026"/>
<col>35</col>
the Commission getting too much into the details of daily life. I was much reassured by what the President of the Commission, Roy Jenkins, told the British CBI the other day. He said that he was seeking to get the Commission away from any sort of notion that if it moves, harmonise it.<lb/>
I am conscious in making these general remarks that of course there is a problem about the interaction of the great issues on the less great issues, and the problem in this particular case, to which my noble friend Lady White drew attention in her characteristically reasoned manner, is that if you seek, as I would, a customs union, you cannot have a true customs union if there are various non-tariff barriers to trade, including technical non-tariff barriers to trade. Therefore, in my view there is a strong case for removing non-tariff barriers to trade. However, one should be prudent and thoughtful about the best tactics in approaching this. I recognise perhaps more than most in this House the frustrations of Commission officials with endless delays in the Council of Ministers and elsewhere in regard to their various ideas, but I do not think the way proposed in this Directive is the best way to overcome those frustrations, and I would lay down three guidelines.<lb/>
First, I believe there is an obligation on the Commission in regard to any Directive removing non-tariff barriers to trade to prove the need to remove them&#x2014;to provide the evidence and show that there is a strong case. I notice in the evidence given to your Lordships' Select Committee that grave doubt was cast as to whether that need had been proven, and indeed the Consumers' Association said in terms that no evidence had been produced as to the extent of the present restrictions.<lb/>
I must declare a certain interest, in that I am chairman of a body called the Advertising Standards Authority, which is much involved in the draft Directive on Misleading and Unfair Advertising on which your Lordships' House has produced an excellent Select Committee report and a debate. In regard to that draft Directive, over many years it has been asserted by the Commission that the justification for the Directive was that differing laws and arrangements in regard to the control of advertising standards was

a distortion of competition. But I think I am right in saying that over all these years that has remained an assertion which has never been backed up by evidence. It is in my view very necessary that if a case for harmonisation is to be made, it should be thoroughly backed up by evidence.<lb/>
Secondly, when a case is found to be made, there is the choice between optional harmonisation and total harmonisation. As often as possible the Commission should go for optional harmonisation; that is, for enabling those undertakings which wish to be in the field of the total Community market to adopt the regulations, and for those who wish to remain idiosyncratically within their own national market to do so. The noble Baroness conceded that the Commission had said it was its desire to do that, and that is certainly the general thrust of Commission policy. Nevertheless, with regard to this particular Directive, although the Commission says in its paper that as a general rule the Commission is in favour of resorting to the optional method of harmonisation in the implementing of Directives, this general rule of course does not exclude the possibility of using the total harmonisation method should this prove to be essential in the case of certain specific problems or in regard to the use of certain products.<lb/>
Therefore, what we face in connection with the present proposed Directive is that there could be propositions for total harmonisation that would go through the Commission procedure proposed without any reference to the Council of Ministers. Accordingly, my third piece of advice to my former colleagues in the European Commission is that they really should not seek to deal with their frustrations over delays in the Council of Ministers by in effect short-circuiting the Council of Ministers. I thought the Consumers' Association evidence on this was very pungent and to the point. They said in their evidence to your Lordships' Select Committee:
<quote>"We think the European Community is on a most dangerous road. We understand the desire to remove barriers to trade, but this must not be done by giving the bureaucracy the right to impose statutory requirements."</quote>
I strongly endorse that, and I endorse it out of my own experience of four years as a member of the European Com-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0027"/>
<col>37</col>
mission. I believe the European Commission is an essential institution of the Community. In my view, unless there was a purely European body to take the kind of initiatives that the Commission has taken on European monetary reform recently, the Community would move much more sluggishly than it does.<lb/>
I also not only believe, but know, that the Commission enjoys the loyalties of a very devoted group of public servants with a high degree of expertise. But I say seriously&#x2014;and I was conscious of this in the days when I was in Brussels&#x2014;that the Commission must always be very cautious about its degree of democratic legitimacy within the European Community. Commissioners are appointed for four years and are sacrosanct during that term. The officials of the Commission are quite properly there in permanent post. They have no mandate arising from an election in the way national Governments and Parliaments have, and therefore they should be very cautious about the degree to which they seek to cut out the democratic processes.<lb/>
Apart from that, it must be faced that the European Commission is not the best organised body in the world; it is in fact a rather small, though devoted, body of people. The noble Lord, Lord Hinton of Bankside, produced impressive figures about the numbers of people involved in seeking standardisation in building and construction in this country; they amount to almost the total number of officials engaged in the work of the European Commission as a whole, outside the translating and interpreting field. It is recognised that the internal structure of the Commission could do with improvement. In fact, the present Commission set up an independent review body for this purpose which has just reported, and some of your Lordships may have seen the report. It confirms what has long been my view of one of the Commission's weaknesses; namely, that it is excessively vertical in its organisation. They said in the report:
<quote>"The lack of adequate co-ordination among members of the Commission and a certain lack of encouragement from them for central coordination and planning among senior officials is particularly evident. The result has been a lack of structural co-ordination amongst Directors-General and a growing emphasis on the roles of the personal staffs of the Commission."</quote>
That independent review committee went on to emphasise the need for:
<col>38</col>
<quote>"strong co-ordination procedures and proper machinery for arbitrating between the claims of competing sectors &#x2026; Co-ordination within the Commission itself is at present insufficient. It cannot be replaced by co-ordination at administrative level, which is then too often informality and takes place at too late a stage in the decision-making process".</quote>
My experience was that an official in the Commission is able to advance a particular proposal, often in a highly complex and technical field, to a degree of development that would be quite impossible for an official in our national Administration, who would have to consult other departments with an interest in the matter. Then, when the decision finally surfaces, it goes through via a written procedure which means that the members of the Commission who carry the ultimate responsibility very rarely have any opportunity to see or express a view on the merits of those proposals.<lb/>
It is for these reasons I believe from my experience inside the Commission that the proposals in this particular Directive for decisions being taken by a qualified majority within the Commission, with the Commission in the chair and without any previous publication of the papers, is, as the Consumers' Association said, a thoroughly dangerous proposal. I therefore very much endorse the proposals put by the Select Committee of your Lordships' House in its paragraph 33; that is a reasonable compromise and an effort to be helpful in these matters. It is that where there are proposals for total harmonisation they should certainly go to the Council of Ministers under Article 100; that where there is a proposal for optional harmonisation there should be within the Commisssion procedure an adequate period&#x2014;your Lordships' Committee proposes three months&#x2014;during which the proposals should be given adequate publicity; and that, finally, any decision on these proposals within the committee that the Commission chairs should in fact be taken on a unanimity basis. I believe that these are sensible and democratic proposals.<lb/>
My Lords, I conclude by going back to my initial general remarks. I believe that once again your Lordships' Select Committee has made robust, but realistic, proposals about how best to react to suggestions coming out of the European Commission. I hope that the report that we have before us will be accepted
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0028"/>
<col>39</col>
by Her Majesty's Government. I hope, equally importantly, that it will be accepted by the European Commission in the spirit in which I know it is offered. I hope that, as the Community develops, the European Commission will be highly selective in the proposals that it puts forward for harmonisation. In particular, I hope that in the field of consumer protection, for example, it will recognise&#x2014;perhaps this is true equally of harmonisation of building regulations and such matters&#x2014;that it has a very important role to play in terms of exchange of information about the best practice in the various member countries of the community; but it should be very cautious about seeking to impose a uniformity on the practices in the various member countries. Finally, I hope that, liberated from some of the less important issues, the Commission and the European Community will be able to concentrate and to make really great progress on the great issues on which so much depends in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00373"><member>The Earl of SHANNON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as previous speakers have mentioned, I know that the whole House agrees with the valuable work of our European Communities Committee and its sub-committees. Sub-Committee G has rightly drawn the attention of your Lordships to the proposal we are now considering for a variety of reasons, some of which appear to be of great constitutional importance, but for my part I wish to make only a very brief intervention, on one particular aspect of the proposal, which I see was, quite rightly, noticed and questioned during the proceedings of the sub-committee by the noble Lord, Lord Ironside. I refer of course to the proposed criteria in Annex VI covering requirements for bodies who carry out independent testing in the absence of the self-certification procedure.<lb/>
For your Lordships' convenience I should like to paraphrase Annex VI. Clause 1 basically requires the body to be competent. Clause 2 then seeks to debar almost all those bodies who have special competence in this field. I agree that there is a small mollifying sentence on exchange of technical information, but this does not really much affect the disqualifying power
<col>40</col>
of the clause. I appreciate that various amendments have been suggested to make the clause more workable, especially that, I believe, put forward by the European Parliament, but this still leaves the clause with what could be serious deficiencies, especially in regard to definition.<lb/>
It would be most desirable to remove Clause 2 altogether, but that would of course raise the objection that the testing body must be seen to be impartial, and this is highly laudable from a consumer point of view. But the real difficulty of Clause 2 lies in two words, "design" and "maintenance". Any laboratory which has in any way ever contributed by research or development to the sum of total knowledge in this field can be disallowed as having taken part, however indirectly, in the forbidden activities. Above all, in view of the European Parliament's suggested amendment, where does technical advice and consultation stop?<lb/>
Those very bodies whose work has enabled them to be eminently qualified under Clause I are therefore automatically excluded under Clause 2. This, strictly interpreted, excludes contract research laboratories, research associations, and even universities, if they have ever made a contribution in this field by contract work, co-operative work, or, I suggest, even a thesis, especially if the author is now on the university staff.<lb/>
This particular subject received considerable attention at the meeting last week in Brussels of the Federation of European Industrial Co-operative Research Organisations, of which I am the Secretary. That organisation strongly supported the amendment which was proposed in this country by the National Council of Building Material Producers, which would allow the traditionally accepted research bodies in this field to be accredited, although one understands that they would prefer to see deleted the words, "design", and "maintenance", as well. I confirm that the Council of the European Federation would also like to see those words deleted. We must be careful that this proposal receives careful attention and consideration for many reasons in addition to that to which I have particularly referred, because once enacted it can, and in all probability will, be used as a pattern for future harmonisation proposals in many other industries.<lb/>

The European Community looks to new technology to maintain its economy in the face of the pressure from the developing world. Those institutes, research organisations, and seats of learning who contribute to new designs and maintain products&#x2014;not only keeping them working but maintaining them technologically in advance so that they can secure a market&#x2014;are already in many cases the accepted bodies to test impartially often with tests which they themselves have invented. We must not allow this apparently small clause to be accepted as it stands, however well-intentioned it appears to be at first glance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00375"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, DEPARTMENT of the ENVIRONMENT (Lord Bellwin)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the points raised by noble Lords in this debate. I should also like to congratulate the Select Committee on producing such a clear and&#x2014;if I dare say it&#x2014;such a constructive report. I am sure that the Select Committee has made a most important contribution to the debate on a most difficult subject. We could not have had a better illustration of the value and importance of the parliamentary scrutiny process, which is highly relevant to this particular Directive. I can assure the House, without hesitation, that both the report and the debate have been an invaluable guide to the Government in dealing with the Directive. I am sure that the debate to be arranged in another place shortly will be equally instructive.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness, Lady White, said, construction plays a major part in the economies of each of the Member States of the Community. The scope of the draft Directive covers an extremely wide range of products. It therefore has, potentially, widespread implications for United Kingdom trade and industry. Moreover, if the procedure proposed for implementing Directives were agreed, it would undoubtedly be repeated in framework Directives for other industries. The implications of the draft Directive in its current form therefore go much wider than the construction industry alone and, as noble Lords have said, we must examine it with particular care.<lb/>
The Select Committee and the industry have questioned the need for the Directive.
<col>42</col>
In its report last year on Directives under Article 100 (of which this is one), the Select Committee said:
<quote>"The Commission should when preparing a draft proposal demonstrate that divergences between national laws are affecting the functioning of the Market, and affecting it directly and to a substantial degree.".</quote>
I am sure that that is right. In this report the committee say&#x2014;and again I quote&#x2014;that they,
<quote>"agree with the Economic and Social Committee that the existence of major barriers should be established before implementing directives are brought forward".</quote>
The report goes on to say that the committee,
<quote>"are not satisfied that the need for the present proposal has been demonstrated".</quote>
This view has been strongly supported by United Kingdom industry and those noble Lords who have spoken today, and I think it is fair comment. The preamble to the draft Directive makes a series of assertions but quotes no examples. There is no quantification.<lb/>
The object of the Directive is the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade&#x2014;an object which I am sure the whole House would endorse. It is no good having a common market without tariffs if Government regulations still prevent, or at any rate inhibit, trade. The question is: How far does this in fact happen? The United Kingdom delegation pressed this question at the opening meeting of the Council Working Group on this Directive in Brussels last month. Several other delegations were also concerned. The Commission accepted that the present priority list in the draft resolution was open to negotiation; it was only a first assessment based on limited information. The list will be reviewed, and we are in touch with United Kingdom industry to ensure that we reflect its precise, up-to-date views in the discussions. There is no doubt that the present list is too long, and we must ensure that as far as possible it includes the items desirable for British industry.<lb/>
But, while we have reservations on the number of implementing Directives we may need, I am sure there will he some. For example, drafts on glass and fire-testing are already in an advanced stage of drafting. Others may be needed to deal with barriers between other Member States affecting products which the United Kingdom does not export. We must
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0030"/>
<col>43</col>
accept that. I do not think it is realistic, as some have suggested, to oppose the framework Directive itself as a matter of principle. It is no help to attack the EEC as a matter of course at every opportunity. We must work within the EEC machinery to achieve the results we want. That does not mean unquestioning acceptance of the procedures put forward under the present draft Directive, and I shall come to those shortly. Moreover, we shall certainly need to be convinced of the need for each implementing Directive as it comes forward; and I am sure the Select Committee have proposed the right approach.<lb/>
Noble Lords this afternoon and in committee&#x2014;and industry in our consultations&#x2014;have raised numerous points on the technical content of the Directive. For example, what criteria will govern the choice between optional and total harmonisation? I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, that harmonisation should normally be optional; but are the safeguards adequate, particularly in relation to self-certification and imports from third countries? Do the criteria for approval bodies fit United Kingdom circumstances&#x2014;for example, in relation to research associations?<lb/>
I cannot answer all these points today. We have already given notice in Brussels that we shall wish to raise these and other points in the detailed discussion of the draft, article by article, which will start in the Council Working Group on Thursday. I can assure the House that I will study the report of this debate very carefully and ensure that these points are taken into account by my officials in the negotiations.<lb/>
However, I should like to touch briefly on what the noble Lord, Lord Hinton of Bankside, has said about the problems of international standardisation. No one has more experience in this field than the noble Lord, and I do not for a moment wish to suggest that he is in any way exaggerating the difficulties which face the standards-making organisations in reaching agreement on precise standards. It is true, too, that nothing in the present proposals will solve that problem. But I think there will usually be a fair measure of agreement on the areas which ought to be covered in a standard&#x2014;for example, for
<col>44</col>
a door, its stability and its resistance to impact and fire; for glass, its strength and clarity&#x2014;and, as I said before, we can surely agree with the intention of ensuring that, once we have an agreed standard, it is applied to break down barriers to trade. That is what the proposal before us is all about.<lb/>
My Lords, it has its problems. The main comments in industry's representations in the Select Committee's report and in this debate have, of course&#x2014;and quite rightly&#x2014;concentrated on the procedure proposed by the Commission for the adoption of implementing Directives. The primary aim of the proposed procedure is greater speed, so that once the standards exist there is no unnecessary delay. The Community's programme of Article 100 Directives is well behind target. The noble Baroness has argued that that does not in itself matter, but, clearly, where there are barriers to trade we should remove them as quickly as possible. A second aim, I assume, is to reduce the load on Ministers.<lb/>
However, I am not at all sure that the cure is not worse than the disease. Indeed, would it even cure the disease? The Commission propose that responsibility should be delegated to a Committee of Implementing Directives, operating with a qualified majority vote. Ministers will be involved only if the Commission's proposal fails to receive 41 votes in favour out of 58, or if the committee fails to take a decision within the timetable determined by the Commission. In these cases Ministers will still be involved, and time may well not be gained. The procedure will also make little difference to implementing Directives which are unanimously supported: these should be processed quickly anyway, without placing an undue burden on Ministers. The procedure can therefore achieve the twin aims of speeding up and of reducing the load on Ministers only in those cases where there is a qualified majority but not unanimous support. Surely there will be few of these.<lb/>
This limited potential gain must be weighed against the various objections that the noble Baroness and noble Lords have mentioned today. A Member country could be required to accept products to a standard it regarded as undesirable, possibly to a lower standard
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0031"/>
<col>45</col>
than it applies at present. If the Directive required total harmonisation, this would become the only acceptable standard. This could have implications for health and safety. It could certainly affect our international trade and adversely affect United Kingdom industry by introducing competition from imports currently regarded as unacceptable. It is not clear how far the procedure will provide for proper consultation with the industry. The noble Baroness has stressed the vital importance of consultation in the widest sense, and I entirely agree. However, I was glad to hear that the Commission have recognised the need for this, and have put forward amendments to provide for it. We shall be looking at these very carefully to see how far they go towards what we would regard as acceptable.<lb/>
Finally, and most importantly, the procedure would remove ministerial and parliamentary control over what is essentially a legislative process. It is hard to see where or how parliamentary scrutiny could be fitted in; and the Council of Ministers would be removed from the picture if a proposal secured a qualified majority in the committee. We and several other Member States therefore expressed strong reservations on this proposal at the first meeting of the Council Working Party in Brussels last month. We are now waiting to see how the views of other Member States develop, and whether any alternative proposals emerge for speeding up the implementing procedures.<lb/>
The Select Committee have put forward their own alternative&#x2014;I hesitate to call it a compromise. I think they are right to distinguish between the two main features of what the Commission are proposing: unanimity and the principle of delegation to the Commission. These are two separate issues. I am sure your Lordships' House will agree that we must maintain the unanimity principle. Qualified majority voting has already been accepted in relation to adaptation of existing Directives to match technical progress. In such cases policy is not at stake, but to apply majority voting to the range of decisions involved here&#x2014;for example, whether there should be an implementing Directive on a particular product, whether harmonisation should be total or optional, the standard to be adopted, the nature of the approval procedure, and so on&#x2014;
<col>46</col>
would be quite another matter. These are matters of policy, not technicalities.<lb/>
There may, however, be scope for speeding up the procedure and reducing the load on Ministers while retaining the unanimity rule. The Select Committee suggest drawing the line between optional and total harmonisation and allowing only the former to proceed by the committee methods. But I am not sure this would be right. To remove the right of appeal to Ministers&#x2014;and perhaps also the scope for parliamentary scrutiny&#x2014;even in relation to optional Directives could create pressures which might make it difficult for the United Kingdom to resist developments which could have adverse effects on British industry or existing levels of safety, for example, by requiring us to accept products of a lower standard than we require at present.<lb/>
My Lords, I think we must therefore maintain our opposition to the procedure proposed by the Commission. We would, of course, be ready to consider any alternative proposals that might be put forward which would achieve the objective of greater speed in areas where the case for harmonisation was established but would not concede any of the vital points to which I have just referred. I am most grateful for the contribution made by the committee, by the noble Baroness and by noble Lords. It has been a most helpful debate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EEC 17th REPORT: AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT: POLLUTION</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00379">4.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00380"><member>Lord ASHBY</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the 17th Report of the European Communities Committee on draft Directives on the discharge of aldrin, dieldrin and endrin into the aquatic environment (6995/79) (H.L. 65). The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. Your Lordships may wonder why the Select Committee has brought this report for debate. It concerns two very technical Directives which have only a very local application to matters in Britain. Its purpose is to provide for the diminution of discharge of three notorious pesticides, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin, into water. This is a purpose which is entirely consistent with the policies of the Government; and, indeed, the agricultural uses of these pesticides have already been phased out. Deaths due to them, of birds, have diminished from as many as 23 in 1973 to none at all now, and in every way the purpose of these Directives discussed in the report is consistent with what Britain is already doing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00381">Indeed, my Lords, the Commission sees only two kinds of production of these dangerous pesticides which need legislation at all. One is the manufacture of them and the other is the use of them for moth-proofing woollen products. They are not manufactured in Britain so that that part of the Directives does not apply to us. But dieldrin is still used in one part of Yorkshire and, in a small scale, in some other parts of Britain for the moth-proofing of wool. For practical purposes, it is the discharge of dieldrin into one river, the River Calder, which would be affected by this Directive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00382">The Department of the Environment find the Directives acceptable to the
<col>48</col>
United Kingdom in principle. This is because a few years ago a very important principle was agreed by the Council of Ministers after a good deal of pressure from this country. The conflict arose because a Directive was published to cover all so-called blacklist substances which were to be discharged into water. The dispute arose not because anyone disagreed that those things should be controlled but because the Commission wanted the control to be by blanket standard emission standards from the sewers and discharge pipes of the factories. This the British thought to be&#x2014;since it was irrespective of the use to which the river was put and irrespective of the capacity of the river to disperse and dilute the waste materials&#x2014;a wasteful, expensive and inefficient way of having an environmental control policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00383">We pressed for an alternative, one which has long been used in Britain, namely, to set environmental quality objectives in the environment itself. That is done by setting standards for the water into which the wastes are discharged and gradually tightening those standards as science produces new techniques for doing so. It means that the standards used will differ from one stretch of water to another, whether it is being used for a trout stream or whether it is being used to empty the sewers of industrial cities; but the objectives are so set that they ensure there is no damage to human health or to the lives of creatures in the water.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00384">After some argument, in December 1975 the Council of Ministers agreed to this compromise. Member States now have the option to control pollution of these blacklist substances either by controlling emission standards or by setting environmental quality objectives This is what we wanted; and this is what we now have. But we have been waiting for the first specific instance of a control of a specific substance; and now it has come. This is one of the first of several Directives based on the 1975 decision. It is soon to be followed by another one on the control of the discharge of mercury into water. That is on its way. These are going to set a precedent for legislation for many years to come and, therefore, it is important to look at the small print of these Directives.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0033"/>
<col>49</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00385">There is a pair of them, although it was unnecessary to put them into a pair. One deals with emission standards and the other with environmental objectives. They offer a choice between emission limits and environmental quality objectives. So far so good. This is what we asked for. But is it a genuine choice? Your Select Committee does not believe that it is; and that is why this matter has been brought to your Lordships' House for debate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00386">If one is going to argue this, it is necessary to base it on the Commission's own definition of pollution. Although it is a clumsy one, I would ask your Lordships, for the purpose of the record, to allow me to read it. Its definition is the discharge of substances into water
<quote>"the results of which are such as to cause hazards to human health, harm to living resources and to aquatic ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of water".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00387">My Lords, what this amounts to is that things which cause hazard and harm are causing pollution&#x2014;and one must distinguish that from contamination, which is the presence of things in water which are not causing hazards or harm. This is the background. What do these Directives about dieldrin and other pesticides require from Member States? I discuss only the requirements of dieldrin from moth-proofing plants because that is the only process which is of any relevance to Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00388">The first Directive sets a limit value for the emission of dieldrin. It is 60 parts per billion (an American billion, a thousand million) in the waste water discharged into the river. Clearly, the Commission considers that this is going to be a little difficult because it allows factories time to build treatment plant. The limit is not to become binding until 1986, six years ahead. The second Directive offers the other option, the one we asked for: an environmental quality objective for the river into which the wastes are discharged. The level proposed for this&#x2014;and I apologise for these figures&#x2014;is 0&#x00B7;005 parts per billion. Unlike the first option, this level has to be reached in two years' time, which gives the impression that it is an easier option.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00389">These are the requirements which the Select Committee challenges because they make a nonsense of the options agreed
<col>50</col>
by the Council of Ministers after great pressure from the British Government in 1975. At the risk of being slightly tedious to your Lordships, I must try to explain why this level makes nonsense. First, the two options are mutually contradictory and inconsistent. Suppose we complied with the first Directive? Suppose we reduced emissions to 60 parts per billion in the Calder River? Would this result in an environmental quality objective of 0&#x00B7;005 parts per billion? It certainly would not. After doing a little arithmetic, which is fully within the capacity of the staff of the Commission, it has been found that it would need a flow of one hundred times that of the Calder at its minimum value in order to produce that degree of dilution; in fact many times the flow of the Thames at Teddington.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00390">So the two proposed standards simply do not match. This could either be a deliberate soft option for those Member States that want to choose an emission standard or it is a sign that the scientific basis for these figures is very suspect. That is not the only difficulty. The standard of 0&#x00B7;005 parts per billion is inconsistent with two other Directives which have already been published by the Commission and agreed by the Council on their own definition of pollution. For instance, the Commission has already agreed in principle that the level of dieldrin in water to be used for human consumption is to be not more than 0&#x00B7;1 part per billion&#x2014;that is, 20 times higher than the level proposed in this Directive&#x2014;so the limit has obviously not been set to make the water safe to drink.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00391">What about the fish? Three years ago the Commission published its own water standards for fish. In this Directive, which has now been adopted, pesticides are not included at all. However, it is possible to calculate what the safe level will be because it is known that for a coarse fish like the roach&#x2014;and we are talking about coarse river fishery in the Calder&#x2014;about two parts per billion is the beginning threshold value for damage, and the level of dieldrin in the Calder varies a good deal; but it is in the region of 0&#x00B7;1 part per billion, that is one-twentieth of the danger level.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00392">So on two counts, both falling in the definition of pollution by the Commission
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0034"/>
<col>51</col>
itself&#x2014;human health and the health of fish&#x2014;the environment quality objective proposed just does not make sense. There remains a very important fact, that the fish and other living things accumulate dieldrin from water, and they concentrate it enormously in their own tissues. If people then eat the fish they might be at danger. Experts are reluctant to commit themselves to precise figures for the amount of dieldrin which fish and other living things will accumulate from the environment. However, it is a general consensus that it is up to levels like 10,000&#x2014;a multiple, that is, of 10,000 of the concentrations outside.<lb/>
If the Calder carried trout, salmon or eels&#x2014;which it does not because of pollutants other than dieldrin&#x2014;then there would be an indubitable case for monitoring the dieldrin level of the fish. Then consent levels on the river could be imposed which would guarantee that the acceptable daily intake, if people ate the fish every day&#x2014;and it is reckoned that about 100 grammes a day is the maximum one might expect people to eat&#x2014;would be safe. This is exactly what is being done all the time in Britain in waters where fish are eaten. But coarse fish are not eaten in Britain, and the present use to which that stretch of water is put does not justify such drastic lowering of the dieldrin level either&#x2014;to come back to the Commission's own definition&#x2014;on grounds of hazards to human health or on grounds of harm to living resources.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00393">Finally, there is a practical difficulty about settling a standard of 0&#x00B7;005 parts per billion which the drafters of the Directive do not seem to have noted. The waters which fall into a river from a mothproofing plant contain many impurities. If one wants to analyse the water containing those impurities for the concentrations of dieldrin, one simply cannot detect levels lower than about 0&#x00B7;01 parts per billion, so the level proposed in the Directive is one which could not in fact be measured, except by most refined and difficult research techniques. So the idea of monitoring concentrations of that level as a routine matter simply is not on.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00394">These are the reasons why I think it is not an exaggeration to say that "nonsense" is the word that has to be used for this option offered to the nation States in
<col>52</col>
the Community which prefer to take environmental quality objectives rather than emission standards. How did the Commission come across this figure? The Directive states that the figure was reached:
<quote>"after consulting a group of national experts",</quote>
and also on the basis of a study made by consultants in the Agricultural University of Wageningen in Holland. But as with previous Directives about the environment, scientific evidence for the decision is not given and the consultants' report is not published.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00395">However, I have talked with the British experts in this matter and their view is clear from what I have already explained to your Lordships. I have managed to see a copy of the consultants' report. Again for the record, I should like to read the conclusion of that report:
<quote>"This leads to the rather disappointing conclusion that most toxicological studies made so far with the aim to assess the environmental hazards of aldrin, dieldrin and endrin &#x2026; have been inadequate in the sense that for the aquatic environment no practical environmental threshold levels can be derived from their results".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00396">The Commission then concludes, based on that conclusion, without providing any of the consultants' data that the environmental quality should be set at a level which is inconsistent with two other Commission Directives, unjustified on grounds of safety to human beings or wildlife, and below the limits detectable by routine analysis. As one of our witnesses put it, data appeared to have been plucked out of the air using a concentration factor much higher than the one thought to be reasonable by British experts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00397">The result is that, despite the compromise agreement made with great difficulty by Her Majesty's Government in 1975, we are not offered a practicable choice between emission standard and environmental quality objective. I am sure that I speak for the sub-committee which scrutinises environmental Directives for the Select Committee when I say that as committed Europeans we all want to reach amicable agreement with the Commission over an environmental policy for the Community, and we all agree that dieldrin is a harmful substance which ought be phased out as soon as satisfactory alternatives are found. The alternatives in use are not at present satisfactory because not enough is known
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0035"/>
<col>53</col>
about them. But we see no prospect of amicable agreement unless the Commission can be persuaded to adopt two simple principles when it prepares its Directives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00398">The Select Committee is asking Her Majesty's Government to press upon the Commission the adoption of these two simple principles. The first principle is to abide by a declaration of the Council of Ministers made in 1973 about the environment. This declaration is the only authority for having a European environmental policy at all. It states that protection of the environment should be achieved
<quote>"at the lowest cost to the Community"</quote>
and that in setting quality objectives
<quote>"proper account must be taken of the specific characteristics of the regions in question".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00399">This means the deployment of our limited resources in places where they could be most cost-effective. It means that we should have different environmental qualities for rivers, depending on whether they carry game fish, coarse fish or no fish at all. Following this policy in Britain over the last 20 years, some of them under the chairmanship of the noble Lord at present on the Woolsack, we have increased the amount of unpolluted rivers by about 4,500 kilometres and we have diminished the amount of badly polluted rivers by about 1,500 kilometres. I doubt whether any other Member State in the Community can match that record. A doctrinaire pursuit of uniform emission standards would wreck this policy; it would waste money which otherwise might be spent on improving the environment elsewhere, so we must insist on flexibility in meeting standards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00400">The second principle is to insist on free and candid disclosure of the scientific evidence on which Directives are based. It simply is not good enough for the Commission to say, "After consulting a group of experts, we set such and such standards". The Select Committee has now got plenty of evidence that the experts' advice is not always taken. To comply with some of these Directives&#x2014;for instance, that proposed for fish&#x2014;would put Member States to enormous expense and to expect them to incur this enormous expense without even seeing the data on which the standards are based is, I suggest, an intolerable situation.
<col>54</col>
I am afraid it is true&#x2014;and we regret it&#x2014;that there will be perpetual wrangling over environmental policy in the Community until this freedom of information is secured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00401">I should like to come back to what I said at the beginning&#x2014;that we entirely agree with the purpose of the Directives, which is to control the level of pesticides in the environment. We go on to say that they are not even sound for that purpose, because they make no provision for monitoring anything except the manufacture and the moth-proofing processes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00402">The last report of the Royal Commission on environmental pollution pointed out that there are other dangers of dieldrin. Some of the dieldrin which is used for wood proofing has caused harm to life, and it is the British policy of having an environmental quality objective for the whole of the environment which enables us to distinguish these things and to control them when we find them&#x2014;a thing we could not do if we adopted a standard blanket emission policy with no variation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00403">Compared with the Common Agricultural Policy, the Commission's environmental policy for Europe may well be a small matter, but it is a perpetual source of irritation. So the message which I bring from the Select Committee to your Lordships' House is to urge Her Majesty's Government to continue to resist this doctrinaire imposition of fixed emission standards as a means for protecting the environment. It is a sure recipe for not getting the best value for money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00404">Finally, my Lords, we would urge Her Majesty's Government to persuade the Commission to put into its Directives two ingredients: flexibility to take account of local differences in the environment and local conditions, and a full disclosure of the scientific evidence on which these Directives are based. If this were done we could begin to have what we would like to have&#x2014;that is, confidence in the Commission's environmental policies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00405">Moved, That this House takes note of the 17th Report of the European Communities Committee on draft Directives on the discharge of aldrin, dieldrin and endrin into the aquatic environment.&#x2014;<i>(Lord Ashby.)</i></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00407"><member>The Earl of CRANBROOK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the very outset I wish to stress to you&#x2014;and I am sure your Lordships will join me in recognising this&#x2014;that the draft Directive which we are discussing is, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, has said, laudable in its general objectives. The substances whose discharge into the waters of Community Members is to be controlled are poisons, as your Lordships will very well know. The effect of these poisons is cumulative and so may not be seen immediately. It may in fact take many years to become apparent. The poisons are absorbed into fish and other living organisms&#x2014;in the case of fish, chiefly through their gills, because the fish is unable to excrete the poison it has accumulated in its tissues. The poison can be further accumulated in the tissues of predatory creatures, whether birds or men, who eat the fish. The problems in this country in the past have unfortunately brought about death in avian predators rather than in man; but this is none the less a problem of which we must all be aware, and we must congratulate the Commission on turning its attention to the environment and on tackling this one specific aspect at this juncture. I feel it is the duty of your Lordships' House to support the Commission and the Council over this initiative in their efforts to reduce or to eliminate these substances from the environment.<lb/>
The topic and the discussion&#x2014;and this includes the discussion of the report of the sub-committee of the Select Committee&#x2014;are in fact very technical. I suspect that it may be this technicality which has occasioned something which can scarcely be called a debate, when two members of the sub-committee speak to each other across your Lordships' Chamber. None the less, I feel it is perhaps because the terminology, and even the jargon, that are used in the Directive, and to some extent in the report on it, are unfamiliar to your Lordships, so that fewer people felt able to come forward to join in the debate. I feel that perhaps I should not be exaggerating the situation if I were to say that a number of your Lordships, if you were to meet a nanogramme in the dark, would not know whether to stamp on it or to put it on the record player!<lb/>
This House is therefore extremely fortunate in having among its Members&#x2014;
<col>56</col>
and this must surely be one of the great merits of this House&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, who has given your Lordships such an extremely lucid exposition both of the draft directive and of the perils which lie therein. He has highlighted anomalies in the technical aspects of this draft directive. Certain of the aims of the directive may in fact be unattainable or, as he pointed out, if attained, may be unascertainable&#x2014;simply because the detection methods for discovering the presence of deildrin in the sort of place it is normally found (that is, a river) are inapplicable because of the presence of other pollutants.<lb/>
Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, has pointed out, the targets expressed in one manner as environmental quality objectives are not compatible with the alternative targets expressed as levels of emission. This also adds to the extremely unsatisfactory nature of the draft directive as it stands. Capacity to interpret technical documents of this nature is not necessarily expected of members of a national or a Community legislature. Members of such bodies must normally rely on their technical advisers to interpret for them and translate into familiar terms the units, the language and the experiments that are discussed in the technical papers. In addition, as the noble Lord. Lord Ashby, has stressed, the primary evidence itself&#x2014;the scientific data&#x2014;must be made available so that those qualified, those national experts whose advice is so important, are able to assess and evaluate the information on which documents such as this Directive are based.<lb/>
Both the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and myself, in my own smaller way, being connected with the scientific community, feel very strongly that evidence which is not published is evidence which is in a sense worthless. We are accustomed to evaluating scientific evidence, but we require to see the data in every case adequately summarised. We can criticise this draft Directive because it is deficient in this aspect. The technical data&#x2014;the evidence on which the standards were based&#x2014;are not provided. Without this, as I said a moment ago, our own national agencies, which are very well equipped with experts whose evidence was extremely important to the sub-committee, cannot assist us with their assessment of the merits of this Directive.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0037"/>
<col>57</col>
Members of your Lordships' sub-Committee were not informed of the full background to the preparation of this report. It may be a fact that the Commission lacks the extent of technical advisers and interpreters of scientific information that is necessary. A moment ago, the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, referred to the Commission as a small but devoted body. If we are to improve this small but devoted body, and provide it with the technical assistance that it needs, it will obviously cost money. But although it will cost money, I think that Her Majesty's Government may have to look to this aspect, because unless this deficiency is remedied future directives that we can expect in this series may not prove to be any more acceptable than that which is before us this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00409"><member>Lord SHACKLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, despite the remarks of the noble Earl, that this is really too technical a subject for the bulk of us even to discuss, I hope that your Lordships will allow me to intervene, if only because it recalls some of the great debates that we had 15 or 20 years ago when so much of the avian life&#x2014;and indeed foxes&#x2014;was being destroyed by the use of mercury seed dressings and, in particular, chlorinated hydrocarbons. This is a subject with which your Lordships have been concerned over a number of years. After hearing the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, there is really nothing further to say on the merits of the argument. It was a most formidable and decisive speech and I would not attempt to adduce again the arguments that he put forward. I should, however, like to comment on some of the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, because he directed his remarks to the system and to how we can improve, particularly in the European Community, the getting of sensible reports on matters of great technical importance.<lb/>
First, I should like to say that we are very grateful not only here but throughout the country to the sub-committee, and, in particular, to the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, for the part he has played in trying to introduce sense into environmental questions as they are considered by the European Community. I am a little more hopeful about the future, because having recently looked through
<col>58</col>
the list of European MPs on the Conservative side&#x2014;I confess that I have not looked at the Labour list but there are not many of them, I regret to say&#x2014;I have noticed that there are a number of Members of the European Parliament who are technically very well qualified, including one Conservative member who is, in fact, an environmental affairs adviser. He happens to be a personal friend of mine and used to work towards me. I hope that this is a matter which will be considered within the European Parliament. I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Mowbray, will need no further persuasion on the merits of this question. But I must say that if the European Commission is to produce reports of this kind, it will do real damage to the cause of those who support sensible environmental measures.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, is probably the greatest expert on mammals in South-East Asia, and he and I last met when we were discussing the conservation of forests. But I wonder whether it would be possible to arrange, either through the members of the sub-committee or perhaps through the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, that some representations are made direct to the Commission on the quality of the advice that they are receiving. I agree so strongly with the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, that it is intolerable that the evidence for the assertions and the conclusions of this report is not available. It is only through the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, that we know even that that advice does not necessarily coincide with the conclusions of the report.<lb/>
Furthermore, I should have liked to ask the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook&#x2014;and perhaps on another occasion I may do so&#x2014;to explain the rather interesting philosophic concept that he put forward, that levels may be attainable but they are not necessarily ascertainable. This seems to me to be an interesting philosophic point, which it is perhaps beyond the range and capacity of scientists, as opposed to philosophers, to answer. I hope that I did not misinterpret him. I also hope that the Government will take a firm and constructive line, with a view to ensuring that better consideration is given to these problems in the future. Meanwhile, I strongly support everything that the two noble Lords have said.</membercontribution></p>

I stand up here in support of 3 million fishermen, who fish in Britain nearly every weekend. I should like to know, first, how much real consultation there was with the freshwater fishermen of this country; and, secondly, how we are to protect our environment if these insidious pieces of trespassing go on from time to time. Apparently, the philistines think that people are idealists if they want to protect our rivers, our mountains and our beautiful environment.<lb/>
I want to give full marks to this noble House. It is only in a place such as this that, in this materialistic world, you can have a little debate such as this, which is very worthwhile. I hope that more attention will be drawn to these Directives, and I wish to congratulate the people who have taken the trouble to study this vital problem in depth&#x2014;and I have read some of the material&#x2014;and its effects upon our environment.</membercontribution></p>

I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, will both be able to come, so that we can try to put to our friends in Brussels the very real difficulties which we find not through any antagonism whatsoever towards the objectives, which are common to both of us&#x2014;over the scientific methods employed, and the lack of publication of scientific data on which we could reach considered judgments. This is a peculiarly difficult Directive. We hoped that we should not have to discuss these water Directives again. But we were entirely convinced, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, made all too clear, that what we were being asked to do was just practically unattainable or unascertainable. It was a nonsense. The degree of particularity we were required to observe was quite unnecessary and was just not practicable for anybody who had studied the matter with water from a river, not water in a laboratory.</membercontribution></p>

I have constantly wanted to make the remarks I am going to make in relation to various measures proposed by the EEC. If one makes what I call blunderbuss legislation to apply to detailed matters in all member countries, one is bound to produce something which at times is unsuitably clumsy for the effect it is trying to produce. Here is an example.<lb/>
It would be very difficult to produce one standard piece of legislation to look after pollution in every country without its appearing to be rather stupid. It has often occurred to me that some process should be available within the EEC Commission for legislating to the effect that each member country has the responsibility of checking its legislation and introducing new legislation where it thinks that it could be improved, subject to monitoring by the Commission and advice from the Commission if it does not come up to the standards which they think should be applied. In other words, we should have a situation in which the Commission can influence each country to produce legislation in its own Parliament that is suitable for its own conditions and make sure that it does so, instead of this blunderbuss attempt which goes on all the time and which at times produces the sort of result we are facing this afternoon and which at other times produces a very absurd situation.</membercontribution></p>

I say "pleasant" advisedly, because in our view the report of the Select Committee which leads us to this debate on the draft Directives is an excellent and very useful one. The Government welcome it. The work of the Select Committee in this field is now well known, and not only in the United Kingdom. I understand, for example, that the committee's reports are awaited and read with great interest in the EEC Commission. The authority and quality of the reports by this Select Committee are therefore well established. This latest one on the Drins Directives is no exception.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0039"/>
<col>61</col>
I should very much like to pay tribute to the quality of the debate. At one time I thought that just the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and I were going to speak, but I have been much heartened by such learned eloquence from my noble friend Lord Cranbrook and the noble Lord, Lord Shackleton, followed by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, the noble Baroness, Lady White, who is such an expert on water matters, and the noble Lord, Lord Brown. All speakers have given the Government valuable points to bear in mind.<lb/>
I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Shackleton, said that it is a very technical subject. Indeed it is, and the noble Lord quite rightly paid tribute to the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, introduced the debate and put everything so eloquently and clearly. It is also a great pleasure to me to be able to say to the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, that the forthright views which he has expressed are very similar to those of the Government. We have been pressing&#x2014;and will go on pressing&#x2014;during the negotiations in Brussels for answers to some of the very pertinent questions which he has put. In my view, he has rightly identified two of the key issues for the Government in the negotiations on these proposals, and I can assure him that we have taken careful note of the points he has made.<lb/>
Let me sketch in some of the background to these proposals from the Community. As the noble Lord has said, the important point about these draft Directives is that they are the first offspring of a major parent Directive in the environmental field. This is EEC Document 76/464, adopted by the Council on 4th May 1976, and dealing with "pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community". The Directive provides a framework for measures to control water pollution caused by the discharge of harmful substances. These are grouped into a black list and a grey list on the basis of their polluting effects. The main criteria used have been "toxicity, persistence and bio-accumulation".<lb/>
The 1976 Directive does not in itself establish limits or standards for any of these dangerous substances. The idea always was that these should be laid down
<col>62</col>
in subsequent Directives and it is the first of these which is before us now. The proposals themselves are not of major significance. The drins are, indeed, nasty substances which should be controlled, but they are not in wide use; in fact, as the noble Lord said, the proposed Directives will bear on only two Member States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. But, as the first in a whole series of Directives, there are principles and precedents at stake here which make our debate today wholly appropriate and justifiable.<lb/>
One important principle which I must mention has already been referred to. This is the so-called "parallel approach". The vital compromise reached in 1976 and enshrined in the parent Directive is that Member States could operate by either Environmental Quality Objectives, which we call EQOs, or Uniform Emission Standards, which we call UESs. This remains vital to United Kingdom interests. Industry in general, and the water industry in particular, support the Government's preference for EQOs as an effective policy for controlling water pollution, a policy which is soundly based in both scientific and economic terms. I very much welcome the support for this approach in the Select Committee's Report. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, has already said, we must ensure that the parallel approach in EEC law is a genuine one. There is cause for a good deal of concern about this in the current proposals. I can assure the House that we will continue to pursue this point in Brussels. This issue goes well beyond the subject matter of these texts, and we must get it right.<lb/>
I should like to add here that there is no question about the United Kingdom's commitment to controlling black list substances in the environment. Indeed, we consider that our record here is already a very good one. It is simply a matter of making sure that there is parity between these two different&#x2014;in their environmental effect&#x2014;approaches in EEC Directives.<lb/>
I have already referred to the narrowness of these proposals from the EEC. As I have said, they affect only two Member States. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the EEC proposals deal only with discharges of dieldrin by
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0040"/>
<col>63</col>
our mothproofing industry, which is largely based in Yorkshire. Traces of drins can be found elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but these would not be covered by the present texts. The agricultural use of these pesticides is dealt with in another Directive, on plant protection products. There is some room for doubt as to whether something of such limited application justifies a Community Directive. In the early discussions in Brussels, we have already raised this question. But the Commission has been under pressure from a number of countries to make progress with proposals under the parent Directive, and the drins presumably seemed a simple place to start.<lb/>
The narrow impact of the proposals obviously means that during the negotiations most Member States are concerned only with issues of precedent. As I have said, we are very interested in these issues, too. We are already in consultation with all those organisations and industries interested in the draft Directives and, with the help of the Select Committee's Report and the speech made by noble Lords today, the United Kingdom will play its part in making sure that all these issues are very thoroughly examined and discussed.<lb/>
There is one other particular issue I should like to mention before I conclude my remarks. This concerns the scientific basis of the Commission's proposals. I understand the various comments about this made by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and indeed those highlighted in the committee's very able report. It is a very clear objective of this Government to ensure, so far as they can, the respectability of EEC legislation, in both scientific and economic terms. My colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, explained the Government's commitment to this in a debate in another place during the summer on the Directive on Sampling and Analysis. From this point of view, we cannot regard these drins proposals as an auspicious first step down the road of the new Environmental 131 Directives. They relate only to the discharge of drins by two particular industrial sectors; so any other drins in Community waters can, presumably, be left undisturbed.<lb/>
<col>64</col>
The particular quality standard proposed has been very effectively criticised by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and by other noble Lords in this debate today. The Government share the doubts which have been expressed about the derivation of this figure, its justification and its implementation. So we do not think these are very good proposals for controlling pollution by the drins in Community waters; nor do they commend themselves, in their present form, in terms of the precedents set for what should be an important series of environmental Directives. The noble Lord, Lord Ashby, expressed the hope that we would adopt the two principles which he enunciated in connection with these drins: the proper protection of the environment at the proper lowest possible cost and also that in connection with evidence on which directives were taken, as my noble friend Lord Cranbrook said, data must be made available for their evaluation. I wish to assure him that we thoroughly support the two principles for which he has asked and we will fight hard for them.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Shackleton, said that the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, was formidable and decisive. How right he was. The noble Lord, Lord Shackleton, is himself such an expert on these matters that I feel extremely humble when speaking in reply for the Government in front of so many experts on these complicated chemical matters.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, asked about fishermen. The answer is that the Commission did not consult with fishermen, but this Government have their interest very much in mind and are well aware of the need for present protection of fisheries. The noble Lord, Lord Brown, referred to "blunderbuss legislation". I have already explained that, as the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, and others have said, we do not like legislation on which data are not available and therefore we do not know on what grounds it is founded. The noble Baroness, Lady White, will be pleased to know that in connection with the arrangements for further meetings in Brussels the Government are pursuing matters on a parallel course and I was glad to hear that the noble Lord, Lord Shackleton, was impressed by the quality of some of our Euro M.P.s who will be taking up this matter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0041"/>
<col>65</col>
The Government agree with the rest of our partners in Europe that pollution by black list substances into the aquatic environment should be controlled, as I have said. So we welcome the appearance of these first proposals which we have been debating today under the parent Dangerous Substances Directive, Environment 131. But as these drins proposals are the first of their kind, like other Member States we shall be concerned as much with the principles and precedents involved as with the particular details concerning the drins themselves. There are undoubtedly problems in these texts, both general and specific. The Government's approach will be the same as with any proposals within the Community: we shall seek to co-operate with our fellow Member States in order to consider and develop the best solution.<lb/>
The Government are grateful for the very detailed consideration of these draft Directives on the drins by the Select Committee. Its report, as I have said, is excellent&#x2014;an important contribution to the consideration of these proposals within the United Kingdom. We are also grateful to the House for arranging this very worthwhile debate today. I can summarise my own remarks in concluding the debate as follows: we agree that in this present form there are many problems with these draft Directives&#x2014;and some of these problems are important ones; we shall be seeking changes in the texts during the negotiations; to this end we are very greatful for and, I repeat, have taken careful note of, the points made in this report and in the debate today.</membercontribution></p>

<col>66</col>
cause I felt that what I had to say to the House was rather destructive. But the embarrassment which your sub-committee finds all the time is that it has exactly the same aims as that part of the Commission which is responsible for creating an environmental policy, and our difference is only on means. It is to overcome this clash of beliefs in means that a debate such as this may be very healthy and helpful to the Commission.<lb/>
I was also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, for speaking on behalf of fishermen. My own experience when I was chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution was that very great care was being taken by what are now the regional water authorities to look after the interests of the fish. I think it comes back again to the principle which I was trying to enunciate: the best way to safeguard the welfare of the fish is similar to the best way to safeguard the welfare of people; namely, to deploy limited resources in the places where they are most needed. That is what we have been pleading with the Commission to do, informally and through reports of the Select Committee.<lb/>
Finally, it is with very great pleasure and satisfaction that we note that Her Majesty's Government find themselves in harmony with the views of the Select Committee on this and I am sure the Select Committee will be grateful if it has made some small contribution to the advocacy of the Government in connection with this case in Brussels.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00426"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member>: No. The future operation of the Department of the Environment shop has been considered and it has been decided to close the shop because of estimated accumulated losses of &#x00A3;22,000 since shop opened in 1971, which have been only partially offset by a surplus of &#x00A3;9,000 in Jubilee Year. In view of this there is little point in estimating losses that would have been made had the shop been open during July, August and September.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00434">What weight government statistics give to the large and increasing exchange of goods and services which is conducted for cash and does not figure in any tax returns when producing figures for gross national product, consumer expenditure and the like.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00435"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member>: Transactions in cash are included in national accounts statistics along with transactions through other media of exchange. Certain cash transactions may generate incomes which are not declared for taxation purposes and which form part of the so-called "hidden economy". By their very nature incomes generated by the hidden economy cannot be measured through regular statistical sources. However, some part, and probably a substantial part, of the expenditure generating such incomes is measured through regular statistical sources through it cannot be separately distinguished. In compiling estimates of gross domestic product the Central Statistical Office makes a positive adjustment to the data on incomes derived from regular statistical sources. The size
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0043"/>
<col>69</col>
of this adjustment is based on the longterm mismatch between basic data on incomes and expenditure. The adjustment therefore reflects some unknown part of incomes generated by the hidden economy.</p>

<title>OIL TANKER TRAFFIC OFF SCOTTISH COASTS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00452"><member>The Earl of CROMARTIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00453">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00454">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they would agree that all oil tankers should be excluded from the Minch and that their course should always be set West of&#x2014;that is, outside&#x2014;the Hebridean Islands; and whether they are aware that any spillage of oil in these narrow waters would result in appalling pollution of mainland and islands coasts, and destroy still further our already depleted fish stocks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00455"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are very much aware of the dangers presented to the Scottish coasts and to marine life by the increased tanker traffic to the North and West of Scotland. For this reason, a group under Department of Trade chairmanship, and including representatives of the Scottish Office and local authorities, has been examining this problem. As a result, the Department has undertaken to develop for approval by IMCO a traffic separation scheme for the Minches. Consideration is also being given to whether it would
<col>72</col>
be practicable to put forward a recommendation that large, laden tankers should keep to the West of the Hebrides.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00456"><member>The Earl of CROMARTIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that satisfactory Answer, and I hope it will not take too long; we do not want any more disasters. Some major ones have occurred there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00457"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will want to wish my noble friend who has put down this Question a happy birthday today!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00458"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00459"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the right of innocent passage is of great importance to this country all over the world, and the Minch is within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom, may I ask whether the Government will none the less put all the pressure and influence they can into arranging for oil tankers to avoid the Minch and to go round West of the Hebrides?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00460"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; I think that was implied in the original Answer. However, the mandatory exclusion of tankers would not be consistent with the right of ships to innocent passage through our waters, and we are obliged to comply with the terms of the 1958 international convention on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00461"><member>Lord BOWDEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been properly reported in the Press that before long cargoes of plutonium will be going on their way from Dounreay to Windscale. The prospect of a disaster due to some marine catastrophe concerning a cargo of plutonium is probably much more dangerous than even the worst oil spillage. When the Government committee considers this problem, could I ask that it makes appropriate arrangements for these ships in their right of passage, as well?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00462"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that question is pretty wide of that of traffic going through the Minches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00463"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware of the nationalities of some of the principal offenders in this regard and of the flags under which they sail? Will the noble

<col>73</col>
Lord give some assurance that Her Majesty's Government will make representations to other Member States of the European Community who have so far not signed all the international conventions, to one of which he has referred?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00464"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; we hope that all those countries who have not so far adhered to these conventions will do so as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00465"><member>Viscount ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will Her Majesty's Government pay particular attention, and perhaps call the attention of the committee concerned with such matters, to the fact that oil spillages occurring in the far North or the far South are particularly dangerous?&#x2014;because the degradability of oil on the surface of the sea very much depends on the temperatures surrounding it, and far to the North and far to the South the oil remains on the surface of the sea for very much longer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00466"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Viscount is right. The Department of Trade's contingency arrangements for dealing with oil spills at sea, however, extend to the whole of the United Kingdom coastline. However, in view of the obvious difficulties in mounting a counter-pollution exercise off the North-West coast of Scotland, the Department recently carried out an exercise based on a simulated grounding of a loaded oil tanker off the island of Rhum. The lessons learned will be applied in the further development of arrangements for dealing with pollution incidents in these waters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00467"><member>The Earl of GLASGOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend tell me whether his inquiry includes the same restrictions for oil tankers in the Firth of Clyde, where a spillage would be even more disastrous?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00468"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the inquiry to which I referred does not include that aspect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00469"><member>The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Lord Soames)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we get on to the next Question, as my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy wished a happy birthday to my

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00472">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00473">To ask Her Majesty's Government why they have dissolved the Advisory Committee for Development Education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00474"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the decision progressively to reduce financial support for development education in Britain and to disband the advisory committee was taken after the most careful consideration and in the light of our current review of public expenditure. We wish to record our gratitude to the committee for its unstinting work over the past 2&#x00BD; years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00475"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister agree, first, that he has not answered my Question; and, secondly, that this committee has been composed, unlike the notorious Quangos, of distinguished men and women from all over the educational world and elsewhere who have worked unstintingly and without payment for 2&#x00BD; years and have produced a report of the utmost value to the educational system, both formal and informal, of this country? In those circumstances, why is this committee to be closed down?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00476"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if we decide, as we have done, progressively to run down our programme of development education, then the advisory committee on that subject must clearly be reconsidered, too.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00477"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: But surely, my Lords, the committee that has been sitting is not dependent simply on spending money. It has been advising the educational system of this country. Is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0046"/>
<col>75</col>
the Minister aware that Norway and the Netherlands spend 30 times as much <i>per capita</i> on development education as this country, and that Sweden spends 50 times as much <i>per capita</i>? Has the Minister read the Schlackman Report? If he is to close down this committee, what will he put in its place in order to introduce the world concepts which are needed in our educational system now that the committee is no longer allowed to do the work which it still wishes to do?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00478"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure whether the noble Lord quite understood my original Answer, or per haps the answer to his first supplementary. I said that we had decided progressively to run down our programme of development education. The advisory committee on that subject, of which the noble Lord was, of course, one of the distinguished members, has among its tasks the job of deciding where to direct the funds available to that programme. If these funds are being withdrawn, then clearly a major part of the task of the committee must be reviewed, and that is what we have done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00481">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00482">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will report on the progress of the Vienna discussions on mutual reduction of arms in Central Europe, particularly in relation to President Brezhnev's proposals to reduce Soviet troops and tanks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00483"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after three Questions, I am beginning to wonder whether it is not my 70th birthday. President Brezhnev's intention to withdraw a limited number of Soviet troops and tanks from the German Democratic Republic is an indication that the Russians may now be willing to negotiate seriously for an MBFR agreement. But the
<col>76</col>
main obstacle to progress remains disagreement about the existing level of Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00484"><member>Lord BROCKWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming the fact that the Government recognise the seriousness of these proposals, may I ask whether they go some way to meeting the West's demands at Vienna, and cannot they, perhaps with some expansion, be made the basis for negotiation on an agreement? May I also ask the noble Lord this question: Could they not be followed by negotiation to contain the SS.20 missile and the Backfire bomber of the Soviet Union, and so avoid confrontation by the staging all over Europe of the cruise missiles, with their 572 warheads?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00485"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may refer to the question of the SS.20 missile, because President Brezhnev referred to that in his speech. There was an offer, as we understand it, to move a certain number of SS.20 missiles back to new sites East of the Urals. The offer was, I think, linked with our agreement not to proceed with modernisation of the tactical nuclear forces, which is a matter very much under consideration at the moment. But, furthermore, we have to consider whether moving these missiles to the new sites proposed will greatly decrease their effectiveness. We think not. As to the significance of the announcement generally, President Brezhnev did not link the intended unilateral withdrawal of Soviet troops and tanks from the GDR with the MBFR negotiations. We look forward to receiving further clarification from the Soviet Union as to how this announcement may relate to the Vienna negotiations, and to the agreed objective of establishing parity in military manpower in Central Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00486"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the Soviet Union made any offer to withdraw its troops which are at present stationed in Czechoslovakia, where they prop up a r&#x00E9;gime which imprisons its citizens for exercising their right of freedom of speech?</membercontribution></p>

<title>RHODESIA: CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00488">2.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00489"><member>The SECRETARY of STATE for FOREIGN and COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS (Lord Carrington)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will make a Statement on Rhodesia. When the House rose, the Government were close to completing their consultations on the way to build on the progress made inside Rhodesia so as to bring the country to independence with wide international recognition. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister and I went to the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government at Lusaka with the objective of securing their support for a renewed effort to find a settlement and end the war. The agreement reached there paved the way for the present constitutional conference at Lancaster House.<lb/>
It was agreed that, in the event of agreement on a new constitution, there should be fresh elections in which all the parties would be able to participate, properly supervised under the British Government's authority and with Commonwealth observers present. Such an election, if all agreed to stand by its result, would offer the prospect of an end to the war.<lb/>
In the last six weeks we have achieved agreement on a constitution which, indisputably, provides for genuine majority rule, while including appropriate safeguards for minorities. Both Bishop Muzorewa's delegation and that of the Patriotic Front have made substantial concessions from their opening positions to reach agreement with us on the independence constitution, which we believe will provide a sound, just and democratic basis for the future of an independent Zimbabwe.<lb/>
The task before us in the conference now is to reach agreement on the arrangements for implementing that constitution. The key element in those arrangements will be, as agreed at Lusaka,
<quote>"free and fair elections, properly supervised under British Government authority, and with Commonwealth observers".</quote>
Bishop Muzorewa's delegation has already declared its willingness to participate in such elections in order to bring the new constitution into effect.<lb/>
<col>78</col>
Her Majesty's Government are willing to discharge in full their constitutional responsibility to see that elections are held on a basis which will give every party a fair chance to state its case to the people of Rhodesia. We have made proposals to the conference about the arrangements to bring the independence constitution into effect, and we are now engaged in discussing them with the delegations.<lb/>
It is in the interests of all the people of Rhodesia and of the neighbouring countries that elections should take place as soon as possible to implement the constitution and allow Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence. Our proposals provide for the appointment of a British governor, with executive and legislative authority during the brief interim. Under the governor, an election commissioner will have the task of supervising the conduct of the elections. Commonwealth observers would be invited to witness them.<lb/>
I would not underestimate the difficulties which lie ahead. But we have reached a wider measure of agreement on the constitution than has hitherto been possible and the British Government have accepted their responsibility to supervise the process of putting it into effect.<lb/>
What we have proposed is fully within the letter and the spirit of the Lusaka declaration. We see no need for elaborate administrative and constitutional structures during the interim period, or for a lengthy interim period with all the unrest and uncertainty that that would bring. Any restructuring that may be necessary will be for the elected Government to undertake within the constitutional framework.<lb/>
If our proposals are accepted, as I hope they will be, and a cease-fire is agreed, the way will be open for an end to the war and for Zimbabwe to take its place in the international community as a free and independent nation in the very near future. I hope that the House will support the Government in their efforts to bring this about.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00490">3.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00491"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords would wish to thank the noble Lord for making this Statement. Indeed, we would all wish to congratulate him on the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0048"/>
<col>79</col>
perseverance and skill with which he has pursued an agreed solution to this perennially difficult question. We wish him well today and in the next few days, which may be crucial to the final solution that he, and we, hope will be attained.<lb/>
This is not, of course, a final settlement. Negotiations are proceeding, as we have just heard, and none of us would wish to say or even suggest anything which might in any way imperil the success of those continuing negotiations. Perhaps, however, one or two points of inquiry and, possibly, of suggestion might be acceptable.<lb/>
As to the role of the governor whom the Government, obviously with the general agreement of those concerned in the conference, propose to appoint to have executive and legislative authority during the transitional period, would it not be useful for him to have some sort of advisory council of a non-executive character, but nevertheless representing the various strands of opinion in Rhodesia, to advise him&#x2014;I repeat, not to exercise any executive authority? After all, he will be one man who is dependent upon advice of one sort or another and it might be best to organise that advice through some kind of council. I merely throw out the suggestion.<lb/>
As to the interim period itself, I should like to suggest that the period of two months, which I think is suggested, may prove to be rather short from the practical point of view of making the necessary arrangements for an effective electoral process, as well as perhaps unfair to elements whom, we hope, will take full part in the elections: elements which for very many years have not been allowed into Rhodesia to do anything, least of all to conduct propaganda. A period of two months would seem to be a little short for people who have spent many years outside a country which they now have the opportunity to ask for a mandate to govern. Possibly three months would be better. I throw out that suggestion without in any way being dogmatic about it.<lb/>
As to the role of the Patriotic Front, which is crucial to the future of Rhodesia, just as the support of the Front Line Presidents is necessary, one cannot but welcome what the Statement says about
<col>80</col>
the readiness of both Bishop Muzorewa and the Patriotic Front leaders to make substantial concessions. I think it should go out from this House&#x2014;as, indeed, it does from this Statement&#x2014;that we all appreciate the constructive attitudes which have asserted themselves in the last week or so, not only in the Salisbury Government but in the leadership of the Patriotic Front. They have made substantial concessions and we are glad that they have done so.<lb/>
Of course they have reservations about the armed forces. It is too early to speak about questions like integration. There may be ways of arranging these matters that are best left to negotiation. Nevertheless, there is some difficulty here. If the transitional period, however short, means that the executive and, therefore, the policing and military authority rests in the governor, then clearly neither the military forces of the existing Salisbury regime, nor, certainly, those of the insurgents, can play a role, at least during that period. Now who will maintain law and order? Is the police element in Rhodesia enough to do that, or will it not need augmentation from military forces? If so&#x2014;the two contending forces having stood down, hopefully, on a cease-fire preparatory to ending the fighting&#x2014;where is that military augmentation for the police, if it is necessary, to come from?<lb/>
Here one comes to a central point&#x2014;the role of the Commonwealth. The Statement says that the elections will be supervised under the British Government's authority, with Commonwealth observers present. We welcome that very much. Could we perhaps give the Commonwealth a stronger, fuller role in the operation of these transitional agreements, in the supervision of elections? For instance, the electoral commissioner whom the Statement mentions, who will operate under the authority of the governor, might well be from another Commonwealth country. Equally, if there is need for a third force additional to the permanent police force of the country&#x2014;and there may well be&#x2014;the maintenance of law and order could be drawn from the Commonwealth. We know, do we not, that, despite the accumulation of resentments, when the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister went to Lusaka they
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0049"/>
<col>81</col>
found in the event a strong Commonwealth will to assist in the creation of an agreed solution. The Lusaka Conference, as the Statement itself says, is really the parent&#x2014;I hesitate to describe the noble Lord as the midwife&#x2014;of this very hopeful conference, and the Commonwealth may expect us, in deference to the help they have given us, to extend to them a role in the management in the transitional period of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, which will itself be on the way to full membership of the Commonwealth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00492">3.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00493"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from these Benches we think that the Government, and more especially, I suggest, the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, are to be sincerely congratulated on the progress made on these all-important talks and particularly on obtaining general agreement on a constitution, something which, as I think has already been said, has never been done before. The next step, obviously, will be to get general agreement on how to bring the constitution into effect and how to organise the elections at which I imagine it will in effect be put before the electorate.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, I do not wish to ask any questions which might have the result of prejudicing the very delicate negotiations now going on, but I imagine that one of the chief points at issue, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, indicated, will be to decide who actually will control and what will be the composition of the armed forces and the police responsible for maintaining order during the elections themselves. Is it conceivable that some comparitively non-aligned (as the saying goes) general might be called in from one of the Commonwealth countries? I suggest that is a possibility. The only question I wish to put is this: Has the matter of compensation to any landowners who eventually may want to leave, been settled, and if so, on what general lines?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00494">3.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00495"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say how grateful I am both to the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, and to the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, for their kind remarks and for
<col>82</col>
their understanding reticence, and I hope that the noble Lord opposite will not think me discourteous if I do not answer his points one by one because that might lead into a detailed discussion of the proposals which I think at the moment would be more suitably carried out at Lancaster House than across the Floor of the House.<lb/>
Perhaps I may make one brief comment which I think applies to all his observations. I am quite sure that these interim arrangements must be simple and the time must be short. I think the time has to be short because I believe that any cease-fire is bound to be precarious, and the uncertainty which will exist during the interim period should be as short as possible and independence should be brought about as quickly as possible, provided, as the noble Lord has said, that there is a fair opportunity for everybody to put their case.<lb/>
With regard to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, what has been agreed is that after independence the British Government will be prepared to contribute to proposals for the resettling and development of agricultural land in Rhodesia, and the American Government have said very much the same. At the present time in Rhodesia there is a good deal of land which is under-utilised, and that is the sort of land which we have in mind at the present time. I very much hope that in the context of an agreement there will not be any European settlers who will wish to leave Rhodesia, because they have an enormous part to play in the future of that country; so I hope that on their part there will be no wish to go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00496">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00497"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary agree that it makes his task and the task of those negotiating at Lancaster House so much more difficult when a fellow Commonwealth country, namely Zambia, which is playing an important part behind the scenes in these negotiations, is invaded from without and its lifeline to Tanzania on the Tanzan railway is cut?<lb/>
On the question of the Lancaster House conference itself, would the noble Lord agree that our experience in the past in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0050"/>
<col>83</col>
creating new independence constitutions has been greatly helped if the contending parties within that colony are associated in the administration and the responsibility, particularly for the armed forces, during the interim period before the elections, and that this is essential if not only are fair elections to be held but are also to be seen to be held?<lb/>
Finally, on the question of the length of this interim period, I am afraid I fail to follow the noble Lord's reasoning. If there is a danger that the cease-fire, which we all hope and pray for, may break down during two months, then what is going to happen after the elections have been held? Surely, it is important to trust that the cease-fire will hold, and, as my noble friend Lord Goronwy-Roberts has pointed out, if fair elections are to be held it is essential that a full period is allowed for those parties which have not yet been able to organise politically to take a full part in those elections.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00498"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the objective of the British Government at the Lancaster House conference is to end the war, and that is what we are seeking to do. Unfortunately, since my appeal for a cease-fire was not accepted by the Patriotic Front although it was accepted by Bishop Muzorewa, one is likely to get this sort of action, however regrettable that may be, until such time as we can get a cease-fire.<lb/>
With regard to the noble Lord's second question, I think it must be the responsibility of the British Government during the interim period to see the administration of the country under a governor. Concerning the noble Lord's third point I think he is underestimating the difficulties of a cease-fire and not appreciating sufficiently the need to get a quick solution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00499"><member>Lord BARNBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I understood him correctly, I think the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary referred to arrangements with regard to the transfer of ownership of land. Can he give an assurance that equal consideration will be given to the question of pensions to those legally entitled to them in Rhodesia? Secondly, as he referred to a period during which, apparently, the direction of affairs is to lie with Britain, is it to be understood that the present
<col>84</col>
Prime Minister, and all the normal functions of State carried out by Government departments under his direction, will continue in the same way?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00500"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the question of pensions, that point is in the constitution and is guaranteed. As to the noble Lord's second question, I think these are matters for discussion at Lancaster House, and I would not care to elaborate on them at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00501">3.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00502"><member>Lord MISHCON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House will agree that the less said on this occasion the better. But having said that and wanting to join from this Bench in the tributes paid to the Foreign Secretary, would he in turn care to join in a tribute to my noble friend Lord Goronwy-Roberts, who, from the same Dispatch Box as the Foreign Secretary has been speaking, advocated time and time again patience in order to see whether the Patriotic Front could he brought to the conference table, despite the fact that from many places in this House he was told that that was impossible?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00503"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am never slow or loath to join in congratulating and admiring the noble Lord opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00504"><member>Lord MAELOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I, as a member of the Opposition Party in this House, very much anti-Tory, be privileged to congratulate heartily the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, on the manner in which he has chaired the conference at Lancaster House? If it succeeds I believe it will be entirely due to his wonderful chairmanship. If it fails it will not be his fault. I sincerely congratulate him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00505"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a very nice tribute. I think the noble Lord had better wait to see how it all turns out. I only wish his appreciation of my chairmanship was shared by all the participants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00506"><member>The Earl of LAUDERDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord clarify one thing he said? He mentioned that this operation is based on the great progress
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0051"/>
<col>85</col>
made internally following the elections in the spring, observed, of course, by the noble Viscount, Lord Boyd, and others. He said just now that the Muzorewa Government had said that they are willing to accept a cease-fire. Are we to understand that it is proposed that the Muzorewa Government remain in office until the new constitution takes effect, or is it proposed that they should stand down?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00507"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I answered that question when my noble friend Lord Barnby asked it. I said that these obviously are matters for discussion; the exact way one does these things is a matter for discussion at Lancaster House. I do not think that at this particular moment your Lordships' House is the right place to discuss these matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00508"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the day after the cease-fire is announced the newly appointed governor will face a daunting task, and unless he is backed up by an efficient staff, which I would suggest involves a major staffing operation which could not be improvised overnight, then in fact he will be governor only in name; the effective power will be lying somewhere many miles away. Would the Foreign Secretary be good enough to tell us whether at the moment this problem of how the governor is going to exercise his authority in both the civil and military field is being dealt with? Is the noble Lord collaborating with the great fund of goodwill which exists not only in the Commonwealth but throughout the whole civilised world to see how that can be harnessed to ensure that the new governor, whoever he happens to be, goes out there with an effective staff so that he can do the job, and it is not just a face-saving operation in which he will be governor only in name?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00509"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is, of course, quite right. The governor must have a staff when he goes out, and these matters are under consideration at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00510"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Foreign Secretary whether it will be convenient for him to place a copy of the constitutional proposals in the Library? And may I, having myself
<col>86</col>
endeavoured the task of constitution-making in this field, congratulate him on his enormous achievement in achieving agreement about the constitution? British Governments over the years have produced scores of constitutions. None has been more difficult of accomplishment than this one, and I think he has achieved a great success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00511"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. Of course I will have a copy put in the Library. I only hope that it stands up to the noble Lord's birthday gaze.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00512"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course, as my noble friend Lord Carrington has said, we all know that the conference is still proceeding. Perhaps it would be better if the House now passed on to other business.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE FAMILY AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00513">3.24 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00514"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member> rose to call attention to the serious effects of the policies of Her Majesty's Government on the family; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I do not feel that it is incumbent on me to apologise to your Lordships for introducting yet another debate in your Lordships' House on the family. We had the first one on the 16th June, 1976, when the Primate of All England, the Archbishop of Canter bury, introduced a debate on the family in Britain today. I feel I must express some kind of surprise, and I direct it indirectly to my noble friend the Bishop of Chelmsford because we are old friends of many years standing. I do find it surprising that there is no one from the Bishops' Bench participating in this debate today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00515">During the debate initiated by the Archbishop of Canterbury the then chair-man of the Church of England Board for Social Responsibility, a Member of your Lordships' House, spoke and spoke well. I believe the present chairman of the Church of England Board for Social Responsibility is also a Member of your Lordships' House. I would hate to think that the established Church of this country is so much in support of the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0052"/>
<col>87</col>
party in this country that has always been regarded as the establishment that it is afraid to come here this afternoon and make any comments which may be adverse ones.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00516">There was another debate initiated last year by my noble friend Lady Phillips and on that occasion there was a discussion on the family. As I say, I make no apology, in view of what happened recently, that we should have another one today. We base the justification for it on the policies and the declared intentions of the Government and the effect of these policies on the family. It seems appropriate to us on this side of the House that we should have yet another debate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00517">In Opposition the Tories made much of the family. The speeches of the present Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer frequently drew attention to the needs of the family. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, took part in the debate on the family introduced by my noble friend Lady Phillips on 2nd May last year. It is true that I have not given the noble Baroness notice that I was going to quote, but she will not find anything objectionable in what I am going to say. In fact I am calling her in aid, so to speak. She said this:
<quote>"I speak on behalf of a party that believes in the importance of the family &#x2026;".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report;</i> 2/5/78, col. 22.]</quote>
She went on to say:
<quote>"There is no real substitute for the family &#x2026; The country needs the family and cannot afford the cost of doing without it".&#x2014;[col. 23.]</quote>
We completely agree. Our submission is that the policy of the present Government will impose even greater hardships on the family.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00518">What is more, we are worried, and I say this very sincerely, about the direction in which the Conservative Party is going. Over the years, certainly since the war, there seems to have been a perceptible change in the attitude of the Conservative Party to the needs of those less fortunately placed in the community. I am sorry that some of the former Prime Ministers, or at least one, is not here today. I think it is true to say&#x2014;and I have reason to believe that a number of your Lord-ships will agree; certainly a number of Conservatives I know would agree&#x2014;that the present Prime Minister is, without
<col>88</col>
doubt, the most Right-Wing Tory Prime Minister that this country has known since the war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00519">It seems to us that she is bent on reviving what many thought had disappeared from our society a long time ago&#x2014;a Tory philosophy which even a good many Tories were unable to accept&#x2014;a philosophy that says: To him that hath it shall be given and to him that hath not it shall be taken away. We regret that. I am sure that there are noble Lords opposite listening to me who also regret some of the intended cuts that are being considered and that are, in fact, being undertaken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00520">As I have said, my only reason for making the comments that I have just made is that many of us regret that there has been a move not just to the Right but, as many of us think, to the extreme Right. If that kind of thing goes on in the next year or two we may have difficulties and disorders in this country which will be difficult to deal with. The Government are committed to cuts regardless of their effect on the family and that is the matter which concerns us. However, having said that, may I make it perfectly clear that we are not unmindful of the seriousness of the financial situation in which this country finds itself. But I am convinced, as my friends on this side of the House are convinced, as well as others in your Lordships' House, that the measures which this Government are taking to deal with the situation are measures which will have and are having a very serious effect on the family.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00521">It is no use paying lip service to the family, describing the family as the backbone of our society and then dealing with it in the way in which this Government are proposing. We are appalled to find that public expenditure is being cut to help pay for massive tax cuts which overwhelmingly benefit richer taxpayers. For a vast number of families tax cuts mean real reductions in their standard of living. Soon after the present Government came into office I drew attention to the fact that, as a result of their first Budget, the Government reduced taxation by about &#x00A3;4,500 million, with the poorest 10 per cent. of taxpayers in this country getting 2 per cent. of the tax reductions and the richest 7 per cent. receiving no less than 34 per cent. of the tax reductions.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0053"/>
<col>89</col>
Is that the way to level up what is happening at present? In view of what I have said, if the noble Baroness has a note to say that it is the way, I hope that she will cross it out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00522">A glance at the gains and losses from the Budget show that a person earning &#x00A3;60 a week gained from the income tax reduction &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;10 a week and lost from increases in indirect taxation &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;60&#x2014; in other words, a net loss of 50p. Similarly, a man earning &#x00A3;100 a week gained &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;23 from the reduction in income tax and lost &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;75 from indirect taxation&#x2014; a net loss of 52p. So much for the so-called benefit to the average worker from the Tory Budget.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00523">Of the &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;5 billion, practically nothing went to families with children. Prior to the election the Tory Party promised to increase child benefit&#x2014;a promise which has never been fulfilled. It would have been particularly appropriate to do so in the International Year of the Child, and at a time when inflation is twice the rate now of what it was a year ago. As the Government do not propose to increase child benefit this November, will they do so next April, or will they decline to do so until November 1980? It is with great respect that I ask the noble Baroness whether she will give a definite answer one way or the other: Will it be increased next April, or will it be increased in November 1980 or not at all?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00524">In the last few days your Lordships will be aware that there has been a good deal of discussion both in the Press and on television about the poor of this country. Professor Peter Townsend's book gives an account of the degree and the number who were living in poverty in 1977&#x2014;let me hasten to concede, when there was a Labour Government. We have had a report recently covering the same period by the Low Pay Unit. Some of your Lordships may have seen on Monday night on "Panorama" an account of the situation. That situation existed in 1977, but it is undeniably true that the position has now become worse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00525">It is estimated that there are nearly 4 million families, involving over 6 million children, living in poverty&#x2014;the yardstick being the Supplementary Benefits Commission rate. If anyone knows anything about the Supplementary Benefits Commission
<col>90</col>
rate he will realise that they are living in poverty. I do not want to go into a lot of statistics, because I sometimes find them rather bewildering and they need a long time to explain. But I was surprised to learn on "Panorama" on Monday night that about one-third of the electorate refused to believe that in this country there were people living in poverty. But then, of course, I realised that one-third of the electorate had voted Conservative at the last election, so it must be that particular third.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00526">The Supplementary Benefits Commission told the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth that the scheme provided particularly for families with children and incomes that are barely adequate to meet the needs of the family. The present Conservative Government's policy, with its high prices and VAT, proposes cuts of about &#x00A3;200 million from school meals, milk and transport. It clearly indicates that we can only expect a substantial increase in the number of poor in the coming year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00527">I shall concern myself with the effect of the cuts on the National Health Service and on the social services. Behind me there are a number of my colleagues who will talk to your Lordships about the effect of cuts in different areas. The impact of the cuts in the two areas that I mentioned&#x2014;the National Health Service and the personal social services; areas which affect and touch the lives of millions of people&#x2014;are of supreme importance because such cuts fall upon the services of the handicapped, the old, the young and those who find it extremely difficult to cope, especially old people living on their own. They are to be sacrificed&#x2014;let us make no mistake about it, and do not let us be afraid to use the right kind of words&#x2014;in a most disgraceful way in return for what the Government think will be a "better tomorrow". They will be dead by then.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00528">There will be cuts in both domiciliary and residential care. There is no doubt whatsoever that such cuts will particularly affect families, and women looking after handicapped children and elderly relatives will experience a reduction in the services of support which such people get from the local authority social services. There will be the silent sufferers who will not make the headlines but whose lives will
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0054"/>
<col>91</col>
be greatly affected by cutbacks in the provision of social services. Intermediate treatment schemes&#x2014;and I am glad that the Home Secretary is so concerned with the behaviour of young people&#x2014;which deal with many of our difficult youngsters, anti-social young persons, will also be affected; whatever the present Home Secretary proposes to do will be affected by the lack of money that will be available to deal with them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00529">There are 116 social services authorities in England and Wales and we have some information&#x2014;but it is by no means complete&#x2014;as to what will happen in about half of them. Some of us have been at some pains to find out. The pattern of cuts established by those authorities will no doubt be followed by the remaining 50 per cent. Valuable staff, already outstretched and overstretched, dealing with people who have complex and difficult problems, will be axed or not replaced when vacancies arise. Training programmes for social workers will be seriously affected when there is a need for trained people. The noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, herself a very distinguished director of social services in what was then a progressive county, knows only too well&#x2014;and I do not make political points here&#x2014;that it was of supreme importance if a social worker was really to be of help to a person, for that social worker to be adequately trained and to know what she was doing. It means that there will be fewer trained social workers. Some community homes, assessment centres and residential nursing homes will be closed, and some day-care facilities for pre-school children will also be closed. Fostering and adoption will be slowed down and reductions in social work service will have serious implications, not only for children, but for families. I want to assure your Lordships that that is so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00530">If I had the time I would spell out in detail the ways in which this will be done. Some authorities are proposing to close homes for the elderly; some are even saving money on fire precautions. A number of local authorities propose to dispense with firemen. In 1975 there were 3,400 fires in England and Wales as a result of which 740 people died; in 1976 there were 4,441 fires, with a loss of life
<col>92</col>
of 732 and in 1977 there were 2,710 fires with a loss of 695 lives. That is the sort of thing that is likely to happen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00531">I say to your Lordships that we shall pay a very heavy price for these cuts. Some local authorities even propose to save on night-sitting services for the elderly. These services are vital because of the high rate of accidents among elderly people during the night, In other areas they propose to reduce such services. Local authorities hope that voluntary organisations will step in and assume responsibility for some of the services which they can no longer undertake. But from where are they to get the money?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00532">Voluntary societies, organisations and workers have made a supreme contribution in the field of social services for many, many years. I believe that it was Wolfenden who said that there were 5 million voluntary social workers in this country. But they must have some money in order to carry on. Yet local authorities are cutting their grants to voluntary organisations. Therefore, it is no good us saying that the voluntary sector will take over; it will be unable to afford to. Local authorities are being forced by the Government to embark upon a policy of quick savings without considering the long-term effect on the family and the most vulnerable. It is a recipe for chaos, confusion and disaster. If any of your Lordships are in doubt about this, I recommend you to read the report of the Personal Social Services Council and the report of the Association of Directors of Social Services. It is a horror story and it cannot be described in any other way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00533">In the National Health Service the cuts will mean longer waiting lists, longer travelling time for out-patients and for visitors to in-patients, and in some areas more travelling for consultants. I well remember, when I was Under-Secretary, sitting where the noble Baroness, Lady Young, now sits, the amount of criticism that I received from your Lordships when we spoke about the difficulty of reducing waiting lists and the difficulties relating to the National Health Service. We now find ourselves in circumstances in which the position will become much worse. I understand that there is even some suggestion that in order to raise money
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0055"/>
<col>93</col>
hospitals will in future have to look for support from local people running, perhaps, bingo, raffles and that sort of thing. I do not know whether or not that is part of the policy of the present Secretary of State, but I seem to remember him saying that there is no reason why they should not do these things. I wonder whether a result of the cuts will mean that there will be hotel charges for in-patients.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00534">I want to conclude by asking the noble Baroness a number of questions of which I have given her notice, because it would not have been fair to have done otherwise. Your Lordships like answers to questions and sometimes, unless prior notice is given, it is not possible to answer questions. A short time ago some of your Lordships may have read in one of our national newspapers an article drawing attention to a document which had been leaked to that paper from the DHSS. I accept that as being true because I have no reason to believe it to be untrue. However, if it is not true, the noble Baroness will say so. That leaked document in relation to the future said that there would be no right to sick pay for six days; that there would be the abolition of the maternity grant and the abolition to the death grant; and that the retirement pension age for women would he raised from 60 to 65; that there would be the abolition of the earnings-related unemployment and sickness benefit. And it contained, so I read, these words:
<quote>"Besides reducing the upratings to prices only"&#x2014;</quote>
we did it on wages, which were higher than prices&#x2014;
<quote>"it is necessary to have no uprating at all until November 1983, by which time the real value of the retirement pension will have been cut by over &#x00A3;4".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00535">I do not raise these matters lightly. I did not introduce this Motion simply because I wanted to have a go at the Conservative Government. We shall all on this side have plenty of opportunities for doing that in the months to come. I did it because I am hoping that the more responsible members of the Conservative Party&#x2014;and at their last annual conference do not forget that the slogan was "Realism and Responsibility"&#x2014;will do something behind the scenes about what I and my colleagues on this side of the House believe is a very serious matter. If they do not, we shall remember the
<col>94</col>
promises that they made before the election; and there is a great danger of the Conservative Party becoming the "con" party. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00536">3.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00537"><member>Lord BANKS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, has given us an early opportunity to debate the effect of the Government's policies on the family. I am certainly grateful to him for that, and grateful to him for giving us the opportunity of listening to the three maiden speakers, to whose contributions we look forward later this afternoon. It must have been a pleasant change for the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, to make the kind of speech which he made this afternoon, instead of standing at the Box on the other side of the House and telling us, with equal passion, why there was no money to carry out the various reforms which were being pressed upon him by Members of your Lordships' House. Nevertheless, I agreed with a great deal that he said, and certainly I share his concern about the course now being pursued by the Government and the effect it will have on families.<lb/>
In fairness, I think it ought to be stressed that the financial position of families with children as compared with others has been deteriorating under Governments of Conservative and Labour complexion. This has been going on for some time. In terms of both the amount of tax-free income enjoyed by different household groups and the proportion of income paid in income tax and insurance contributions, families with children have lost out. The statistics under both these headings for a comparison between, for example, 1963&#x2013;64 and fourteen years later, 1978&#x2013;79, bring this fact out clearly. Here we are considering the position before the change of Government.<lb/>
I shall not weary the House with a string of figures but here is one of those statistics. The percentage of income paid in income tax and National Insurance contributions in 1978&#x2013;79 by a single person on average earnings was 54 per cent. higher than fourteen years earlier in 1964&#x2013;65. But for a married couple with two children the figure is 144 per cent.; so 54 per cent. more for the single person, and 144 per cent. more for the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0056"/>
<col>95</col>
married couple with two children. That is an indication of how the relative position has worsened.<lb/>
The disparity, of course, is most pronounced among the lower income sections. For those below average earnings the disparity is greater than the one I have just indicated. One cause of this was the failure to increase family allowance sufficiently over the years. Of course child benefit introduced by the last Government has replaced family allowance and child income tax allowances and we on these Benches have warmly welcomed that development. But it means that when personal allowances are increased nowadays there is no increase for children unless child benefit is increased at the same time. The present Secretary of State for Social Services, Mr. Patrick Jenkin, when in opposition, spoke in a Press notice about the Conservative Party's commitment to treat increases in child benefit in the same way as reductions in direct taxation. He went on to say:
<quote>"&#x2026; the next Conservative Government, which is pledged to major reductions in direct taxation, would regard improvements in child benefits, which are replacing child tax allowances, as part of this process".</quote>
In other words, an increase in child benefit was an essential part of the process of the reduction of taxes.<lb/>
Now the Government have reduced direct taxation but they have failed to increase child benefit, as indeed the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, pointed out. Therefore, the relative position of families with children has suffered again. Yet an increase in child benefit should be part of the process, as Mr. Patrick Jenkin himself explained. An increase in child benefit would help redress the imbalance between families with children and others to which I have referred because it would help all families with children, and it would help the poorest most significantly. It would help one-parent families. I welcome the 50p increase in the addition which is given for the first child of one-parent families, but a 50p increase in child benefit would help them even more because it would apply to all the children. Incidentally, perhaps I might say that I welcome the shorter waiting time for long-term supplementary benefit which is now to apply to one-parent families.<lb/>
<col>96</col>
Turning to an increase in child benefit, that would help to move families off supplementary benefit, and if it was increased sufficiently would get rid of the position where a small number of people on benefit can receive more money when they are on benefit than when they are in work. So it would help to deal with that problem, although it is a limited problem. The Government have argued that child benefit was raised in April and cannot therefore be raised six months later. But that last rise in the child benefit coincided with the final elimination of child tax allowances, and the result, taking into account the increase of &#x00A3;1 but also taking into account the loss of the remaining child tax allowance, meant an increase of 37p for a child under 11, 14p for a child in the age range 12 to 16, and a loss in fact of 5p for a child over 16. Therefore, I do not think we can say that that was sufficient to rule out the need for an increase now in November.<lb/>
I certainly join with the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, in asking whether it is the intention of the Government to wait 18 months before there is an increase in child benefit, when the child benefit may well be eroded by 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. I think there is an overwhelming case for an increase in child benefit now. Of course, tax reductions will help families along with others, but not proportionately, as we have seen. We on these Benches have advocated a reduction in direct taxation and a transfer of part of the burden to indirect taxation, but we would have linked it with a redistributive tax credit scheme and we regret the fact that the Government, for the moment at any rate, have abandoned any intention of proceeding along that road.<lb/>
The gains in tax will inevitably&#x2014;it is part of the exercise&#x2014;be partly taken up by the increase in indirect taxation. When one takes into account as well inflation at up to 20 per cent., which we understand may be the case in the not too distant future, the probable increase in mortgage interest&#x2014;and one in five of those on average earnings has a mortgage&#x2014;the probable increase in rates through the double impact of expenditure cuts and cash limits, many families will have nothing left and many, I have no doubt, will be worse off. The poorest families of course are the most affected by the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0057"/>
<col>97</col>
failure to raise child benefits; they are the worst hit by rising prices and it is estimated that the cost of living for the poorest is about 5 per cent. ahead of the cost of living for the average family because the essentials they require have gone up in price at a greater rate.<lb/>
Lord Wells-Pestell referred to the leak as to what matters were being discussed in the Department of Health and Social Security and he mentioned some of the items that had been suggested, such as an increase in waiting days, the abolition of the maternity grant, the abolition of, the earnings-related sickness and employment benefit and the abolition of the death grant. Like him, I do not know whether the Government have any intention of adopting any of those things and I shall listen with great interest to the answer which the noble Baroness gives to the questions he put.<lb/>
I wish to comment briefly on the problem of heating costs in winter. This is important to families and we must think carefully about the new scheme which the Government have introduced and announced on Monday of this week. The electricity discount scheme is to be withdrawn. It was not ideal and it was limited to one fuel, but it helped 3 million people at a cost of some &#x00A3;45 million a year, whereas the new proposal will help 345,000 people at a cost of &#x00A3;16&#x00BD; million a year. Thus, the new proposal will help fewer people although it will help them more substantially, as I understand it, in that the amount paid out per head will be greater.<lb/>
But many of those who will be eligible for it will already have been receiving, through supplementary benefit, this particular benefit, and others could have received it had they chosen to apply for it. It seems to contain certain anomalies. As far as I can see&#x2014;I may be wrong and no doubt the noble Baroness will correct me&#x2014;somebody on family income supplement with children over five gets automatic help whereas somebody on supplementary benefit with children over five does not get automatic help. I wonder if that is right. It seems to be a trifle anomalous.<lb/>
If the Government had advanced on the lines that they are now embarking on but on the same scale as they did with the electricity discount scheme, with a figure
<col>98</col>
of perhaps three to four times what they have in mind and with a rather wider range of potential beneficiaries so that they were not going to leave people, as they are now, in the range 65 to 75 without any automatic assistance, then this might have been the first step towards the comprehensive fuel benefit which has been advocated by the Supplementary Benefit Commission. But my first impression is that it falls well short of that.<lb/>
Finally, I come to the cuts in the personal social services, to which Lord Wells-Pestell referred. They will undoubtedly affect families. He spoke about the plans of the 116 local authorities and there is no doubt that services already inadequate in many cases will be further reduced. Services where the targets set by the previous Government were not being achieved will be further reduced. There will be less nursery provision for children under five, less day centres for elderly people, less short-stay homes for the elderly, fewer meals on wheels and fewer home helps. Although I heard it said only last weekend in regard to the London borough in which I live that if all the social workers were to call on every name on their lists it would take them three years to do so, there is to be less man-power available and less training, although there is a shortage of trained people in these services, particularly in residential care. If we accept that there had to be public expenditure cuts on the present scale&#x2014;and I question that&#x2014;then surely we should ask whether it is right to insist that the cuts must apply to all services so that children, the elderly, the disabled and the sick have to take a share. Where provision for those categories was inadequate before, surely that provision should not be further cut.<lb/>
When we discussed the family in your Lordships' House on 2nd May 1978, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, supported the idea of a family impact statement attached to every Government proposal. So many different aspects of Government activity bear on the family. There are the school meals cuts, school transport cuts, education cuts and possibly immigration policy: we on these Benches hope that the proposals in that respect will not destroy the unity of the family by separating husbands and wives, parents and children, contrary to our international obligations. I suppose that this debate
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0058"/>
<col>99</col>
is in itself a family impact statement on the Government's policy so far, a family impact statement which we are all helping to draw up. It is clear to me that the impact on the family of these policies will in many spheres be both detrimental and depressing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00539"><member>Lord BROOKS of TREMORFA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a short while ago I was handed a telegram which had been sent to me by my colleagues on the South Glamorgan County Council. It says, "Good luck with your maiden."I am not sure whether they misunderstand what happens in your Lordships' House, but when I return to South Glamorgan I shall tell them that the exercise was carried out briefly and non-controversially, and I am sure that any illusions they may have will be wiped away.<lb/>
Although I shall not principally refer to Wales, in the Principality, together with a few other areas of the United Kingdom, there has historically been a rather stronger sense of family and community life, largely because of the nature of the industries which employed us. Steel and coal were not simply industries; they were an extension of the family. Indeed, the families lived around the pits and still do in all too few cases. They lived around the steelworks, and in the very area where I live in Cardiff we have just seen the closure of a major steelworks, the major employer in the area, one which employed generation after generation of workers, but those jobs are no longer available to them. I have seen at first-hand what this technological change has meant to the families in my area.<lb/>
There have, particularly since the war, been tremendous social changes which have had an enormous effect on the family. Indeed, if this debate were taking place in the 'thirties it would be of a quite different nature. As one who was brought up in the 'thirties in a working-class household, looking back on it I can see that the only way we survived was because of the love and care of a close family life. Social changes are having perhaps an even greater effect on family life than the rapid change in technology. If I refer only to the changing role of women in society&#x2014;I make no judgment on it&#x2014;I say simply
<col>100</col>
that if more and more women intend to play a role different from that traditionally played, it will of course have a tremendous effect on family life. I would recommend to the Government that they look at the comments in the recent TUC pamphlet on children in our society, in which it is recommended that an allowance should be paid to women who are prepared to stay at home to look after their children.<lb/>
I am a member of a major local authority, and for some years immediately after reorganisation I was fortunate enough to lead that authority. Local government reorganisation occurred at the worst possible moment for local government. Inflation was just about taking, off. In my view&#x2014;and here I shall be controversial&#x2014;local government reorganisation itself was absolutely stupid, and it should be looked at again very closely. Despite those factors, we were forced to make cuts, and I believe that they were made without eating into the fabric of the services that we had to provide. I can tell your Lordships that, although my local authority is at the moment Conservative controlled, many of its members were sick at the thought of the exercise they had to carry out. They are even more worried about the reports they constantly read in the Press as to what is in store for them, not only this year but next year as well.<lb/>
Whether we like it or not, my Lords, the responsibility for the maintenance of much of our family life now lies with statutory bodies. There has been very little controversy over this matter between the parties since the war; we have all agreed. There has been a consensus which, by and large, has worked to preserve much of the fabric of family life. But I am bound to say that if the reports that we read in the Press are true&#x2014;that the Government intend to pursue some of the more draconian proposals&#x2014;the effect on family life will be very severe indeed.<lb/>
Recently, the Dr. Barnardo's organisation issued a report which is very worrying&#x2014;it should be worrying for all of us&#x2014;and here I shall finish my speech. Following that report, the <i>Daily Mirror</i> wrote a very short leader, headed "A Question of Care". This is what it said:

I must confess that I do not even know him, but I think that his speech was absolutely first class, and I agreed with every single word of it. I should also like to congratulate my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell on his speech, with which I completely agreed. I shall not repeat all the facts that he gave, but I reserve one right&#x2014;the right to "knock" the Conservative Government as many times as I wish on serious issues. My noble friend was very polite about not wishing to "knock" the Conservative Government, but that is not going to stop me. I also wish to congratulate my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell for bringing forward this very important issue so early after the Recess: this question is absolutely crucial to everything that we shall have to do during the next few years.<lb/>
My Lords, "the family" has become an emotive term. If the Labour Party presents itself as the guardian of the family, Conservatives have always presented themselves as the guardian angels of the family. Neither of the two largest political parties has done enough in the past 30 years to improve the lot of the family. The measures proposed by the Conservative Government, despite their sanctimonious talk about the family, after examination by organisations and experts, supported by facts and figures, point to an assault today on the living standards of the family. How can we otherwise explain the introduction by the Conservative Government&#x2014;since coming into office with a large majority&#x2014;of
<col>102</col>
measures for the family. Despite the tub-thumping slogans about income tax cuts, initiatives, and incentives, and despite all the hue and cry, there have followed in the Press and on the air discussions, backed by facts and figures, on poverty, poverty, and poverty again. Such things are inevitable following the Chancellor's Budget.<lb/>
If the Government believe both in the family and in the power of incentives to bring about economic prosperity, they should be raising child benefits, as the noble Lord, Lord Banks, said, and I agreed with him 100 per cent. The Prime Minister is a mother with a job, and she should be aware that there are other women who would enjoy being mothers and having jobs, too. Generous child benefits might give poorer mothers a real choice of whether or not to work and this might result in some of them choosing to stay at home and simply be good mothers. But as has already been said by my noble friend Lord Wells Pestell, in Sir Geoffrey Howe's Budget the poorest 10 per cent. of taxpayers picked up only 2 per cent. of the tax cuts. The richest 7 per cent. cornered 34 per cent. of the total. I am sorry that I repeated that figure, but I think it was worth repeating. The only concession to the family was a 50p increase in child benefits, but half the total number of poor gain nothing&#x2014;of course they qualify for supplementary benefits&#x2014;as the 50p is automatically docked. In answer to this there is the argument that a mother's place is in the home. Yes, it may be&#x2014;but only if she can afford to stay at home.<lb/>
But the most scandalous indictment of the Government, as pointed out in <i>New Society,</i> is as follows. If families had obtained their share of the tax cuts, child benefits would have amounted to about &#x00A3;8 per week over the past years. But now that the child tax allowances have been phased out, child benefits have taken on the role of maintaining equity between taxpayers with different needs and responsibilities. If child benefits are not raised we shall slip back into a situation in which, as in the past, the tax system continues to be effectively biased against families with children and favours the childless taxpayers. There is an over riding need to help families with children through the tax system as well as through
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0060"/>
<col>103</col>
social benefits. There could not be a stronger argument for a policy which favours taxpayers with children and at least maintains equity between them and taxpayers without children.<lb/>
There is another argument. Child benefits are tax-free; thus, they increase the difference in income between those who work and earn their incomes and those who live on social benefits, from whose incomes the value of the child benefits is deducted. Thus, child benefits provide an incentive to work, and increase the incomes of those who work well above those of people on supplementary and unemployment benefits. Surely, my Lords, child benefits are therefore in accord with the philosophy of this Tory Government, who put so much stress on the value of incentives in restoring the economy.<lb/>
My Lords, child benefits are a simple means of recognising and calculating the extra costs of children within a family; so, by helping families with future generations of children we are helping future families, which is a top priority today. Finally, if this Government re main blind to the arguments expressed by all those specially concerned with specific measures to deal with poverty, I wonder how future families with children will regard this indifference, perpetuating the inequality in taxation measures between childless families and those with children.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00543"><member>Lord UNDERHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when considering this privilege of addressing your Lordships' House for the first time I had to face the problem of how, after 49 years' active work politically, I was to make a non-controversial speech on a highly critical political subject; and I should like your Lordships to accept that it is not my intention to be controversial but that I am endeavouring to give a factual account of this subject from deeply-held views. We will all agree that millions of families depend upon the services provided by public spending for an effective standard of life; and, as my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell has made quite clear, we cannot deal with this debate without considering the cuts in public services which seem to be intended or proposed. Life is to be made much harder
<col>104</col>
for millions of families by cuts that will affect children, the elderly, the handicapped and the sick; and, as my noble friend has made quite clear, the Government have emphasised absolutely clearly that the justification for these cuts is that they are necessary in order to pay for reductions in income tax. For myself, I cannot accept that there should be hardship to families in order to provide tax cuts for the better off. I must say that the Government are doing this, it seems to me, without any aspect of social policy, indiscriminately, just across the board, and I hope we shall get some explanation as to why.<lb/>
Local councils throughout the country are being compelled to decide between alternative services. Those of your Lord ships who have had the opportunity to listen to BBC radio during the last few days will have heard their excellent accounts of the problems which are facing local councils&#x2014;problems which I would suggest councils should not be asked to face. My noble friend has referred to the Government's intention to relieve local councils of the responsibilities for providing certain services&#x2014;school meals, free milk, free transport. It is not my purpose to reiterate what has already been said, but perhaps I may say some thing on school meals. Until 12 months ago my wife had worked for 17 years as a part-timer in a school canteen, and she has told me repeatedly of the benefits that children have gained from having a hot mid-day meal. Regrettably, there are a number of children who leave home for school in the morning without an adequate breakfast&#x2014;and now we are told that they can manage with a sandwich mid-day. Or are mothers who go to work going to have to sacrifice that, so bringing further burdens on to their families, in order to look after their children?<lb/>
Education cuts are facing local education authorities up and down the country, and I picture the problem of those who serve on local councils as to what they should do in order to carry out the Government's demands. Should they cut nursery schools, nursery classes, bearing in mind that there will be mothers who would then find it difficult to go to work in order to assist with the family budget, as they must because of the low incomes of their husbands; or that, alternatively,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0061"/>
<col>105</col>
there will be the problem of the single parent? Are we to risk going back to women being driven more and more into the hands of unscrupulous child-minders because they cannot pay an excessive charge for nursery accommodation? Local councils have to determine between that and the development of remedial teaching; between that and cuts in school equipment and in school books, the standards of which were already too low even before these cuts were talked about. They have to determine between those cuts, or whether to reduce the number of teachers, and noble Lords will have read, as I have, of decisions already taken by local authorities to dismiss or reduce the number of teachers.<lb/>
My Lords, it is a very controversial point, but I must say that it makes for a cynical attitude when authorities which have to decide on those cuts know at the same time that it is the Government's announced intention to provide &#x00A3;70 million to enable selected children to have places in independent schools. That seems to me, frankly, to show a gross cycnicism in relation to what are our priorities. Then, my noble friend has dealt with the problems which councils face in other directions. Are they to scrap, curtail or increase the charges for home-helps; are they to scrap, curtail or increase the charges for meals-on-wheels; are they to close old people's homes; are they to close children's homes'? The problems that councils are being forced to face are, as I have said already, problems which I do not believe they should be called upon to face.<lb/>
My Lords, I should like to refer to just two other things, one of which has not been mentioned in this debate at all so far. That concerns the millions of families which are affected by unemployment and low pay&#x2014;and time permits me to make only a passing reference to them. Obviously, we cannot blame the Conservative Government for the position with regard to low pay and for the figure of unemployed at the present time; but for doctrinaire reasons the Conservative Government are refusing to intervene, placing reliance on market forces.<lb/>
I should like to refer to one problem which faces us in two areas; and this is common to a number of other areas. I know Corby and Shotton, particularly
<col>106</col>
Shotton, very well. One has to realise that 6,000 families in each place are going to be affected by unemployment just through the use of the easy word"redun dancy"&#x2014;which means poverty and tragedy for that number of families. One cannot criticise the Government at this stage for the position in the steel industry, but one can criticise them if they have no intention of intervening, because in those areas there is no alternative employment whatever, and only Government intervention will ensure that that is provided.<lb/>
My last point is this. I have now been retired for three months. This has given me the opportunity of shopping&#x2014;something which I have not done for a long time because I have been too busy. I have been appalled by the price rises every time I visit the shops, appalled by the price rises for commodities which are needed for everyday living&#x2014;rises caused by Government action on VAT. I am appalled by the price rises which I see every time I go into a shop; and now there is no opportunity at all for any protection. In just these brief points, I think there is enough to show that the position of families is being worsened, and is likely to be worsened, by Government action and decisions having to be taken by councils and health authorities which they should not be called upon to take.</membercontribution></p>

I know that he has been a Labour Party agent since 1972, and everyone in the House knows how much Members in both Houses of Parliament owe to their agents. I think that I am perhaps the wrong person to offer these congratulations because I know that the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, worked with the late Morgan Phillips and I am sure that for that reason the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, would have wished to offer the congratulations which I do now. I only hope that the noble Lord will not be so busy shopping that he will not be able to be here for we need to hear him more in this House.<lb/>
I should like also to pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Brooks of Tremorfa. I am delighted that he mentioned Dr. Barnado's. Being a member of Dr.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0062"/>
<col>107</col>
Barnado's council, I am glad that lie reads so much about them. I think I should thank the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, for the comments he made about me, although he may not make the same comments at the end of the debate because there are many matters on which I would take issue with him. But we are grateful to him for initiating this timely debate.<lb/>
When there is a change of direction in the administration&#x2014; and I underline"administration"&#x2014;of welfare policies necessarily there are bound to be read-justments which can be disturbing, uncomfortable and worrying; but what is important is that the changes are ultimately in the right direction even if, on a short-term basis, they appear frustrating. I have profound sympathy with my ex-colleagues, the directors of social services with their social work staff, and also with the voluntary sector, in the present position. When I was in office in Oxford city for much of the time I did not have difficulty in gaining resources, but towards the end of my time there were great cutbacks and there was difficulty in obtaining resources. But my department was robust. They believed in the work they were doing and were not going to be deterred. Therefore, I should say&#x2014;although I think it is not generally known&#x2014;that we had a welfare fund operating in our department and we raised approximately &#x00A3;10,000 a year as a private fund; and we started making good the staff we could not take on by forming a very good group of volunteers who undertook to work with qualified social workers. Thus a great deal of work was done with families without our taking on any more staff.<lb/>
I wonder whether the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, were as disastrous in content as he made them out to be. His Jonah-like pessimism lacks that robust and wonderfully positive attitude in adversity that we have come to associate with him. I think he under rates the sturdy compassion of the general public for working on their own behalf. These days, we have only to see the self-help groups that have grown up to meet particular needs. All Members of your Lordships' House, on whichever Benches we sit, care deeply for the elderly, for the
<col>108</col>
physically and mentally handicapped, for the children in trouble and in need, for the disruptive and disrupting families, for the homeless, for the single parents and for those who live on the poverty line. Concern and caring are not the prerogative of any one party in this House. Every Member of this House is surely at one on the policies with regard to the family. Where there are disagreements I would suggest, as has been shown by all previous speakers, that it is in the financing of the policies in which we all agree; and I would suggest, secondly, that there are, and have been, difficulties in administration that have been wasteful of money.<lb/>
In my time as a social worker and, indeed, in my own personal experience, I have often been in touch with children whose father has been cruelly killed and where the income of the family has dropped dramatically. In order to live within her reduced budget and to meet her changed circumstances the mother has had to alter her style of life; and many mothers have done this with great courage and have considered the wellbeing of their children. And so it is with the country. There is not the money to increase our public expenditure&#x2014;not merely to maintain it but to increase it. On this, I know, many Members of this House do not agree with me. Although the book by Professor Peter Townsend has come out, there is another book which makes out the figures to be quite different. I think that we should look carefully and objectively at both books.<lb/>
Today, I confine myself to the position of children in trouble and in need and to their families and suggest that we should be looking at the administration of our common policies. In her speech at the annual general meeting, the chairman of Dr. Barnado's, Lady Wagner (as has already been said by one of our maiden speakers) drew attention to the present rise in the number of children in care. The Committee for New Approaches to Juvenile Delinquency points out that there were 880 juveniles in borstal in 1969 and that by 1977 the figure had risen to 1,935. The cost is &#x00A3;94 a week and the recidivism rate is 81 per cent. within two years. Are we perhaps wasting money? Children's homes cost &#x00A3;70 to, in some cases, &#x00A3;100 a week. Community schools for education
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0063"/>
<col>109</col>
cost up to &#x00A3;120 a week per child. Here we have evidence that 66 per cent. of delinquents in custodial care commit further offences within three years. My Lords, are we wasting money?<lb/>
There are alternatives to costly custodial care for a proportion of the children. Some delinquent children must have residential care, but that residential care should be of a high standard of excellence, and we should do with much less in the country. What are these alternatives? First, there are the day care facilities which have not yet been greatly developed in this country. Dr. Barnado's, for instance, had in Birmingham a day care centre for disruptive, absconding and seriously delinquent children. These children remain at home but go to this centre during the day from early morning until late at night, and the parents are helped. This is far less expensive and is far more effective than removing those children from home and having them in care.<lb/>
Secondly, there is the provision of substitute homes by foster care services. Here I suggest that we should develop much more than we have this foster care system which of course has been going on for generations. But I would point out that it rather depends upon where you live. If you live in a London borough, only 22 per cent. of the children in care are boarded out. If you live in Sheffield, 55 per cent. are boarded out; and if you live in Warwickshire, 65 per cent. are boarded out. Should we not think of saving money and of giving much better child care by developing much further our boarding out system?<lb/>
Then there is adoption. I am chairman of the Adoption Resource Exchange. This seeks to place for adoption children who are handicapped, adolescent and difficult to place. Last year 100 children were placed. If they had remained in care in residential accommodation until the age of 18, it would have cost the country &#x00A3;2 million. We have been told&#x2014;I think rightly&#x2014;by the Department of Health and Social Security that there will not be further money forthcoming in grants for this society. I therefore put it to all the members of the society that we should either have to make arrangements ourselves for raising further money or close down. The robust answer came
<col>110</col>
from everybody that this work was of absolutely vital importance to the family, that we would form a committee to raise money and therefore not accept a further grant from the Department of Health and Social Security.<lb/>
Thirdly, there have been remarks made about the activity programme offered to children and their parents which is called intermediate treatment. I have this week been to Norwich and seen an excellent intermediate centre. I have realised that, as such, centres, while they need resources, are nothing like as expensive as waiting for the children to commit offences and be accepted into care. If we reduce the number of children in care by helping them to remain either with their families or with substitute families, the social services departments in our country would he very much better off.<lb/>
Now may I come to the question of a developing partnership as between voluntary organisations and the statutory services. I believe that there needs to be a much bigger development in this area. There was growing resentment, as has been stated before, at the high rate of taxation that people used to have to pay and still have to pay. But, as has been stated, some people now pay less. There is nothing to stop those people from making contributions, and many of them do. Among the people I have met in Oxford, for instance, there are five who were going to give up their small businesses, which were essential to the community and were employing people, and who are now not going to do so because of the changed state of taxation.<lb/>
May I give your Lordships a few figures regarding the whole question of voluntary contributions in this country. The Charities Aid Foundation indicate that in 1978 &#x00A3;707 million was contributed to voluntary organisations, and that this sum rose to &#x00A3;818 million in 1979. Volun tary contributions to Dr. Barnardo's were &#x00A3;6,006,000 in 1977 and rose to &#x00A3;8,087,000 in 1978. Therefore, I think we should not denigrate our society. We have a compassionate society which is willing to give and gives voluntarily. May I take this opportunity of mentioning something personal to your Lordships' House. After the debate on the Inter national Year of the Child, one of our much respected doorkeepers in this House
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0064"/>
<col>111</col>
who heard that debate carried out a sponsored walk from Westminster Bridge to Brighton. He was supported by his excellent doorkeeper colleagues, both of this House and of the House of Commons. He raised a great deal of money for the Dyslexia Society. People are doing such things up and down the country.<lb/>
I have not given the Minister notice of the following question, but I should be grateful for an answer at a later stage. It concerns VAT in connection with voluntary organisations. Could there be a review of the VAT legislation as applied to charities which are relieving distress for families and children on parallel lines to local authorities who, under Section 15 of the 1972 Finance Act, are exempt from VAT? The voluntary organisations are giving the identical services. Secondly, I would ask whether at a later date voluntary organisations giving a similar service to local authorities could be exempt from land tax.<lb/>
I believe, as I have said, that there needs to be a greater development of the partner ship between the State and the voluntary sector. I turn briefly to the management structure of local authority social service departments; and not only to them but to education and health. I wonder whether we have not wasted much money in the past years in our management structures. The best qualified teachers leave the classroom; the best qualified nurses and the sisters that we all used to love are now administrators; and the best social workers are now in a managerial role. The experienced social workers, teachers and nurses surely should be at the grass roots; and were this so I believe that much sounder preventive work could be done and the family could be better helped.<lb/>
The question of training has been mentioned. I believe, sadly, that, as with education in the 1940s and 1950s, we have perhaps tried to train too many social workers too quickly, and that we would have done better to have trained fewer social workers well so that they in turn could have carried out in-service training programmes and helped with volunteers.<lb/>
I would just mention the needs of the under-fives, for whom there is no co-ordinated policy and in regard to whom there are at least six or eight different
<col>112</col>
training programmes for those wishing to train. Surely this again is wasteful.<lb/>
I join the noble Lords, Lord Wells-Pestell, Lord Banks, and others, in their beliefs concerning the child benefit allowance. I appreciate that a change in policy is a goal that cannot be reached overnight but that we should work towards a change in policy, towards increasing the child benefits. However, I have a personal view, which is that there should be a graduated child benefit scheme, giving higher child benefits for children under three years of age so that every mother has an opportunity to stay at home and care for her young child if she so wishes. I believe that much harm would be avoided if we were to do that. Secondly, child benefits should be paid on the same level as payments for unemployment and sickness benefit. Thirdly, I believe that child benefits should be index-linked.<lb/>
My Lords, we all believe in the corner stone of the family in our society. I believe that much can be done by society itself at a personal level, at a local level and at a neighbourhood level. Therefore I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, for bringing up this subject today; but I think that with very great managerial and administrative care we could save much money for those priorities that we believe in.</membercontribution></p>

Most of my time in the Chair was spent in coaxing and exhorting honourable Members to curtail the length of their speeches.

I propose to teach precept by example but I confess that on the aspect of being non-controversial I am in some difficulty this afternoon because of the subject we are debating. If I say&#x2014;I say this honestly&#x2014;that I enjoyed very much my 20 years' membership of another place, then there are bound to be one or two of your Lordships who may think: "How could you have?" and therefore I am creating controversy! But I would ask for the indulgence of the House and hope that,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0065"/>
<col>113</col>
if I do suggest an area of controversy, your Lordships will forgive me on this particular occasion.<lb/>
Briefly, I wish to discuss the subject of this afternoon's debate from a specifically Scottish point of view. It is a topic that is eagerly and anxiously discussed in home, street, shop, train and bus. The proposed expenditure cuts of 3 per cent. this year and another 1 per cent. next year have created, I regret to say, fear, worry and alarm in the minds of the Scottish people, as elsewhere. For example, the Glasgow local authority calculates that the Tory spending cuts will cost the average family in their area &#x00A3;8.40 per week. Is this a reasonable apprehension? Of course it is. The Government policies will have the most damaging social and economic repercussions. Any cuts in the provision of social services for the sick and disabled, the young and the old, are unacceptable. Yet the Government seem likely to cut provision to levels which will reverse any commitment to a society in which the case for the underprivileged is a recognised priority. My noble friend, Lord Wells-Pestell, has referred to Professor Peter Townsend and his recent publication. I will not go into that except to say that, according to his definition of poverty there are forty million people living in the United Kingdom in a state of poverty.<lb/>
It is in the local authority sector that the most immediate cuts are taking place. In their circular to Scottish local authorities the Government ask for local authority expenditure to be cut by 7&#x00BD; per cent. from the Labour Government's projected levels for 1980&#x2013;81. According to the Secretary of State for Scotland, it is the basis for&#x2014;and I quote him&#x2014;
<quote>"continuing and increasing reductions in later years".</quote>
Further in the memorandum to local authorities, the Government state&#x2014;and I quote again&#x2014;that they wish to see:
<quote>"an accelerated programme of school closures, cuts in nursery education and further education to 1977&#x2013;78 levels, a reduction in the level of library maintenance, economies in the frequency and methods of collection of refuse, a review of road maintenance standards, and a review of con-cessionary fare schemes for the elderly and the disabled".</quote>
It is also suggested that there should be full cost charges for school transport. If financial support for public transport
<col>114</col>
is to be cut down, then obviously bus fares will have to be increased. There is also a proposal that we should increase the charges as well as reduce the opening hours and the standards of maintenance for leisure and recreation centres.<lb/>
Let me look very briefly at one or two of these. Concerning school meals, in which I am particularly interested, 150,000 pupils in Scotland will lose their right to free meals if the Government cuts are implemented. I served for several years as chairman of the largest education authority at that time&#x2014;that of Glasgow Corporation&#x2014;and we felt great pride when we were told by our medical officers of health and our nutritional experts that our children at school had gained in inches and in mental ability as a result of our excellent provision of school meals. Was all that a mirage? Are we now to throw overboard the expert advice of the medical and nutritional people at whose instigation we instituted free meals or paid meals in our schools? Surely not; but that is exactly what is going to happen. As far as school milk is concerned, at the present time we provide it free for children under seven, but even that has to be left to the local authority to deter mine whether they are going to continue that particular situation.<lb/>
Let me deal just very quickly with housing. The Government are considering the introduction of legislation over ruling the right of local authorities to oppose the sale of council houses&#x2014;elected people, elected on a manifesto which declared that they were against the sale of council houses. Nevertheless, there is this intention to overrule their power and the chairman of the Britannia Building Society claims that the mass sale of council houses to their tenants could force mortgages up to 16&#x00BD; per cent. Such a rate on a &#x00A3;10,000 building society loan for a twenty-five year mort gage would mean a repayment of &#x00A3;138.70 per month: that is &#x00A3;54.20 more than the repayment at the current rate of 11&#x00BE; per cent. One could go on for ever about the drastic effects of the Government's policies.<lb/>
Last night, I listened to a most interesting radio programme on BBC Radio 4. It lasted for 1&#x00BD; hours and was entitled, "What's for the Chop?" It was introduced by a lady, Mary Goldring, who
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0066"/>
<col>115</col>
looked at the different ways in which local authorities are meeting Government demands to cut spending. As I said, it was an excellent and most educative programme, dealing as it did with the views of a wide range of treasurers and chairman of local authorities throughout England&#x2014;and there was one from Scotland. I would certainly urge all Members of this House, before they cast a single vote in favour of the proposed cuts, to take the trouble to obtain a transcript of that broadcast and to read it.<lb/>
The Labour Party, inside and outside Parliament, has a duty to protect the working people of Scotland and the rest of the country, and the responsibility to oppose measures which will damage the fabric of our Welfare State. They are being carried out on the altar of tax reductions, from which the main beneficiaries are the very rich of the country. We believe that the Government have an inescapable responsibility to protect the weakest members of the community, and a duty to secure the maximum employment opportunities. That is why we, as a Labour Party, will do everything in our power to press the Government to change their policies.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00549"><member>The Countess of LOUDOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very pleased to be the first to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, on his most interesting maiden speech. I hope that it will be the first of many. I wonder whether many of your Lordships realise the extent of the financial burden on a family with a handicapped child&#x2014;either physically or mentally handicapped, or both. Many of these handicapped are unable to move around quickly; hence more heating is necessary than for a normal child. They may need a special diet, and we all know how expensive that can be. Children grow out of their clothes, but the handicapped, both adults and children, wear out theirs much more quickly through sitting and rubbing, due to wheelchairs and perhaps calipers. There is always extra washing and bedding needed, caused through incontinence, plus the wear and tear on furnishings, caused perhaps by a hyperactive child. These are not luxuries; they are necessities.<lb/>
Often the parents' earning power is reduced because the mother is unable to
<col>116</col>
work or the extra family responsibilities prevent the father from doing shift-work or overtime. The behavioural and emotional problems, added to these financial ones, may place an almost intolerable burden on a marriage. We all have our breaking point. In the case of some of these families, this point may be put off or eliminated entirely by the provision of holidays for them, with or without their disabled child. Again, I stress that this is not a luxury but may be a decisive factor in preventing the break-up of the home or a breakdown in parental health, and it is alarming to find that for many local authorities this is the area in which the first cuts are to be made.<lb/>
Under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, local authority social services departments have a statutory obligation to provide many of these items that I have mentioned. As 61 per cent. of local authority spending is financed by the rate support grant from central Government, the drastic reduction in this grant that the Government intend to make, plus their demand for cuts in local authority spending of up to 10 per cent., must have an extremely adverse effect on the provision of social services for disabled children and their families. The voluntary services do a magnificent job, but unless the social services cuts are matched by increases on the voluntary side the result may be a poorer quality of life and greater dependence on others for many individuals, and a considerable extra burden on their families and neighbours. Many disabled and elderly people will be living at home owing to the lack of residential places, but with a deterioration in support services.<lb/>
Many of the women who will care for these people&#x2014;and it is predominantly women who will be affected&#x2014;will also be adversely affected by the envisaged reductions in day care for pre-school children, and in some areas by cuts in grants for holiday play schemes. Local authorities vary from area to area in their provision for the handicapped. Some are extremely good, but at the moment the natural tendency appears to be to look for quick savings. I hope that the Government will be able to give us an assurance that the most vulnerable groups will be protected, and that they will show their compassion for this group of people&#x2014;the handicapped who cannot help themselves.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00551"><member>Baroness PHILLIPS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should first like to thank my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell for introducing this debate today, and to pay tribute to him for his splendid introduction. Also, I should like to congratulate our three maiden speakers&#x2014;all from this side of the House, and all people whom I have known and respected for a long time. Perhaps their splendid speeches will stop this nonsense in our Party of wasting time by talking about abolishing the House of Lords. There are far more important issues for them to be paying attention to at this time, instead of tearing themselves apart on this nonsense. I think your Lordships have heard me say this before. I am going to suggest a referendum asking "Which House will you have abolished?" I think that people might get a shock from the answer. But I should like to pay particular tribute to the three splendid maiden speakers, and I hope that there will be many occasions when we shall hear them again.<lb/>
We are talking today of the family and it would be impossible to range over the whole field. I must say that I am very sorry for the Minister. She has had only one supporter from her own side of the House. I think that if she looks back over the debates under the previous Government, she will see that we did at least come in, even if we sometimes attacked our own Government. Perhaps they have a stronger whipping system on the other side of the House. But my noble friend Lady Loudoun always comes in, and I salute the way in which she never fails to come back to her first love.<lb/>
This is the International Year of the Child and I shall speak of children. First, the cuts will affect the great mass of children. These are not children who are handicapped, either physically or mentally. They are possibly not even disadvantaged. They probably have good loving parents and they have a bright future. How will the cuts affect this group? These children are all in schools, and there will be a direct effect upon them. There are to be cuts in lesson time, in heating, in transport and in teachers. The under-fives, a group which in my judgment, has never really had full consideration from any Government, will be drastically hit.<lb/>
<col>118</col>
Grants are to be withdrawn from voluntary groups. I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, that I am with her in that this is the renaissance of the volunteer, but the volunteer cannot also be fund-raising. I speak as someone who has worked in the voluntary movement, and if you have to raise all your own money then you do not have time for the job for which you are raising money&#x2014;a trap which, as I recall, we fell into in the Labour Party.<lb/>
I listened on the radio this morning to a mother from a London borough, describing the repercussion on her own life through the closure of a nursery group. She said at the end&#x2014;I thought with great compassion and common sense&#x2014;that it would be far worse for some other people, for single-parent families, and she referred to fathers&#x2014;which we do not often do&#x2014;who were trying to bring up families on their own. She said this would mean that they would have to give up work, thus throwing themselves on the State or returning to the unregistered child minders. As to the leisure-time activities of adolescents, these will certainly suffer. In my own borough, we have a newly built and, I understand from one of my grandsons, who is an excellent detective in these matters, fully equipped leisure centre but this is not going to be opened.<lb/>
In this connection I should like to refer to the circular to which I drew the attention of your Lordships before the Recess. The circular deals with juvenile delinquency and was issued by the Home Office, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Social Security and the Welsh Office. It refers specifically to ways in which we can prevent juvenile delinquency. When this circular was issued in 1978, it made particular reference to community based ventures, and there is one sentence in it to which I shall draw the attention of the Government. It refers to "occupy in leisure"; in other words, if a young person has proper outlets whereby he can use his energy and develop his skills he is less likely to become a delinquent. May I take the figure given by my noble friend Lady Faithfull which I believe I quoted on that occasion.<lb/>
If not on humanitarian grounds, may I remind the Minister that it actually costs far more to keep a delinquent in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0068"/>
<col>119</col>
care than to keep him out of care. Last week, there appeared in one daily paper a cartoon which showed the Prime Minister standing outside a newly built prison and saying to one of her Ministers&#x2014;I can imagine which one, but we shall guess&#x2014;"The savings in education will just about pay for this". There is a terrible irony and truth about this statement.<lb/>
As I move about Great Britain a great deal, I am asked on every hand, in every town into which I go, to bring forward the case concerning the closure of some project or for the cutting down of some project. These schemes are run by dedicated people who for many years have struggled on low pay, with volunteer labour. They need the extra bit of money to keep going.<lb/>
It is difficult to believe that in a country which owns 2 million yachts we cannot afford to educate our children properly. We are indeed living in an age of private wealth and public squalor. I would be the last to suggest that there is not extravagance and waste in bureaucracy. There is certainly extravagance and waste in private enterprise. And who pays for that at the end of the day? The customer. But cuts, unfortunately, do not necessarily fall on wasteful activities. All too often, it is too easy to quickly eliminate a whole department, to close a ward of hospital beds, as we are seeing now, or to eliminate teachers.<lb/>
From the imploring letters and sad pleas which I have received from so many people, I have selected just a few. May I draw your Lordships' attention to the Burnbake Trust in Wiltshire. What a wonderful heading: "A new start for offenders". The Trust employs young offenders and teaches them how to earn a livelihood. They are difficult young people. The Trust now faces complete extinction if its grant is removed after October, 1979, and it has already been told that it will be removed.<lb/>
May I also draw your Lordships' attention to the handicapped. There are so many examples available but I have selected merely one, a centre in Stafford shire for adult special care. It is a centre for multiple handicapped young people, and it was set up originally with Area
<col>120</col>
Health Authority money. The equipment is not now going to be used because the grant has been stopped and the staff made redundant. These young people represent probably one of the saddest groups of all. They are often blind, they are incontinent and they are unable to communicate. Where are they going to go if that kind of centre is closed?<lb/>
I have received news in a typical letter from Wales&#x2014;I shall not quote all of it, because I might be accused of attacking the Prime Minister, and I should hate that&#x2014;of a newly created centre for very mentally handicapped children. It was founded by the writer of the letter, an old friend of mine, and she says:
<quote>"After a hectic summer &#x2026; we are now taking up the battle' with Government Departments who chant with monotonous enchantment (and disenchantment to those who listen) the philosophy of Do unto those who have most and to those who have not, refer to the Department of the Devil take the Hindmost".</quote>
I hope that she is wrong.<lb/>
Without being unctuous, I did not want the rebate in my pay packet at the expense of the mentally handicapped child, and I know I am typical of very many people. Mr. Robert Adley, a Member of another place, who was on a radio programme with me this morning, said, rather proudly, "I am not a 'do-gooder'. I am a Tory Member of Parliament". I am not quite sure how we are to interpret that, but I say very proudly that I am a "do-gooder". I hope that the Government have enough "do-gooders" in their midst to think again about the terrible effects that the cuts are going to have in relation to the family.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend Lady Phillips who has just sat down commented upon the paucity of Government speakers in this debate. I believe I am right in saying that there are but three. However, may I call attention to one very cowardly act of the Government: that not one single Peer on the Tory Benches intends to speak in this debate. It has
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0069"/>
<col>121</col>
been left to the Baroness in this Chamber, and it is so unfair. How can one throw political invective into such a charming face as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Young? For the courteous Members of the Opposition this is an impossible, ungallant and ridiculous thing to do. I find myself, therefore, in the position of having to try to persuade her&#x2014;gently, if I may&#x2014;to use the warmth of her personality to melt the "ironness" of the maiden who governs her political party at the moment.<lb/>
It has been said so many times that there is very little difference between the major political parties in this country. It has been said that the past Labour Government could have been a moderate Conservative Government. At last, at all events, a very definite distinction can be seen. There is, indeed, a very definite breach between the views of the political parties. There can be no doubt whatsoever that the aims of both parties might have been to try to abolish waste, to try to do away with bureaucracy and red tape and to endeavour to put the economy of this country on to a sound footing. But can one ever imagine a Labour Government getting its priorities, in the process of economy, so entirely wrong, so cruelly wrong as the present Government are doing? And it is no excuse whatsoever to plead that there was a mandate for all this. May I, with all the emphasis that I can command, tell Her Majesty's Government that there was no mandate to withdraw aid from many who will now go cold this winter. There was no mandate to cut educational services which cannot even afford sufficient books in our schools. There was no mandate to abolish the Price Commission. There was no mandate to double VAT. There was no mandate to cut the health services spending and there was certainly no mandate to agree rises in Common Market food prices.<lb/>
Having said that, I should now like to concentrate, if only for a few moments, on the class of persons by way of family who have, so far as I can tell, not yet been dealt with in this debate. I refer to young married couples who in my view have never had it so bad. I happen&#x2014;and it was a great privilege&#x2014;to have served most of the years of my public life in London local government, and proudly there, especially after the war, irrespective of
<col>122</col>
party, we endeavoured to build a sound foundation in local government in London for the family, and especially the young family. What are the things which are important to a young couple? They must be the following: housing, prices, education&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00555"><member>Lord MISHCON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness will never take from me the gallantry that I wish to show her or the admiration that I shall always have for her, and part of that admiration is for her political courage which made her get to her feet. If I may say so, I doubt whether the courage was matched with relevance. I say that for this reason. It is difficult to conceive that any political party could be mandated by an electorate with regard to the demands which might subsequently be made by an International Monetary Fund when the Government were facing a financial crisis; and how one could ever conceive of a mandate to deal with cuts which were imposed as conditions by the International Monetary Fund is frankly beyond me.<lb/>
Secondly, I really cannot conceive of a more irrelevant argument than the second one which was advanced, but perhaps I may be allowed merely to continue with what I was saying and not to be put off by that very courteous intervention. I was asking what could be more important than housing, prices, education, hospital services and&#x2014;certainly to a young working wife&#x2014;nursery schools. I should like to look at the very thing that the noble Baroness was referring to; namely, the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0070"/>
<col>123</col>
question of housing and her reference to the fact that a Labour Government made it difficult for private landlords to rent housing. It may have been a Labour Government who granted security of tenure where a Tory Government would not have done. It may have been a Labour Government who protected furnished tenancies where a Tory Government might not have done. But I can assure the noble Baroness that it would never be a Labour Government who would impose upon local authorities the duty to sell council houses that were built as a social service for those who could ill afford to buy their homes and to saddle themselves with heavy mortgages. They were built in order to deal with priority lists, to be vacated when people moved so that they could then be given to the next person on the priority list. I agree with her that this is something that a Labour Government would not have done. But unfortunately it is something that young couples in this country now face as a result of Tory Government policy.<lb/>
If I may now move on to prices, this subject has already been dealt with, but can anybody do anything else&#x2014;and I am trying hard to use moderate language&#x2014;than pity the lot of the young housewife in this land at this moment? I can remember that the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter&#x2014;and I wish he were in his place at the moment&#x2014;waxed eloquent in a recent economic debate, and he saw fit to quote John of Gaunt from <i>Richard II</i> He referred in moving terms to that lovely description of this country as given by John of Gaunt. Then he stopped short and it was all I could do to remain seated and not to rise, because he stopped short at the words, "This dear, dear land". That was a description that he thought it not appropriate to give. My Lords, it is a "dear, dear England"for young couples at this moment ; it is a dear, dear England when inflation has risen to double the figure at which it was left by the last Government and, on top of that, they have to face 15 per cent. VAT on the goods which they purchase. Then when they think in terms of their children's education they now face the possibility of cuts in the nursery schools, cuts in educational services and presumably cuts in hospital services.<lb/>
<col>124</col>
If this were purely a political debate, it would in fact be a waste of oratory and this House is not short of oratory. It ought to be an honest exercise, as my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell put it, in an endeavour to persuade, not a hard hearted set of ogres who sit upon Government Benches in this House or in the other place but people who possibly do not know the hardships which they are imposing because they do not know sufficiently well the people upon whom they impose them. I plead with noble Lords opposite, and with the utmost sincerity, to reflect before they impose the most grave hardships upon the solid structure of this country, built upon the honourable family unit.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00557"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been a pleasure to listen to three constructive and cogent maiden speeches and also to listen to the Front Bench speech by my noble friend who opened this debate. Last night as I was driving my car home from this house I was alerted on the radio by the talk of a bonfire of controls and the breathtaking stroke that had been made by the Government to let all things rip on the Stock Exchange and everywhere else so that money can move freely all over the world. That is the acme of monetarism. For my trouble and pains over 40 or more years, I went into my study and I picked up, now grey with age and dirty blue, the <i>vade mecum</i> of the professors of the 'thirties who tried to cure the slump; the foundations of the May Report; the two minutes of evidence; the work of all the great professors and pundits of the time, including Sir Montagu Norman, who wanted his name inscribed on a piece of metal because the Gold Standard was going to save mankind. It was all pillars of cloud because they were dealing with unreality; they were dealing with a system of society that existed only on a page of mathematics and in the differential calculus. They were not dealing with the idiosyncrasies of human beings, not dealing with the wants and pains and desires of ordinary men and women around the world. They were dealing with graphs&#x2014;it is full of them&#x2014;and statistics trying to prove, and what they were trying to prove. They were trying to prove in a way, although they did not use the word then, that monetarism works.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0071"/>
<col>125</col>
The fanatical monetarists who are now dictating to the Government believe that a fierce credit squeeze, high interest rates, cuts in public expenditure, will have the effect of squeezing inflation out of the system, restoring the confidence of British industry and laying the basis of a great upsurge in output and productivity. It is much more likely, as the TUC, and others on all sides of the House, at different times have said, that this is a complete gamble and there will be a big fall in investment at home because of letting all systems go on the Stock Exchange and letting money flow freely. On 7th August even the <i>Financial Times</i> said:
<quote>"Faith in the Government's economic policy must be built on the hope that a currency and monetary squeeze will have its impact on inflation before it destroys the profitability of large parts of Britain's manufacturing industry".</quote>
Then it was said:
<quote>"This is a gamble and the stakes are higher than the Government would wish".</quote>
As someone has already said, there was no mandate for about 70 per cent. of what this Government have imposed upon the British electorate. One-third of the people could not provide a mandate. Also the Government have reneged on their promises on the Health Service, and reneged on their promises of not cutting so much government expenditure in their Election Manifesto.<lb/>
Furthermore, let us take the Stock Exchange. Mr. Gordon Pepper is seriously disturbed. Now who is he? He is a partner in the stockbrokers Greenwell and Co., who publish a regular, well-informed, splendidly thought-out <i>Monetary Bulletin,</i> and he is a leading commentator on City and monetary matters. In the <i>Observer,</i> which I am sure this well-informed House has read, on 12th August he said he feared that the money supply was rising too slowly for comfort: "The economy should be given time to react to the changes in monetary policy. If it is forced to react too abruptly it will suffer quite unnecessary disruption."<lb/>
This debate is calling attention to the serious effects of the Government's policy on the family. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Snow (who used to sit over there), who, in quite a striking lecture to the Findley Green Foundation, called
<col>126</col>
attention to what he termed the state of siege; and he opened it by saying:
<quote>"We are living in a lobotomised society".</quote>
The more I look across the Chamber the more sure I am that we are, if nobody gets up from the other side to denounce these frenetic cuts that are being made. Ordinary human hopes are beginning to disappear and there is a greyness about living and the quality of life. He added in his day&#x2014;because it is a bit Malthusian, but do not make too much fuss of poor old Malthus:
<quote>"There are already too many people in the world and the overwhelming elasticity of population is confronted"&#x2014;</quote>
I added this bit&#x2014;
<quote>"by the axiom of the limited area of the earth".</quote>
Absolutely correct; it is one of the problems confronting mankind and they have not a clue how to tackle it, as we are living in an unreal society.<lb/>
In all this the family is allegedly the basis of civilisation&#x2014;not allegedly; it is. That is a clich&#x00E9;, but as in all life we say it is a clich&#x00E9;. The trouble with clich&#x00E9;s is that they are so often fundamentally true and people take no notice of them; and that is exactly what is happening to the attention of the Tory Government to the family. Now in our own country, which believes itself to be in the forefront of civilisation, the family as a unit is forced by Government to face ruthless cuts, cuts that go back to the 1930s. The system of society in which we are living did not solve its problems by any of the economic nostrums put forward in the famous May Report. Their problem was solved by men killing each other. It was the upsurge of rearmament in 1938 that did it. If we are not careful we shall have that upsurge again if we have militaristic speeches and the "barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world" suggesting that we should have more guns and more nuclear weapons. What kind of family chance will there be there?<lb/>
We are also losing control of our environment. In all the expectations of the young&#x2014;I do not want to repeat all the statistics; I want to take the philosophy as a whole&#x2014;in housing, health, hospitalisation, education, welfare, nursery schools, the whole lot, we are surrounded by squalor, mediocrity; in our planning, even our buildings and everything else, there are cuts, cuts, cuts. The Price
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0072"/>
<col>127</col>
Commission was a nuisance to this Government because it informed the general public of expected increases in prices and thereby in some cases curbed prices. Because of that curbing it has been pushed aside. Similarly, the Royal Commission was an embarrassment by issuing statistics to demonstrate the inequality of incomes and wealth. Those things are disappearing, and it will be more difficult for people to study our system of society and find which way it is drifting economically. To the detriment of the family, Parliament is becoming only a court of cassation. What is that? It is the power of annulment. That is all we have got. It is the power of annulment which is paramount in Westminster today, not the power of initiative. The power of initiative has been lost for this last generation and taken over by the Executive, and that applies to Conservatives and Labour in power. It is a very dangerous phase in human society that most Parliaments are moving in that direction; and God forbid that the British Parliament should ever become just a court of cassation where people are satisfied with just annulling things from time to time.<lb/>
Gibbon pointed out in his great masterpiece:
<quote>"We are in the hands of powerful vested interests with minds that are unsoiled by toil and uncontaminated by experience".</quote>
The more I read what is happening to us, the more sure I am that poor old Gibbon was right. We are witnessing (Good Lord! I have been speaking for 10 minutes!) the most vicious attack on the Welfare State and the public sector since the hungry 'thirties. I will not quote the Budget cuts. I want to cut this speech down to about 14 minutes, if I can. The cash limits which have been introduced are a great trick. Let me be fair and point out that the Labour Government&#x2014;I do not want this thrown back at me&#x2014;used them in 1976 and I did not like it. However, it is something that can hide in local government expenditures. It is making local government try to save &#x00A3;2 billion in cuts. Maiden speakers and other speakers have quoted examples regarding local authorities. In Staffordshire there were cuts in the fire service and in the nursery schools and the people are beginning to protest. There are people who have voted Conservative who have come to me
<col>128</col>
and said so, and who have also said that they did not expect this approach to be made.<lb/>
Another matter worth mentioning is that a summary of the cuts in themselves is quite terriffic. The 1979&#x2013;80 cuts involve a 3 per cent. reduction in Civil Service manpower; a 3 per cent. reduction in cash limit expenditure, which includes rate support grants in the local authorities and a general 8 to 9 per cent. squeeze; a &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;6 million cut in spending programmes and &#x00A3;1 billion worth of sales in the public sector. That, if ever one had a nefarious policy, is like a farmer selling his seed corn. We are selling assets. God knows what kind of food we shall get on the motorways. It is bad enough at present. They probably will not be open on Sundays. That is the first move.<lb/>
If the Conservative Government last beyond 1980&#x2014;they may not&#x2014;there will be a 10 to 20 per cent. cut in Civil Service manpower; a 5 per cent. cut in 1980&#x2013;81 in the rate support grant and another &#x00A3;4 billion to &#x00A3;5 billion cut again in the whole of the spending programme. No wonder Maynard Keynes said this&#x2014;nobody likes Keynes now; the fashion is Friedman or someone like that. This is not Davies of Leek; this is Maynard Keynes:
<quote>"The decadent international but individualistic capitalism in whose hands we find ourselves is not a success. It is not intelligent, it is not beautiful, it is not just, it is not virtuous&#x2014;and it doesn't deliver the goods. In short, we dislike it and are beginning to dispise it. But when we consider what to put in its place we are extremely perplexed."</quote>
That is the matter to which this House should be attending. It should create an historic occasion. It should be discussing the matter less from a party political point of view and more with a philosophical approach. This House could justify its existence by taking a Keynesian attitude to the system of society in which we live. However, our Holy Grail is national productivity, and there is many a problem in that connection. I had better finish soon, although I would like to go on. It is tempting to continue, but do not worry.</membercontribution></p>

Joseph. He says&#x2014;God, this is terrible&#x2014;that there are six poisons. There is some thing funny about that. Is there a doctor in the house? Sir Keith Joseph says that unions poison the economy. That is the language of the deluded. Sir Keith Joseph, Industry Secretary, in a radio interview said that a
<quote>"politicised trace union movement, associated with Luddism"&#x2014;</quote>
your Lordships all know what this is&#x2014;was one of the six poisons responsible for Britain's ills. Look how he thrusts it on to them. He went on to say that the other five poisons were excessive Government expenditure; high direct taxation&#x2014;and that is untrue because we are not the highest taxed in Europe by any means; egalitarianism (a beautiful word); excessive nationalisation and anti-enterprise culture. He said that it was easy or possible to get some of the poisons out of the country's system by tackling the trade union movement. Some noble Lords say, "Hear, hear!" It is a bit moronic.<lb/>
I wish to raise a question about Luddism and take as an example the silicon chip. Let us consider the telecommunications industry and what will happen to families in that connection. In 1967 there were 99,400 people employed in telecommunications, in telegraph and telephones. By 1976 that figure had fallen to 73,600, but even if the industry managed to maintain the same level of output, employment could drop 10,000 more by the 1990s. Another startling example is cash registers. When one shops in the big stores the registers add up straight away. As regards the mechanised parts of those machines the 1975 annual report showed that in five years the development of those new machines had led to a reduction of the workforce from 37,000 to 18,000. It is not Luddism when there is a protest about that. It is nothing to do with Luddism; it is the fear of mankind.<lb/>
We have now reached a pitch&#x2014;and I wish I had time to develop this point&#x2014;where I guarantee a three-day week in the pits cutting coal well would provide a bigger output of coal than we are getting the way we are working today. Mankind has entered a different trend of history and Members of this House not over-whelmed by party politics should have more debates about it. We may be wrong
<col>130</col>
as regards many of our answers, but we should have more debates trying to find answers to the problem of productivity that is growing all over the world in relation to the massive increase in population. That way, and only that way, will provide happiness for the family.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00561"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, that we ought to spend more time thinking about the consequences of the new technology in terms of its effects on not just the family, but on the whole of our civilised life. However, I shall not today follow him in quite that vein. I shall speak, as is my custom, on a few matters which worry me. I wish to begin my remarks by congratulating the three maiden speakers, the noble Lord, Lord Brooks of Tremorfa, the noble Lord, Lord Underhill&#x2014;I cannot call him that, I shall call him Reg, as I have always called him&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, who have made three very good maiden speeches, which means that in future we shall hear many good speeches in your Lordships' House. I hope that they will attend and give us regularly the type of speeches which they have given today.<lb/>
In Monday's <i>Financial Times</i> I read that the family food bill had risen by 15 per cent. in the last 12 months. In fact a survey of mine, privately carried out, suggested that most of that rise occurred in the last six months. When the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, spoke he pointed out how he had noticed most of the rise in the last three months. Some of the increase, although not all of it, is due to Government policy. The extra 5 per cent. devaluation of the green pound; the acceptance of a rise in EEC food prices and the increase in the price of milk, are but three examples. It is not only food that has gone up in price; the cost of clothing has also increased. I know I shall be told that VAT does not apply to children, but it applies to children over the age of 13 or 14. As the charging of VAT depends on size, it applies to many children who are much younger than that. However, in any case the family does not consist only of children; the family consists of parents and children.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0074"/>
<col>131</col>
I want to move to the vexed question of housing. Here I have the impression&#x2014;I may well be wrong&#x2014;that there is not the awareness there should be of the extent to which poor housing can have deleterious effects on the health, education and development of children. I may be wrong&#x2014;and I shall be glad to discover that I am wrong&#x2014;but that is my impression. A survey carried out by the National Children's Bureau showed that children living in houses which lack a bath, an inside toilet and hot water are slightly more likely to suffer from non-asthmatic chest complaints than children living in houses with those amenities. In fact, any doctor will confirm that.<lb/>
Overcrowding also affects the educational development of children. In another survey, the National Children's Bureau found that 11-year old children living in overcrowded houses have their arithmetical ability retarded by six months compared with children living in less crowded conditions. Again that is quite under standable. Yet one in eight of our 11-year old children live in overcrowded conditions. In that same survey children in families which do not have their own bath, inside lavatory and hot water were found to have their arithmetical ability retarded by 10 months compared with children in families which have those amenities. Yet again one in eight of our 11-year-olds live in such conditions.<lb/>
The National Children's Bureau also found that 16-year old children living in overcrowded houses are significantly more likely to be school truants and to have a lower actual attendance rate than children living in less crowded conditions, even when the effect of social class is removed. Another analysis also showed that children in overcrowded conditions are more than twice as likely to be reported by their teachers as delinquent and aggressive than children who are not living in overcrowded conditions. Of course, bad housing can end in divorce.<lb/>
Yet there are 800,000 families in this country who live in houses that are officially unfit for human habitation and 1 million families live in houses that lack hot water, a bath or an inside toilet. It is estimated that 1 million children live in bad housing conditions. One in six of our 11-year-old children share a bed.
<col>132</col>
The last Government indicated that 300,000 new dwellings would need to be built every year, and it is estimated that a further 400,000 houses would need to be rehabilitated every year if we are to come to grips with this problem.<lb/>
Yet what do we find? One of the first acts of this Government was to cut &#x00A3;320 million off the housing budget for England and Wales. That is not all. They requested local authorities to indicate the effects of the 2&#x00BD; per cent. additional cut this year and 5 per cent. cuts in each succeeding year, and also of a further option of 5 per cent. and 7&#x00BD; per cent. in 1980 and 1981. That shows a callous indifference to the basic need which good housing represents. Moreover, these requests to local authorities were extended to education and personal social services.<lb/>
I shall deliberately quote to your Lordships from a circular which Mrs. Thatcher issued in 1972 when she was Minister of Education. I quote from paragraphs 19, 20, 21 and 28. In paragraph 19 she said:
<quote>"The value of nursery education in promoting the social development of young children has long been acknowledged. In addition, we now know that given sympathetic and skilled super vision children will also make great educational progress before the age of five".</quote>
In paragraph 20 she said:
<quote>"The opportunities which the new policy offers for families living in deprived areas, both urban and rural, in bringing up their young children will be particularly important".</quote>
In paragraph 21 she said:
<quote>"The extension of nursery education will also provide an opportunity for the earlier identification of children with special difficulties which, if neglected, may inhibit their educational progress".</quote>
Finally, in paragraph 28 she said:
<quote>"All children can gain from nursery education. But it is particularly valuable for children whose home and life are restricted, for whatever reason".</quote>
I do not believe that Mrs. Thatcher has changed her views, but she is presiding over a Government whose policy will have the effect of restricting the development of nursery education&#x2014;that very nursery education which she so strongly advocated when she was Minister of Education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00562"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on a point of information for the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, to whom I always enjoy listening, it is not the Government's
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0075"/>
<col>133</col>
policy that nursery education should stop. All the economies will do is slow down the pace at which the number of nursery school places are provided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00563"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that their policy will "restrict the development of" nursery education. The noble Baroness has merely confirmed that and I thank her. That is not all. There is also a danger that there will be an increase in the cost of school meals and perhaps even the loss of school milk.<lb/>
I want to dilate on these two matters for a couple of minutes because again, although I have heard a lot said about this at various times and in various places, I am not sure of the extent to which it is realised what could be the consequences of this either reduction in the provision of, or large increase in the cost of, these school meals. So far as school milk is concerned, again, in terms of small children its provision is a very important contribution to their health. In the case of school dinners, on which I said I wanted to dilate for a couple of minutes, what we are likely to have is probably an increase in the cost rather than an abolition.<lb/>
An increase in the cost will greatly increase the burden on the family because of course it will affect the family income. Since the statutory duty to provide it is what will be removed, there will be different ways in which different authorities will deal with it. There are lots of dangers. There is the question of its effect on working mothers, which has already been mentioned. Some children might have to return to empty houses. I should have thought that the possibility of the child not coming back is very great; that is, staying at home and not going back to school. It is realised that in fact some children may not eat at all. They may have to go without a meal as a consequence of this. I know that when the noble Baroness replies she will indicate that that is not their intention. But one is always guilty of the consequences of any act one commits. In the case of the Government they will not be able to blame an absence of knowledge, because lots of people and many organisations have been drawing their attention to these consequences. I do not intend to go further on this.<lb/>
I had intended to say a little more on the effect of the cuts in the Health Service.
<col>134</col>
My noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell has dealt with it to some extent. I just want to say that this is not only a problem of the inability to get a bed in the hospital. There are other dangers which are probably worse. There is the danger that there may not be sufficient staff in a hospital, particularly nursing staff. You may find yourself in a ward with an inadequate supply of nurses, or what is in some respects possibly worse, there may well be enough nurses but they are not trained. This is another possible consequence. In fact, since I know the suggestions of some area health authorities as to how they will deal with the cuts, I think this is a likely consequence of the cuts in the Health Service; plus the fact that the Health Service have to pay the increased VAT.<lb/>
Moreover, there is the question of the increase in prescription charges&#x2014;an additional burden. Some of these burdens could have been lightened by a substantial increase in child benefit. The Government have not done that. Speaking personally, I am waiting with interest for the reply of the noble Baroness to the question that was put by my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell. I hope that at least the Government will recognise that they have a method of ameliorating to some extent the consequences of their other actions. I expect that when the noble Baroness replies she will give us the usual talk about the economic reasons for the cuts. I hope she does not waste too much of our time on that. I do not accept it, but that is not the point. The real point is that the family could have, and should have, been given priority in the Government's planning. The question I want her to answer is not whether it is necessary to adopt the economic policy that is being adopted, but whether it is absolutely necessary to allow the family to be punished in this way, and whether the Government could have given priority to the family in their planning.<lb/>
I do not accept that the cuts needed to be right across the board. I know that the Government do not accept that, because they have increased expenditure on the Armed Services and on the police. Therefore, what I am saying is that the safeguarding of the family should be given at least as much priority as law and order. Frankly, I contrast the danger of the possible reduction in the youth service
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0076"/>
<col>135</col>
with the short, sharp remedial treatment which is threatened for the youngsters. Again, I am not arguing about the merits or demerits of that. What I say is that I believe that prevention is better than cure.<lb/>
Finally, I cannot exempt the Government from the opprobrium they deserve for the way in which they behave towards the families of immigrants. It is no use claiming to be a strong upholder of family life, and then to make it difficult for families to be united. That is no good at all. I am afraid that the Government have so far not covered themselves with glory in their treatment of the family. All I shall say at this stage is that there is time for them to recover. I hope they will seize it.</membercontribution></p>

I should like to make it known to your Lordships how grateful I have been to the noble Lord for the considerable assistance he gave me during his time in office at the Department of Health and Social Security. I am happy to say that many of the difficult and tragic cases which came my way and which had been neglected by local authorities were solved, and I am sure that would not have been the case without the help of investigation from the DHSS.<lb/>
I am pleased to see that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, will be speaking for the Government in this debate I know she cares about families in need. I hope that as a Minister she will be able to give us some assurance that all the rumours that are going around are not correct. On Monday a headline in the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> read, "Disabled face 'horrific' job cuts". I am sure every one knows the saying, "A disabled person can mean a disabled family". The options listed were: abandon the quota scheme, cut the disablement resettlement service, abolish the disabled advisory committee, close the employment re habilitation centres, cut training at specialist residential colleges and save on sheltered employment. This publicity has worried many people.<lb/>
<col>136</col>
I am sure that with more incentive and better organisation money can be saved in many Government departments. I took a young ESN girl on a job creation scheme some months ago. One morning one of the administrators of the scheme spent about two and a half hours with her, and said to me afterwards, "Barbara is not interested in boys". I knew only too well that that was not correct and it seemed to me that a great deal of time had been wasted. Also, far too many officials were involved with each individual case, causing confusion all round. To cut services across the board with no research and with no alternative plan for disabled people would be a quite retrograde step.<lb/>
I wish very much to bring to your Lord ships' notice today the present plight of one of our most famous hospitals, and this can and does have very serious effects on the family. I must declare an interest as I am an ex-patient and, as chairman of the Spinal Injuries Association, many of our members who are fathers, mothers and children rely on it as their lifeline. The part of the hospital to which I now refer is the National Spinal Injuries Unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury. This unit at present serves the whole of the South of England, with many patients from all parts of England and many parts of the world.<lb/>
The spinal unit treats patients who are paralysed from spinal cord injuries. They come to be paralysed through road accidents, when serving in our Armed Forces, by way of industrial injuries, at work on oil rigs, many through sporting injuries, from falls downstairs or out of trees or from windows and buildings. The cord can also be damaged by disease or a medical condition such as a thrombosis in the spinal canal. When these accidents happen it is a traumatic experience and shock for all the family, when one of its members is paralysed from the neck or back down. Expert treatment is needed to prevent pressure sores, con tractures, urinary complications and thrombosis. Family support and advice are essential.<lb/>
This spinal unit, which for years has been overworked and understaffed, with buildings which have long outlived their useful life, is part of the Oxford Regional Health Authority. The DHSS is aware
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0077"/>
<col>137</col>
that in the South of England two more spinal units are planned. At present there is a shortage of at least 100 beds for spinal patients. If spinal patients stay in general hospitals all sorts of complications often arise, one of the greatest being depression through lack of inspiration from similar patients Last winter, when the snow fell, some of the roofs fell in on patients. In August, there was a staff freeze with the result that no patients could be admitted in that month. Now there is a further crisis. The unit has been told to close a ward, and it was suggested that they should close the one women's ward, with the children's annex, which was recently upgraded by voluntary money.<lb/>
The unit has been told to close 25 out of its 156 beds, yet it is supposed to treat new injuries and look after about 6,000 paraplegics, who often have complications with which general hospitals cannot cope. A 16 per cent. cut seems quite extraordinary when there is already a shortage of 100 beds and no new units yet built. When patients have to remain in general hospitals, their overall treatment is often prolonged, costing a great deal more money. It must surely be the right policy to get patients correctly treated and returned to their families as soon as possible.<lb/>
All of us who are involved know the great struggle and hardship which severe injury imposes on families. We know the need for new units to take the stress off Stoke Mandeville, but in the immediate future the hospital staff need their morale boosted, not flattened into the ground. The patients, and their families, need reassurance that they will be treated. There is to be a meeting on 7th November, where the decision to close a ward will be taken, and I urge the Minister to try to take an interest before that date. The unit has been starved for long enough by a region that seems to be more interested in the Oxford City hospitals; but perhaps this is inevitable as most of the patients come from outside the region.<lb/>
It is possible that a fund-raising campaign could help this unit, but unless something happens soon, due to the continuous struggle for survival, the people who care will have lost the energy needed. If voluntary money is raised for any special project, there must be assurances that it will go for that purpose
<col>138</col>
and will not get swallowed up in the vast pool of the National Health Service administration. I would ask the Minister whether the responsibility for a national unit should be left to a local area. Our members of the Spinal Injuries Association do not think so; it has just not worked.<lb/>
I end on another matter. Last week in Hull mothers protested at the withdrawal of the attendant at a school crossing. Unless children have protection from the terrifying monster lorries which charge up and down the roads and through the streets and from murderers who prowl behind hedges, no doubt mothers will run to their doctors in ever-increasing numbers for valium to dull their senses or will end up with a nervous breakdown. For many years people have been educated to the fact that the State will provide. Volunteers have often been shunned and discouraged. If the State can no longer provide, then the statutory bodies should help rehabilitate society into being more independent and able to help itself, but it is a terrible country if those who cannot help themselves are not supported and cared for and given a life with dignity.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00567"><member>Baroness DAVID</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my congratulations to the three maiden speakers whom we have heard today. I think we have had a very remarkable afternoon. In my speech I shall concentrate upon the effects that the Government's policies on education will have on the family. There will be financial, social, and health effects. First, I wish to refer to school meals. I know that this matter has been mentioned before, but I should like to go into a little more detail. The Bill about to be published will, I understand, give local authorities freedom to charge what they like, to provide whatever sort of meal they like, with whatever nutritional content they like. I hope that the Bill will not absolve them from the obligation to provide a free meal for children whose families are below a certain income level; that would appal me. The relief of individual poverty should surely be a national responsibility, and I ask the Minister for specific assurances on this. If it is the Government's policy to take away the statutory duty to provide free meals, I hope that the local authority
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0078"/>
<col>139</col>
associations will get together and decide on a uniform pattern for the whole country.<lb/>
Last year, 1,159,000 children had free meals&#x2014;14 per cent. of all children attending school. The hot mid-day meal is for many children the main, and only, proper meal of the day, as my noble friend Lord Underhill has already said. There is plenty of evidence for that. The cost of whatever sort of meal is involved is bound to go up by a large percentage, and families on low incomes, particularly those with several children at school, will be very hard hit indeed, and probably just will not be able to afford the higher charge.<lb/>
An article in <i>New Society</i> on 9th August this year suggested
<quote>"that a price increase of 25p or 30p would, on past trends, lead to a decline of a third, possibly a half, in the number of children paying for meals".</quote>
An analysis of the take-up of school meals in 1977&#x2013;78, published in the Centre for Environmental Studies <i>Review</i> in May this year suggested that it will be the children from lower income families who would no longer be able to take school meals, and its tentative conclusion was,
<quote>"that the free school meals scheme is not sufficiently generous to cater for all families who could not afford paid meals".</quote>
It seemed from this that the price charged deterred a significant number of poorer families who did not receive free meals. The health of our children will suffer.<lb/>
Let the children go home, some say. This is often physically impossible if the school is some distance from the home, and many mothers work not just for the pleasure of it, but to earn enough to keep the family solvent. Many mothers would prefer to stay at home. DHSS figures show that the number of two-parent families going below the poverty line would be trebled if the wife did not earn. The alternative of giving children cash to buy what they like at a local shop seems to me highly undesirable both from a health point of view and from the point of view of creating bad relations with the local community as well as possible trouble in the streets. Let them take sandwiches, some say. Sandwiches are cold comfort on a cold winter's day.<lb/>
In talking of reducing public expenditure it often seems to be ignored that cuts and
<col>140</col>
a reduced service have been the pattern for the past three years. I obtained figures of my own LEA showing that &#x00A3;666,000 has been cut from the school meals service since 1976. The total budget is currently &#x00A3;3.7 million, and to achieve the Government's target of savings the authority reckons that it will have to cut a further &#x00A3;1.7 million. The charge will have to go up very considerably to meet that and the food value will inevitably go down. The effect on family finance and children's health will be disastrous. If the services are slashed, if the take-up is less, a number of school meals staff will be unemployed. Nearly all of them will be women, and probably wives contributing that little extra that keeps the family going.<lb/>
I want to refer next to school transport. Again, I understand that freedom is to be given to provide, or not to provide, and to charge. The ideal of free education for all, accepted since the 1944 Act, is demolished. I guess that most authorities will put on a charge, preferring this to cuts in staff and capitation, and that they will think that the fairest way is to charge a flat rate, that being the easiest to administer and collect. I again asked my LEA the position there. Over the last three years it has made a cut of &#x00A3;81,000 by a reduction in discretionary transport, ignoring in many cases strong protests from irate parents who feared traffic hazards. The authority is expecting to make a further cut of half a million pounds in 1980&#x2013;81 from a total budget this year of &#x00A3;2 million. To achieve this, a flat rate of about &#x00A3;12 a term would have to be asked for; &#x00A3;1 a week if there is only one child. The incentive from the income tax cuts of about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;30 per week for the average family is not going to last long.<lb/>
There are uncertainties of course. Families living not too far from the school may decide to drive. Traffic around schools could become more dangerous. The numbers going on the school bus might go down and fares therefore might go up. Those living in rural areas will, as so often, be penalised. Will there be free transport for those below a certain income level? Will that be left to local decision? Will the Minister please tell us?<lb/>
I wish to turn to nursery education, which also has already been mentioned.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0079"/>
<col>141</col>
The building programme has been cut from &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;9 million to &#x00A3;4 million. The Labour Government's target of getting 50 per cent. of three-year-olds and 90 per cent. of four-year-olds into nursery education by 1982&#x2013;83 will go by the board. The chance of using empty classrooms&#x2014;and there are plenty of them in primary schools as rolls fall&#x2014;will not be taken because the staff, though they exist, will not be employed. From announcements already made by local authorities it appears that 22 have mentioned cuts in nursery education, five of them abandoning all provision. This is despite what the noble Baroness has just said about the Government's intention. The many other authorities which have named anything from &#x00A3;1 million to &#x00A3;4 million, but have not specified where the axe will fall, will no doubt be lopping off some&#x2014;we hope not all&#x2014;nursery education.<lb/>
The children in our nursery schools, the children who need nursery education, are for the most part the disadvantaged: the handicapped, the children from one-parent families. It is very short-sighted policy to deny these children a good start in life. They need the care and stimulation that good nursery education gives. The parents need relief from day-long care if their children are handicapped, and the single parent needs the chance to earn something to help both pride and pocket. The savings to the nation will be small now, but the cost in future could be very large indeed.<lb/>
I heard rumblings that local authorities might be given freedom in the new Bill to charge for nursery schooling. Will the Minister reassure us that this will never be allowed&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00568"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it might be helpful if at this point I were to say that it is not our intention to include in the forthcoming Education Bill a pro vision to allow local education authorities to charge for nursery education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00569"><member>Baroness DAVID</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very relieved to hear that; I thank the Minister very much.<lb/>
Next I want to speak of community education, adult education, and the Youth Service. These have been favourite targets for Conservative cuts, and in many parts
<col>142</col>
of the country cuts have already been made. Mark Carlisle told the TUC a short time ago that adult education would take a major share of cuts in 1980&#x2013;81. These activities are looked on&#x2014;mis-guidedly, in my opinion&#x2014;as fringe activities, and the service has already been asked to take a disproportionate amount of reductions. In some areas the service has been emasculated. For many people attendance at adult classes is the only significant activity outside work. They may be seeking to enhance and update skills, or improve their general social and personal confidence.<lb/>
The adult literary classes that have done such invaluable work spring to mind. Retirement is brightened by this provision. Women whose children are off their hands and who perhaps are feeling a little bored and lonely gain a new lease of life from the companionship and interest that they get in this way. In a society in which leisure time is increasing, this service is going to be needed more and more to keep people sane and happy. We do not want the alarmingly large number of those who suffer from mental illness, with all the misery and expense that that entails, to be increased. If costs escalate, as they well may if the service is not to vanish, again it will be the less well-off, those without cars (because already transport to centres has been stopped in many places), those in hospital and the disadvantaged who will suffer. Family life will be less rich, more difficult, more prone to irritation and frustration.<lb/>
I fear for the future of this service. It appears that a disproportionate cut of considerably more than 5 per cent. is to be made in next year's rate support grant settlement for adult education. Where are the Secretary of State's sympathies on these matters? What are his views? When, in February 1969, there was a debate in another place deploring Cheshire County Council's decision to cease all evening classes for one year&#x2014;this at a time when the Russell Report and the Open University were being set up&#x2014;Members of Parliament from all parties joined forces to berate Cheshire. Lord Boyle, then Sir Edward, expressed support for adult education, stressing its value in providing second chances. He said:
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0080"/>
<col>143</col>
<quote>"We are not just talking about courses, we are talking about people".</quote>
There was only one Member that day who backed the suspension of Cheshire's evening classes&#x2014;the Member for Runcorn, Mr. Mark Carlisle.<lb/>
My Lords, if the adult side of community education has suffered, I think the Youth Service has suffered more. The number of community educational staff in my area has gone down from 83 to 54, and the youth tutors form the larger part of that reduction. Clubs have been open for fewer nights; part-time and voluntary helpers cannot get the support they once had. Imaginative schemes have had to be abandoned. There was a very good scheme which two policemen, I think, started up with the lads from a housing estate where there had been a lot of vandalism. They organised for them a lot of things with motor bikes, and they asked the education committee for a small grant to help them. It was not given.<lb/>
I saw that Mr. MacFarlane, at the Conservative Conference, had to face the youth lobby. He said that the Youth Service could not escape the cuts in public expenditure, and he looked to industry and commerce to make a greater effort to help young people. But when a representative from the National Association of Youth Clubs asked him to spell out the kind of aid that industry and commerce could give, Mr. MacFarlane could not do it. This representative complained that they were suffering from
<quote>"a savage moral-sapping cut in our grant".</quote>
Another youth worker, who had given 27 years of service, said,
<quote>"The shutters are coming down",</quote>
and gave examples of huge rises in the costs of hiring accommodation which could put some clubs virtually out of action.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not know how much communication, if any, there is between Mr. Macfarlane and the Secretary of State, but a rather different account came from the Secretary of State on 17th October when he was speaking to the National Youth Bureau. He said:
<quote>"The Government's overall expenditure plans for 1980&#x2013;81 will be published very shortly, but I can tell you now that in drawing them up we did not assume any reductions in local authority expenditure on the Youth Service&#x2026;Whatever
<col>144</col>
assumptions we make the authorities must be free to make their own choice of priorities. I would only ask them to bear one consideration especially in mind in assessing their support for the Youth Service. That is that investment in local voluntary organisations yields a large bonus in the sense of unleashing a store of voluntary effort. Conversely, if support is withdrawn, that effort is lost. I think it would be a great pity if the voluntary organisations were made a prime target of expenditure reductions".</quote>
My Lords, the Government may assume no reductions, but the local authorities are most certainly making them&#x2014;and all this when the Government are making such a song and dance about law and order.<lb/>
I agree with my noble friend Lord Pitt that prevention is better than cure, and surely it is wise to keep young people off the streets and out of the pubs when teenage drinking is becoming a really big problem. A report from the National Youth Bureau out this last week puts all this better than I can:
<quote>"The Youth Service through its work with young people at risk can reduce spending on custodial institutions".</quote>
It points out that if young people are accommodated in custodial units the cost is over &#x00A3;5,000 per person per year. The noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, made this point, and so did my noble friend Lady Phillips. Surely retrenchment on the Youth Service, expected to be 30 per cent. in 1980/81, is one of the most foolish of all retrenchments; and, on top of that, there are cuts in the youth opportunities programme and STEP, the special tem porary employment programme. The report comments:
<quote>"The reduction in STEP funding seems likely to mean the withdrawal of facilities from those young people who are seriously disadvantaged&#x2014;the unemployed youngsters living in inner city and urban areas".</quote>
I know, too, that the NSC are worried about the projected size of manpower cuts in the Civil Service. If those cuts are made sweepingly across the board, they could be very damaging. Arbitrary cuts are ridiculous: they must have people there to arrange the programmes for the unemployed. The effect on families where there are unemployed youngsters needs no elaboration.<lb/>
My Lords, I want to finish on the overall effect of the Government's educational policies on women, because I believe this is one of the most serious aspects of the Government's actions,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0081"/>
<col>145</col>
and means real discrimination against women. I have already mentioned the effect changes in the school meals service and nursery education can mean to a mother who needs to work. There is also the need for retraining, both to bring up to date women who have not been working for some years because of childbearing and rearing, and to train women, made redundant for one reason or another, in new jobs. The TOPs, the training opportunity programmes&#x2014;excellent programmes&#x2014;have had their budgets cut, just when the need will be greater; and every LEA, I suspect, will be reducing the money it puts into its budget for discretionary awards. Mine will have cut &#x00A3;180,000 in the three years to 1980/81. The picture in Surrey is similar&#x2014;&#x00A3;65,000 this year. I am sure that is the general theme.<lb/>
This hits the mature woman particularly hard. As the Equal Opportunities Com-mission says:
<quote>"Much more money is currently spent on men than on women in post-school education&#x2026;and because the prime source for women wishing to retrain is discretionary awards, which are to be hit hard, the gulf will be widened further still. The system by which mandatory grants are awarded is based on the traditional male career pattern where qualifications are gained early on and the working life is uninterrupted. The traditional female career pattern, taking into consideration a period of child rearing, is clearly at variance with this, and the system of discretionary grants has enabled mature women to study, qualify and make a valuable contribution to the community in later life. For teachers, in-service training cuts will severely affect the ' woman returner ' "</quote>
Then, again:
<quote>"Most women obtain their further education through the adult education service, and for many women this service provides the only viable opportunity for post-school education. Because women are generally not as mobile as men, institutes of adult education situated within the local area often become the centre for their continuing education '. And many adult educa-tion teachers are women working part-time&#x2026;".</quote>
That is what the Equal Opportunities Commission says. So in both these ways, and by less provision by the Open University, women are to be ill done by, and that is not good for family life.<lb/>
My Lords, there are other education proposals of this Government that I take issue with, but I have endeavoured to stick to those which have a direct bearing on the family's finances and the family's physical and mental wellbeing&#x2014;and those are alarming enough. Do the Government
<col>146</col>
really know what they are setting in train? When one looks at the proposals for expenditure on an assisted places scheme, and when one looks at the tax cuts that benefit only the family with an income of &#x00A3;10,000 a year and above, can your Lordships possibly think that this Govern ment&#x2014;led, ironically, by a married woman and a mother&#x2014;have got their priorities right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00570">6.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00571"><member>Baroness STEWART of ALVE CH URCH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I first congratulate our maiden speakers and say that I hope to hear them on many occasions again. May I also thank my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell for introducing this debate and for expressing so clearly and with such imagination the views on this subject that are held by most of us on these Benches. I should like to limit my comments to two matters of educational policy which directly and indirectly are of great importance to family life. The Government's plan to provide assisted places in independent schools for bright pupils is based on the fallacious belief that by means of interviews and examinations one can make an accurate assessment of the ability and occupational potential of young people at the age of 11 or 12. It is true that it may he possible to identify a child who is a potential genius, or one who is mentally defective. But the achievements of most young people during their school days depend largely upon the encouragement they receive from their parents and teachers, the degree of confidence that they have in their own ability, and whether they think that hard work will be worth while from their point of view. It is unlikely that Henry Moore would have become the greatest sculptor in the world if he had not received advice and great encouragement from his parents in the Yorkshire town where his father, who had left school at nine years of age, worked as a coal miner.<lb/>
If this Government achieve their ends, the young people who do not obtain places, with or without grants, in in-dependent schools will go to comprehensive schools where they will be regarded by many Conservatives as second-class citizens. A small proportion of them will take O-level and A-level examinations and go to a university or to further education colleges on leaving school,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0082"/>
<col>147</col>
but many more will leave school at 16 unaware of their educational potential, and of the value of O-level and A-level school leaving certificates.<lb/>
Having spent many years as a WEA tutor and a school governor, I am convinced that the great majority of the population in this country fail to reach their educational potential. This is partly due to the fact that it has not been possible for teachers to give them, during their school days, the individual attention which all young people need. This in no way reflects adversely on the teaching profession, for which I have the greatest respect; but if all children of every range of ability were to receive the individual attention they need, we should need smaller classes and many more teachers than we have today. We should need also a far closer relationship between parents and teachers, not only in comprehensive schools but in primary and infant schools.<lb/>
The comprehensive school of which I am a governor is fortunate in having not only parent governors but an active parent-teacher association which provides many opportunities for its members to meet and discuss the needs of the school. I hope it will not be long before all schools have such committees and co-operating between parents and teachers.<lb/>
In another educational sphere, I am much concerned to hear that this Government's policy may lead to cuts in the grants to adult education provided by the universities and the Workers' Educational Association. More than 20,000 adult students take part each year in London University's extra-mural classes. No academic qualifications are required by students who join these classes which cover a very wide range of subjects. In addition to classes in economics and sociology and literature and art, there have been special courses for men and women engaged in social work and communication, and also courses have been organised for magistrates, police officers, and tenants of GLC housing estates.<lb/>
The participation of the universities in adult education has been of great value not only to students but to the universities themselves. As R. H. Tawney said in his book on equality:
<col>148</col>
<quote>"Civilisation is not the business of an elite alone but a common enterprise which is the concern of all".</quote>
University education is no longer reserved for the well-do-do and the intellectual elite. Men and women of all ages, many of whom are parents and grandparents, join university tutorial classes. Unlike pupils at school and internal university students, they are under no obligation to continue to attend the class if they find that it is boring or that it does not provide for their needs. The students meet their tutors as equals and as a result the universities gain as much from these classes as the students themselves. I earnestly hope that there will be no cuts in grants to the universities' extra-mural departments, and that the Government will abandon their plan to provide assisted places in independent schools, and will give thought to the educational needs of children and adults as a whole.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00573"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I first add my congratulations to the three maiden speakers this afternoon, each of whom brought to us a particular and special personal experience which enriches our debate and each of whom we hope to hear again. It is strange (is it not?) that this is a debate on the family, the family which has always been upheld as the great symbol of the Conservative Party of Great Britain, and that it has elicited one speech from the Tory Back Benches. What has happened to the Tory Party so far as its concern for the family is expressed in this House? Is this not a worthwhile House in which to speak about the family? I think the answer to that is very easily encapsulated in the figures already given. I am not going to repeat the many excellent speeches on specialist subjects made this afternoon; but the fact that you can put on one side the &#x00A3;50 million that this Government are going to find as extra Government finance in order to support the private schools of this country while at the same time they are cutting down the money available for school milk, school meals, school transport, for the number of teachers and, above all, perhaps, for school books in the public sector of our education system, gives the answer in itself.<lb/>
Yes, my Lords, the Conservative Party is concerned with the family&#x2014;the families of those to whom it is paying out large tax
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0083"/>
<col>149</col>
rebates, the familes with swimming pools for their horses. On the other side, among the vast majority of the children and the families of this country, the answer of the Conservative Party is to cut down public expenditure even when it means increasing the poverty of what we have heard this afternoon is in the region of one-third of our total population.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00574"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord continues, I am sure that he will appreciate the fact that total Government expenditure this year is the same as last year. There is no diminution in the total sum being spent. This is a fact and we all have to face it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00575"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to know, if that is the case, whether that includes the extra cost imposed by VAT; or is the noble Baroness simply talking about a total sum and not the higher prices which have to be paid during this year for the provision of school books and for the provision (as my noble friend Lord Pitt has said) of many children's clothes? Is this all included in the total expenditure that the noble Baroness is speaking of?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00576"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would make two points. There is no VAT on either books or children's clothes. That is one point. Secondly, total Government expenditure, in real terms, is as great this year as last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00577"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept the assurance of the noble Baroness that the sum is as great. Certainly the sum is not as great as it would have been if there had been a different result at the General Election. But I want to extend this argument with one or two personal examples and anecdotes. Only last week I was talking to a headmaster who had had docked from his annual expenditure this year a sum of &#x00A3;x, and he and the parent-teacher association had decided that they would hold a jumble sale in order to make this sum up. So they planned to hold the jumble sale in the school. They were told by the council that a new edict had gone out that if the school was used for any purposes, including school purposes, then rent had to be paid. In other words, the snake was eating its own tail. That, I
<col>150</col>
suggest, is typical of the kind of economy which this Government are conducting.<lb/>
I do not want to go into the question of school meals because they have been so adequately dealt with; but there is one point arising from the danger of the cutting down or abolition of school meals. In the council area in which I live there has been a public declaration that there is a probability that the school meals service will be closed down completely. We have heard about the nutritional danger of this; but what happens to the children at lunchtime? I was chairman of the governors of a London comprehensive school with 1,350 pupils. At every governors' meeting we had the terrible task of trying to arrange the supervision of those children at lunchtime when there were school meals being provided. What happens if the school closes at lunchtime and there are no school meals? This is a real and immediate problem not just in the cities but also in the country areas and in the small market towns throughout this country. This is a social threat to the lives of the children in their societies.<lb/>
Before I leave the educational issue&#x2014;which has been adequately and extensively dealt with&#x2014;there is one issue that I would like to bring to the attention of the noble Baroness who is going to reply. I understand&#x2014;and perhaps she can confirm this&#x2014;that in the first six months of this year 1&#x00B7;25 million fewer school books were bought than in the same period as last year. That is in the first six months of this year, before the cuts in expenditure began. Can she give us any estimate of the reduction in the number of school books that are going to be bought this year after the cuts have been applied than were purchased last year? What is her policy regarding the buying of school books in the public sector as distinct from the private sector?<lb/>
One could go on. The comparison between income tax rebates on the one hand for the wealthy and the application of VAT on the other. Before the noble Baroness interrupts me again, I shall quote from the Child Poverty Action Group report of this week, that the income after tax enjoyed by childless couples has been increased since the last Budget by 10&#x00B7;6 per cent. of the average earnings of childless couples;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0084"/>
<col>151</col>
but for couples with four children the income has decreased by 8&#x00B7;6 per cent. Is that the Government's policy towards families? Is that the Government's policy towards children? We have seen and we are seeing, as my noble friend Lord Pitt pointed out, National Health Service hospital wards being closed while at the same time the Government are encouraging the use of private beds.<lb/>
I should like particularly to pay tribute to the contributions made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, and my noble friend Lady Loudoun, on the question of the disabled. I want to speak briefly on this issue in addition to what they so movingly put before us. I understood, and many people in public life understood, that the Government had virtually pledged that the money for the disabled would not be included in the cuts that they were organising. In their Manifesto the Conservative Party said this:
<quote>"Our aim is to provide a coherent system of cash benefits to meet the costs of disability so that more disabled people can support themselves and live normal lives".</quote>
Yet it is reported&#x2014;and I should like the noble Baroness to give us some answer on this&#x2014;that the Manpower Services Commission is including the employment services of the disabled in its cut of &#x00A3;150 million during the current financial year. If that is so, that is a pledge dishonoured.<lb/>
I would also refer the noble Baroness to the two speeches made in July and September by her colleague&#x2014;and our ex-colleague&#x2014;Mr. Reg Prentice who said that the disabled would have to play their part in the cuts that were being made in public expenditure. I would further refer her to the speech of Sir Keith Joseph at the conference at Blackpool when he said that we were not spending enough on the disabled for a civilised society, but the most that he could offer to civilise our society was to wait until the economy had recovered. How long do we have to wait? Is it the Government's policy to retain an uncivilised society until their hopeful schemes come to fruition some time in the future? In the meantime, what happens to the disabled?<lb/>
Two final points which I do not believe have been mentioned in this debate. We are talking about the family life of all people in this country. How is the
<col>152</col>
Government's concern for family life, how is the Government's responsibility for the preservation and development of family life, assisted by their refusal to allow husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s of British women to enter this country and settle with them in a family situation? Again I ask the noble Baroness: Is this the Government's policy? Do they intend to prevent British women from having their husbands and fiances in this country with them, or is this just a rumour? If they do intend to pursue this policy, how does that square with any concern for the preservation and development of family life? There is perhaps a rumour, but one that I should like the noble Baroness to scotch if it is untrue: it has again been reported that in the small firms with fewer than 20 employees a woman who leaves in order to have a baby will not&#x2014;as she is now&#x2014;be guaranteed her job hack at the end of six months.<lb/>
Is this Government policy, or is it not? We are entitled to have an answer. If it is Government policy, is this assisting, particularly among a large number of single-parent families, the preservation and development of family life? I ask the noble Baroness to respond. I suggest that it has been convincingly proved through out this afternoon that the present Government were elected on a set of false and contradictory promises and that these have been exposed. They were elected, and I again congratulate them on putting their policy into practice. The sooner they put it into practice the sooner people's eyes will be opened; but so far as the old Conservative regard for the family is concerned, that must have been well and truly destroyed by now.<lb/>
Let me say one word further on their own policy. As I understand it, the policy of the present Government is that the whole future of this country, including all families living in this country, depends essentially upon an industrial revival, which in itself depends upon increased investment. Investment in what?&#x2014;not just machinery. Is it not investment in people? And must that investment in people not stem from concern, protection, development and fostering of family life in this country? Is that not in our economic interests, quite apart from the moral aspect? Does not the survival of this country as a society in which we enjoy the standard of living to which we have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0085"/>
<col>153</col>
become accustomed essentially depend upon investment in people? Are not the Government cutting that investment time after time after time for the vast majority of people while providing handouts for the meagre few?<lb/>
I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, on the Front Bench. May I add perhaps one sly word following our exchange earlier this afternoon. Is it not important for our children to learn some thing about the world in which they live, and to learn that the world has become a hamlet now and not even a village? What are the Government going to do? Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Young, could have a quiet word about this before the noble Baroness replies. What are the Government going to do in order to extend the social consciousness and the international consciousness which some of us have been trying to promote throughout the educational system and which the Government have now apparently brought to an end?&#x2014;because there again the future of this country depends upon the consciousness of children in the kind of world in which they are living today and in which they will be living in the next 20 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00578"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord has asked me a direct question, I will give him a direct answer to that. I think the most important thing that the educational system can do for all the nation's children is to equip them to face life as it is; to have good standards, to have good academic standards, to have good moral standards and standards of discipline and to train them for the jobs which are going to be available in the world. That should be of first and prime importance, and it should not be side-tracked by all sorts of statements which are really almost incomprehensible in their vagueness. I think we want to do something for children and that, if I may say so, is what parents really want for their children in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00579"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I frankly do not understand what the noble Baroness is talking about. I understood that what she has been suggesting is precisely what I am talking about.</membercontribution></p>

<col>154</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00581"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: The committee I was referring to, which the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, knows about, was assisting the teachers' training colleges, teachers, universities, polytechnics&#x2014;every form of educational institution in this country&#x2014;to broaden horizons and to develop international understanding, and to teach teachers how to convey that international understanding to children. This is what I am talking about. That work, as I understand it from the answer this afternoon, has now been wantonly abandoned. I am simply pointing out that the future of the children in this country depends upon their consciousness of their role in the world in which they live, and I want to know what the Government are going to do to replace the work which this afternoon they have announced they have abandoned.<lb/>
Finally, please, do open your eyes as a Government to the fact that, by your actions today, you are deepening the gulf between the two nations; and those two nations, as has been shown in Peter Townsend's book and in all the surveys which have been summarised during the past ten days, are, first, the majority of working-class families and children in this country and, on the other hand, the few who have benefited from your tax cuts in your Budget. Secondly, there is the division between the North and the South. If you look at all the figures in every independent inquiry that has been made, they all coincide in one respect&#x2014;namely, that the depths of poverty are to be found in the North, in Northern Ireland, in the North-East, in the North-West and in Scotland. This is a division which was shown in the Election and it is one which I believe the Government are perpetuating by their policies towards the family.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00583"><member>Lord MCCARTHY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like at this time of night to do three things as quickly as I can. First, I should like to congratulate the maiden speakers, as others have done. Secondly, I should like to summarise the essence of the attack which we have sought to make on Government policy so far tonight; and, thirdly, I should like to deal with one or two aspects of the debate, and in particular the impact of Government
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0086"/>
<col>155</col>
policies on employment and the family, which I do not think has yet been fully discussed.<lb/>
It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Brooks of Tremorfa, the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, of Transport House, and the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, lately of another place, on the excellent speeches they have made. They have obviously given us the result of their experiences in local government, Parliament, Transport House and shopping queues. We welcome what they have said. We welcome their recruitment to our ranks and we look forward to hearing from them frequently. I would, though, find it a little surprising&#x2014; that all three maiden speakers came from this side of the House; were it not for the fact that the great majority of speakers also came from this side of the House.<lb/>
That means that I have to spend a little time saying something about the only speech which has come from the other side of the House so far: the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull. I thought she was very well named tonight. I thought she did her best for them: I thought she was faithful to what their policies were. I expected her to do that. It was not all that convincing, but I expected her to try. I think the remarkable thing about that speech was that even the noble Baroness admitted that things must get worse before they get better, or at least things must get more frustrating before they get better. The only trouble is that it gets increasingly difficult to believe that things are ever going to get any better when it is increasingly clear that they are getting worse every day. She also raised a notion, of which we have heard quite a lot from the representatives of her party in the other place, that since there is clearly going to be a reduction in public provision we must expect there to be an increase in private provision and that voluntary effort must now expand to take over what the State is not going to do any more.<lb/>
The fact is, of course&#x2014;and this has been borne out in many books, not only Professor Townsend's book&#x2014;that the voluntary societies who perform an essential and indeed expanding role in social provision depend increasingly upon public provision themselves; that the
<col>156</col>
excellent ladies who man the Citizens' Advice Bureaux for nothing depend upon public funds to set them up; that the housing advice centres, and even Dr. Barnardo's, which incidentally is 40 per cent. Public funded, depend upon public provision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00584"><member>Baroness FAITHFULL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I specifically said that the figures that I gave did not include either grants from local authorities or payments by local authorities. The figures that I gave were entirely voluntary contributions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00585"><member>Lord MCCARTHY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. Of course they were. They made up the other 60 per cent. My point is that public provision underpins the voluntary social services. As I was going on to say, even an organisation which one would think was at the very heart of the voluntary area of social service&#x2014;the WRVS&#x2014;raises no money at all of its own. So that voluntary provision depends upon the existence of earlier public provision.<lb/>
Another point she made was that, somehow, we could perhaps supplement the voluntary provision in future by collections, by Bingos or by sponsored walks. You can always do that for popular causes. If you are trying to get money for a kidney machine or to do something about dyslexia, you can get people to pay for causes of that kind. But if you are trying to get money for alcoholics or to look after sex offenders it is a little more difficult. Moreover, the money you get is for new capital. But we have now reached a stage in the National Health Service where, if you really have its interests at heart, you have to think twice before you provide money for more capital equipment on a flag day. That will provide more kidney machins and more expensive capital equipment of all kinds, but only the State will provide the revenue to run it. It is very easy to provide &#x00A3;100,000 for an expensive piece of equipment by voluntary effort, but it may cost &#x00A3;300,000 a year to run it. You do not get money like that from voluntary provision, so there has to be an underpinning of State provision.<lb/>
I turn to the second thing that I want to do tonight; that is, to talk about the essence of the debate that we have sought
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0087"/>
<col>157</col>
to put before the House. In moving the Motion, my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell gave specific details of a whole range of cuts which have already been made in the National Health Service and in private social services&#x2014;longer waiting lists, reductions in domiciliary care, cuts in training social workers, specific cuts in grants to voluntary bodies, specific cuts in school meals and so on. The only answer that we have had so far from the other side is, "We did not intend it to happen. It was not supposed to take place and it has nothing to do with us."He pointed to the fact that it was being done to finance regressive tax concessions, which were bound to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and no answer on that has been given. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Banks, who spoke from the Liberal Benches, agreed, on the whole, with the substance of that charge. But he pointed, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Gaitskell, and others, to the importance of asking the Government tonight what they intend to do about child benefits, and I trust that we shall get an answer.<lb/>
We then had more than 10 speakers from this side of the House, and the only speeches about which I should like to remind the House are those which did not merely fill out and develop the points made so well by my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell, but actually widened the debate to cover new issues. In this respect, I would particularly remind the House of what the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, said about the consequences of the Government's policy so far as housing is concerned, and its effect on immigrant families and young people, also, his point about the need to have some sense of priorities. He said that if there are to be cuts, let us have some priorities. I shall come back to that, for I should also like to mention the noble Baroness, Lady David, who talked about the problems of education and gave a whole series of examples of cuts which we are told were not intended and were not supposed to happen.<lb/>
The only point I want to add to this general debate so far is that we on this side of the House are not asking for the moon. We are not saying that the Government, given the economic situation which this country is in, should go out and meet all the demands for increases in
<col>158</col>
social and personal services. We know that there is an infinity of demand for new nursery schools, old people's homes and so on. It is a question of priorities. We know that this is a low growth economy. We know that we need to control the rate of increase in public expenditure.<lb/>
I have no desire to go back over a whole series of measures which were introduced by recent Governments, many of them by the last Labour Government, in order to try to control and introduce priorities into the use of Government expenditure. I make no apology for cash limits. Until the introduction of cash limits, local authorities could send in supplementary estimates whenever they wanted and they were always paid. This is no way to run the social services. I also make no apology for the introduction of RAWPE into the National Health Service, which was intended to give more money to the under-privileged areas and less money to the more privileged areas. I make no apology for the manpower watch, which was introduced in the Department of the Environment. Until there was some control over the growth of public employment in local government, public expenditure could not be controlled at all. Above all, I make no apology for the introduction into the National Health Service of the principle of not meeting all the revenue consequences whenever additional capital was provided. The introduction of the revenue consequences of capital expenditure was an essential control in the public services, and we are not suggesting that all these things should go.<lb/>
What we are saying is that there is no evidence at the moment that public expenditure is out of control. It is declining, and has declined since 1974 as a percentage of GNP. It has declined in volume less since 1976. The cash limits themselves were underspent in the last two years by 3 per cent. We are saying that even in this context it is only realistic and sensible to honour the proposals for very modest increases in the rate of real increase in Government expenditure, set out in the last Government's blue paper on expenditure plans. That is all we are saying.<lb/>
We are saying that reductions in the volume of expenditure which is now being introduced by this Government is not
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0088"/>
<col>159</col>
being introduced for reasons of control. It is not being introduced to enforce priorities. As has been said, it is being introduced for partisan and ideologically doubtful reasons, to reduce the marginal rate of taxation to 25 per cent., to find additional money for certain things. And let me say, while I am on this point, that it is just not true to suggest&#x2014;in fact, it is devious in the extreme&#x2014;that we are to have the same level of public expenditure in real terms in all the main services this year as last year. The Government intend to spend more money in a number of areas&#x2014;on law and order, on defence and on private schools&#x2014;and this is to come within the overall figure which they say is to remain the same.<lb/>
Then, again, if the National Health Service continues as it has been continuing, it will need more money simply to stop where it is, because of the age structure of the population. No provision is made for that. Also, no one can tell what this Government are going to do, and how far they are going to fund the many references before the Clegg Commission. These references are not fully funded now. They were not supposed to be fully funded by the last Government, and we do not know what consequences that will have for the overall availability of funds in public expenditure. Above all, we do not know what is to happen to the value of money. We do not know what is going to be the value of the money we have available in the public sector if the level of inflation and the level of wage increases go on rising in the way that it looks as though they are rising at the moment.<lb/>
So I move to the third point I want to raise: the effect of the Government's policies on employment. On the question of employment, I should have thought that we could have hoped to have a very large measure of agreement on all sides of the House. The employment situation in this country is desperate. Especially is it desperate in the medium term. The Treasury model tells us that we shall have 2 million unemployed by 1980&#x2014;or, if it does not, the forecasters ought to be shot because every other model forecasts at least those figures. Also, if we are going to have unemployment at this level we know that we shall have much higher
<col>160</col>
levels of unemployment among young people. If the future resembles the past, we know that we are going to have roughly twice as much unemployment among young people as the average national figure, and we know that in certain parts of the country, as the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, has reminded us, the level of unemployment there is going to be far, far greater.<lb/>
It is in this context that one must turn to what this Government have suggested. The Manpower Services Commission has been asked to make a number of cuts. It was reported in the last edition of the <i>Youth Aid Bulletin</i> that on 13th June last the Secretary of State for Employment wrote to the chairman of the Manpower Services Commission thanking him for his co-operation in making cuts in the 1979&#x2013;80 programme and asking the chairman what could be done to secure major changes, of the order of &#x00A3;100 million to &#x00A3;150 million, in each of the next three years&#x2014;that in the present employment situation. He conceded that these were large savings and suggested that they should be finalised by late July. On 15th June he wrote again seeking significant reductions in the Manpower Services Commission staff and suggesting that this might be done by "performing functions less intensively, or curtailing them or dropping them altogether". In this way, said Mr. Prior, it should be possible to reduce staff expenditure by 10, 15 and 20 per cent. by April 1982. As a result of these two letters, the Manpower Services Commission's office prepared a paper. This indicated, they said, that cuts of this size would involve the ending of the special temporary employment programme during 1981, considerable reductions in existing training programmes, in grants and in ITB operating expenses. The Manpower Services Commission also calculated that to save &#x00A3;150 million it would be necessary to close a number of skill centres and reduce the size of the employment transfer scheme. Not unnaturally, the Manpower Services Commission were unanimous&#x2014;we are speaking here not just of the TUC but of the CBI as well&#x2014;in pressing the Government to minimise these cuts be cause of the rising tide of unemployment which they also must estimate will reach 2 million or so by 1980.<lb/>
It seems to me that the time has come for the Government to exempt the Manpower
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0089"/>
<col>161</col>
Services Commission and to exempt also the job creation scheme&#x2014;which is small enough, in all conscience&#x2014;from the consequences of these cuts. It seems to me that if there is any priority for the Government, this priority should be recognised. And it is not just a priority which is being asked for, as I say, by the TUC. This was a unanimous decision of the Manpower Services Commission. And the most awful thing of all is that this is being done in the name of an ineffective pay policy, required in order, we are told, to cure wage-induced inflation. Yet we all know that it will not cure wage-induced inflation; it will simply raise the level of unemployment.<lb/>
Of course, nobody is saying&#x2014;and I have not come here tonight to say&#x2014;that it is easy to do much about unemployment at the moment. Unemployment rose under the Wilson Government; it rose during three out of the four years of the Heath Government; it rose under the last Labour Government until the last 12 months of that Government. It is caused by a whole range of things which I am certainly not going into at this time of the night. It is becoming extraordinarily difficult for Governments to do anything about unemployment, however much they may wish to do so.<lb/>
But I say that it is insane; I say that it is immoral, in terms not simply of the family but in terms of the economic future of the country at this time, for a Government to give the active creation of unemployment a fundamental role to play in their policy. If you ask the Prime Minister, as she is always being asked, what is going to happen if people get large wage increases this year, you are told that there will just be more unemployment and that this has got nothing to do with the Government&#x2014;as though, in some sense, it will be everybody's fault but the Government's if this happens. In fact, it will be the Government's fault. Because the Government, having declared that they have no need to seek trade union co operation and having rejected all other forms of pay policy, have no alternative but to sweat it out, whatever the cost to investment, competitiveness, unemployment and even family life. Those are some of the reasons why we have put this Motion before the House tonight, and I commend it to all noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00587"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, said at the opening of this debate this is the third debate that we have had on the family in three years. In 1976 we discussed the family on a Motion by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury, and again in 1978 on a Motion introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, which I recall very well.<lb/>
I should like to begin my remarks by congratulating the three maiden speakers whom we have heard this afternoon: the noble Lord, Lord Brooks of Tremorfa, the noble Lord, Lord Underhill&#x2014;may I say to him that if his idea is that he made a non-controversial speech I shall tell all my colleagues that we had better fasten our safety belts when he decides to be controversial&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Galpern. I have listened with great interest to what they have had to say and I shall read it tomorrow in the <i>Official Report.</i><lb/>
Many of the issues which were raised in those debates have been raised here again this afternoon. That is to be expected and to be welcomed because any discussion of the family must touch on the most fundamental and enduring questions that we face as a society&#x2014;the structure of society itself; the responsibility of parents for the upbringing of their children; the economic situation of men, women and children, particularly older children: their opportunities for work, the livelihood they gain from work, the support available to them when they are out of work ; and the major philosophical question about the role of the State in the economy and in the provision of all the services that families need: health, education, housing and social services in particular.<lb/>
In the debate on the Loyal Address earlier this year in another place, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said:
<quote>"The family is the great unit of society&#x2026; It is promoting the family which lies at the heart of our philosophy".</quote>
I should like to state unequivocally at the start of this reply that we stand by this statement, and, despite the criticisms today, I am indeed glad that the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, has introduced his Motion.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0090"/>
<col>163</col>
Having listened, however, to the very many critical speeches which have been made this afternoon, I begin to think that some noble Lords opposite are really under the impression that there exists somewhere or other in Whitehall a crock of gold which, for some inexplicable reason, this Government are unwilling to distribute to the very many deserving causes which they have described at considerable length. The facts, however, are not like that. As the noble Lord, Lord Banks, has said, we as a country are in a serious economic condition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00588"><member>Lord MCCARTHY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Baroness really say that after what I have just said?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00589"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will say now to the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, that I did appreciate a number of his statements, and that if he will contain himself in patience I shall come to them later on in my remarks. We as a country are in a very serious economic condition, living comfortably only by the accident of North Sea oil. We are now, with the exception of Italy and Ireland, the poorest country in Western Europe&#x2014;and no wonder that there are so many poor people in this country; I find it quite as deplorable as anybody else who has spoken today&#x2014;whereas 20 years ago we were the richest. Our economic growth is stagnant and, worse still, our factories today produce about the same amount as they did during the three-day week. Nobody can rejoice at this situation and nobody can want to do anything else but try to improve it. That is why we have made the revitalisation of the economy our over-riding priority, and in order to achieve this, enterprise must be encouraged and rewarded by the reduction of direct taxation. To meet this there must be cuts in Government expenditure. For the truth is that if only we could get economic growth in the economy then we would have the money for all the desirable projects that have been debated today. As it is, if the Opposition really want to help the poor and the needy they should not be complaining about the present economies&#x2014;many of which they themselves would have introduced had they won the election&#x2014;but encouraging both sides of industry to produce more. That is the only way to achieve better services.<lb/>
<col>164</col>
The fact of the matter is, as I have already indicated, total Government expenditure is no less this year than last year in real terms. Indeed it would be interesting to know how a Labour Government, had one been elected, would have financed the extra &#x00A3;4,000 million of expenditure. Would they have put up income tax to 40 per cent., or would they have put up VAT to 20 per cent., or would they have had a combination of both? Or would they indeed have waited for the International Monetary Fund to step in again when the next crisis arose, to force the economies on the Government and to force the cutbacks that they would have had to make? Of course, much of the pain of the present economies is there because they are the end of a large number of economies that were introduced, not with any pleasure on anybody's part&#x2014;certainly not on my part&#x2014;in 1976 by the International Monetary Fund, and it is because we are obliged to make further economies on top of those that the situation today, as my noble friend Lady Faithfull so well explained is in fact a serious one in many parts of local government. I recognise that. That is the truth of our situation and we might all of us just as well face it and not pretend that there is some easy way to get infinitely better public services in this country.</membercontribution></p>

I have listened with great patience to what has been said this afternoon, and I would say to him and to his colleagues that if they really think that by taking every last halfpenny away from every rich person in this country they will pay for the services they are under a misapprehension, because what the May election showed was that in fact, in order to pay for the services, income tax had to be very high for a number of what I think they and I would call "working people", and those working people did not like the high taxes. That was one of the reasons why the Conservatives won the election in May.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00595"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am never certain about elections, but I am sure about the common sense of the British people and they know perfectly well how serious the situation is.<lb/>
I have been asked about our priorities. In our Manifesto we gave two priorities: defence and law and order, which I believe all would agree are basic functions of the State. They are an absolute essential for families because without peace abroad and order at home little is possible at all. At the same time, it is neither possible nor desirable for individuals to provide these services for themselves.<lb/>
Perhaps I should add a further priority; it is a change of attitude, and it is to our approach and a change of attitude on family policy that I now turn. We give the word "family" several meanings: the basic parent-child relationship, the wider blood and marriage relationships that spring from it&#x2014;grandmothers, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, sisters and brothers&#x2014;and the still wider social and neighbourhood networks based on friendships and sharedcommunityexperiences and problems. In all these senses we shall put the family at the forefront of our policies, and what these different conceptions of the family have in common is that they are society's own spontaneous and natural forms of organisation, its best and most enduring protection against loneliness, deprivation, instability and cruelty, and its best&#x2014;indeed its only real&#x2014;sources of energy and progress.<lb/>
To the extent that our political structures help these vital natural resources our country will take a happier and more successful path forward. But over the years trends in government and in the development of public services have put these resources at risk. We have seen a gradual encroachment of the State and public agencies on the lives of individuals. Individuals have been encouraged to depend more on the public sector for employment, for cash support, for social
<col>166</col>
welfare of all kinds. Their sense of responsibility for themselves and their families, their powers of initiative, their ability and willingness to share and solve problems with neighbours, family and friends have all, to a certain extent, been undermined by the gradual but inexorable growth of the public sector, and sometimes frustrated by the unresponsive and bureaucratic structures of some of our public services. It is our aim to bring home to all individuals the extent to which they can and should take responsibility for their families and themselves.<lb/>
We recognise, of course, that certain services need to be publicly provided for a large majority of the population, and that other services and support must be publicly provided for those whose circumstances make it necessary. I should like to reassure everyone that it is no part of our policies to dismantle or damage the major public services or to withdraw cash and other forms of support where it is genuinely needed. Nevertheless there are many times when an individual or a family must say: "How can I help myself?"and not, "What can the State or local government do for me?".<lb/>
In discussing voluntary effort, the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said that it was almost impossible to have voluntary effort without State funding. Of course, one of the difficulties is that we have now reached the situation where, because the State has played so large a part in our lives, there is nowhere else to go for a great deal of funding but to the State or to local government. However, one of our emphases must be the support of the voluntary services, and I hope to see an increase and growth of the whole of the voluntary movement as being one of the most cost-effective ways of providing many of the services which we have. If I may say so again to my noble friend Lady Faithfull, the examples which she gave are very helpful in this respect.<lb/>
We must make clear to society as a whole that progress, creativity and stability are qualities that come from individuals, families and other spontaneous and natural social groupings working together, and they are not qualities that any Government can impose. In one of the first and most immediate roles of the family, the upbringing of children, I acknowledge that the role of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0092"/>
<col>167</col>
parents has in many ways become more difficult over the years. Society is more turbulent than it once was. Its intellectual and moral climate prevents anyone bringing up children with difficult problems and some of the advice available from expert sources is perhaps less than helpful. I am glad to say that few, if any, teachers, sociologists, doctors or social workers would go so far as the comment which a colleague of mine heard at a conference not long ago on family life:
<quote>"Children are far too important to be left to the family".</quote>
But I believe that in general parents are doing what they have always done; namely, providing a basis of emotional security and discipline which is vital for the balanced development of their children. Highly skilled professionals&#x2014;teachers, doctors, nurses and health visitors and in cases of serious difficulty or risk, the social services, all have an essential role to play and it is right that they should be available through the public sector. Because in today's more mobile society the experience of grand-parents in bringing up children is often not so readily available to young parents we should pay more attention to education for parenthood in our schools.<lb/>
In saying this, neither I nor my colleagues believe that the State can or should provide everything. Where parents on their own cannot cope&#x2014;for example, where both are out at work&#x2014;there is a great deal of support available in local communities. Neighbourhood groups, pre-school play groups, family centres can all be organised voluntarily and informally and such initiatives often correspond better to the family's real needs than schemes which are formally organised through the public sector.<lb/>
Turning to the wider social issues, it was no accident that in our Manifesto we grouped changes in a considerable variety of public services under the heading "Helping the Family", including housing, education, health and welfare, the environment, social security, and services for the elderly and the disabled. Our general aim in these fields is to increase the individual's and the family's freedom of choice, to maintain, and, as the economy permits, to improve, all essential public services, and to make the public services
<col>168</col>
more responsive to individual and family needs.<lb/>
I should first like to turn to the elderly, for, oddly enough, although almost every other aspect of family life has been raised this afternoon there has been no mention at all of the 8&#x00BD; million elderly people on retirement pensions in the population, the group of people that is now increasing as a proportion of the total population. I believe that one of the most encouraging aspects of life today is that a higher proportion of elderly people are being cared for by their own families than at any time since the First World War. As the House will know, we are raising retirement pensions on 12th November by nearly 20 percent. thus keeping pensions in line with prices and making up for the shortfall of the previous Government of nearly 2 per cent. in the rise of pensions. This added increase will help the elderly not only with their everyday bills but with their fuel bills this winter. Furthermore, we are pledged to keep pensions in line with prices, and we will pay the &#x00A3;10 Christmas bonus this year as we indicated we would.<lb/>
In housing our policies will give greater freedom of choice to all sections of the community by extending home ownership. I might say to those many people who have raised the question of the sale of council houses, that according to every single survey ever taken the majority of people would like to own the homes they are living in. Therefore it is a desirable policy. It is one that obviously supports the family by giving it, above all, security, and it gives it at the end of the day some thing of value to hand on to the children. So we are entirely committed to our policy of extending home ownership, particularly to council house tenants and first-time buyers, through promoting shared ownership and encouraging the private house-building industry. In addition we hope to bring back an increase of homes into the private rented sector.<lb/>
There are a number of detailed points that I have been asked and I feel it is right that I should now turn to them. I should like to turn first to education. We are introducing shortly in another place a Bill to ensure that parents' wishes are taken into account in the choice of schools for their children, and to ensure among other things that school governing
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0093"/>
<col>169</col>
bodies should give parents a voice in decisions about the schools their children attend. On nursery schools, I should like to reiterate that we do not intend to introduce into our Bill any provision to allow local authorities to charge for nursery education. It is our policy that there shall be co-operation between the DES and the DHSS, and indeed I meet my colleagues of the DHSS regularly to co-operate closely on all matters of provision for the under-fives. The latest figures that I have for nursery education are those of January 1979, when there were about 230,000 children in England and Wales receiving nursery education and a further 234,000 in ordinary classes in primary schools. Over 38 per cent. of all 3 and 4 year-olds were receiving education of whom 19 per cent. were in nursery schools and classes. I accept that this is still some way short of the Plowden target, which envisaged 90 per cent. of 4 year-olds and 50 per cent. of 3 year-olds, mostly on a part-time basis. Nevertheless we continue to move towards the Plowden target, but for the time being we are giving priority in the provision of nursery education to the admission of handicapped and socially disadvantaged children, including children of the ethnic minorities who come from homes where English is not the main language of the family.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00596"><member>Baroness DAVID</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Baroness will forgive me, what are the Government going to do about the five local authorities which are closing all their nursery schools?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00597"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether five authorities have closed all their nursery schools or are thinking about this as one option. So much discussion nowadays concerns people thinking about what they might do, but they have not yet done so. I would hope that this is an area where authorities would look closely at the possibilities that the noble Baroness, Lady David, herself mentioned, of using empty primary school classrooms and of making use of volunteers to help. I believe people should ask themselves how they can meet this need, and I believe that with goodwill a great many of these difficulties could in fact be overcome. It is enormously encouraging how successful the whole of the pre-school play group movement has been. I believe there are now some 300,000 children
<col>170</col>
being looked after in this way in pre school play groups entirely by voluntary organisations. It shows that where people know there is a need it can be met, and I hope very much that this is one of the ways in which we shall use the resources we have as a result of falling roles to meet what is clearly a very greatly felt need.<lb/>
Turning now to the question of school meals, milk and transport, it is our intention in our second Education Bill to allow authorities to make a charge for school meals, provided of course that they provide somewhere in the school where children can bring their own food, for which they must not make any charge at all. We have taken the view over educational expenditure that we wish above all to ensure that the basic fabric of the educational system will not be affected. The Association of County Councils suggested to us that there were three areas of expenditure in education budgets which are not strictly educational matters; those are school meals, milk and transport.<lb/>
I am surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady David, and the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, who took such a gloomy view of what local authorities will do over these matters, they themselves being most distinguished members of local authorities, cannot believe that local authorities will take care of the needy as central Government will do. The present subsidy on school meals is now &#x00A3;400 million annually, and we are hoping for a saving of &#x00A3;200 million, so there will still be a subsidy on school meals which would of course be available to help poor children, and I accept that there are some who will need to be helped. But I think, in the context of everything else, it is not unreasonable in the world today, 1979, nearly 1980, a very different world from that in the war when all this was introduced, when food was rationed, when the average standard of living was considerably lower than now, to look in this context at school meals.<lb/>
The facts are that the actual take-up of school meals is 66 per cent. only of children in attendance at schools. I suspect that part of the reason why there is this short fall of take-up is that children do not always like the meals provided. The boys want one thing and the girls something else and they do not feel like the kind of meal being provided by statute. Is it not more sensible, therefore, to give freedom
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0094"/>
<col>171</col>
to authorities to provide a different sort of meal to meet the conditions of today and to make a charge for it? Incidentally, I am sure I do not need to tell noble Lords opposite that the reason why 5p has gone on school meals this autumn is that this was agreed by the last Labour Government, so it is nothing to do with the Conservative Government. Is it not sensible to look at this enormous expenditure to see if we cannot find a better way of providing a mid-day meal for the children of this country? This is what we are attempting to do. I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, about some Scottish figures. I very much regret that I have not got those with me, but if I can get the answer to the question he raised, I will write to him about it.<lb/>
Turning now to the matter of health and social services, raised by a number of speakers, again the fact is that in real terms personal social services expenditure is very nearly double what it was in 1971&#x2013;72. The reductions which the Government are seeking are on the plans which they inherited which allowed for very considerable growth. In fact, the current expenditure target for local government as a whole in 1979&#x2013;80 is only 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. below the estimates for 1978&#x2013;79 which were prepared towards the end of 1978. It may prove to be an overestimate if the experience of the previous years is repeated. The outfall for 1980&#x2013;81 is only a further 1 per cent.<lb/>
I am sure that ways can be found of stretching resources especially by drawing on the services of the voluntary sector and the potential of the community as a whole. I would once again commend to all in local government the very interesting figures which my noble friend Lady Faithfull gave on boarding out and on fostering. Not only is fostering usually better for children&#x2014;it is undoubtedly cheaper. The great variation between one authority and another is most extra ordinary.<lb/>
In my view, what these matters have done for us all is to cause local authorities and the Government to think very carefully about where their priorities lie. If one has less money to spend, it concentrates the mind in a very real way on the essentials: what one really needs to provide and what could be provided by somebody else. It is in that spirit that
<col>172</col>
I believe everyone needs to look at the situation in which we find ourselves.<lb/>
I was also asked by the noble Lord, Lord Banks, about fuel assistance and those on supplementary benefit. The supplementary benefit allowance goes to families with children under five and the Family Income Supplement Scheme gives &#x00A3;1 a week to all families receiving the supplement. If that is not a complete answer to his question, and he would like me to answer it further by correspondence, I would be very happy to try to do so.<lb/>
I was also asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, about Stoke Mandeville Hospital. I am told that my right honourable friends in the Department of Health and Social Security are well aware of the unique importance of the spinal injuries hospital at Stoke Mandeville. There are a number of special Questions down in another place to the Secretary of State on this matter and I can promise the noble Baroness that I shall answer all the points that she has raised as soon as I am able to do so. However, she may like to know that all the possible savings that she quoted in the long list that she gave, are not savings that have been made&#x2014;they are simply alternatives that have been considered. I assure her that no decisions have, in fact, been taken on any of them as yet.<lb/>
I was asked also about the whole question of immigration policy. My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Mr. Raison, who is responsible for immigration policy, gave an indication earlier this month that the new rules on immigration would not debar the partners of British women born here. I hope that when they do appear&#x2014;and I understand that they will appear in a Government paper&#x2014;they will solve the anxieties of many people who have made representations on this particular point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00598"><member>Lord MISHCON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Baroness would give way for a moment. She emphasised the words "born here". Therefore, is it her Government's policy that British women who are subjects of this country, but who were not born here, will be hit?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00599"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that I am in a position to give
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0095"/>
<col>173</col>
an answer to that question at this stage. It is obviously a most important point that has been raised and if I may I shall write to the noble Lord upon it because I would not want in any way to mislead the House on a matter of immigration policy. I was also asked whether or not women who are employed in small firms might no longer be subject to the Protection of Employment Acts if they are having a baby. I should like once again to assure noble Lords that that is a matter which has been dealt with in writing in Government proposals for changes in the provisions of the Employment Protection Act, on which no decision has yet been. taken.<lb/>
I should now like to answer the questions which were raised with me by the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell. I am very glad that he gave notice of those questions and I shall do my best to answer them. He asked first about child benefit and indeed that issue was raised by a number of noble Lords. I confirm that we recognise the importance of child benefit, but I regret to say that I cannot give a guarantee this evening that there will be an increase in child benefit in April 1980, as he has asked. Secondly, he asked whether the Government intended, as the <i>Guardian</i> leaks suggest, to make people wait six days for sickness benefit; abolish maternity and death grants; delay women's pensions until 65; and abolish the earnings-related supplement. On all those matters I can only tell him that reports have recently appeared in the Press that the Secretary of State for Social Services is considering whether to achieve the necessary cuts in public expenditure by one or more of a range of options. The responsible Ministers have to explore the whole range of theoretical possibilities for savings, to assess what is involved. Other Governments have done much the same. The social implications are in mind, as well as the savings, and no decisions have yet been taken on any of these matters.<lb/>
The last question he asked me was whether we intended to postpone any further up-rating in benefits until 1983&#x2013;84. I think that the noble Lord can reasonably expect the Government's legislation restricting the statutory up-rating guarantee to prices, to retain the assumption of annual up-ratings. I hope that that will meet his point. We have said that, as
<col>174</col>
far as the retirement pensioners are concerned, the pensions will keep up with prices and we stand by that. We have already indicated that pensions will increase on 12th November, as we promised in our manifesto, and on that occasion they will be slightly more than keeping up with prices.<lb/>
In conclusion I should like to say that the House and the time do not allow me to answer all the many questions that have been raised. I shall study the <i>Official Report</i> carefully and write to noble Lords on the points that I have already indicated. I do think in this connection&#x2014;and I say this in all sincerity&#x2014;that we must keep a sense of proportion about what is going on.<lb/>
As regards local authority expenditure, the Government have asked for a saving for 1980&#x2013;81 of 5 per cent. on anticipated expenditure. It is not 5 per cent. on actual expenditure, but 5 per cent. on the former Government's proposals. We must recognise that the Government are spending as much this year as last year. Therefore, to talk about the dismantling of the Welfare State or family policies, is right out of turn.<lb/>
It is easy to exaggerate, for example, the Assisted Places Scheme. The Assisted Places Scheme would not even come into any of the discussion that we have had at all because it cannot conceivably begin before September 1981 and the cuts that we are talking about are for the financial year 1980&#x2013;81. Even then it would begin on a much more modest scale than has been described. I should like to give the assurance that, even if we did not have the Assisted Places Scheme, it is a completely separate budget and there would be no more money for education. I give that as an illustration of how easy it is to get a great deal of this matter out of proportion. I am sorry for it, but it can worry people who should not he worried and I do not think that it is helpful in a public discussion of the economy at a time when we all wish that things were better than they are.<lb/>
The Government remain committed to policies to support the family. We shall be publishing the report of the Central Policy Review Staff entitled, <i>People and Their Families,</i> which I believe will be of great help and interest to all those who have taken part in the debate today, as
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0096"/>
<col>175</col>
well as to many individuals and organisations outside.<lb/>
Two years ago I introduced a debate on the family at the Conservative Party Conference. I said then that the family stood for four great principles: for stability, continuity, individual responsibility and self-help. We need those qualities today. That is why we, as a party, will do all that we can to support the family, to help the family to help itself and to do so in the wider network of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00600">8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00601"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that it is the view of the House that, as we have had a debate lasting a good many hours, it should not be prolonged much longer. It is perfectly true that both sides have said all that they wanted to say but I shall ask the indulgence of noble Lords for three or four minutes in order to make one or two comments on what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said in her summing up. Before doing so, may I say that the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, was in a very difficult position in having to support policies which she must know from her experience will have a devastating effect upon the family. However, she probably will not admit to this. What surprised me about her contribution was the fact that I seem to remember not so very long ago she joined my noble friend Lord Parry in demanding from the Labour Government that more money and attention should be given to the care of the mentally and physically handicapped. If I have understood her correctly now, she is agreeing to those people being deprived. I wonder whether the noble Baroness has changed her mind because there has been a change of Government. In my view the whole basis of her argument resulted in a recommendation that family adversity is a virtue. However, it certainly is not a virtue for a family that is living in poverty. It is no good saying that there must be changes, that people must accept them and put up with them. If you are living in poverty, a few coppers makes all the difference.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Young, whom I should like to thank for trying to reply so fully to this debate&#x2014;and those of us who have been in her position know only too well that it is most difficult to sit down and feel satisfied with all the replies that you have given&#x2014;asked
<col>176</col>
whether we, on this side of the House, think that there is a crock of gold. Yes, there was a crock of gold of &#x00A3;4,500 billion which the Government gave to the richest people in this country&#x2014;at least, they gave almost the whole of it, 34 per cent. of it. That crock of gold could have been used in a very different fashion.<lb/>
Our main complaint against the Government is that they embarked upon this almost overnight, without giving any notice at all to local authorities. Local authorities were not given time to plan how these cuts were to be made, and they had to make them in a hasty and piecemeal manner. I think that that is largely the cause of the trouble. The noble Baroness asked what we would have done if we had been faced with this situation. All I can say is that I hope that we would not have run away from the responsibility of sitting down with the local authorities&#x2014;and a number of professional bodies represent local authorities&#x2014;and saying: "This must be done; let us work out a plan as to how it can be done".<lb/>
I should like to thank the three maiden speakers. I cannot imagine that a situation will arise again where there will be three maiden speakers in a debate which, right from the beginning, was going to be controversial. On the whole, they discharged their responsibilities extremely well. I wanted to give my noble friend Lord Mishcon a piece of advice, but as I believe that all advice is bad and good advice is fatal, I shall not attempt to do so. However, I agree that the noble Baroness is all that he says: courteous, charming and very delightful. I have known her much longer than he has. I say to him, do not be taken in by that, for underneath there exists a tough, thoroughbred Tory. I beg leave to withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DOCKLANDS (LONDON): REGENERATION</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00603">8.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00604"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government, in view of the continuing dereliction of the London docklands, what is their policy towards assisting private enterprise to encourage active participation in the regeneration of this area.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0097"/>
<col>177</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00605">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the designated area of Docklands is but a small part of the tip of five boroughs: Tower Hamlets, Newham, Greenwhich, Lewisham, and Southwark and it takes up an area of about 8&#x00BD; square miles. The majority of its land fringes on the Thames, with perhaps part of Newham not quite so adjacent. With containers and larger ships Tilbury became the modern deep-water dock for London and its principal port. Therefore, the other docks on the river declined and the decline was made even greater by the fact that there were other ports on the East and the South coasts of England.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00606">During the last 30 years neither Government nor private enterprise were prepared to invest any money in this area and so alas! it slipped into even more disuse and ultimate degradation and dereliction. In olden times ships got as close as possible to the City of London, which is why the first bridge that we have is Tower Bridge. The only other links that we have down stream crossing the Thames are the Rotherhithe Tunnel, the Blackwall Tunnel, the Woolwich Ferry, the Greenwich pedestrian tunnel and the Dartford Tunnel. Without adequate road and rail access the whole area has become totally unviable for industry and commerce. There have been recent proposals for northern and southern relief roads which would give access to the motorways and thus link the North and the South of the Thames. They would run from the Isle of Dogs to the east end of the Surrey Docks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00607">In 1971 the Department of the Environment closely examined the area and all five boroughs requested assistance from the GLC so that they could start new industries. Thus, in 1974 the Docklands Joint Committee was formed and the then Secretary of State for the Environment called for the release of statutory land. Since then virtually nothing has happened. The dock workers have had a very hard time, watching their livelihood vanish and disappear before their eyes. They fought a strong but unavailing rearguard action. As a result they have had to have generous redundancy and resettlement arrangements to alleviate their troubles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00608">No new jobs are being generated in the area as industry will not move there unless it has a proper road infrastructure. In another
<col>178</col>
place last night in a debate on the London Transport Bill the honourable Member for Newham said:
<quote>"Everyone is agreed that there should be development in dockland. The question is: what sort should it be? Everyone is agreed that there should be better transport in dockland. The questions are: what sort of transport, where shall the money come from and what type of facilities shall the community invest in?"&#x2014; [<i>Offical Report,</i> Commons, 23/10/79, cols. 294&#x2013;5.]</quote>
The present population of Docklands is about 55,000. The Greater London population is just under seven million and the South-East standard region has a population of nearly 17 million. With the ever-increasing fuel costs and the evermore vital need for conservation of fuel, which has been so firmly stated by Her Majesty's Government, surely there must be a very strong logistic case to be made out for encouraging industry and commerce in this area, the most densely populated area of its size in the whole of Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00609">Your Lordships will well know that in the past port may well have improved through long sea journeys, but cornflakes and detergents do not improve; they simply cost more, particularly if the consumer is 100 miles or more away from the factory. Since 1971 each borough has remained very largely parochial and independent in its outlook on Docklands. These boroughs have not looked really beyond their own boundaries. I say this without acrimony because local councils are elected to look after local needs. I maintain that central Government must look after the overall picture and the "national interest". The development of this dilapidated and derelict area, which is a disgrace to the nation, must be of prime national concern. If the area was put under one authority it would immediately qualify for assistance from the EEC. I shall come back to this in a moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00610">The present planning proposals show a complete lack of awareness of the role that private enterprise and investment will play in the redevelopment of the area provided public works are committed to improving the access. But there must also be a guarantee that at some future date there will not be a cut-back. No major institution or pension fund&#x2014;and there are many&#x2014;will invest millions of pounds in a section of Docklands only to discover
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0098"/>
<col>179</col>
that the main access to service the development might be postponed for two or three years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00611">I have seen letters of intent from some of the largest funds stating that they will not proceed without this assurance. I contend that the Government have no right to hinder further the implemention of the road infrastructure. The area is fast becoming a graveyard. Young people are moving away and soon only the old will remain. It is an indictment of Government that they have not yet taken instant power to reverse the situation. It would capture the imagination of the whole nation were the Government to act forthrightly. After all, Her Majesty's Government give incentives for industrial development in parts of South Wales, North West Scotland, and various other parts of the United Kingdom both to developer and to tenant. I should like to know what advantages and incentives there are for private industry to come to London's own Docklands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00612">The unemployment level is high in the Docklands area&#x2014;probably about 1 in 9. That was the figure quoted last night in another place. It is unfortunate that the employment exchanges overlap the boundaries so that it is difficult to get a precise figure for the particular area, but it is probably as high as anywhere in the whole of the United Kingdom. In the circumstances it would be shameful if the Government failed to designate Dock-lands as an assisted area and thus entitle it to achieve aid from the EEC. There are three sources of aid from the EEC. First, the European Social Fund; secondly, the European Regional Development Fund; and thirdly, the European Investment Bank. The Secretary of State has it in his power to breathe new life into the area now, and one of my questions will be to request that he should do so forth with and thus end the shameful state that exists in our otherwise great and magnificent capital city.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00613">One of the original questions I was going to ask was that the Government should form an Urban Development Corporation to control and develop the Docklands area. I am certainly not alone in welcoming the announcement by the Secretary of State that legislation to create such a corporation will be included
<col>180</col>
in the forthcoming Local Government Planning and Land Bill next month. It has however been implied in the Press that the consultative document on the creation of these new urban development corporations may well make it out that they will not come into being until 1981. I should like to plead with, or even ask, my noble friend if he will endeavour to see that this date should be advanced to March 1980 at the latest. Such a delay will only put a further break on development of the area, which would be in tolerable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00614">The consultative document issued by the Department of the Environment last week sets out the reason for forming an Urban Development Corporation and one must accept that the motive is correct. It is to put the area under a single autonomous body since the Docklands Joint Committee has failed to produce results, and there have been far too much talk, far too many plans, and far too few results. However, this can be rectified.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00615">For your Lordships' information, these bodies which exist at the moment at great expense are there basically to make London's Docklands viable. They are the Docklands Joint Committee; the Docklands Land Board; and the Dock-lands Development Organisation. I should like to suggest as an immediate and possible alternative to the Urban Development Corporation, why not give the Docklands Land Board the right to acquire and assemble land by compulsory purchase, if necessary, and have public sector land, in the area, transferred to that Board? For example, the surplus land owned by the Port of London Authority. Will the Government confirm that such land, which is incidentally 27 per cent. of the area, could be transferred to the agency that exists for this purpose; i.e., the Docklands Land Board?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00616">I agree that it is the intention that the Urban Development Corporation will have this power in any event, financed by the Treasury on a grant and borrowing basis, so why not the Docklands Land Board? Such acquisitions would be on the recommendation of the Docklands Development Organisation. Since we know that the necessary millions of pounds will not be forthcoming from the Midastic pension funds and insurance companies, unless the northern and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0099"/>
<col>181</col>
southern relief roads are guaranteed, the Minister could authorise their construction and then pass the control to the Docklands Development Organisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00617">Finally, since the results have been pathetic in relation to the whole concept and urgency of implementation of a positive renewal of the area, let us remove the deadwood, streamline the Docklands Committee, Organisation and Board, and elect one man as absolute chairman over the three agencies, answerable directly to the Secretary of State. The qualifications of that individual, beyond total integrity, would be an excellent and successful business career combined with an understanding and sympathy for the area. A man, in short, who is altruistic, commercial, and a fearless and brave leader. I refuse to believe that we do not have a character like that somewhere in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00618">I have already given my noble friend Lord Bellwin notice of some of my questions with a view, hopefully, of trying to make this debate rather more constructive than it otherwise might be. I ask first, in view of the urgency of the problem, will the Minister take special powers for the formation and commencement of the Urban Development Corporation, to bring the date forward to March 1980 at the latest? Secondly, should this not be practicable, will the Minister invest the necessary authority in the existing Dock-lands Committee, Organisation and Board simultaneously appointing an overall chairman, and insisting at the same time on rational streamlining of the existing authorities? Thirdly, will the Government immediately declare the area designated as docklands an "assisted area" so that it may properly benefit through the EEC Regional and other funds? It seems that the Government, quite rightly, feel that we may be paying too much as our share to the EEC. Maybe we are, but we could get back what we are paying many times over if this project could be given the go-ahead.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00619">Fourthly, could my noble friend the Minister ensure that the private sector is properly represented on the Board and/or Boards which would thus weld the sharp edge of enlightened enterprise to what has been the blunt blade of bureaucracy? Fifthly, can my noble friend give an assurance that the Secretary of State will
<col>182</col>
meet a representative body from the private sector in the very near future, to quote that horrible expression, "like right now", bearing in mind that the private sector wishes to promote Dock-lands in conjunction with local and central Government? Sixthly, will the Government, without further delay guarantee a starting and finishing date for the northern and southern relief roads? Last night in another place the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport said:
<quote>"We must look at the needs of Docklands. Everyone is agreed that there are important transport deficiencies in the way of reviving Docklands. Providing the proper transport infrastructure is a key point in getting the Dock-lands strategy moving".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 23/10/79, col. 310.]</quote>
This would allow pension and other funds to concentrate new development in the area. One would imagine, for example, that the National Coal Board pension fund would prefer to help its deprived brothers in Docklands rather than speculate vast sums in the United States.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00620">My last question, No. 7, is this: Bearing in mind that the public is ignorant of the true connotation of Docklands, particularly as the area is no longer really a dockland, will Her Majesty's Government state that their intentions for the rehabilitation of this area are of such vital importance to the nation that they will designate it as "New London"? Her Majesty's Government believe in private enterprise. Docklands is not a lame duck; it is a goose that will lay a golden egg, for vast employment and productivity will be generated if the Government will take the initiative, and hundreds of millions of pounds from the private sector is waiting for the green light.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00622"><member>Lord PONSONBY of SHULBREDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am always suspicious of grandiose plans in the planning field. Having been involved in planning problems in London for more than 20 years and having seen the developments which have taken place, one becomes even more suspicious of grandiose plans. In particular, I can think of two of the major problems in London with which I have been associated&#x2014;the problem of the redevelopment of Piccadilly Circus and the problem of the redevelopment of Covent Garden. Both of those areas
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0100"/>
<col>183</col>
had grandiose plans drawn up for them at different points in hisotry and those plans were subsequently shelved, and a piecemeal development more in line with current thought among environmentalists took place in those areas.<lb/>
Docklands is, of course, very different in scope from the other inner urban areas, but it is still a problem of urban redevelopment; it is not a green field situation. I thank the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for initiating this short debate. Successive Governments and administrations at County Hall and Whitehall have tried to tackle the problem of Docklands for a number of years. In 1973 the Government/GLC-sponsored Travers-Morgan inquiry suggested five possible approaches to the problems of Docklands and none of those was found acceptable at that time.<lb/>
However, they offered a way forward and led to the question of the practicability of dealing with the artificially drawn Dock-lands area being discussed. The alter natives then discussed were the questions whether there should be a London borough GLC administration or a new town-type corporation for Docklands, and it was after considerable consultation, with the blessing of the then Secretary of State, Mr. Geoffrey Rippon, that it was agreed that a Docklands Joint Committee should be established on which representatives of local authorities involved in the area, including the GLC, should be represented, with an additional number of members on the Joint Committee to be appointed by the Secretary of State.<lb/>
The area of Docklands&#x2014;and we have had an even longer historical survey than the slightly different historical survey which Lord Kimberley gave tonight&#x2014;includes large portions of some of the boroughs involved, and of the total area of 5,500 acres, 4,000 are within Tower Hamlets and Newham, which between them are currently contributing about &#x00A3;20 million in public sector investment out of the total investment of &#x00A3;50 million which is being made. The effect of the setting up of an urban development corporation would be to deny democratic representation in these matters to the boroughs concerned, and this is particularly serious in the case of the Newham London borough where one-third of the borough is within the Docklands area.<lb/>
<col>184</col>
The noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, intimated that one of the problems of the redevelopment of Docklands is resources. Successive Administrations have been asked to provide more resources for this purpose, and in particular both parties at different times in power on the GLC have unsuccessfully argued with successive Ministers of Transport that there should be money for the extension of the Jubilee Line. I understand that the Leader of the GLC has reluctantly accepted the view of the present Secretary of State about the need for the restraint of local government expenditure, but nobody should suppose that that is the end of the battle for funds to be made available for the extension of this underground railway system. The noble Earl rightly pointed to the importance of having a proper roads structure in Docklands. Equally important in my view is the question of the public transport structure, particularly through the Jubilee Line, which would immediately, by being built, bring the whole of Docklands much closer to the centre of London.<lb/>
Unfortunately, on the question of funds being made available, the consultation paper by the Department of the Environment on Urban Development Corporations indicates in paragraph 17 that UDCs will he provided with resources adequate for them to undertake their tasks "allocated as necessary from relevant programmes". The implication of that is certainly seen to be that there will be no additional moneys available other than cash which is in existing programmes. That is a sad situation because it requires a high level of public investment to get the infra-structure of Docklands right.<lb/>
Public sector investment is running this year at some &#x00A3;51 million ; it is expected to go in 1980&#x2013;81 to &#x00A3;67 million and in 1981&#x2013;82 to some &#x00A3;79 million, and of course this money is being used by the Docklands Joint Committee to improve roads within the Docklands area, to improve transport services, to improve sites, to infill docks and variously to consolidate particular sites within the area. There has been factory construction in Greenwich; there is an industrial park in Newham of some 65 acres which is being sponsored by private investment; News International is proposing to move into the Tower Hamlets part of Docklands
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0101"/>
<col>185</col>
and that will provide about 3,000 jobs there; and Billingsgate fish market is proposing a move to West India Dock, though I suppose one could not say that will create extra jobs because the jobs are being shifted from the City of London into the West India Dock area. Internally within the areas there has been the move of a brewery on to the former site of Standard Telephones.<lb/>
An advantage which the Joint Committee now enjoys is that it is now able to advertise sites, which should help development further. However, it should be said that none of the sites within Docklands is particularly big. In fact, there is only one which is over 20 acres in size. This is the site where there was formerly proposed a development by Trammel Crow who withdrew from development because they could not get the necessary guarantees. There have been a number of subsequent suggestions about what should happen on this particular site. Only last week Taylor Woodrow announced proposals for developing the site, which would bring at least 9,000 jobs to this part of Southwark, and which should regenerate extra rates of &#x00A3;11 million a year. This particular proposal includes a shopping centre which would be nearly twice as big as the Brent Cross scheme in North-West London.<lb/>
Unfortunately, there is not likely to be any speedy decision on these ideas, because I understand that the GLC is in the process of announcing a competition for the development of the use of this particularly large and important site in Docklands. I understand that the holding of the competition will mean that there will not be a decision on this particular part of Docklands until the end of July. I should like to support the noble Earl in the point about how everything seems to drag along and take a very long time. This competition will delay matters further.<lb/>
The proposal to set up the Urban Development Corporation is seen by many people involved as adding to the time being taken in dealing with this question. As I said in my opening remarks, my fear is that once again we shall be thinking in terms of drawing up some elaborate scheme, whereas to allow the process of development in certain parts of Docklands to proceed would bring about a slow rejuvenation of the area rather than the sterilising of large
<col>186</col>
parts of it. This is the kind of lesson that I have particularly learnt from past experiences of inner urban redevelopment in London.<lb/>
The strategic plan drawn up by the Docklands Joint Committee proposes a population increase from about 56,000 to between 100,000 and 120,000 over a period of years. The plan also comments on the inadequacy of the transport facilities and the need for a number of new developments in the area. The message must be there that things are happening in Docklands. It is wrong to say that nothing at all is happening. I would plead with the Government that whatever decisions are eventually arrived at with regard to the Development Corporation, action on it should be taken sooner rather than later. As the corporation is to be included with wider legislation to be introduced shortly, I believe that it will probably not get onto the Statute Book until next summer. Thus, the corporation could not be set up until after that time, and it would be a long time before it could be effective. In closing, I wish once more to thank the noble Earl for raising this matter this evening. It is a question of great concern to London, and it is important in terms of the problem of the vitality of our City being solved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00623">8.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00624"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARY of STATE, DEPARTMENT of the ENVIRONMENT (Lord Bellwin)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we took office we made it one of our priorities to review the problems of the inner areas of our great cities and the arrangements for dealing with them. These areas are vital to the prosperity of the country; indeed, they are the very areas on which so much of our past economic strength was built. But they are often now also areas of bad housing and social conditions, and they have been caught between the rising expectations of living standards and rapidly changing economic forces. Old industries have become obsolete and have run down, moved away, or simply died. They have left behind a legacy of decay and frustration. People, particularly the young and skilled, have moved away to better houses and jobs, leaving behind those less able to look after themselves, the elderly and the poor.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0102"/>
<col>187</col>
London's Docklands have been particularly badly affected. The once great docks have largely moved down river, and the industries and population who serviced them have gone, too. Much of the area has become derelict. This has left not only great problems, but also probably the greatest opportunity for urban redevelopment and regeneration in the country, if not indeed in Europe. The situation in Docklands needs special measures if it is to be tackled effectively, and I shall come to these in a moment. The first objective must be to create the conditions in which people will once again want to live and to work, and where enterprise and industry will flourish. As with other areas, it is most likely to prosper in an economic climate which encourages private initiative and investment.<lb/>
In the very short time that we have been in office the Government have already taken several important steps in this direction. As well as the reductions in direct taxation announced in the Budget, and already beginning to take effect, there have been specific measures and proposals which have a bearing on areas like Docklands. Releasing suitable land for development is an essential ingredient in the regeneration process and one group of measures is aimed at that.<lb/>
The rate of development land tax has been reduced and the amount of development value which can be realised in any one year has been increased. Local authorities can now dispose of development land, by sale or long lease, without reference to Government, and the rest of the unnecessary paraphernalia of the Community Land Scheme will soon be swept away. We are taking steps to speed up the release of unused land held by public bodies. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has announced the Government's intention to require such land to be registered, and if there is no good reason for it to be unused, there will be a power to require it to be offered for sale. Restrictions on office and industrial developments have been relaxed by abolishing the office development permit system and by raising the limits for industrial development certificates.<lb/>
<col>188</col>
As a further encouragement to industry, we have asked planning authorities to be more sympathetic to small firms wishing to set up or remain in business in urban areas. Another matter which I know many people complain about is the delays involved in obtaining planning permission. Steps are being taken to reduce the time taken to deal with planning appeals, and we have urged local authorities to deal more quickly with planning applications.<lb/>
All these and other measures will help to encourage development and stimulate economic regeneration. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment recently announced the Government's decision on the special arrangements necessary for tackling the problems of the inner cities. He said&#x2014;and I think it is worth repeating:
<quote>"I would like to see inner cities once again be full of hustle and bustle on a human scale, varied, alive; above all, places where people are free to develop and to succeed".</quote>
How will this be brought about in Docklands? The Docklands area of London stretches for about seven miles down river from Tower Bridge. It is broken up by the river and by local authority boundaries, so that it consists physically and administratively of several distinct parts. They all suffer from similar problems associated with the closure and decline of the docks, and from a range of other environmental and social problems, which they share with other parts of the Docklands boroughs.<lb/>
My Lords, it has been recognised for some years that to tackle the particular problems of the Docklands area special measures are and were necessary. During the last Conservative Administration, a study of the area was commissioned jointly by my department and the Greater London Council, and various schemes for redevelopment were proposed. Although none of these was adopted, the momentum led to the formation, in January 1974, of the Docklands Joint Committee, on which the GLC and the five Docklands boroughs were represented. It exercised power by delegation from the constituent authorities, and its main task was to produce a strategic plan for the development of the area. In the five years or so since the DJC was set up, a good deal has been happening in Docklands. A strategic plan was published in July 1976. The first operational programme, published
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0103"/>
<col>189</col>
two years later, included an analysis of progress towards redevelopment. That showed good progress, in providing some of the infrastructure and services essential to the redevelopment of the area, draining and filling old docks, laying trunk sewers and drains, building new roads, improving public transport and providing essential services. So far as it goes, what has been achieved reflects credit on the DJC and the local authorities involved.<lb/>
On the other hand, within the totality of the needs of the area progress has been disappointing. Although the number of houses built has been in line with the target, they have been predominantly in the public sector. There has been a serious shortfall in private housing, and it must be very doubtful, if the present arrangements were to continue, whether a reasonable mix of tenure would be achieved, and new, large council estates are by no means what is needed. Even more important has been the failure to attract new private industrial and commercial investment on anything like the scale needed to regenerate the economy. It is clear, therefore, that far stronger measures are needed.<lb/>
As I said earlier, the Docklands area provides us with a tremendous opportunity. My Lords, "the bottle may well be half empty, but it is also half full". Indeed, it is probably unique in Europe as a large area for redevelopment adjacent to the heart of a major commercial city. What happens in Dock-lands is important not just for East London, but for the country as a whole. If the opportunity is to be fully grasped, it will need a degree of commitment and singleness of purpose that it would be unreasonable to expect within the present arrangements. In short, it is not a task which the local authorites, acting on their own and through a joint committee, can be expected to tackle successfully. That is not a criticism of the authorities involved. Indeed, as I have said, within the constraints of the machinery available to them they have achieved a great deal. But the machinery is not good enough.<lb/>
My Lords, that is why the Government have announced their intention to seek powers to set up urban development corporations&#x2014;to tackle such problems&#x2014;and one of these corporations will operate in London's Docklands. Legislation to achieve this will be introduced soon. I
<col>190</col>
do not wish today to anticipate the debate that we shall undoubtedly have later, but noble Lords will wish to know the outline of the Government's intentions in this matter. The legislation will seek to allow the Secretary of State to designate areas in which urban development corporations are to operate. As well as London's Docklands, it is envisaged that a development corporation will operate in parts of the dock areas of Merseyside. The terms of the legislation will be modelled on that under which new towns operate. It will contain a range of powers which could include planning, land assembly and disposal for private sector development, industrial and commercial promotion and development, environmental improvement, housing, and the provision of infra-structure.<lb/>
The next stage will be to make special designation orders for each UDC. Those will contain the particular range of powers that the UDC is to have, and will define the boundaries of its area. The orders will be subject to Affirmative Resolution. It is proposed that the main legislation should afford the urban development corporation power to acquire and assemble land, by compulsory purchase if necessary. To ensure that it owned sufficient land to begin its task speedily, it is envisaged that the designation order should make provision for the transfer of some public sector land direct to the UDC. The development corporations will be provided with resources adequate for them to undertake their tasks. But I must stress (to return directly to my noble friend's Question) that underlying our whole approach to this matter is the realisation that the most important ingredient of all is private sector finance. The Government's role is to create the right conditions. Their financial contribution must be limited to providing the services and facilities which only they can provide, and which are essential to attract the massive private investment needed.<lb/>
The UDCs will not be massive bureaucracies; that would defeat the main aim. Neither will they take over all the powers and duties of local authorities. Their main task will be economic regeneration. Some of the powers will be exercised jointly with the local authorities. For example, to the extent that the local authorities are willing and able to provide
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0104"/>
<col>191</col>
the appropriate housing and infrastructure needs of the UDC, then it would make good sense for them to do so. The local authorities will continue to be responsible, either solely or jointly, for a wide range of services. So it really is a nonsense to say, as has been suggested elsewhere, that the UDCs will disenfranchise people in the area.<lb/>
It is of the essence of a new town type corporation that members of the board are appointed, not elected. One alternative, I suppose, would have been to create a new London borough of Docklands, but I doubt whether anyone would seriously argue that case. My noble friend Lord Kimberley asked whether the private sector would be represented on the board. Yes, it will be. I cannot today discuss the structure of the board, but it will certainly include prople with an expertise in securing major new private sector investment; and it will also include people having a special knowledge of the locality.<lb/>
I sympathise with the point made by my noble friend Lord Kimberley that, in view of the urgency of the problem, the UDCs should be set up as soon as possible. That is indeed the Government's aim; but I think the date he mentioned&#x2014;March 1980&#x2014;is too optimistic. I doubt if the enabling legislation will be on the Statute Book by then. It might, however, be sensible to think in terms of making an early appointment of the chairman designate, and possibly some at least of the board members. They would then be placed to take up their full duties effectively as soon as the UDC was designated. We will certainly consider that.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Kimberley also made, I think, two other points. He asked whether Docklands would be given assisted area status. The answer is: No, that is not our intention. He further asked whether the Government would guarantee the start and finish dates for the northern and southern relief roads. My Lords, this Government are certainly brave, but to guarantee the completion date of major new road schemes would indeed be giving hostage to fortune! I take my noble friend's point, though: better roads and better tranport infrastructure in general are vital. The
<col>192</col>
Minister for Transport recognises this, and has already announced his commitment to getting the right tranport links in and for Docklands.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to emphasise two points. The new development corporation will indeed have a crucial part to play, but the GLC and the boroughs will also continue to have very important roles. If the regeneration of Docklands is to be successfully achieved, there will need to be a high degree of co-operation between all the agencies involved. It is perfectly understandable that the local authorities would have preferred a different arrangement, perhaps a strengthening of the DJC, but I hope and believe that at the end of the day, with the best interests of the area as the prime objective, they will co-operate with the UDC. The second point is that we should not underestimate the size of the task. Docklands has been in decline for several decades; it will still take years to halt the decline and regenerate the economy. The Government believe that the appointment of a special development corporation will significantly speed up the process, while clearly recognising that it will not happen over night.<lb/>
My Lords, it would be so easy to drift along as we have been doing, seeing modest progress taking place, a little here, a little there. That way would mean no requirement for new powers, no aggravation with dissenting parties; just a faint stirring of the waves. In five and ten years' time the situation would surely be marginally better&#x2014;but nothing would have fundamentally changed. This Government are not prepared to allow that to happen. That sort of scene has been with us for too long now and the time has come for firm and bold action. That is the Government's intention; that is what the formation of the UDCs is all about.<lb/>
I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Kimberley for raising this matter tonight, thereby affording me the opportunity to set out the Government's thinking and intentions on this most pressing situation. If I have not covered every point he has made, I will carefully read the transcript of this debate and will write to him. May I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, for his constructive remarks. As to the point he made regarding the precise
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0105"/>
<col>193</col>
amount and source of additional funds which will go into the UDC, we shall have to await the Government's decision on that. I hardly think that the noble Lord would expect me to answer that question tonight. I thank him for his helpful contribution. The points he made are very relevant.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00662">To ask Her Majesty's Government what has been the trend in Britain's international competitiveness over the last two years in terms of a common currency, measured (<i>a</i>) by relative increases in export prices; and (<i>b</i>) in unit labour costs; and what are the forecasts for the next 12 months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00663"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, TREASURY (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am arranging to have the relevant figures available published in the <i>Official Report.</i> Figures are available only up to the last quarter of 1978 for relative export prices and to the first quarter of the present year for labour costs. Both series show a loss in competitiveness compared with two years ago. Whether this continues depends upon a number of factors which it is not possible to forecast reliably.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00665"><member>Lord CHELWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that when we have a chance to look at these figures they will be very disturbing indeed? Is not one of the main reasons for that the fact that some major industries persist with long out-dated restrictive practices? If my noble friend agrees, will he say how the Government see their role in helping and encouraging industry&#x2014;that is, management and unions&#x2014;to get rid of restrictive practices as well as creating a climate in which industry can again flourish?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00666"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend draws attention to a point of great importance. An improvement in our standard of living can only come from an increase in national output. This depends upon productivity, and an improvement in productivity depends, in part at any rate, on the removal of restrictive practices. The Government are themselves doing their part by squeezing inflation out of the system by following a strict fiscal and monetary policy, and they are providing tax incentives in indirect taxation at all income levels. So far as individual restrictive practices are concerned, that is primarily a matter for the employers and employees of the industries concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00667"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord the Minister whether the Government will resign in order to get rid of the greatest restrictive practice?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00668"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are doing a first-class job in
<col>200</col>
tackling the very great problems which have been exacerbated by five years of Labour rule, and I am sure that the success of their policies will be evident in the years to come.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00669"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: Would not a little modesty now be more prudent, my Lords?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00670"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I was, my Lords, speaking with all due modesty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00671"><member>Lord MISHCON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister also speak with some veracity as well as with modesty, and would he in the circumstances agree that investment in industry is a much more important matter than the one he has just been discussing? Does he feel that investment in industry in this country has been facilitated by the complete removal of exchange control over the last 48 hours?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00672"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, investment in industry is a matter of very great importance. Investment depends upon confidence. The Government are endeavouring to restore confidence in industry, not least by squeezing out inflation, which has been one of the greatest impediments to growth and one of the greatest deterrents to investment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00673"><member>Lord ROBERTHALL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister not agree that the 1944 White Paper, which has formed the basis of our attempts at full employment, calls for particular attention to the necessity for collaboration in the reduction of restrictive practices but that, in spite of all efforts, the problem has got worse rather than better? Will he not also agree that that accounts for the gradual decline in the rate of growth of the GNP?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00674"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. I had the great pleasure of working with the late Lord Keynes at the Treasury while the White Paper to which the noble Lord referred was being written. Its emphasis upon removal of restrictive practices and improvement in productivity is just as valid today as when those words were written 35 years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00675"><member>Lord PAGET of NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord regard it
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0109"/>
<col>201</col>
as purely coincidental that this trend took a sharp turn for the worse when Britain changed Governments?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00676"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there has been no sharp turn for the worse as a result of the change in Government. In fact, on the contrary, the prospects of this country are much better than they were during the years of the Labour Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00677"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord explain to the House why he believes that the removal of foreign exchange controls in this year will have any different effect in British industry from that which it had when it was tried under a previous Conservative Government&#x2014;when it was tried in 1970 and 1972&#x2014;when the capital released left this country for other countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00678"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: All the evidence, my Lords, is that investment from this country overseas creates export opportunities and therefore improves matters so far as British industry is concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00679"><member>Lord TAYLOR of GRYFE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord explain why the confidence that he has expressed in the future is not shared by the Stock Market?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00680"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Lord wishes to look at the history of the Stock Market in any detail, but if he would care to examine the progress of prices under the Labour Government it would give him no great comfort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00681"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having inquired into the history of the Stock Market, may I ask the noble Lord whether it is not a fact that since the present Government came to power there has been a steady and uninterrupted deterioration in Stock Market prices?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00682"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are not directly or indirectly responsible for Stock Exchange prices&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00684"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: &#x2014;&#x2014;but if the noble Lord wishes to follow this point, may I remind him that in the heyday of the Labour Government the Stock Ex-

<title>PRIVATELY RENTED DWELLINGS</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00688"><member>The Earl of KINNOULL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00689">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00690">To ask Her Majesty's Government how many dwellings have been lost in the privately rented sector in the United Kingdom since 1974, how many are at present unoccupied, and whether they will make a statement of Government proposals to revive the privately rented sector.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00691"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE, DEPARTMENT of the ENVIRONMENT (Lord Bellwin)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the annual average rate of decline in the private rented sector in England between 1971&#x2013;1977 is estimated at 125,000 dwellings. There is no estimate of the number of unoccupied dwellings which were formerly privately rented. The Government will be introducing a new form of shorthold letting in the Housing Bill this Session, enabling landlords to let on short fixed-term tenancies at fair rents. Landlords will be certain of repossession if they wish at the end of the term, and tenants will be guaranteed security for its duration. Shorthold will not apply to existing tenants. The Government will also bring forward an experimental scheme to encourage new building for rent by approved bodies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00692"><member>The Earl of KINNOULL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that valuable reply, and welcome the recognition by the Government of the importance of the private rented sector in the housing programme. Can my noble friend give an

<col>203</col>
assurance that the Government will review the Rent Act with a greater sense of urgency than the previous Administration, which took five years to do nothing other than grudgingly acknowledge the problem?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00693"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government attach great importance to the private rented sector, which must be preserved. There are great numbers of people, particularly the young, the single and the mobile who do not want to be, or whose circumstances do not permit them to be, owner-occupiers or council tenants. Housing provision for them must come from other sources. Housing associations can make a valuable contribution, but cannot possibly fill the gap that would ensue if all private renting were to end. This is quite apart from the socially divisive effect of reducing the choice of tenure only to owner-occupation and council tenancy. That is why we are bringing forward proposals to preserve and to revive private renting, and to the extent that looking at the Rent Acts is a part of that we will certainly be doing so.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LABORATORY ANIMALS<lb/>PROTECTION BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00698">3.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00699"><member>The Earl of HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time. In rising to put the Motion which stands in my name to your Lordships, and commending the Bill to your Lordships' good favour, I should like to start by thanking all those whose names appear on the long and distinguished list of speakers this afternoon. I am particularly gratified to see the name of my noble friend Lord Adrian, who has selected it for the subject of his maiden speech. His profession particularly well qualifies him to speak on this subject, and I am sure he will win his spurs to your Lordships' entire satisfaction. I shall listen to what he has to say with the greatest interest.<lb/>
I have stated in earlier debates on other Bills in this field that it is not a field for Private Members' Bills, and my reasons for going into reverse and acting contrary to my previously stated opinions are multifold. Last year, at the season of the party conferences, legislation was discussed based on the slogan of bringing animals into politics. I then decided in my own mind that if this meant bringing them into party politics I was against it. I could imagine no more unedifying spectacle than the parties bidding for the anti-vivisectionist vote in marginal constituencies.<lb/>
Secondly, I was increasingly exasperated by delays, of which every party and Government were guilty&#x2014;although I shall acquit the present Government who have not been in office long enough&#x2014;in bringing legislation up to date and implementing those recommendations of the Littlewood Committee which required legislation, with the result that laboratories of men of science are being vandalised and men of science are being threatened over the telephone, though their only guilt is in doing experiments to try to benefit mankind. These threats, of course, come from what I call the protestational neurotics who infiltrate, soil and sully every reform movement, however worthy. They do not have the support of the genuine animal welfare societies.<lb/>
Thirdly, it seemed essential to provide the working party of the Council of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0111"/>
<col>205</col>
Europe, which is seeking to produce a convention standardising animal welfare legislation throughout the European continent, with a lead based on a new model Act incorporating the one factor that we can contribute to Europe in this field&#x2014;100 years of experience; the experience of the pioneer which no one else except we has had.<lb/>
Lastly, I found myself able to recruit an exceptionally able team of helpers, all of whom knew the present Act, all of whom were aware of the ground which it did not cover. These were the recently retired Chief Inspector from the Home Office under the 1876 Act; the then immediate past President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the Professor of Nutritional Science at the medical school, the Royal Free Hospital; the late chairman of the Council of the Physiological Society and the chairman of the legal committee of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. Between them and others who helped, they covered the whole field necessary to contribute to this Bill. We have put in collectively a very hard year's team work and if, for the purposes of this Motion, I speak as I must in the first person singular, I would ask your Lordships to treat it as a colloquialism in so far as I am a kind of"we".<lb/>
By the end of last year, I had the Bill in advanced draft form and have spent the greater part of this year in polishing it up and convincing my friends in the scientific and medical worlds of its merits as a successor to the present Act. I may say that this has not always been easy, but I nevertheless have gained their support for my introduction of it here this afternoon.<lb/>
I am not going to take up time in arguing the pros and cons of using animals in the laboratory, 5 million a year, as opposed to killing them and eating them for food, 400 million a year; harvesting their wool and dairy products, putting them to the plough in days gone by, employing them as draught animals generally or entering them for steeple-chases culminating in the Grand National, where an expectable number of them get damaged and killed every year. I also leave aside our relationship with the animals based on their pestilential quality, which requires us to exterminate them
<col>206</col>
quite ruthlessly when their activities are incompatible with human activities. I can say only that I think it wrong to inflict more pain than is avoidable in any of these contexts.<lb/>
I accept that for an indefinite time to come there will be no universal alternative to the use of whole animals in all contexts, and the emphasis here is on my usage of "universal" and "all". I believe that nearly all sensible folk will go along with this view, albeit with variable degrees of personal reluctance. It would be quite wrong to suppose that men of science are strangers to this reluctance. They, too, are animal lovers. Working with animals fosters care for them, due to the need to keep them in good health during the course of an experiment. It does not breed indifference. I shall leave others to make these points in detail and will concentrate my own contribution to the debate on leading your Lordships through the Bill, starting with some very general considerations which we ought, all of us, to have in mind.<lb/>
Legislation ought never to be conceived in a vindictive spirit. It is not an opportunity to get even with people who do not share our views. A law is not good in proportion to the number of convictions it secures but, rather, in the degree of law-abidingness and co-operation which it promotes. Almost all the ethical considerations inspiring animal welfare are situational ones involving acts of judgment. If a man's judgment leads him in unacceptable directions, that may be a good reason for correcting it or restraining it, but not for treating the individual at fault as a criminal to be imprisoned with murderers, thieves, prostitutes and others. For that reason, this Bill does not constitute a new branch of criminal law.<lb/>
To give effect to this spirit, I have endeavoured to structure the Bill so as to strike as nice a balance as I can between what is done directly by statute, explicitly in the Bill, what is done indirectly by subordinate legislation and the machinery of regulations based upon statutory instruments and what is to be done by incentives to conform with an official code of good conduct which Clause 8 of the Bill requires the Home Secretary to publish under the title <i>A Guide to Good Laboratory Animal Practice.</i>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0112"/>
<col>207</col>
The Bill is evolutionary, not revolutionary, in scope. It builds on the present Act, incorporates those recommendations of the Littlewood Report needing legislation&#x2014;now, as I have said, over 15 years out of date&#x2014;and seals off some grey areas which have inevitably developed since 1876, the date of the present Act. I should perhaps remind your Lordships that the whole&#x2014;I repeat the whole&#x2014;of immunology, hormone-based therapy, vitamin-based dietetics, chemotherapy, antibiotics, anthelmintics&#x2014;modern medicine, in fact&#x2014;has been developed since the present Act came into force, and that the consumer protection movement of recent years has added many animals to the list of those that are required every year.<lb/>
In terms of modern biomedical technology, the relation between our exploitation of animals, in the general sense, in the laboratory and any reasonable definition of the word "experimental" is tenuous and very difficult to draw. The Bill is therefore based upon the more comprehensive term "procedure", the effect of which is to bring a rather wider range of animals under the protection which the Bill provides than is the case at present. This is reflected in its short title, "The Laboratory Animals Protection Bill."<lb/>
To qualify for protection under the Bill, an animal has to have two conditions fulfilled. First, it must be the subject of a procedure which, in the absence of an anaesthetic or other means of pain relief, could be expected to cause distress, pain, ill-health&#x2014;those three. Whether or not an anaesthetic is actually employed is irrelevant to the determination of whether an animal is a protected animal but, if a protected animal, it is entitled to the same degree of pain relief as would be the case if the procedure were carried out in the course of ordinary veterinary care and therapy.<lb/>
Secondly, the procedure must have certain stated objectives which are listed in the Bill, and I shall come to them later. These do not include slaughter for food, shearing for wool or the production of milk or other dairy products&#x2014;eggs and so on. These contexts are the province of other statutes. The ringing of birds and the implantation of radio-locatable bugs in wild animals in order
<col>208</col>
to follow their movements for the purposes of field natural history and observations are excluded from the Bill.<lb/>
This brings me to Clause 1 which provides that any procedure carried out on a protected animal is an offence, unless it falls within the restrictions imposed by the Act. This is the basis of the whole Bill, the rest of which is concerned with the power of the Home Secretary to control and relax this overall embargo in cases enfranchised by the Bill. Throughout the Bill the Home Secretary is made the keeper of our consciences in the context of animal experimentation. He is to be our watchdog. May I remind your Lordships of an old, homely proverb:
<quote>"Do not keep a dog and bark yourself".</quote>
The Bill does not tell the Home Secretary what to embargo. It contains no specific prohibition on particular experiments or procedures. Cosmetics are not picked out for special mention. There is no prohibition on inducing smoking habits in dogs. It will be up to the Home Secretary of the day, as it is now, to single them out and prohibit them if he thinks the circumstances warrant. The only constraint on him is that of public opinion, as expressed in Parliament.<lb/>
This brings me to Clause 2 where the restrictions begin to be relaxed, under control. It is a long clause and one of the key clauses in the Bill. It lays down the need for a licence in respect of the person by whom and the place at which a procedure bringing an animal under the protection of the Act is carried out. In addition, it lays down the purposes of the procedures which may be licensed and requires a veterinary degree of pain relief. It also covers the special cases where procedures are carried out as demonstrations for teaching purposes. It protects the offspring of pregnant animals. It requires the painless killing of animals in pain. It embargoes the use of curare and curaro-mimetic drugs as an anaesthetic and requires all animals to be treated with compassion.<lb/>
I will skip two clauses in order to come to the system of licensing persons and premises, taking them in that order. Clause 6 requires a licence application to be sponsored, but the system is quite different from sponsorship under the present Act, which is in the hands of very distinguished presidents of learned societies
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0113"/>
<col>209</col>
and colleges. Everyone knows that these distinguished persons are swamped by applications from strangers, of whom they know very little and who may be working in specialised fields, of which they know no more. The late Lord Platt used to tell your Lordships on many occasions what he thought of the bogus character of the protection which this system provided under certificates which he signed, more or less blind.<lb/>
The Bill replaces the old system by a system of double certification. There must be two sponsors to every licence application. The first must sponsor the applicant personally, must know him and must state that he has the requisite qualifications to carry out procedures on animals. The second must be a recognised expert in the field of the proposed procedures, who must certify that they fall within the purposes enfranchised by the Bill and that there is no reasonable alternative to the use of animals for that purpose.<lb/>
This removes from the limited number of inspectors the invidious task which would he imposed upon them if they were to be responsible for monitoring a virtually unlimited number of fields, from the standpoint of determining whether there was an alternative to the use of animals in those fields. The experts requisite for this category will be listed at the Home Office on the recommendation of the presidents of the learned societies and colleges. So these distinguished persons will continue to play a part in the system, but it will be the right part for them to play, and a real one.<lb/>
If the licensee changes course or enlarges the scope of his work, then the licence will need to be amended correspondingly, so that it will come to appear over the course of a career rather like a passport with visas. This being so, the special certificates requisite under the present Act will cease to serve any useful purpose and they are dropped accordingly. The protection they gave to horses, dogs, cats and other domesticated animals and pets was largely spurious since the same authority issued them all. What they did was to ensure that the Home Office knew that these animals were either being used or that their use was in contemplation. But this will be automatic and a routine
<col>210</col>
matter under the present Bill, where there will be no "blank cheques". Therefore they can be taken for granted and the system of alphabetically labelled certificates dropped.<lb/>
I come next to the licensing of the premises under Clause 5. At present premises are not licensed; they are simply registered to tell the inspector where he can call to carry out his inspection. By licensing, as opposed to registering, a great deal can be accomplished indirectly. The licence to an experimenter is to a single individual who conducts a single procedure. The licence of the premises can be to the chief executive of an industrial organisation or to the vice-chancellor of a university or anybody representative of the owner of the premises where many experimenters may be carrying out their work in parallel. The occasion of granting this licence can be the opportunity to draw his attention to the guide and to express the hope that its provisions will be treated as practices to be aimed at on the premises. This will put everyone's work at hazard if anyone on the premises disregards the guide's provisions and risks the chief executive's or vice-chancellor's loss of the licence by revocation if representations from the inspectors go unheeded. Thus the vice-chancellor or chief executive and everybody on the premises will be in league to see that the provisions of the guide are kept on the premises. Thus in my view men should be governed, naturally and without effort, by providing them with incentives to the good behaviour which one wants them to exhibit.<lb/>
The three clauses which I have recited, Nos. 2, 5 and 6, form the heart of the Bill. In order to present them sequentially, I skipped Clauses 3 and 4. Clause 3 carries the species protected to Schedule 1, which I shall deal with later, and Clause 4 repeats the embargo in the present Act against public exhibitions. Clause 7 is an enabling clause by means of which the Minister can make regulations which a later clause specifies as by statutory instrument. Clause 8 is the one requiring the publication of the guide to good laboratory animal practice. It is not, of course, in the Bill. It is the Home Secretary's responsibility to draft and circulate the guide, so the Bill does not tell him how to do his job. Clause 9
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0114"/>
<col>211</col>
requires licence holders to submit annual returns and of course the Home Secretary's annual report is based on those returns.<lb/>
The provisions of the Bill would be ineffective without some teeth in the form of an inspectorate which is set up in Clauses 10, 11 and 12. These very largely follow the present Act but the powers of individual inspectors are significantly increased. They can order the killing of an animal which is felt to be in undue pain without regard to whether or not the purposes of an experiment have been fulfilled. So far as practice is concerned, this is somewhat of a distinction without a difference because the inspectorate possesses this power in effect now, not in virtue of what is in the 1876 Act but in virtue of powers that they take to themselves under the conditions for issuing a licence. But the public do not know this and they believe that the inspectorate has no such power. Therefore I think it desirable that it should be in the Bill.<lb/>
In addition to the inspectorate, the Bill gives statutory expression to an advisory council in Clause 14 and lays down its constitution in Schedule 3. What I have in mind is a critical, collective opinion-forming body on questions which may be vexing the Home Secretary or the public or even the inspectors themselves. It is not conceived primarily as an ethical committee laying down standards of right and wrong but more as a body of advisers to whom the inspectors can turn if they, for example, do not agree about something among themselves, and to which they can refer matters on which they all of them feel unsure. They are, of course, experts. They are the normal advisers to the Minister; but even the most expert adviser sometimes finds himself in need of a commonsense lay opinion. That is how the constitution of the advisory council has been expressed.<lb/>
My Lords, I have again skipped a clause to facilitate exposition. Clause 13 requires the Home Secretary to publish an annual report and Clause 15 provides for an agreed licensee to have recourse to the advisory council. I think this is important. The present Act can inflict injustice on a licensee and there is absolutely no redress or means of making representations.<lb/>
<col>212</col>
These are the principal features of the Bill to which I would draw the attention of your Lordships in this opening speech. I do not want to prolong it unduly as I am sure that I shall have my attention drawn to other features of the Bill in the course of the debate. Those I will deal with when winding up the debate. Many of the remaining clauses are formal or legalistic and what one would expect to find in an Act of this kind, and of course some are consequential on the three main clauses that I have dealt with. The "guts" of the Bill are in Clauses 2, 5 and 6 and I would recommend a study of them.<lb/>
Before coming to an end, I should like to say a few words about the definitions in Clause 28. A "laboratory" is whatever premises are licensed for the conduct of licensed procedures on protected animals, so that in a veterinary or an agricultural context a meadow or a dairy could be a laboratory for the purposes of the Act. Then a "procedure" on a protected animal is defined by its purposes and it might be as well to recite these explicitly for the record. There are five of them, namely, testing a hypothesis, collecting information, testing or producing a substance, registering an effect of a substance on an animal or use for educational purposes.<lb/>
The species of animals protected under the Bill are not listed in the Bill but carried into Schedule 1, to which the Minister has power of addition or deletion by regulation. In this way practice can be made to conform with what we learn over the years about life forms which might need more protection in the minds of our successors than they do in our own minds today.<lb/>
So much for the Bill itself. If your Lordships approve it and approve the Motion for Second Reading, I shall then ask you to approve a second Motion committing the Bill to a Select Committee of the House. This was originally the idea of the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, and I owe the idea to him. I thought it a good one and I am happy to give him the credit for a good idea. The field is a controversial one, where conflicting feelings run high. I think it right and proper that an experimentalist who may feel that I have been too restrictive, or an animal welfare devotee who may feel that I have not gone far enough,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0115"/>
<col>213</col>
should have the satisfaction of feeling that he or she has been listened to with that patience and attention which only a Select Committee can provide. It also gives the House, through its Select Committee, an opportunity to collect evidence over and above that which may be volunteered. I am quite sure that the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, will enlarge on these arguments and I do not intend to say more on that matter as I believe that T can leave the rest of it in his very capable hands.<lb/>
My Lords, I very much hope that the Bill will commend itself to your good favour. It has been a labour of love by a dedicated team. Men of science played a distinguished and honourable role in helping to achieve the Act of 1876, which was a more or less corporate expression of British affection for animals and a determination that the rather horrible physiological experiments which were carried out in France in the middle of the last century should not be repeated in this country. So the men of science played an honourable role in putting the Act of 1876 on the Statute Book. During the century of their co-operation with it since, they have been continually traduced and blackguarded as monsters by the militant anti-vivisectionist Press&#x2014;as total a stranger to the truth as can well be imagined. I want to see them, as a member of their community, play the same honourable role today in whatever measure proves the successor to the present Act. For that reason, my Lords, as well as for the protection of laboratory animals, on the Motion that this Bill be now read a second time, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NORTHERN IRELAND: <lb/>GOVERNMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00701">3.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00702"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE, NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Statement is as follows:
<col>214</col>
"Mr. Speaker, I will, with permission, make a Statement about the government of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
"The Queen's Speech declared the Government's intention, to seek an acceptable way of restoring to the people of Northern Ireland more control over their own affairs '.<lb/>
"Since taking office in May, I have, for this purpose, had wide-ranging discussions in the Province, and a series of private meetings with leaders of the main Northern Ireland political parties represented in this House.<lb/>
"My discussions and meetings have confirmed the Government's view that it is right to transfer back to locally elected representatives some at least of the powers of government at present exercised from Westminster.<lb/>
"The political parties in Northern Ireland themselves, in their election manifestoes, asked for this, and there is widespread support for it in the Province.<lb/>
"There is, moreover, awareness that such a restoration of political responsibility can only be brought about in Northern Ireland by all parts of the community recognising and respecting the interests of others.<lb/>
"It will in due course be a matter for Parliament to decide, on proposals put to it by Her Majesty's Government, what kind of powers and responsibilities are to be transferred to elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland and through what kind of institutions they are to be exercised.<lb/>
"The Government wish, however, to put forward proposals which, so far as possible, have the agreement of the people of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
"We intend therefore to convene a conference of the principal political parties in Northern Ireland to seek the highest level of agreement that we can on proposals for a transfer of responsibility which the Government might put before this House in due course.<lb/>
"We are, for this purpose, preparing a consultative document, which will be laid before Parliament, to serve as the basis of the conference.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0116"/>
<col>215</col>
"The document will set out the range of powers and responsibilities which the Government for their part would be prepared to see transferred from Westminster.<lb/>
"The document will set out as options for consideration by the conference a number of ways in which the transferred powers might be exercised; and in each case with what Her Majesty's Government would regard as reasonable and appropriate arrangements to take account of the interests of the minority.<lb/>
"Responsibility for law and order in the Province, which&#x2014;as I indicated in reply to Questions earlier today&#x2014;remains the Government's overriding priority in Northern Ireland, would not be transferred.<lb/>
"I shall shortly be approaching the party leaders concerned to discuss with them the arrangements for a conference to be convened as soon as possible and, I would hope, by the end of November.<lb/>
"Our aim will be to secure from the conference, drawing on suggestions in the consultative document, workable and acceptable arrangements for restoring to the people of Northern Ireland greater responsibility for the conduct of their own affairs which we can then recommend to this House in fulfilment of our commitment in The Queen's Speech".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00703">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00704">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00705"><member>Lord BLEASE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to thank the Minister for repeating the Statement to this House. I have received a copy of it within the last few minutes. As this is the first occasion since the Summer Recess on which there has been an opportunity to mention Northern Ireland affairs in this House, I feel sure that all noble Lords will wish to join with me in expressing our deep shock and grief at the tragic murder of Lord Mountbatten. Also I have great concern about the continuing senseless and vicious campaign of violence being perpetrated against the Irish people both North and South. Our heartfelt sympathy is with the
<col>216</col>
families of all the security forces and of all innocent victims, civilians, who have suffered much during these recent months through murder, maiming and malice.<lb/>
I wish also to say that, along with noble Lords in this House and with Members in another place who realise in practical terms the problems of civilised living in Northern Ireland, we acknowledge the tremendous difficulties that confront the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and his Ministers in obtaining peace, justice and progress in Northern Ireland. The Statement today proposes further discussions and consultations by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State with the main representatives of political parties in Northern Ireland in the form of a conference.<lb/>
In offering my support for these efforts, which I hope will be fundamentally based on democratic political persuasion, I would add some words of caution. I should like the Minister to indicate what hopes the Northern Ireland Secretary of State has at present, after having carried out a series of consultations with the representatives of political parties, that there will be agreement by the political parties in Northern Ireland to participate in this constitutional conference. If one or more of the parties boycott the conference, what will be the arrangements for the decisions that the Government and Parliament will have to take by way of option?<lb/>
I note and welcome the fact that the text and terms of the consultative document will be generally released in another place and in this House and I would suggest that such a document ought to be widely available to the public. I say that because, from knowledge and experience of other similar conferences and assemblies held in Northern Ireland over the years, if this is not done there will be a series of leaks and ugly forms of speculation which can only harm such discussions. A further point I should like to suggest is that perhaps a record of the progress of the consultations may be made regularly so that the general public may in some way voice their opinions on the progress of the discussions.<lb/>
I feel that I would be failing in my responsibility to the Northern Ireland people and to this House, if not to my own conscience, if I did not mention the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0117"/>
<col>217</col>
great concern and frustration in Northern Ireland about approaches to security matters during these past five months. Whatever may be the particular need for measures to uphold law and order, I certainly welcome the point set out in the Statement which says that,
<quote>"Responsibility for law and order in the Province, which&#x2014;as I indicated in reply to Questions earlier today&#x2014;remains the Government's overriding priority in Northern Ireland, would not be transferred.".</quote>
I welcome that at this time in the affairs of Northern Ireland, whatever subsequent events may lead to; that is a very important principle which has my full support.<lb/>
A further point that I feel I should like to stress is that while the Government must give full recognition to the elected representatives of Northern Ireland&#x2014;and I stand by that wholeheartedly&#x2014;I believe that in the present Northern Ireland situation efforts should be made to strengthen the pluralistic aspects of responsibility and influence in our society. Therefore, I would again suggest that the consultations and discussions would benefit by involving representatives of the business community, trade union representatives, the churches, educational and other professional bodies. Finally, my Lords, I would hope that these discussions and consultations will take place in an atmosphere of constitutional conference. I believe that it is vital that issues concerning social and economic matters should also be included. Homes, jobs and educational opportunity are closely linked with peace, progress and constitutional matters in Northern Ireland. So I thank the Minister for the Statement that he has made to the House and look forward to receiving progress reports from time to time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00707"><member>Lord HAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we too would like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for repeating the Statement. We accept that unfortunately there is no magic solution to the problems of the Province and that the Secretary of State has needed time for consultation and discussion with the various parties over there. We now look forward to studying the consultative document planned to serve as the basis of a conference and certainly would not question its stated aim,
<quote>"to seek the highest level of agreement".</quote>
<col>218</col>
The great problem which, of course, remains is how to get all parts of the community to recognise and respect the interests of others. None the less, we hope wholeheartedly that good may come from this endeavour, fully accepting that responsibility for law and order should not be transferred at this stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00708"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Blease, and to the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, for their reception of this Statement which marks the opening of a new and critical phase in the future of the Province. I am grateful also to the noble Lord, Lord Blease, for recording his sympathy, which all of us share, with the family of the late Lord Mountbatten. I shall not dilate upon that great gentleman in this place now, but we all know what we think of him.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Blease, recognised the difficulties which face us and we welcome his support. He asked me a number of specific questions, the first of which was: What would we do if one or more of the parties would not come to the conference? In our view that would be a most regrettable development and I trust that it will not happen. Both Parliament and the people of Northern Ireland would not understand why any party should not attend when less than six months ago they had all fought the election on the basis that they wanted to make progress. The noble Lord went on to ask what would happen if the conference were to fail. I do not believe in anticipating failure, but if it were to fail to reach agreement, the Government would put forward what they judged to be the best proposals for making progress in the light of the views that were expressed in the conference.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked whether there would be a freely available record of the consultations. I believe that it will be best for this relatively small gathering to meet in private, although the members thereof may release as they wish what has proceeded there. On the question of security and whether that will hamper the proceedings of the conference, I think that it is only necessary to emphasise that it would be playing into the hands of the terrorists to accept that every further outrage they commit constitutes a veto on further progress, and that is what that would be.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0118"/>
<col>219</col>
The noble Lord also suggested that we might ask the conference to look at matters wider than constitutional. The people concerned will be completely aware of these matters and I do not doubt that they will raise such matters as they see fit. The consultative document will not preclude members from introducing ideas of their own.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00709"><member>Lord PLANT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to associate myself with what my noble friend Lord Blease has said. I speak as chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Northern Ireland. I am circumscribed in making a statement here and I must put it as a series of questions. First, would the Minister agree that it is only the people of Northern Ireland who can put their own house in order and that by and large the great majority would welcome the Statement that he has made? Secondly, I recently attended the memorial service at Aldershot for the 18 soldiers murdered at Warren Point. Is the Minister aware that there is a memorial book in the chapel at Aldershot with the names of 300 soldiers who have laid down their lives in Northern Ireland?<lb/>
My third question concerns the time-scale. The Minister has said that by November these discussions would be taking place. Can he inform the House of the time-scale envisaged after the initial discussions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00710"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Plant, that it is only the citizens of the Province who can put their own house in order. It is the duty of the Government to try to bring about the circumstances under which they are able so to do and to provide the encouragement for those who may be reluctant to make the attempt. It will be a function of public opinion in this country&#x2014;by which I mean the whole of the United Kingdom&#x2014;to make it apparent to any who are reluctant to look and listen and speak rather than to shout, that this is something which the people will not tolerate.<lb/>
I too have seen with proper humility the memorial to which the noble Lord referred and with real sorrow I see that it grows longer every week.<lb/>
<col>220</col>
As regards the timing, I very much hope that we shall have something concrete to proceed on by the end of this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00711"><member>Lord DERWENT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to raise one point with my noble friend. Did I understand him correctly to say that there was no chance of the public being kept fully informed during the discussions? If that is so I think it is most regrettable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00712"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, subject to advice, my understanding is that there will not be published a <i>Hansard</i> account, as it were; on the other hand it is not human nature for there to be a revelation, after three weeks of silence, of a conclusion reached. It is possible that different interpretations may be put on the proceedings by different participants. However, we shall have to see how we go and grow wise with experience.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00713"><member>The Duke of NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask my noble friend whether the Government of Southern Ireland have been consulted about this matter and will steps be taken to keep them informed as the conference progresses? I am one of the many people who believe that the secret of this dreary and terrible subject lies much more with keeping the Government of Southern Ireland informed and in trying to bring them along with us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00714"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware of the dimension which the noble Duke has introduced. This is a United Kingdom matter, but of course the Government of the Republic are concerned; of course they will be kept aware of what is going on and I trust that their interest will be sympathetic.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LABORATORY ANIMALS<lb/>PROTECTION BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00715">3.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00716">Second Reading debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00717"><member>Earl GREY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first may I apologise to the House for not being able to stay until the end of the Second Reading debate on this most important Bill. Unfortunately, I have a prior engagement which is unavoidable. My Lords, I welcome this Second Reading
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0119"/>
<col>221</col>
debate and also the setting up of a Select Committee which will be able to assess more fully the facts regarding cruelty to and unnecessary treatment of animals. The subject of laboratory testing evokes automatically strong emotional feelings&#x2014;those for the continuance of and those opposed to the practice. I admit that I find it difficult to be objective without being biased.<lb/>
Having read the Bill, I am not happy with some of the clauses contained in it, especially the ones dealing with pain and suffering. I do not think that it goes far enough towards ensuring the welfare and safety of animals, but I for one would rather be informed and convinced more fully before making a final decision. One reads of frightening cases of treatment and experiments. I do not know whether those accusations are justified, but, surely, in order to obtain the truth, could not the veil of secrecy which seems to exist be lifted and more facts be allowed to be published?<lb/>
One solution could be the appointment of more inspectors. I believe that they number only 14, and that the number of experiments amount to a few million. I would approve that extra fully-qualified inspectors&#x2014;and possibly some could be recruited from various animal welfare groups&#x2014;should be given more powers. I believe that those inspectors should have the right of entry to any laboratory without having first to apply for permission to inspect. I cannot see any objection to that if all experiments are being carried out lawfully and there is nothing to hide.<lb/>
I, for one, cannot condone the testing of tobacco on animals to find out which strains are harmful to humans. There must be any number of humans willing to smoke themselves to death, given the offer of free tobacco. Let them be the guinea-pigs. I also fail to see the justification in the experimentation of cosmetics in order to make women more attractive to men. There are enough products on the market for that already. If experiments are to continue, which will be the case, I think that the criteria should be purely on medical grounds. I shall follow closely the progress of this Bill, or any similar Bill, with a great deal of interest and concern. Finally, I look forward with interest to listening to the
<col>222</col>
maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, who I understand is well qualified to speak on this very important subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00718">4.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00719"><member>Lord ADRIAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I speak for the first time in your Lordships' House with a good deal of apprehension. I know that maiden speeches should be non-controversial and I know that the subject of today's debate gives rise to strong feelings. If what I say does likewise, I apologise in advance; I do not mean it to. I shall need all your Lordships' traditional kindness. At the outset I must make it clear that I hold a licence under the 1876 legislation to carry out animal experiments. I am a physiologist and I teach medical students. Being also a university don, I am forewarned, having read a most helpful article by the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan, that your Lordships have no taste for lectures. I shall do my best not to fall into that, for me, very familiar mode of address.<lb/>
Your Lordships will understand that I am one of those who hold the view that animal experiments can be justified, and indeed that they are necessary. They seem to me to be justified by the knowledge that they produce and, more importantly, by the benefits which stem from that knowledge; by the reduction of disease and the increase of the health of mankind and animals. I believe that the human and animal suffering which would be caused by denying ourselves the benefits of experiment would far outweigh the suffering caused by experiment.<lb/>
As a physiologist with a medical training, I can see clearly how far the advances of medicine have depended on animal experiments. I do not doubt that there are in your Lordships' House several, and in the world at large millions, whose very lives depend on animal work on diabetes. The production, testing and standardisation of insulin has traditionally used animals. Now, however, we can look forward to the production of insulin by genetic engineering and to its standardisation by "alternative" methods.<lb/>
The use of these "alternative" methods, as and when they become sufficiently developed and reliable, is very much to be welcomed; and I believe that their use
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0120"/>
<col>223</col>
is increasing. Ten years ago people thought that the numbers of animal experiments would continue to rise inexorably year by year. Instead the Home Office statistics show that since 1970 the annual total has, in fact, declined slightly. We may acknowledge the part that the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, and many others have played in this very welcome development.<lb/>
I have said that I believe using animals in testing and experimental work is justifiable, but that is not to say that I think that all experiments or tests are justified. I do not advocate uncontrolled animal experiment&#x2014;rather it should be done only under informed and responsible control; control of the kind that I believe has been exercised in this country for the last 100 years. But if we are to maximise the benefit and minimise the animal suffering, that control must be well-informed. This is indeed recognised in the composition of the proposed advisory committee, but it seems to me so important that I should like to see the role of that committee strengthened.<lb/>
The advisory committee should be active in offering the Secretary of State and the Inspectorate advice on all aspects, scientific as well as ethical, of animal experiment, and their counsels should surely take into account the best available medical, veterinary and scientific knowledge. I should like to see the clinical and scientific members of the committee appointed from nominations by the Royal Colleges, the Royal Society, and relevant learned societies. I would also hope that in matters of appeal under Clause 15 the advisory committee's advice would normally be heeded. The importance of control, and indeed of self-control, is part of the outlook of biological scientists in this country who are jealous of their good reputation for animal care. I know that it is held that, because of lack of testing in the courts, the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act is widely neglected. I can only say that in my own experience my colleagues take the provisions of that Act very seriously indeed and listen closely and with respect to the very knowledgeable advice of the Inspectorate; and that this attitude of willing co-operation extends to our professional associations.<lb/>
<col>224</col>
The Bill which your Lordships are considering today preserves a great deal that is well-tried in the 1876 legislation. But biological science has made very great progress in the last 100 years and it is hardly surprising that the 1876 legislation needs bringing up-to-date. The Bill of the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, does just that&#x2014;it implements many of the recommendations of the Littlewood Committee. The concept of experiment is replaced by the much wider one of procedure. The scope of control is extended. Sponsoring for licence applications is made less automatic and will demand that the sponsors know more about what and who is being sponsored. All this greatly improves the present position, and does much of what critics of the 1876 Act have demanded. But it must be admitted that the present position is not altogether bad&#x2014; in fact, the existing Act, for all its detractors, works well. There seems to me to be some force in the argument that our efforts should be concentrated on achieving a satisfactory agreement in the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee of the Council of Europe for the Protection of Animals, and for delaying changes in our legislation until that agreement has been accepted.<lb/>
But, on balance, I think that we have waited long enough. At the same time I should be sorry indeed if controversy over this Bill and over one which may reach us from another place should interfere with our efforts to influence what is yet to be agreed in Europe. Finally, I do not think that human beings will very readily give up using animals, for food, for work, for knowledge, for safety, even for sport. Individuals differ widely in what they themselves will do. But society has to set limits on all these activities and fiercely argues about where those limits should be. To set those limits in experimental science in the last 100 years this country has relied on a combination of legislation and the personal responsibility of scientists. On the whole, it has worked well. It has offered protection to animals and, be it admitted, to scientists also, as was the intention of the original legislation. The Bill before your Lordships' House builds on and develops that very well-tried approach. I shall support its Second Reading and, if it be so moved, its reference to a Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00721"><member>Lord HUNT of FAWLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords will agree with me when I thank the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, for his splendid maiden speech. He is the distinguished physiologist son of a distinguished physiologist father whom many of us knew. Like his father, he has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His father was awarded the Order of Merit and was a Nobel Prize winner in medicine. We hope that our new friend will follow this splendid example and rise to those heights, and that he will speak to us often. We are proud and privileged to have him with us in our House. We thank him once again for his speech. It was, as it should have been, non-controversial. When I had been in your Lordships' House for four months the Chief Whip came to me and said, "It is time you made your maiden speech". I said, "What on?" He said, "Any non-controversial subject". I said, "What do you suggest?" And he said, "What about pay beds in National Health Service hospitals!" I had difficulty in making that really non-controversial.<lb/>
May I return to the subject of our debate this afternoon&#x2014;the Laboratory Animals Protection Bill. Many years ago when I was on the junior staff of the Medical Professorial Unit of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I took out an animal-experiment licence with a grant from the Medical Research Council to investigate a possible connection between the pituitary gland and gastric ulcers. This involved working with rabbits which I had bred myself in my parents' garden in Surrey. As you know these animals multiply quickly. With the help of my family and others looking after them we soon had a considerable number. We became quite fond of some of them and we got to know them by name. When mature they were brought up to London, to the Dunn Laboratory at Barts. While there I remember, well, being concerned about their welfare. We did our best to be kind to them but I thought, then, that more regulations were needed to supervise and control experiments on animals.<lb/>
This Bill introduced to your Lordships' today by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, sets out clearly possible lines along which such protective legislation, regulations,
<col>226</col>
official advice, embargoes, codes of conduct and licensing (not only for the experimenter himself but also for the premises in which he works) could and should now be developed to alleviate as much as possible the ill-health, distress, discomfort or pain experimental animals may suffer. But, as the noble Earl has himself suggested, and as the RSPCA and others have pointed out to me, his Bill still needs amendments; first, perhaps, by a Select Committee and then by a Committee of the Whole House.<lb/>
Modern medicine and millions of people owe an enormous debt to those who have observed animals under controlled conditions, or who have carried out carefully-planned tests, trials or experiments upon them. These scientists have played a large part in the prevention and treatment of a great number of very serious diseases ranging from diphtheria and tuberculosis to poliomyelitis and bubonic plague. At present we cannot do without these animal experiments, because the alternative methods of assessment, which are steadily being developed, are not yet good enough in all contexts.<lb/>
Members of the public and their lawyers are becoming more insistent on adequate protection and safety in almost every aspect of modern life. The number of animal experiments is, we are told, increasing because of the eight or more workers' or consumers' protection Acts which have been put on the statute book during the past 25 years. And more and more work is being done in trying to find an answer to our many vital medical problems. It might be thought that a Bill like this, with its stricter licensing and tighter controls, would tend to impede or perhaps even reduce medical research. I believe that the opposite is the case; it should lead to more and improved scientific trials and experiments under better conditions for the animals concerned.<lb/>
In some subjects more should have been done in the past. Last year my wife and I travelled to Salzburg by air, with about 20 "thalidomide" teenagers on a holiday jaunt, some of them with arms and legs only a few inches long. A more cheerful bunch of youngsters I have seldom seen; but during lunch one could not help wondering, as have many others, how much human anxiety and suffering
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0122"/>
<col>227</col>
might have been avoided had more adequate animal experiments been possible before thalidomide had been put on the market. They were attempted, we all know, but did not prove sufficient.<lb/>
There are some people who think that this Bill is quite unnecessary because they believe all experiments involving animals should be banned. To them I would reply by paraphrasing what I said to your Lordships on 22nd February 1977: If there is the slightest chance of a new food additive, drug, antibiotic, hormone, vaccine, insecticide, or even a new cosmetic preparation such as a hair dye, making someone ill, perhaps even causing cancer or some other very unpleasant or fatal disease, would these people really prefer that the first sign of such an illness should appear in a son or daughter, mother or father, wife or husband rather than in a rabbit, guinea pig, mouse or rat? I think we all know well enough, in our hearts, how the majority of people would answer that question. Therefore, my Lords, as a doctor and on behalf of most of my patients and their loved ones, I beg you to give this Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00722">4.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00723"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find it extremely difficult as a layman to express adequately the admiration I have for those noble Lords who have spoken already, particularly the professional ones who understand this subject inside out. I ask your Lordships' forgiveness for intervening for a few moments as a layman. I should like to thank the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, for having given us the opportunity of speaking and of hearing him on this subject. Most people are deeply concerned about how animals are treated, but I think that very few, if any, would deny that it is important in some way, and perhaps in many ways, for experiments to continue.<lb/>
The importance of this Bill arises from the fact that an attempt is being made to deal with a subject in a reasonable and proper manner. I should also like to say, particularly to the maiden speaker, Lord Adrian, that of course anybody who has any knowledge of anything at all knows what a valuable service his father and he have rendered to humanity, and today
<col>228</col>
he has exhibited it in his speech. There is not very much need to speak about its excellence because we all expected it, and we look forward with considerable pleasure to hear from him very often and again shortly. That is why I confine myself to a portion of the Bill that I consider to be of considerable importance, and which I hope your Lordships will agree is of considerable importance.<lb/>
I agree with the views already expressed, that we in Britain are outstanding in the manner in which protective legislation to animals has been used, and I think particularly in the last 100 years to Europe as a whole. We in Britain have had a proud tradition for more than 100 years of the strongest legislation in Europe in this respect. I am concerned of course for the well-being of animals, as are such vast numbers of our fellow men, and I commend the Bill as being a step in the right direction; namely, that of bringing legislation concerning the protection of laboratory animals up to date. Many of your Lordships who have much deeper knowledge and experience of this subject than I have, have given, and will be giving, the benefit of their views, and those views will be listened to with interested attention by the House. I therefore propose to deal briefly with one aspect of the Bill which I consider to be of considerable importance; namely, the provisions of Clause 8.<lb/>
All of us will agree that every method should be sought to carry out tests humanely, on any kind of animal, and that just as important is the need to try to minimise the need for, and the number of, animal experiments that are required in any particular circumstance. Clause 8 requires the Secretary of State to publish a guide for good laboratory practice and advice on alternatives to experimental animals. The concept of alternatives is not new, as we have heard, but the questions that present themselves are: What alternatives are suitable? And, are they valid?<lb/>
I wish to quote, as an example of the importance of research, the recommendations of scientists known to me who have studied the subject extensively and whose work in SCIP I admire. One of the alternatives to the use of animals which they propose, and with which after long deliberation they consider to be suitable
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0123"/>
<col>229</col>
for testing certain chemicals in medicines and food additives, is an easily available human tissue, the placenta or afterbirth. They state that when a substance is being tested for safe use in man, the best alternative to animals is man himself. Since it is not technically possible to carry out many tests on man, the best alternative is to use a human tissue, and in the placenta there is just such a tissue.<lb/>
Clearly this does not replace all experiments on animals, but it has been pointed out to me that some experiments which take place using animals perhaps use more animals than would otherwise be the case in order to arrive at certain conclusions which may fail. However, I am talking now about something which does not mean that at all; in some instances experiments with the placenta can be better than tests using animals.<lb/>
The report of the work of these scientists has just appeared in a publication entitled <i>Placenta&#x2014;A Neglected Experimental Animal,</i> by Dr. Peter Beaconsfield, MD, PhD, and the director of SCIP, a research organisation with which I have worked and in which I have been interested for a considerable time, the Research Unit of Bedford College, University of London, the Visiting Professor of the City University, and Dr. Claude Villiee, PhD, the director of the Laboratory of Human Reproduction at Harvard Medical School, Boston, in the United States.<lb/>
In this volume a number of articles and discussions between members of the group are collected. These people are experts whose knowledge is very wide-ranging and world renowned, and all of them are qualified to express their opinions on the satisfactory use of alternatives to animals in research. According to them the placenta, being human tissue, is infinitely more suitable a testing material to assess the accuracy of certain reactions than many animals currently in use, for the simple reason that it is human tissue. The foreword to the book has been written by one of the group, the Swedish Nobel Prize-winner, Professor Hugo Theorell, and I quote from his opening remarks:
<quote>"The quest for a suitable model on which to base human medical research is as long as the history of medicine itself. Only time will show how important a milestone on this journey the placenta may prove to be. As yet, it has been neglected &#x2026; somewhat surprisingly, when we consider how much effort has been applied to
<col>230</col>
seemingly less satisfactory and less freely available alternatives. The placenta's remarkably complete spectrum of cellular and biochemical activity, as well as its hormonal and endrocrinological roles and its short life-cycle, adds to its suitability for studying the processes of cell replication, immune mechanisms &#x2026; and perhaps ageing."</quote>
This second quotation amplifies the first:
<quote>"Although only one of many possible research models, the human placenta offers many advantages. It consists of human tissue, it is readily available and it possesses the unique properties of differentiating and growing from embryonal tissue to maturity and &#x2026; senescence in only nine months."</quote>
On the subject of drug testing, for example, Dr. Beaconsfield comments:
<quote>"As the placenta is a rapidly growing tissue, it is a good testing ground for compounds which are being developed to slow down growth and interfere with certain aspects of metabolism."</quote>
Dr. Beaconsfield also comments:
<quote>"The validity of the placenta as an experimental animal is fully upheld &#x2026; it can be kept alive and intact &#x2026; and many processes can be studied on it."</quote>
I hope your Lordships will forgive me for quoting so fully, but to me, as a layman, it seems strange that this subject, which is considered very fully in the publication to which I referred, appears to have escaped the notice of the Home Office and those who should have been deeply concerned with this subject. I believe that this Bill, and in particular the clause to which I referred, will make it compulsory for the authorities to see that every incentive possible is given to those who are taking part in research work of this description.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00725"><member>Baroness HYLTON-FOSTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to open my speech by adding my congratulations to those already extended to the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, upon his most thoughtful and informative speech, and I hope that it is but the forerunner of many more to come. I welcome the Bill for three reasons. The first is that I am connected with, and interested in, research into migraine, as well as blindness. Secondly, I believe that the Bill should curb the experiments done by irresponsible people. My third reason can be expressed in the words of Professor Hutt, Counsellor for Research, and Director of the Max Rayne Institute across the water at St. Thomas' Hospital. Professor Hutt hopes that the Bill will help to demonstrate to the general public that research workers, who are often denigrated by prejudiced groups, are
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0124"/>
<col>231</col>
responsible people who really care about welfare of the animals they use and now accept the need for restrictive legislation. The professor also points out that the great majority of animal experiments carried out in this country, particularly in the medical and veterinary field, really are necessary if we are to develop new techniques for the prevention and treatment of disease and therefore of suffering by mankind and by animals.<lb/>
In a Stephen Paget Memorial lecture in 1978 Professor Paton of Oxford University pointed out that scientists had been represented as pursuing wanton curiosity or lacking in social responsibility. So he drew attention to the many forms of animal suffering, such as dying from disease and being killed for food. He also referred to the unwanted dogs and cats which are destroyed each year if they are lucky, and are not otherwise starved to death or dumped on a motorway. Yet only one animal experiment which leads to a future reduction of suffering is the one that is most bitterly attacked. It is not always understood that the use of animals in medical research is for the benefit of both human and veterinary medicine.<lb/>
I must join with other noble Lords in thanking the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, for his brilliant and most comprehensive speech and for introducing the Bill. I must tell him that the director of the Max Rayne Institute says that he and his team could find in the Bill no point of principle to which they could take exception, but they would like attention drawn to three clauses. With regard to Clause 7 they suggest that all breeders of laboratory animals should be inspected regularly for standards and disease control. In relation to Clause 8 they suggest that all licensees should receive a code of conduct and regulations with reference to animals used within the institutes. Clause 14 deals with the advisory committee, and the director and his team recommend that there should be more than one representative for the industries listed under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 1 of Schedule 3, and they would strongly press for the inclusion of an experienced chief animal superintendent (technologist) on the committee.<lb/>
Would the noble Earl agree with these three points, and if he does, would he draw them to the attention of the Select
<col>232</col>
Committee if the Bill is committed? Finally, would the Government agree that the enforcement of higher standards will inevitably lead to higher costs which in these days of financial stringency many universities and medical research institutes will not be able to meet? Therefore this will mean a reduction in medical research of the very best type. I should be grateful if the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, would indicate whether the Government would give sympathetic consideration to this problem.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00727"><member>Lord HILL of LUTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will occupy your Lordships' time only very briefly. I want to underline, if I may, one point. Before I do so may I join in the congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, upon his magnificent maiden speech today. Inevitably he reminded me of the gentle, extraordinarily able man who was my director of studies some 55 years ago&#x2014;Lord Adrian. We welcome the noble Lord; we enjoyed his speech greatly.<lb/>
In connection with the Bill I want to underline the significance&#x2014;to which the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, referred in his opening speech&#x2014;in the change from the word "experiment" to the word "procedure". It really is a significant change that there will be brought within the strengthened control, which other provisions of the Bill will secure, any procedure which in the absence of relief would cause distress, pain, or ill-health&#x2014;and that is whether experimental or not. Those actions are brought within the ambit of this strengthened control, whereas today many of them not involving experiment are not within the ambit of the existing Act.<lb/>
This point is of immense importance, and I emphasise it for the following reason. Some of your Lordships may have listened to the seven o'clock news this morming and a contribution that followed from a spokesman for the antivivisection people, who described the Bill as a "whitewash". I think that this must be answered now. Is it a whitewash, first, to strengthen the control over experimental work (the existing arena) and to extend that control to cover this extensive and growing world of action&#x2014;not experiment&#x2014; concerned with vaccines,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0125"/>
<col>233</col>
biological products, testing, and insulin, which is of course likely to be much more used as the consumer protection movement grows? Is it whitewash to do those two things? Whereas one can understand those people who, for sentimental or other reasons, would deny other people the great benefits of animal experimentation, nevertheless they have no right to describe as a whitewash a Bill that does a very important thing in bringing the law up to date by substituting the word "experiment" with the word "procedure".<lb/>
If the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, is to be thanked for anything&#x2014;and he is to be thanked considerably for the amount of work he has put into the Bill&#x2014;it is for proposing that change of terminology which means so much protection to many more animals, and which is a very real advance, particularly because at the same time the control is strengthened so as to be even more effective than it is at present.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00729"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, may I say how grateful I am to have been able to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, with his vast experience and knowledge. Secondly, I want to thank the noble Earl for bringing the Bill before this Chamber. It is time that a Government, whatever their political colour, took the responsibility rather than leave it to the enterprise of Members from either side of this House or of the other place to try to put the situation in order regarding protection of animals in laboratories.<lb/>
I have to declare a little interest here. I have over the years been linked with the work of the pharmaceutical laboratories and I have watched pathologists at work. Consider the situation if one is trying to sell the result of work of such men as the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, and his noble father, and others overseas who may be seeking a licence to sell a drug in Japan, perhaps through the FDA&#x2014;the Federal Drug Association. Whether the British pharmacologists, biologists or others like it or lump it there must be put forward a vast amount of evidence before the drug can be licensed in the country concerned, no matter how good the drug may be. There must be some animal
<col>234</col>
pharmacology, there must be some work on animals. Whatever legislation this country may introduce, if we want to export the results of the brain work of our people in the fields of drugs, gastroenterology, <i>et cetera,</i> some work must first of all be done on animals, and if it is not done here it could be taken to other European countries where there is less concern for the safety of animals than there is in this country. Therefore, those vivisectionists who, like myself, also love animals should remember that if we push these experiments out of this country, which is famous and noteworthy throughout the world for its love of animals, they could go to parts of the world where, whatever action is done to animals, the thought of cruelty to them will be the last thing in the minds of the experimenters and results will be the first. If one looks at the distinguished men and women&#x2014;and I know some of them&#x2014;who have contributed to this Bill, one can only pay tribute to the hours and hours of thought and discussion which have gone into the production of it.<lb/>
My Lords, when we talk about the Littlewood Committee's report, I should like to point out that in 1976 the figure was given of some 5&#x00BD; million animals having been used; and I should also like those of us who are interested in the prevention of cruelty to animals not to be so anxious and self-righteous about it. To my mind, the Bramwell Committee's report on the factory farming of animals showed that that is much more cruel than the gentle work which has sometimes to be done with animals in a laboratory. Anybody who has been to a modern chicken farm, where millions of chickens are living with their necks between bits of wire, and who have seen these neurotic animals, will, I am sure, agree&#x2014;and it is now moving into the realm of pig farming and calf farming. Let us stop this attitude that it is only the scientists in the laboratories who are being wantonly cruel to animals. People who speak like that know nothing about what it costs to set up, from the pathological department right through, an experiment on animals. No scientist would have the background for simple, wanton research. Anyway, all research has to have approval&#x2014;and it has to have the approval of men and women in a profession which has to be trusted,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0126"/>
<col>235</col>
because it has the know-how so far as we laymen are concerned. Consequently, let me say that more work has been done to try to meet some of the feelings of the Littlewood Committee as shown in their report on laboratory animals than has been done in the field of agriculture as a result of the Bramwell Report on factory farming.<lb/>
I want to thank my noble friend Lord Janner. I was fascinated by his story of the placenta. We have not got the time to do it now, but perhaps at the Committee stage or at some other time some noble Lord in the field of medicine or in this field, who knows about the work which is done on this matter&#x2014;there must be some noble Lord who does can&#x2014;tell us whether there is any reality in it. If there is reality in it, then I say to my noble friend Lord Janner that I am quite certain the scientists and others in Britain will be among the first to recognise the truth of this statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00730"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite agree. I hope they will read the book which has been produced, which contains very full information about it, but I do not want my noble friend to think for one moment that I was in any way deprecating those who are in the scientific world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00731"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend missed my opening sentence. I was congratulating him. In fact, I used the words, "Thank you". My Lords, I must not speak for too long&#x2014;and I have an apology to make to the House. It is not my custom to leave the Chamber if I have spoken in a debate, but I have a commitment with the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I shall stay here as long as I can, and I hope that perhaps the debate will be finished before I have to go. Let me take just another couple of minutes.<lb/>
There are regulations and Acts which, whatever we may say at the present moment, imply that animals have to be used; and they require manufacturers, those of us in the pharmaceutical industry and others to let the Home Office know, and to let other authorities know, what is being done. There are the Medicines Act 1968, the Health and Safety at Work Act, the Consumer Protection Act, the
<col>236</col>
cosmetic products regulations of 1976, and the regulations concerning the safe use of poisonous chemicals on farms. I am picking the noble Earl's brains now; he knows that. Then there are the 1978 regulations concerning approved products for farmers and growers, the proposed scheme for the notification of toxic properties in substances, the Food and Drugs Act 1955, two of the Pesticides (Safety Precautions) Schemes 1971&#x2014;and so one could go on.<lb/>
My Lords, I am about to sit down. We talk about Europe, and what we might do there. I do not think we have to wait for this. To cut my speech right short now, I hope that this House will approve and give a Second Reading to this Bill, so that we may have a Select Committee to give a lead and produce a piece of work which will do well for Britain and also (since this Government are interested in prosperity) for the drug industry and the research of our great medical, scientific and biological people who, for years, have given a lead to the world in the cure of diseases.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00733"><member>Lord CROSS of CHELSEA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, until recently I was the chairman of the committee set up by the Home Secretary to advise him on problems arising under the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act, so perhaps your Lordships will bear with me while I say a few words and they will be very few&#x2014;on this Bill. In 1876 there were comparatively few animal experiments, and the main problem which faced the legislature 100 years ago was that of vivisection, the performance of surgical operations on unanaesthetised animals in furtherance of physiological knowlege. Today, the main problem, I think, is quite a different one. It is that created by the need to test for safety new substances&#x2014;medicines, industrial chemicals, pesticides, weed killers, detergents and so on&#x2014;which are constantly being devised and made available to the public. Nearly all countries&#x2014;this country, the EEC countries and most developed foreign countries&#x2014;have legislation which requires the use of animals to test the safety of new substances, and under that legislation, day in and day out, millions upon millions of rats and mice are being used for safety testing. The problem, of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0127"/>
<col>237</col>
course, is to strike a fair balance between the safeguarding of the consumer and the limitation on the number of animals used.<lb/>
My Lords, I would emphasise to your Lordships that this is not a United Kingdom problem. It is a worldwide problem; and, as the noble Earl who opened this debate emphasised, it is one in which this country, with its great experience of animal protection legislation, can lead the way&#x2014;and I am sure I hope it will. But, of course, legislation in this field is something of a hot potato. There is necessarily, I think, a certain suspicion, or there has been, between, on the one hand, scientists and doctors and those predominantly concerned with the protection of the consumer, and, on the other hand, those predominantly concerned with the welfare of animals. Of course, those classes overlap; many doctors and scientists are animal lovers, and many people who are members of animal welfare organisations use medicines and detergents.<lb/>
I think myself&#x2014;this is the strong impression I gained in my work as chairman of the committee&#x2014;that, based on a greater knowledge of the facts, there is gradually growing a greater mutual understanding on both sides than there used to be. That was borne, in on me as I heard the evidence in the inquiry the committee made into the LD50 test some months ago. But the time is undoubtedly ripe for a new Bill and thin, Bill is certainly an enormous improvement on the existing one. Speaking for myself, I should have liked to see it a Government measure. I do not think that the noble Earl will dissent from me on that. But assuming that the Government are not going to produce a Bill of their own, I would invite your Lordships to give this Bill a Second Reading, trusting to having it amended in certain respects in Committee.<lb/>
My Lords, there are just one or two points of detail on the Bill that I would refer to. The first concerns the composition of the advisory committee which is to be built into the statute. It is not like the existing committee, which is not statutory at all. The Bill makes no express provision for the inclusion among the members of the committee of members representative of animal welfare organisations. I am not sure that that is wise. Certainly, in our deliberations on the LD50
<col>238</col>
test we were greatly helped by having with us as an observer Mr. Jordan, a member of the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation. Obviously, it would be inappropriate to put on to the committee a convinced abolitionist, a man convinced on principle of the wrongful nature of animal experimentation; and obviously such a man would not willingly serve on the committee. But I hope that the Select Committee, if this Bill goes to one, will consider the possibility of including members of animal welfare organisations on the committee.<lb/>
The second matter is rather more personal. The Bill provides that the chairman of the committee should be a legally-qualified gentleman. In a general way I am all in favour of "jobs for the boys" even if the job, like this one, is unpaid; but I am not sure that it is by any means necessary that the chairman of the advisory committee should be a lawyer. I was very glad to hear that Mrs. Warnock, the Oxford philosopher, who has been a member of our committee, was prepared to take my place as chairman of it when it was a non-statutory body. That is the second point which I hope that the Committee may take into account. I commend this Bill to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00735"><member>Lord FERRIER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am a layman but it so happens that I have had much to do with animals used in medical research and I have taken part in a number of debates in this House over the years&#x2014;to such an extent that I feel justified in adding to the congratulations which have been showered on the noble Earl on the result of his expertise and enterprise and that of his team which produced this Bill which is praised as it should be. I think, on what I have heard, that I can assume that the House will give the Bill a Second Reading and refer it to a Select Committee; but that will not be the end of it for there are plenty of problems with other Bills in the other House, problems connected with the Common Market and the like and we shall no doubt hear from the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, about other projects which are in his mind. But I do not propose to refer to any specific part of the Bill for that is a Committee matter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0128"/>
<col>239</col>
I intend to detain your Lordships for only a very short time to comment on the situation in general terms. First I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, on his maiden speech. He outlined a number of directions in which man's life is related to animals, and I should have liked to hear him add the word "companionship" in terms of animals. I have just been to the Kipling lunch and I think of his poem about "the firstest friend". He said:
<quote>"I love Binky my dog because</quote>
<quote>He is the same as the first friend was</quote>
<quote>And I am the man in the cave."</quote>
The problem has an emotional element, thanks largely to the divisive and sometimes hysterical campaigns by organisations in the anti-vivisection field whose sponsors' heart-felt sincerity must be respected although, alas! they allow their hearts to overrule their heads. The noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, brought that out in his reference to this morning's broadcast to which I shall refer again. Talking of the anti-vivisection people, with their substantial financial resources, they inevitably employ personnel whose merit in their employers' eyes rests on the stridency with which they "sing for their suppers." That is something that we must bear in mind increasingly today. It applies to trade unions but that is another matter. There are people employed to say these things.<lb/>
Those of your Lordships who may have listened to Radio 4 at 7.15 this morning, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, has referred, will understand what I mean. I thought the BBC were interviewing someone on the Bill. I thought that their interviewer put up a very moderate and sensible case for the Bill in the face of the criticisms that were made and he dealt with the "anti's" strident and misleading condemnation of it. This brings me to the single point that I want to make. One result of the Bill, if it becomes law, will be to enable the Home Office to collect and publish statistics in a more generous way and in a more accessible form than at present. I cite this instance. I was in the woods the other day collecting chanterelles and wood hedgehogs&#x2014;which I had not heard of but ate with relish. I took a book on fungi from my shelf and it opened at "Moulds". In the middle of the page
<col>240</col>
was a description of Florey's original experiment, in respect of penicillin. I sent my name immediately to the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, and said that I should like to speak. Your Lordships may recall that with the small pickle of penicillin that was available to Florey he inoculated 50 mice with streptococci and treated 25 of them with penicillin. Twenty-four of these survived and all the others died. No one, I think, can say that that was a waste of animal life. This, we know, is the sort of thing that happens. This experiment of his led to the saving of thousands of lives in the war and continues today into the millions.<lb/>
Was the experiment necessary? I leave it to your Lordships to decide that. Was this one experiment or was it fifty? Here I am back to statistics. I think I am right in saying that at present it would be 50; but there are various other angles on this which are very interesting. Were the mice anaesthetised'? Of course not. If one turns to the Home Office publication <i>Experiments on living animals: Statistics 1977,</i> at page 18 one sees under the heading <i>Rabbit, Applications of substance to the eye: </i> 14,897 experiments. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, who congratulated the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, on pressing the use of the word "procedures" rather than "experiments" Ten animals and 10 control animals used in one test would be reported as 20 experiments. One animal used 10 times in 10 consecutive experiments which all gave negative answers would be reported as 10 experiments. On Page 18 at column 6 the returns are 14,897 experiments on rabbits used for testing the application of substances applied to the eye. This figure could relate to anything between 14,897 rabbits used once each with a positive result, and one rabbit used 14,897 times with a negative result in each case. The truth would lie somewhere between these extremes, but not in any discoverable way. This is indicative of the way in which I hope to look forward to see statistics turned out when the noble Earl's Bill is an Act and the law of the land.<lb/>
This is where I cross swords with the "anti's". They know perfectly well that many of their accusations based on current figures are grossly misleading because the figures are misleading or capable of misinterpretation. If they do not, then they ought to. This Bill will go
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0129"/>
<col>241</col>
a long way to clear matters up. I deplore the divisive and accusatory terms in which these campaigns are waged. It was by chance only that I found myself concerned with the use of animal procedures. First, as a boy in a physiological laboratory under a well known research physiologist; and, later in my life, as chairman of a group manufacturing pharmaceutical products with our own animal laboratory. I mention this in order to refute the accusation implicit in too much of the "anti's" material, that researchers are, <i>ipso facto,</i> monsters of cruelty. They are not. The reverse is the case. This point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hylton-Foster. Individuals, with very few exceptions, are not callous. They respect life. Why else are they researching? Compassion and the love of animals does not reside on one side of the divide which has been created and none on the other.<lb/>
Let us strive to press on with this Bill. It is far ahead of anything else that has been done. The speech of the noble and learned Lord who preceded me was most impressive on this direction. What more really can be said? Let us try to press on with it. It is far ahead of anything that has been done. It reflects the greatest benison on the noble Earl and his team. I repeat the word that he used in his own speech when talking about compassion. He referred to his work as "a labour of love by a dedicated team". So far ahead indeed is this Bill that one appreciates how wounding it must be to those who wish that they had thought of it before, or thought of it themselves. That is why I said early in my speech that there are problems ahead with various Bills in various directions. I do not think anything more meticulous or more well informed is going to emerge. The Bill is a huge step forward and I hope that the House will give it a Second Reading and commit it to a Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00737"><member>Lord DE CLIFFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I address your Lordships, I should like to offer an apology to the noble Earl for not being present when he made his speech, and to the other noble Lords whom I unfortunately did not hear because of the rather inclement weather that I encountered on my way here. Having said that, I shall not detain your Lordships unduly. It would be ill of me
<col>242</col>
to make comments on this Bill, not having heard what other noble Lords have said. Any remarks I may make are purely my own views.<lb/>
The noble Earl and I on a number of occasions have disagreed quite strongly on the subject of animal experimentations. When I obtained his Bill during the recess I was most surprised to find that I supported him practically the whole way through. This is the first really good attempt that we have had&#x2014;and when I say "good" that is a masterpiece of understatement&#x2014;at producing a Bill to amend the 1876 Act. The whole of the administration of the 1876 Act, until fairly recently, was clothed in the most appalling fog.<lb/>
One of the things about which I agree most strongly with my noble friend Lord Ferrier is the totally incomprehensible statistics which have been produced. One of the reasons why there is such tremendous heat against animal experimentation is the enormous numbers&#x2014;running into millions&#x2014;of experiments being carried out on animals. The bulk of those experiments were probably justified; perhaps a lot were not. The trouble is that those of us who are on the periphery of these things are presented with only the very worst aspects. One never sees anything being pushed forward to suggest that certain scientific experiments on animals have been made which are going to advance everything for the benefit of mankind. But if one experiment goes wrong there is noise like the trumpets of Hell blowing to welcome the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury. That is wrong, my Lords.<lb/>
I do not like experiments on animals. My personal feeling is automatically against them. But I hope that I am one of those who can see that these are necessary, and that, up to a point, we have to have them. Many advances which have been made would never have been made without experiments. I am not saying that I agree with the methods on occasions, but I can see that experiments have to take place. I say to the noble Earl: I thank you for taking the steps forward which you have.<lb/>
I strongly support the noble Earl in moving that this Bill be committed to a Select Committee. I have heard of this House&#x2014;particularly when we had another

Government&#x2014;having long hot summers; this Select Committee is going to have a long hot winter. The Committee is going to be exposed to flames of indignation and wrath day after day. I hope that those selected to sit on it will have a great deal of resistance to pressure, because they are going to suffer it. Apart from that, there are a few small items with which I disagree: some drafting; some minor matters of principle. I heartily support the noble Earl's Bill, and I trust that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading. I wish it the hest of luck in the Select Committee, if it is so committed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00739"><member>Lord RICHARDSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, I was a student of the late Lord Adrian and formed an admiration and a love for him which was very commonly held. It was thus with great delight that I listened to the enormous success of his son when he made his maiden speech this afternoon. My pleasure at this, however, was considerably muted by the fact that he said many of the things that I had wished to say and said them so much better than I would have if I had attempted to say them. So I must confine myself strictly to matters that he did not stress although he mentioned them.<lb/>
One, I think, is very important&#x2014;and in this I speak from experience&#x2014;which is that this debate and this discussion is coming at a time when the Council of Europe is considering the legislation concerning these matters throughout Europe; and several noble Lords have made this point. Why I say I have some experience of this is that the first of the Directives directed towards the professions from the EEC was concerned with my own profession. It was extremely clear that the long experience of organisation of education in this country had a major effect on the tenor of those Directives. In fact, the assessment of sufficiency for medical student training would have been expressed entirely quantitatively had it not been for the introduction of the qualitative element by people representing this country. I believe the same is true in the postgraduate field where, again, we are well organised and know what we think. If in this country we can know what we think and know it in a modern setting&#x2014;not just
<col>244</col>
as it was 103 years ago in its starting&#x2014;this Bill will have done a very great service to this country.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, made very clearly a point about the sponsors for those who should hold licences. I am one of the 10 presidents of institutions who has the task of acting as a second sponsor and, like the late Lord Platt, I find it is intensely difficult and indeed invidious, because I do not know enough of the individuals and sometimes of the subject. I have to search my knowledge and try to find out, but I do not believe I always do this satisfactorily and I know that another president of another institution holds exactly the same views. In the future those who are sponsors not only will, in the one instance, know the individual and his work but, in the other instance, will know the relevance and importance of the experiments to be done.<lb/>
We have heard this afternoon about emotion. It is not entirely on the side of those who would deplore animal experiments. It is held very strongly indeed by doctors who have to care for patients and who have the greatest and most intense gratitude when there is a specific remedy they can apply, and who have a sense of extreme pain that would amount to terrible anger and resentment if, when they cannot find a remedy that can be applied, the reason for their not finding it is a failure to experiment because of a false logic and a lack of balance as to the relative importance of man and his suffering in relation to that of animals, however greatly one might wish the animals not to suffer.<lb/>
Mention has been made, as was inevitable in this debate, of penicillin. The experiments that the noble Lord, Lord Ferrier, has just told us about were relevant to penicillin. It so happens that last Sunday in the Central Synagogue in Great Portland Street there was held a memorial service for the last to die of the immortal triumvirate of Florey, Fleming and Sir Ernst Chain, and the Chief Rabbi, in a most moving memorial address, said of genius that there had been Darwin and Marx and Freud and Einstein. Then he said:
<quote>"Which of those has been responsible for saving the lives of millions and millions of men?"&#x2014;<i>Sir Ernst Chain</i></quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0131"/>
<col>245</col>
He went on to say he did not think there was a single person in that vast building full of people who did not owe something to that discovery, either directly or indirectly. I believe this to be true of the Members of your Lordships' House. The emotion is not entirely on the side of the anti-vivisectionists.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00740">5.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00741"><member>Lord AUCKLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debt of gratitude which this House owes to the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, for instigating this debate this afternoon is very much more considerable than many people think, because we have had Bills, quite sincerely meant, from the other side of the spectrum but nothing in those Bills have ever given any real alternative to saving lives and to decreasing the numbers of deaths and disablements through malignant disease. Now at last we have a Bill which we hope will in due course reach the Statute Book, if not in its present form, in something like its present form, because it has very much merit in it.<lb/>
Most of those who have contributed to this debate have themselves been distinguished doctors and scientists. I cannot classify myself in either category, although for many years my family and I&#x2014;as I have had reason to mention before to your Lordships&#x2014;have been involved in sitting on hospital committees of various kinds and have witnessed the use of drugs which have been able to be used, very largely through experiments on animals. I should like in this connection to add my own congratulations to the very erudite maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, whose father was a distinguished and much respected scientist who contributed most valuably to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The Bill has the merit of setting out with considerable clarity its aims. It places considerable obligations upon those who conduct these experiments. I think that is a very important point to remember. We were regaled in some of the popular Press recently with some quite loathsome experiments on animals in a certain Oriental country&#x2014;experiments which would never be allowed here under the legislation at present in force and certainly not under the legislation which the noble Earl, himself a most distinguished scientist, has put in his Bill.<lb/>
<col>246</col>
Of course, this is an emotive subject. Any death of a pet, particularly a dog, cat or rabbit, is a matter for tragedy; but it is something like 0.25 per cent. of dogs which are used in experiments in this country. But let us get things into perspective. How many dogs get thrown out of cars on to a motorway because they are unwanted by families? I must declare an interest here, as we have a dog which was obtained as a small puppy from a lady who specialises in dogs which have come from the RSPCA and which, as puppies, have been ill-treated in some form or other. We have given homes to several such dogs which I am pleased to say have all, so far, lived to a fairly ripe age. We like to think that that is because they have been well looked after.<lb/>
How many dogs, cats and other animals are kicked, have things thrown at them or have poison indiscriminately put down for them? We hear all too little of this from those who criticise what the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, is seeking to do in his Bill. Of course, no legislation of this kind can be above criticism and no care can be too great to ensure that suffering does not take place. I think that the obligation to put all animals used for these experiments to sleep afterwards, though regrettable in many ways, is essential to make sure that no suffering takes place.<lb/>
I especially welcome Clause 5 of the Bill, but I wonder whether my noble friend who will be replying for the Home Office, and the noble Earl would consider making this power mandatory, rather than permissive; in other words, substituting "shall" for "may". However, that is a matter for the Select Committee, if that is where the Bill goes. I believe that power to be most essential. Also, it should be extended to the kennels where these dogs are kept, particularly if they are some distance away from where the experiments take place. Similarly, the power in the very important Clause 7 should be mandatory, if it is not already so. I may be doing the noble Earl an injustice in asserting that it is not mandatory, but my reading of the clause is that at the moment it is a discretionary power. One reads stories about the transportation of animals in rather different circumstances, and this is something which is vital.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0132"/>
<col>247</col>
It is obviously very difficult to obtain figures of people who have suffered from conditions such as asthma&#x2014;and, since I suffer from sinus trouble from time to time, I can speak with some knowledge here&#x2014;arthritis and certain cancers, who would never have seen the light of day for more than a few months or years of their lives, had it not been for these experiments. I have not witnessed many such experiments. I have witnessed one in this country and another at a well-known pharmaceutical company in Antwerp. The experiments were carried out under conditions of absolutely maximum cleanliness, hygiene and skill and there was no question of the animal being ill-treated. There was also no question of a show being put on, merely because several Members of Parliament went along in an official capacity.<lb/>
I believe that this is a Bill which is well worthy of going to a Select Committee, particularly in view of the possible implications of EEC legislation. If we do not have a Bill such as this, two things will happen. First, animals will suffer very much more than they do now at the hands of all kinds of cheapjack experimenters working for profit, and, secondly, more animals will find themselves abandoned by those who do not know how to look after them. It may, in sonic cases, be a choice between evils. One can understand people's feelings when animals are used on experiments and, in the long run, have to die. But there has been very convincing proof in speeches this afternoon by those who really know and who have taken part in these experiments that much human life has been saved and that much remains to be saved in the future if these perfectly ethical experiments can go on with the Home Office inspectorate being ever vigilant to make sure that no malpractice takes place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00743"><member>Lord HOUGHTON of SOWERBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate that we have had today has been more than a discussion on the Second Reading of a Bill. I believe that it is the opening of a long and, I hope, fruitful debate on this difficult subject which is likely to continue in Parliament for some time. As an indication of public concern on this question, I would remind your Lordships' House that the
<col>248</col>
three major political parties referred to this subject in their respective election manifestoes, and that is a clear sign that public concern about this question has made an impact on political opinion.<lb/>
I think that we all owe a deep sense of gratitude to the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, for his accomplished presentation of this Bill to us this afternoon. I have been grateful to him for a long time for his confidence and reports, as occasion arose, on the progress that he was making with this Bill. I say to the noble Lord the Minister opposite that, if he spends half as much time on a Government Bill on this subject as has been spent by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, then at the end of the day we shall have accomplished a fine legislative change.<lb/>
The Government themselves have promised to introduce a Bill to update the 1876 Act, but now we have a Bill by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, in this House; we are to expect the Second Reading in another place on 16th November of a private Member's Bill introduced by Mr. Peter Fry on the same subject, and currently we have under consideration the draft convention of the Council of Europe, which is also about experimentation on living animals. So after a long period when there has been little happening on this front we have three new elements in the situation, and I think it will be of interest to the House to learn from the Minister how Her Majesty's Government see the legislative programme, the strategy for dealing with this complex problem during this next Session of Parliament.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, will probably find that he is a kind of pathfinder for the Government. He is leading the way in thought on this subject. If the Bill is referred to a Select Committee, as I hope it will be, I think that the evidence which will be given to it will be of great value in considering the later stages of discussion and constructive thought on the subject.<lb/>
I happen to be the chairman of a committee for the reform of animal experimentation, and in the course of today's debate I have not heard the kind of speeches on this Bill that I hear from my friends in the animal welfare movement. The debate has been one of tranquillity. The voice of sanity has
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0133"/>
<col>249</col>
prevailed throughout. But it takes more than the voice of sanity to make the world go round. It takes the voice of passion, of deeply held conviction, of deeply stirred conscience. That is what we shall be listening to in the weeks and months to come on this and other measures for reform in this field. And we must not despise that. We must take account of the fact that public opinion is stirred more by emotional reactions to a matter of this kind than by the laboratory approach to the use of animals for research and similar purposes.<lb/>
In my own work in recent months I have missed the late Lord Platt whose vast experience and moderate counsel on this difficult subject was of great benefit to me. I am quite sure that he would have taken part in the debate today had he been spared to comment on my noble friend's Bill. This Bill is to be welcomed for the good it does, which is not inconsiderable. It incorporates practically all the recommendations of the Littlewood Committee which have been neglected for so long because they needed legislative change. The opportunity has now come to incorporate them in the Bill.<lb/>
The Bill strengthens the conditions under which licences are granted to persons who are suitably qualified. It requires the limits of their use of animals for particular purposes to be clearly laid down. The Bill improves laboratory practices; it imposes conditions for the alleviation of suffering and stress; and in many ways it seeks to make the life of the laboratory animal more tolerable. That is all to the good. However, I see nothing in the Bill which offers any hope of reducing the numbers of animals which pour into our laboratories happily alive but which come out of them miserably dead. I see nothing in the Bill to restrict the use of animals and to get the numbers down, which the leaders of both the Conservative and the Labour Parties have publicly declared to be their wish.<lb/>
The Home Secretary can, admittedly, use his discretion under the procedures of the Bill to put the brake on practices which would give rise to public indignation if they became known or which would he an objectionable abuse of animal life. However, I cannot put too much confidence in Home Secretaries to use their discretion in Bills of this kind because the
<col>250</col>
record of successive Home Secretaries on the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 is quite deplorable. I know of no Act of Parliament which has been converted so freely by successive Ministers into a piece of elastic as the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876.<lb/>
That is why I think that we must examine closely the two watchdogs in the public interest with which the Bill deals. One is the inspectorate and the other is the advisory committee. The inspectorate on the one hand and the advisory committee on the other ace the representatives of the public interest here. Clearly the public have an interest in what experimenters are doing. They are doing a great deal at public expense, anyway, and they are doing it under immunity from prosecution under the general criminal laws against cruelty to animals.<lb/>
To the extent that cruelty or suffering and pain are inflicted on animals in laboratory work, it is done under licence. If it were not done under licence, it would probably be the subject of criminal prosecution. Indeed, not so long ago there was a case in Scotland where, had an experiment been carried out under the protection of the 1876 Act it would not have been open to prosecution; but since the experiment was conducted outside the protection of that Act the person concerned was prosecuted and convicted under the Protection of Animals Act (Scotland) 1912. Therefore those who are doing this work under the protection of the 1876 Act have an obligation to pay attention to public concern. That is why they must submit themselves to be monitored and supervised where suffering may prove to be unavoidable.<lb/>
The inspectors are there to see that the law and the regulations are complied with. The Bill strengthens their position, and that is to be welcomed. However, they are not able by themselves to provide the Home Secretary with all the advice he needs to exercise the discretion which the Bill would give to him. That is where I think the advisory committee conies in.<lb/>
Several references have been made by noble Lords to the composition and work of the advisory committee. In a very well informed and interesting speech, the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, referred
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0134"/>
<col>251</col>
to the advisory committee. Then a few moments ago we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Cross of Chelsea, who until recently was chairman of the advisory committee. The late Lord Platt was a member of the advisory committee and complained bitterly on more than one occasion about the infrequent use made of the committee by Home Secretaries of the day. That is why I am most anxious that the advisory committee provided for in this Bill should not only be statutory but also should have responsibilities and powers of initiative of its own. It should not be dependent wholly upon the call of the Home Secretary to examine a particular matter upon which he needs advice. It must be free. It must have the powers of a watch dog in the public interest.<lb/>
The present Home Secretary has to some extent forestalled the provisions contained in the Bill relating to the future terms of reference and the composition of the advisory committee. In an announcement made a little while ago the Home Secretary appointed a new chairman&#x2014;who is not to be one learned in the law, as the noble Lord, Lord Cross of Chelsea, pointed out&#x2014;and he had fresh proposals to make regarding the terms of reference, which to some extent are satisfactory. However, there is still, unfortunately, a problem as to the composition of the advisory committee: who shall be on it, what kind of background they shall come from and what kind of interest one is to expect them to reflect in the work of the advisory committee.<lb/>
This is a most difficult question. One can either have a completely neutral, non-professional committee or one can have a committee which has upon it those of experience and those with points of view upon particular aspects of the problem&#x2014;professional, medical, animal welfare and so forth&#x2014;and I think we have not finally resolved how the new advisory committee is to be composed. But undoubtedly we want to see on that committee a few intelligent laymen. After all, they are the representatives of the public interest. The public are lay people, but in a democracy their voice is as important, if not more important, than that of more sophisticated and well informed people. We cannot leave all these things to the
<col>252</col>
experts. Your Lordships know as well as I do that very often experts, left to themselves, become dangerous people. Some of them even go "dotty" and they require the commonsense of the layman to keep them on the lines of rational thought and activity. That is the element that we want to see on the advisory committee.<lb/>
The Littlewood Committee understood this when in paragraph 238 of their report they said:
<quote>"The role of legislation is to prohibit objectionable activities, to encourage humane practices and to provide for the aceountability to the public of all concerned".</quote>
My Lords, that is the keynote of legislation and that must be found in full measure in this Bill. I think that an examination of it will show that it has to be tested against that particular criterion. I strongly support the Motion to refer this Bill to a Select Committee. I support the Second Reading of the Bill, also, not because it is the final word, not because it reflects all that I would wish to see, but because its great value lies in the fact that it is the product of deep thought and consideration by scientific opinion. In particular, it might be said that it represents what the Research Defence Society feels able to accept and that is an important guide in the consideration of this matter.<lb/>
If we have a Select Committee, I think it will help to receive evidence; not only to invite it but to summon it and let us hear the constructive proposals of those who have much to say on all sides of this argument, and in particular the animal welfare organisations. When animal welfare organisations have carried their message and their propaganda to the point of attracting the serious attention of political parties, the close attention of Government and of Parliament, who want to reform and change the law, then I believe the animal welfare organisations have a clear public duty to come forward with constructive proposals to enable all parties to arrive at an agreed conclusion. That is really what all this should be about and the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, has started the process of that opportunity.<lb/>
This is the first time for many years that we have had the opportunity of embarking on such an important phase of consideration of this matter. I know, as
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0135"/>
<col>253</col>
my noble friend Lord Davies of Leek said, that there are other worries in the field of animal welfare, but we cannot do everything at once and we cannot put one noble cause in competition with another. I think we have to deal with those things upon which we feel deeply, upon which we believe that we have the knowledge and conviction to advance the matter further and to try to get progress in that way.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Adrian, and other noble Lords have given their philosophical judgment upon the use of animals for experimental purposes. This is not the moment to open the moral argument, but so far as I am concerned&#x2014;and I speak only for myself&#x2014;I do not believe that we have any moral right to do these things to animals. I do not believe that man has any divine or moral right of dominion over other species. Personally I can never accept the doctrine of the sanctity of human life from those who regard animal life as being freely expendable and who will subordinate other living things to the greed and the arrogance and the selfishness of mankind. That is a personal point of view, but I do not let it blind me to other considerations and other points of view. Since we have to get a consensus if we are to get legislation, if we are to get public opinion behind us, if we are to get the response from those who are working in the laboratories, we must all try to come together and get a code and a standard of conduct which will be accepted by all of us as the best possible method of going forward in all the circumstances. Therefore, I hope the House will give the Bill a Second Reading and will adopt the Motion to refer it to a Select Committee, because I believe that the evidence which that Select Committee can obtain will be of enormous value in the later stages of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00745"><member>Lord SOMERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not intended to speak tonight and I hope your Lordships will bear with me for a few moments. The noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, to whom I always listen with respect, particularly on this subject, regretted the lack of passion in today's debate. I think I may count myself as a modest representative of the animal welfare world: I am the president of the Council of Justice to Animals, I
<col>254</col>
am chief patron of the Crusade against all Cruelty to Animals. I am also a patron of a trust which owns a large dogs' home, but I have always found that where one gets passionate defence of animals it is practically invariably from those who are either incapable of seeing both sides of the question or who do not want to see both sides. I believe that the only way in which to make any progress at all is to look at it from a perfectly balanced point of view and to see the pros and cons of the entire subject.<lb/>
I owe a great deal to the medical profession. In fact if it were not for them I should not be standing here tonight and anything that can further their knowledge I am perfectly prepared to support. I can only say that I entirely support my noble friend's Bill and I sincerely hope that it will go to a Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00746">5.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00747"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, animal experimentation is a complex and highly specialised subject. It also raises moral and social issues which are by no means the exclusive concern of the scientists. I think there are few other scientific activities which give rise to such strong instinctive reactions towards suffering to which many, in fact all, of your Lordships have given expression in the speeches which have been made today. With over 100 years' experience behind us in the working of the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876, and in view of the developments which have taken place during that time in the fields of scientific research and animal welfare, it is clearly right that the most serious consideration should be given to placing on the Statute Book legislation which takes those developments fully into account. So our thanks are more than usually due to the promoter of a Private Members' Bill: to the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, today, not only for introducing what I think is only the second attempt completely to replace the 1876 Act but also because by introducing this important Bill the noble Earl has attracted to the debate many of your Lordships who have a close knowledge of the working of the existing legislation. May I join all other noble Lords in welcoming particularly the speech which was made by the noble Lord, Lord Adrian. In fact the noble Lord has been frequently a patient listener in your
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0136"/>
<col>255</col>
Lordships' House and I welcome so much that he decided to come and speak on this subject today, a subject on which he has unrivalled qualifications to speak.<lb/>
If I may say so, the noble Earl's speech and the speeches of other noble Lords have shown that legislation on this subject must maintain a proper balance between the legitimate requirements of science and industry and those of animal welfare. As I think all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate will know better than I do, the basic objective of the 1876 Act, which has continued substantially unchanged to the present day, is to regulate and restrict experiments calculated to cause pain in living vertebrate animals.<lb/>
It is against that background that the most recent independent review of the working of the Act was carried out by the Littlewood Committee between 1963 and 1965. Perhaps I could just remind your Lordships in passing that the Committee found that the Act had been generally effective in preventing objectionable activities, in encouraging humane practices and in providing for the accountability to the public of all concerned. The members of the Committee concluded, however, that in what were then recent years the provisions of the Act had not matched up to modern scientific and technological requirements and that administration had not kept pace with scientific advance.<lb/>
The Committee made 83 detailed recommendations. As the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, said, actions were then taken to try and put at any rate parts of the report into effect. Over 20 of the recommendations were in fact implemented administratively, either wholly or in part, with consequent improvement to the effectiveness of the controls. The most obvious examples are the appointment of lay members to the Advisory Committee and the re-organisation which took place of the Inspectorate.<lb/>
Perhaps I could just pick up the point which the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, kindly made in his speech: that on the 25th July the Government announced a reconstitution of the Advisory Committee with a new name, the Advisory Committee on Animal Experiments, with wider terms
<col>256</col>
of reference and with a new chairman, following the period of service which the noble Lord, Lord Cross of Chelsea, had most kindly given to the work of that committee. The noble and learned Lord gave us advice as he saw it on how the committee could develop in the future with regard to both composition and function. Lord Adrian in his speech also referred to the Advisory Committee, as also did the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, and I do assure all three noble Lords and the rest of your Lordships that I will draw the attention of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary to what has been said not only generally in this debate but specifically on that particular subject.<lb/>
Some 10 recommendations from Little-wood called for no specific action in that they endorsed provisions in existing legislation or in existing practice. Of the remainder of the Littlewood recommendations some 20 needed legislation. May I just say that the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, has, I think, every right to claim, as he did in his speech, that his Bill aims to deal with those remaining recommendations of Littlewood which needed legislation. The Government have also had this in mind and this was why at the General Election our Manifesto undertook to introduce legislation updating the Act. When the noble Baroness, Lady Hylton-Foster, asks me about higher standards and what the Government would do to commit themselves to higher standards in this field, my answer is that updated legislation would be designed to continue to enable improvement in standards of animal experiments along with strengthened control for animal welfare.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, mentioned in his speech, however, a United Kingdom delegation is currently engaged, in full consultation with the animal welfare organisations and with the research and professional interests, in discussions in the Council of Europe on a draft convention to protect animals used for experimental purposes. In fact the delegation only returned from the latest round of work last weekend. I understand that the overall shape of the convention is becoming clearer, but there remains a good deal of work to be done on the contents. I hope that after listening to Lord Richardson's professional testimony
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0137"/>
<col>257</col>
to the influence which the medical profession in this country has had on EEC Directives your Lordships will allow me to assert that I believe we are playing a leading part in these discussions on the European Convention, and this is a tribute to this country's long experience in this field. Although I cannot commit the Government at this stage, I very much hope that, not least through United Kingdom influence, a convention is going to emerge to which we shall have no difficulty in being able to give our assent. This would in itself almost inevitably mean that the Government would be required to bring in new legislation to meet the pro-visions of the convention.<lb/>
In case your Lordships think that this is simply an excuse for saying that there-fore the Government are not prepared to do anything at the present moment, may I just explain the effect of what I have just tried to say. It seems likely that the Council of Europe convention will establish general principles of control while preserving a measure of flexibility as to method, so that each of the contracting countries would have a certain amount of freedom in adopting its own preferred control system. But really it is too early to be sure that United Kingdom legislation produced now would not need amendment in the light of the convention in its final form. There are several key issues which will receive further study in Strasbourg.<lb/>
If I may give one concrete example, the latest draft of the convention covers the breeding and supply of laboratory animals, which is beyond the scope of the 1876 Act. In order to comply with the convention, therefore, we would have to provide for controls in this particular area. I recognise absolutely that the Bill of the noble Earl contains a provision about this, but with respect it is a very general provision embodied in Clause 7, and I think it is too early to say whether further provision would be needed to meet the requirements of the convention as the convention emerges in its final form. This consideration applies not only to the question of controls on the breeding and supply of animals. If I may weary your Lordships with one other example, it applies also to all aspects of animal experimentation which are to be covered by the convention.<lb/>
Here is another example. The draft convention as it stands recognises as a
<col>258</col>
legitimate goal of experimentation "the improvement of life of man or animal", and this is taken up in the noble Earl's Bill in Clause 2(<i>c</i>)(ii). But it is very much a matter requiring careful examination and further debate as to whether this principle, which could allow all manner of abuses, should be subject to further refinement and restriction. This question will almost certainly be among matters which must receive further study at the next meeting of the Council of Europe committee.<lb/>
The noble Earl has indicated that his Bill has the broad approval of many of the scientific and research interests. The noble Earl's wish to demonstrate that those who are animal users are no less concerned with animal welfare than other people is certainly welcomed by all, and it is in that context that our debate this afternoon has been held. As we have heard, however, certainly from the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, there are wider issues on which the non-scientist expects to be heard and has a right to be heard. May I put it like this. What is the informed non-scientist pre-pared to accept in the use of experimental animals? I would suggest that he would not find acceptable some aspects of this Bill, which might indeed appear to compare unfavourably in concern for the welfare of experimental animals with the provisions of the 1876 Act, which they are intended to replace. That is particularly so as regards the purposes for which animals may be used.<lb/>
I have already mentioned the question of experiments concerned with improving life, that is to say, non-medical experiments. As drafted Clause 2 (<i>c</i>) (<i>v</i>)&#x2014;experiments done solely for the purpose of teaching technical skills&#x2014;might also be unacceptable to some people. I acknowledge that some relaxation of the absolute prohibition in the 1876 Act is desirable to take account of the demands of the highest levels of modern surgery, and that Clause 2 (<i>g</i>) of the Bill requires a licensee to have the Secretary of State's permission before conducting an experiment for such a purpose. That is certainly a safeguard, but I do not know that it goes far enough. In general, the use of live animals for the purpose of gaining manual dexterity is surely to many people morally repugnant.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0138"/>
<col>259</col>
I should have thought one would need to consider very carefully whether it could only be justified exceptionally.<lb/>
Our informed non-scientists would also be likely to find difficulty with Clause 2 (<i>h</i>) which deals with infliction of pain on an animal during an experiment. I was interested to hear the noble Earl's list of forms of treatment, and the list of the noble Lord, Lord Cross, of new substances which have developed since the 1876 Act came into force. I can well under-stand why the scope of the word "pain" in the context of modern animal experiments, is now much wider than when the 1876 Act was drafted. I must say that I am not convinced that the drafting of Clause 2 (<i>h</i>) would adequately deal with the problem. It would, for example, allow prolonged pain if the experimenter could satisfy himself that the degree of pain was not too severe; and it is left to the judgment of the experimenter as to what is severe pain or distress. I realise that these are difficult issues which&#x2014;as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Fawley, and the noble Lord, Lord Richardson, said&#x2014;must be put in the context of the saving of many lives. These are issues which rightly will be occupying much time at Strasbourg.<lb/>
I should like to deal with one other point. A general feature of the Bill which gives it, quite wrongly, an incomplete appearance&#x2014;"quite wrongly" because we know of the enormous amount of work and professional expertise which has been put in&#x2014;is the considerable extent to which it would leave matters to be determined by the Secretary of State. Clause 7 in effect leaves the control of supply, breeding, transport, accommodation, veterinary supervision and laboratory animal care to subordinate legislation without any indication being given as to the scope of the regulations. If for no other reason than that such controls may require financial provisions, some further substantive provision seems essential if effective controls are to be established over all these matters.<lb/>
I know that it is bound to give a mis-leading view of a Bill&#x2014;indeed it may, if I may say so, give a rather impertinent view&#x2014;to select the more obvious difficulties. Therefore, I should also like to say that I have been enormously impressed
<col>260</col>
with the general aims of the Bill, with the noble Earl's speech and, without any Government commitment, I was most interested to hear the noble Earl speak of the licensing provisions of the Bill and of his idea of a guide to good animal laboratory practice. Of course, many of the provisions stem straight from the Littlewood recommendations. But, whether or not the differences of view concerning this Bill are capable of reconciliation, any legislation must, as I have already argued, be introduced against the background of the provisions which will be included in the forthcoming European Convention.<lb/>
In the gracious Speech, the Government have declared their intention to introduce legislation when we know what the European Convention provides; but in the meantime, if close study of all the issues involved in the noble Earl's Bill can be undertaken, it would be an enormously valuable contribution to this country's revised legislation which we shall have to have. The noble Earl has indicated that if the Bill is given a Second Reading he will move for the Bill's referral to a Select Committee. The Government would support such a move in order to facilitate detailed examination of these difficult issues and we should, of course, give very careful consideration to the Select Committee's views.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00749"><member>The Earl of HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in winding up the debate I should like to begin by thanking the whole House for the kind reception that has been afforded to this Bill. Without a single exception everyone has paid tribute to the work of the drafting and advisory team which I was able to engage. I should like generally to thank the whole House.<lb/>
Without wishing to prolong the debate unduly, your Lordships will perhaps allow me to take up a few points that have been made by various speakers and reply to them. I should like generally to assure the whole House that as regards any what I call "Committee points" that have been raised, I personally shall be responsible for combing through the <i>Official Report</i> of today's date and ensuring that they are referred to the Select Committee, if your Lordships give the Bill a Second
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0139"/>
<col>261</col>
Reading and the Select Committee is set up. By giving that general undertaking I shall be able to shorten my remarks.<lb/>
As regards the matters raised by the noble Earl, Lord Grey, I should like to point out that he has not quite under-stood the implications of Clause 18. Of course an inspector has right of entry, but what happens if that right of entry is withstood? Is the inspector to be given the right to break in?&#x2014;No, my Lords. He must go to a magistrate, and a police officer must be given a warrant to break in and search the premises for whatever it may be. We cannot have people untrained in breaking and entering, other than burglars whom we send to prison. If anyone is to break and enter on a warrant from a magistrate it must be a police officer who knows his powers under that warrant.<lb/>
The other matter which I thought the noble Earl had not fully understood was cosmetics. I want your Lordships to appreciate how general the term is and perhaps I can make it a little more personal by giving an example. Suppose the wife of one of your Lordships or some noble Baroness was involved in a motor accident and was very badly scarred. It would be only natural to want to disguise those scars by cosmetical treatment. Scarred tissue is abnormally sensitive to carcinogens and therefore it is particularly important that cosmetics used for that purpose should be free from carcinogens. To say that they may not be tested by putting some general embargo on the testing of cosmetics would be quite wrong. I do not want to elaborate the matter. The noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, and I discussed the matter fully on the occasion of her two Bills.<lb/>
I was delighted with the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Adrian. In addition to the other qualities referred to by your Lordships, I noticed at one point a little note of dry wit which always com-mends itself to your Lordships' attention and which we shall look forward to hearing in the future. I noted his point about nominations to the advisory councils and will bear it in mind in Committee.<lb/>
I sympathise with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, becoming over-emotionally involved with an experimental rabbit. I once nursed through all its childhood
<col>262</col>
a small duckling with a broken leg which became, as it were, a toy for the children to play with and needless to say, it was known as "Donald". However, eventually came Christmas and we had to eat Donald. When we saw his broken leg on the dish coming out of the oven we were all deeply distressed to know that Donald had gone.<lb/>
I was interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Janner, said about the use of the placenta. I shall follow that up by reading what he recommended. However, I must make one point clear on the use of these alternatives. To establish and validate an alternative to animal experiments means using many more supernumerary animals. This is an area where one should make haste slowly otherwise one will find that one is sacrificing an un-necessarily large number of animals to the validation of alternatives which turn out not to be alternatives.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00750"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Earl will allow me to make just one remark on that point. The experiments to which I referred needed no experimentation on animals at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00751"><member>The Earl of HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order to establish that the technique of using whatever it may be&#x2014;a placenta or tissue culture&#x2014;gives the same result as that which would be obtained using an animal there needs to be correlation of the results on the former with the results on the animal. That is where the supernumerary animals must be used.<lb/>
I was delighted with the support that I received from my noble friend Lady Hylton-Foster. I am only too happy to assure her that I can take the three points she made to Committee to see what can be made of them. I was most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, for his comments about extension of the coverage and his defence of the Bill against the broadcast this morning. I was telephoned at a late hour last night and asked whether I would give an inter-view and make a recording for this morning's broadcast on Radio 4. Rightly or wrongly, I said that I would not, that I wanted to go into a huddle the night before this debate, stew over my notes and think about what I was going to say, and not get involved in making a recording.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0140"/>
<col>263</col>
I was extremely interested in the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cross of Chelsea, who spoke of the change of emphasis that there has been between the parties, who hitherto had been at daggers drawn. This is well represented in this House by the cordial relationship that has subsisted now for quite a number of years between the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, and myself, who have been in one another's confidence over progress in this area. I take the noble and learned Lord's point about the seats for animal welfare; there are vacant seats on the Council which could be used for this purpose. Again, it would be a Committee point to argue out whether they should be nominated for a specific purpose or whether the seats should be left open at the discretion of the Home Secretary.<lb/>
I was delighted with the exposition of the noble Lord, Lord Ferrier, on, as it were, the arithmetic of the annual report, because this is something that tends to be extremely misleading. I shall deal with that again when I come to some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby.<lb/>
Having wrestled with the noble Lord, Lord de Clifford, in years past, few people's speeches have pleased me more than his. The concept of wrestling with the noble Lord must be taken in a very general sense because, many years ago as little boys, we used to wrestle together when playing in Ranelagh Gardens. I am delighted to have his support. I was very glad that my noble friend Lord Richardson stressed the contribution that Britain can make to leadership by drawing on his experience in medical matters, and I was also delighted with the support of the noble Lord, Lord Auckland. As regards the mandatory as opposed to the permissive element in Clause 7, it reads, "The Secretary of State may". When the noble Lord speaks of making it mandatory, I take it that he wants Clause 7 to read, "The Secretary of State must". There is a certain drafting difficulty in making this mandatory because we cannot say that the Secretary of State must make a regulation on a matter if he may not want to make a regulation. There must be a point where we trust the Home Secretary to do what
<col>264</col>
we expect him to do. If he does not, then we must chase him all over the horizon in Parliament, which is the right place to bring pressure to bear, rather than put it into written words, which can be so treacherous.<lb/>
Lastly, I turn to what the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, had to say. The noble Lord called me a pathfinder. I had thought of myself more as a pace-maker, but I shall deal with that when I reply to the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, on behalf of the Home Office. With all respect to the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, I believe that to take numbers as a criterion is to pursue a will-o'-the-wisp. There are no magic numbers in nature, politics, or anything else. But numbers are not policy determinants; they are policy consequents. We cannot have a policy for animal experimentation based on, for example, the use of 4 million animals rather than 5 million. We are dealing with an on-going situation, never an equilibrium. Old methods are always falling into desuetude, new methods are coming into practice. New alternatives are being found and at the same time new demands are being made which entail the use of animals. At the end of the road the final balance is what it is. If we think that it is too much, we must attack it at some other point and not simply say, "Let us reduce numbers".<lb/>
There are some points in common between the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, and the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, which I should like to emphasise to your Lord-ships because we must face reality. Human beings are at the apex of the predatory pyramid on this planet. No animal species can withstand us: save on the rare occasions when we have to meet a rogue elephant single-handed, we always come out on top. Nothing stands between any animal, individual or species and blue hell but the conscience of humanity. We must incorporate that conscience into statutes as best we can. There comes a point when we have to trust the Home Secretary to do what we want him to do, and that is where I join my notes on the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, with the remarks that I want to talk about made by the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, concerning the intentions of Government.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0141"/>
<col>265</col>
There is many a slip twixt cup and lip. I appreciate that the Government would like to introduce new legislation, and that they would like to string along with Strasbourg. I am disturbed to find that Strasbourg meets only twice a year for this particular purpose. At its last meeting it only managed to get through the second half of the first draft of this convention. Having read the first half, I conclude that an enormous amount of work needs to be done on it. If we are to wait upon Strasbourg, I am afraid that it may fall in the lifetime, not of this Government but of the next Government, or possibly the one after that. Therefore, regarding myself as a pacemaker, I intend to press ahead with this Bill. Both during the last Government and during this Government's time in office I have been in touch with the Home Office throughout. I have never made any secret of the fact that, if I can pilot this Bill safely through this House, I hope the Government will take it over and, needless to say, make the necessary amendments to it. I hope that they will make it a Government Bill and see it through its hazards.<lb/>
In my next remarks I shall attribute motives to all Governments that have ever been. I do not know whether in logic there is such a thing as a "trilemma" as opposed to a dilemma, but this situation is one in which there are three alternatives which no Government would like. In the other place Governments never want to put the Whips on on an emotionally laden subject; they like to give such a subject a free vote. On the other hand, Governments never want to have responsibility for administering a Bill which may have been mutilated in Committee by enthusiasm in an unwhipped House. Finally, Governments do not want to lose face by having to withdraw their own legislation from Parliament because it has been mutilated. The result is that the system has been biased in favour of inactivity.<lb/>
When I was going through the early period of gestation before producing the Bill this afternoon, it seemed to me that, if I could take upon myself the onus of the initiative, if I had to I could withdraw the Bill&#x2014;I am not a Government; I do not lose face; it is just another Private Member's Bill that does not get proceeded with. I could perhaps get the Bill to the stage where the Government
<col>266</col>
could take it over, knowing that they could back it fairly effectively without the risk of it being mutilated.<lb/>
I hope that, if the Bill goes to a Committee, the Government will give evidence in Committee. I should hate to feel that they might rob us of their wisdom and experience, for these definitions of "pain" and so on are very difficult. We are dealing, as I said in my opening remarks, with situational ethics, where you are pitchforked into a situation not of your making and you have to make the best of it. With those remarks, coupled to my firm intention to press on with this Bill so long as it is in your Lordships' House, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BBC OVERSEAS<lb/>BROADCASTING SERVICE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00756">6.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00757"><member>Lord BUXTON of ALSA</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will ensure that in the national interest there will be no curtailment of the BBC's overseas broadcasting services, despite the need for general economies, because of the long-term importance of maintaining both the British viewpoint and uniquely impartial sources of information to peoples throughout the world. The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is I believe an extremely critical issue that we are about to debate. I am therefore greatly encouraged that so many of your Lordships are following me. I am also reassured by the formidable authority of those who are going to speak. In my view, we are at a crossroads. We have suddenly discovered ourselves at a crossroads affecting our standing in the world, and if we take the wrong turning now we can start an adverse slide that we may be unable to arrest.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0142"/>
<col>267</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00758">The majority of countries in the world do not have a free Press or independent broadcasting. The majority do not have either. Authoritarian regimes thrive on the principle that they can achieve their objectives and, they believe, perhaps miracles, provided people are kept in the dark and do not know about their failures and shortcomings. They in fact welcome and approve ignorance. Are we in Britain now going to give encouragement to this conception?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00759">I have no vested interest, but I should perhaps mention that I am a director of an ITV company, Anglia, in the East of England. But if I do have an interest it is one which I believe is shared by millions of people at home and by countless millions around the globe; that is to sustain and, if possible, expand the reception of the British viewpoint in the world and of our uniquely impartial news services and information. I hope that the sequence of events which has led to this impasse or threat will be chronicled by the Government when they reply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00760">As I understand it, the Foreign Office, required earlier this year to make cuts like every other department, required part of their cuts to be made by the BBC External Services. Rather than find the additional sum internally, or somewhere else, it was considered that our most valuable export, the best export we have left, could be mauled and amputated. This has caused very great concern in many countries, and not only in the countries where the BBC is listened to, but especially in the United States where there has been a great deal of agitation and coverage in their Press.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00761">I feel that the Foreign Secretary and the Government must be blameless up to now because of the timing. Frankly, it looks to me like a standard and probably quite excusable departmental banana skin. But sadly this misjudgment has some of the characteristics of much of our foreign posture over the last two decades: an apparent disposition to opt out, disengage, and to off-load responsibilities. Seen by the ordinary citizen there appears to be a yearning to have as few obligations in the world as possible. So now it has been proposed that even the British voice, the only voice for millions of freedom and truth, should be sacrificed along with what
<col>268</col>
remains of our prestige and influence&#x2014;just to save the cost of about one military aircraft.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00762">Could it also be that the power of broadcasting, the power of the BBC over-seas broadcasts, are a worry to somebody? Are they a worry to the Government? I do not know. But if so we should be en-lightened, and that would form an important and interesting subject for debate. I understand that the cuts to be imposed will have a much greater impact than is generally understood. In fact, according to the <i>Economist</i> it may reduce us as overseas broadcasters to the level of North Korea or Albania. Now just consider that when Britain, through the BBC, has been the pioneer and the premier voice on radio around the world for over half a century. I feel that one can hardly hold this Government responsible for the history of declining influence, but they are now responsible at the eleventh hour for saving this nation from an ignominious withdrawal from the radio shortwaves&#x2014;thus making way for less truthful Governments where freedom may not exist, to fill the vacuum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00763">Perhaps it is not properly understood that we cannot expect to reopen on these frequencies if, in the future, we change our minds. Let us be quite clear about this: once out we shall almost certainly be out for ever. There are three reasons why once out we may not get in again. They are, first, that the expert team of foreign journalists which has been thoughtfully built up and welded over the years by the BBC External Services will have been disbanded and will not be available. You cannot just pick things up like that over-night. Secondly, the listeners will not be there because they will have been switched off and lost to other countries and other services. But, primarily&#x2014;and thirdly&#x2014;the frequencies will not be there because they will have been surrendered and will not be recoverable. You do not own the frequency. You are entitled to use it by international agreement. But if you opt out and fail to exercise the right you have registered, other nations will fill it. It is standard practice to fill any holes which exist.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00764">May I quote the recent words of an Asian Ambassador which were reported last month in the <i>New York Times.</i>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0143"/>
<col>269</col>
He said:
<quote>"To the degree that British foreign policy has any influence outside Rhodesia, it's only because of the impact of the BBC. Mrs. Thatcher doesn't seem to know it, but shortwave is this country's most important export."</quote>
That was an Asian Ambassador. I am quite sure that the Prime Minister does know it and, when the full implications of this critical prospect are made known to her, that she will not hesitate to respond.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00765">Apart from the possibility that perhaps the Foreign Office might be apprehensive about the power of the BBC broadcasts in parts of the world&#x2014;I have no idea whether that is so&#x2014;it is not relevant to this debate if some BBC external broadcasts occasionally sound as if they come from the East and not from the West. The same could be said of course on odd occasions about BBC internal services, and of television, including ITV. But that is not relevant to the subject of cutting the volume of overseas broadcasts, because the question of bias and impartiality should be dealt with quite separately.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00766">Those matters have to be dealt with by the authorities concerned who have the statutory power to act, and maybe they are sometimes guilty of pussy-footing and possibly well-meaning tolerance, which usually finishes up by being interpreted as plain funk. We all have these problems in the media. But this question of bias is a red herring when it comes to the critical subject of curtailing our national broadcasts to the rest of the world. It cannot conceivably be dealt with by cutting the budget. That is like amputating your foot because you have stubbed your toe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00767">The second aspect which should be ignored in the context of this debate is the question of the BBC's finances, and whether its home services are efficiently and economically run or not. This is not relevant to the subject of the external services. The licence fee and the domestic revenue are for the home services, radio and television. These funds should not be appropriated for overseas radio. I suggest that the public, when paying for a licence to receive television programmes at home, would have something impolite to say if part of this payment was to be used for External Services. Whether for better&#x2014;or one hopes not for worse&#x2014;the External Services are the responsibility of the
<col>270</col>
Foreign Office. Therefore, there is no place in the context of my Question for points about the general economy of the BBC. Only details about the economy of the External Services would be relevant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00768">May I start by expressing my own clear feeling or conviction. I believe that no Government, neither this nor any other Government, have the moral right to cut off millions of human beings anywhere in the world from the voice of Britain, from the sound of truth, from the message of freedom. The Government may have the statutory power, but they do not have the moral right any more than they have the right to snip the lifeline of a North Sea diver; any more than they have the moral right to cut the hawser of a cable car when there are miners underground; any more than they have the right to pull the bung out on a boatload of boat people. The Government do not have the moral right, after only six months in office, to throttle any part of the service on which human beings of so many nations have been relying for so long.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00769">If the Government do exercise their statutory power in this way and plunge millions of the West's friends and potential allies into silence and loneliness, that will be shameful for this country and it will be a grievous blow to our prestige and self-esteem in the eyes of the world just at the moment when the Prime Minister is doing so much, so successfully, to revive both.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00770">It has been reported that rather than cut broadcasts to the Middle East, Africa and perhaps South America, we should discontinue the vernacular broadcasts to Europe and to developed countries. Apparently somebody considers it reason-able&#x2014;if the voice of freedom has reluctantly to be discontinued for the benefit of listeners in Asia, Africa and so on&#x2014;and a useful solution to cease broadcasts to most of Europe as a sort of compromise, to cease conveying the British viewpoint to the landmass from Turkey right round to France. Evidently somebody is not aware that the battle for men's minds, the struggle between the Soviets and the freedom of the West, is primarily being fought out in Europe and among the developed nations. How can the oldest, longest-surviving champion of freedom and democracy&#x2014; how can Britain, to whom all the world looks for hope and example, how can the country to which refugees
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0144"/>
<col>271</col>
from the workers' paradise consistently flee, how can Britain of all countries seriously contemplate stopping communications in their own language with individual human beings in Europe, East and West?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00771">Everybody hopes there will never be strife again in Europe involving this country, but only a dreamer would consider it impossible. In war as in peace communications with individuals abroad is absolutely vital. Suppose there was another war and the survival of this country and the West was at stake. Would anyone want to be the Foreign Secretary of the day and have to admit that the country, when hostility started, had no way to talk to the people of Europe and the developed countries, that there was no way to convey the voice of democracy and hope to individuals in their homes? Are this Government to go down in history as the one who surrendered our broadcasting facilities to Russia or Albania or any other political puppet? Is this in years to come to be the Government's skeleton in the cupboard?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00772">Take the other situation. Suppose that mercifully there is no war and that things conceivably start to move in favour of freedom and democracy and that the light of the West starts to burn more brightly. Communications with all parts of the world then become imperative to give leadership and inspiration, especially in Europe, but again the Foreign Secretary would then have to say to the country, "I am sorry, but the Conservative Government stopped all that in 1980 because that was the only way they could find a few million quid".</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00773">Can we seriously contemplate such a prospect? This Government are thank-fully seeking to strengthen our security, and none too soon, both at home and abroad, with the support and approval of the vast majority of the British people. They are endeavouring to redress the dangerously weak state of our defences and restore our position in NATO. A vital component of our contribution to NATO, in addition to our Forces and equipment, is our long-established foreign broadcasting services, more experienced and more independent than any other in the world. The radio services in numerous foreign languages to which people in all
<col>272</col>
the countries in Europe cling must be an integral part of our strategy; they were and are a key component of the West's position over the years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00774">In cutting news, information and the British viewpoint to foreign countries, the Foreign Office would blatantly be marching in the opposite direction to the Prime Minister who has recently expressed Britain's determination to strengthen our position in Europe. You cannot improve defence and the scale of our contribution while at the same time cutting the vital component, information. That is irrational, to put it politely. Again, I do not believe this or any Government have a moral right to sever these vital human links and relationships in Europe for the sake of financial savings. If they exercise their statutory power in this respect, that is one thing, but it would earn scorn for our country across the world, and to do that we do not have the moral right without even the consent and approval of NATO.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00775">Even the Central Policy Review Staff in the Berrill Report, which recommended savage cuts in overseas broadcasting along with a diminishing of our presence in the world, conceded that external broad-casting
<quote>"is the most effective instrument the U.K. has for keeping alive knowledge of the values and ideas of a free society. It can justifiably be claimed to be one of the U.K.'s success stories".</quote>
The cuts in external broadcasting recommended in the Berrill Report were then considered with great thoroughness and care by the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons in its report last year, and they were rejected. The conclusion of the Expenditure Committee was:
<quote>"We believe that the BBC External Services form a vital part of Britain's overseas representation. The BBC has a unique reputation for objectivity and reliability, built up in a time of war as well as peace, and based in no small measure on the fact that it operates a genuine World Service free from an incubus of political motivation. It would therefore be madness, in our view, to impose swingeing cuts on the present service precisely at a time when, as the CPRS acknowledge, other countries are stepping up their efforts&#x2026;We therefore strongly urge the Government to find the extra finance for much needed improvements to audibility in key parts of the world. The money at present devoted to the external services represents, in our judgement, one of the most cost-effective items of expenditure within the Government's programme and one which would richly repay a further modest investment".</quote>
That was last year. Impulsively to curtail the BBC's foreign broadcasting therefore
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0145"/>
<col>273</col>
would be acting in defiance of the considered view of the all-party group of Members of Parliament who expressed that view only 12 months ago. There would be no ally or support for the cuts that are proposed, except from the authors of the Berrill Report, which Conservative spokesmen then in opposition roundly and fiercely condemned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00776">If the Foreign Office has got itself into a corner where it has no room for manoeuvre and can apparently contrive no other way of saving the prescribed sum, then with the greatest respect the Government must intervene in some way or another because people in different parts of the world must not lose these precious sources of information. We are talking about human beings&#x2014;actual live listeners&#x2014;not colours on the map.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00777">It is a meaningless exercise in seeking to justify some cuts to ask, "Where will discontinuing the British voice matter least?" Does that mean which country or area has the least number of people, or where are the BBC broadcasts are least popular, or which is the country most friendly, or most unfriendly, or what? Such criteria are frankly unreal, whichever one adopts, because what is at stake is human beings, individual listeners. Surely an individual in some wilderness is just as entitled to hear British sources of information as somebody in the heart of a European city, and vice-versa.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00778">A hurried last minute search for groups of the human race who can be denied the British voice, the voice of freedom, is fruitless, cynical and, frankly, shameful. The Administration of this country and its financial accounting cannot be so inept that a sum of &#x00A3;4 million, or &#x00A3;1 million or &#x00A3;2 million or &#x00A3;3 million cannot be saved somewhere. I can think of several ways myself, but I do not want to raise new or contentious issues today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00779">Finally, I urge the Government that such external matters, those affecting Britain's place in the world, should be regarded separately from the management of the domestic economy. One is simply not comparing like with like. The fear that by maintaining the cost of the BBC's External Services there might follow a wave of demands in connection with domestic issues from other departments for similar immunity is, in my view, unreason-
<col>274</col>
able and unacceptable. It is a question of Britain's future in the world that we are talking about. We do not want any fudged solutions to this critical problem which is causing so much concern at home and abroad. We do not want financial tinkering to wriggle through the impasse which may seem to have been created.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00780">We need a clear response that the BBC's External Services will not be curtailed and will in fact be strengthened, as recommended by the House of Commons Committee last year. We need this assurance. My solution is simple. The budget for the External Services should, in my view, be marginally increased and not cut at all, as the Expenditure Committee implied. This would place foreign broadcasting in a different and separate category from home problems, thus silencing inter-departmental argument as it occurs. Apart from the recommendation of the Expenditure Committee, there is one further voice in support which I should like to quote. I refer to a statement made by a present Minister of State at the Foreign Office, who said in a Conservative political pamphlet published in 1977:
<quote>"We should strengthen the external services of the BBC".</quote>
I agree with that, my Lords.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00781">6.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00782"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely happy to be the first to be able to associate myself with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, has so eloquently said. We are told&#x2014;and I only hope that this may be denied by the Minister who is to reply&#x2014;that it is the intention of the Government to cut the budget of the BBC's Overseas Service by 10 per cent.; that is to say, by &#x00A3;4 million. Such cuts, if made, would, we understand, for reasons given in the speech by Lord Buxton, result in the services concerned being permanently suppressed. We are also told that it is likely that the Government will in the circumstances recommend the maintenance of our admirable World Service and retain also those directed towards Communist countries in Eastern Europe and perhaps also those to the Arab world, thereby in effect accepting the proposals which were put forward by the "Think Tank" two years ago. That would of course mean leaving &#x00A3;4 million to be recovered on the remaining services;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0146"/>
<col>275</col>
namely, those (in the local languages) to Asia, Africa, Latin America and Western and Southern Europe.<lb/>
If all this is so, it would seem that, given the necessity in any case of maintaining various powerful transmitters which are essential for the audibility of the World Service, together with other overheads, the cuts in various individual services would perforce be very severe; no less, we understand, than 12 to 16 out of 38 services having to be closed down altogether&#x2014;that is, permanently&#x2014;and the total broadcasting time reduced by any-thing from 17 to 25 per cent. In other words&#x2014;and I do not think that this can be, or will be, disputed by the Government&#x2014;the effect of a 10 per cent. financial cut would be not only disproportionate, but also highly disruptive of a service that has been carefully built up over many years.<lb/>
More particularly, it has been calculated&#x2014; and here again the Government will be able to confirm or deny&#x2014;that if the World Service and services to the Arab world are to be maintained in their entirety, a cut of &#x00A3;4 million would result in a suppression of services of the order of magnitude&#x2014;and I say "of the order of magnitude"&#x2014;of all those, in the local languages, to Western and Southern Europe and Latin America, or alter-natively all those (again in the local languages) to the Indian sub-continent, the Far East, and Africa. In other words, about 40 million people, mostly in countries where Communism is making great or considerable headway, would cease to hear the voice of the BBC at all and thus be deprived for the most part of their only reliable sources of information. As I believe the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, said, one can imagine their feelings.<lb/>
My Lords, these same proposals were of course debated by your Lordships two years ago and were indignantly rejected by a very large majority in the House; and they were also rejected in another place. Seeing that their party is now in office, I venture to give one or two quotations from the sentiments then expressed by very prominent Conservative leaders. The first is that of the voice of the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, who has told me that unfortunately due to another engagement she has had
<col>276</col>
to scratch her name from the list of speakers. With her consent I can quote her and report she sticks a hundred per cent. to what she then said. It was, as reported at columns 925 and 926 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 23rd November 1977:
<quote>"our Overseas Service of the BBC is the best broadcasting on radio &#x2026; of any country in the world &#x2026; To suggest that that is something on which we should cut down seems utterly and absolutely wrong".</quote>
Then there was the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, who is not present this evening. He said, as reported at columns 939 and 940:
<quote>"To cut as drastically as is suggested &#x2026; would be to throw away valuable and irreplaceable assets &#x2026; Should we willingly discard these means of direct communication, greatly envied by other countries? Surely the answer must be, No."</quote>
Then there was the noble Lord, Lord Home of the Hirsel. Do I see him here this evening? Yes, I do. With his permission I should like to quote what he said. He said, as reported at column 887:
<quote>"The Overseas Service of the BBC is accepted far and wide as the most objective presentation of world events &#x2026; It is a British asset which should not be put at risk by paring and pinching. Indeed, an increase in its budget would he a good investment".</quote>
That sentiment was repeated in the House of Commons a little later, on 14th December 1977, when Mr. Farr, apparently speaking for the Tory Party, after roundly condemning the CPRS proposals, made much the same point when he said that he would have thought that one of the options that should have been considered was the possibility of an increase in BBC External Services.<lb/>
So it is clear that only two years ago Conservative leaders were unanimous in repudiating any proposal to cut the budget of the BBC's Overseas Service by a penny. They even thought that the budget should be increased rather than pruned or cut. So how comes it that a Tory Government may now be proposing to cut these same services by anything from 17 to 25 per cent.? The only possible answer seems to be that, since it has been decided as a matter of policy to cut Government expenditure by 10 per cent., expenditure in every branch of govern-mental activity must be reduced by exactly the same percentage. Well, if this is really so&#x2014;which I can hardly believe&#x2014;it is logical lunacy. Even admitting that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0147"/>
<col>277</col>
expenditure must be reduced overall, it does not follow that all Departments and all branches of Departments must be cut by precisely the same extent. Of course not! All cuts are unpleasant, but obviously some are less unpleasant than others, and some in the simple interests of national survival should not be made at all.<lb/>
Of course, all Ministers confronted with the necessity of cuts will say, "Not me". But it should then be for the Prime Minister to say which of them, if any, should be exempted. As I understand it, she has already exempted the Service Departments, and if she is to stick to her undertaking to increase defence expenditure to the extent of 3 per cent. per annum, that is an exemption which of course must be made. But having done that, then she should presumably have considered whether for political or social reasons, or whatever, other Departments might be asked to cut rather more than the general average and others perhaps rather less. These priorities having been determined, it surely should then have been left to the Departments themselves to decide which among their own sub-departments should have, as it were, priority. For instance, in the case of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office it might well have been considered that the additional &#x00A3;4 million of cuts in its budget, necessary if the Overseas Services were exempted altogether, should be made in other parts of the diplomatic and consular vote in addition to those already announced, I understand, in the Press.<lb/>
Surely, for instance, a cut or a further cut in the <i>frais</i> (as they call it) of members of the foreign service everywhere would be preferable to the closing down of the voice of Britain in many of the countries concerned. For example, it might be unpleasant for a First Secretary in Jakarta to have to reduce the number of his guests by 15 per cent. rather than 10 per cent., but most people in this country, I believe, would think that that would be a lesser blow to British interests than the suppression of the BBC broadcasts to Indonesia. Additionally, or alternatively, what about closing down yet more diplomatic establishments (more especially those which have only a minor role in pushing British exports) and perhaps asking one of our European Community
<col>278</col>
colleagues with a major stake in the area concerned to look after our interests? That suggestion has been made before but has not been followed up.<lb/>
My Lords, it may be said that such suggestions do not come well from an ex-member of the service, and, naturally, I should not welcome further cuts in the <i>frais</i> as such; of course not. But, really, if&#x2014;and I only say "if"&#x2014;it is a straight choice between that and crippling the BBC, I believe that many members of the present Foreign Service would shoulder the burden cheerfully. I may be wrong in this, but I believe that, in addition to the suppression of certain posts, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office may be asked to make economies of scale that might result in some of its staff becoming redundant. But I submit that that is something which was bound to happen in any case. There are probably many too many people in all Government Departments engaged in writing letters to each other in strict accordance with Parkinson's Law; and, though painful, I do not see how, given our present parlous economic position, this kind of cut can be criticised or resisted. It would certainly not be self-defeating, as would be an attempt to curtail the Overseas Services of the BBC.<lb/>
Or, my Lords, take aid. Are we really satisfied that the relatively tiny sum of &#x00A3;4 million might not with advantage be deducted from the total aid budget (I do not know whether that comes under the Foreign Office or not), some of which, at least, is suspected of getting into the wrong hands or of being otherwise misdirected? For instance, is it true that this year we are contributing &#x00A3;11 million of aid to Nigeria, by all accounts now a rich oil country, which, in any case, has just been nationalising BP without, as I understand it, very much compensation? How would our interests be served by paying out such sums at the virtual expense of one of our greatest assets? My Lords, it does not make any sense to me, and I do not think it will make any sense to your Lordships.<lb/>
Finally, there is yet another good reason for not cutting any of the overseas programmes of the BBC. They are the only means we have of disseminating news about what we are now doing in Brussels and in Strasbourg to carry out our obligations under the Lom&#x00E9; Convention
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0148"/>
<col>279</col>
and in accordance with the various association agreements of the European Economic Community&#x2014;to the great benefit, of course, of a large number of developing nations. It would clearly not be right for such news to be conveyed, if it is conveyed at all, to these peoples by French or by other non-British media. I would ask the Government to consider this argument very carefully.<lb/>
Anyhow, my Lords, for all these reasons, we can only hope that, when and if a proposal to cut the Overseas Services of the BBC comes before the other place, a sufficient number of Members will be found who will vote in accordance with their beliefs, and not just troop into the Lobbies to silence, or at least partially to throttle, the chief voice of freedom in a dangerous and increasingly totalitarian world. Even if they do not, and even if the Government (as is quite likely, I think) evade the issue in some way which is open to them, it is surely possible that the crippling of the Overseas Services will not find, to say the least, very much support here in your Lordships' House. We are, after all, my Lords, no longer under imminent sentence of death if we occasionally vote in accordance with our convictions, and the Government really should not think that they can get away with anything here, however demonstrably counter-productive.<lb/>
Even if for technical reasons we could not actually prevent the cuts being made by the Government&#x2014;that is, if the Government finally insisted on them&#x2014;we could at least organise a pretty formidable protest which might even, I suggest, influence votes in a good many of the constituencies of this country, and that is something of which the Government might well take note. It will be seen that I look forward with interest, if with little immediate hope, to what the Minister responsible is going to say this evening in answer to Lord Buxton's Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00783">6.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00784"><member>The Lord Bishop of GUILDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am assuming that tonight the pressing of this Question is not set in the context of economies made in general throughout our country. I would feel I needed to reserve my position in that. I assume that what we are talking
<col>280</col>
about is the much more narrow question of pressing upon the Foreign Office that they should reconsider the relative work of the BBC Overseas Service in comparison with the total cost of presenting British interests overseas. I am not going to speak about the details of the problems which have been presented to the BBC by the cuts proposed, although the papers which I have read and the people I have consulted have left me in no doubt that the cuts proposed would seriously cripple the Overseas Service. Nor am I speaking about religious programmes in particular, though perhaps I could say that I regard them very highly and, in particular, the efforts made recently to take notice of religions and world views besides our own.<lb/>
What I want to do is to draw attention to two general points which I hope the Government will take into consideration when seeking to answer the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Buxton. The first is that I hope the Government will recognise the effectiveness of broadcasting in reaching a much wider range of people than the Diplomatic Service can, however energetic or hardworking the staff of embassies and cultural centres may be. I spent a good deal of my working life in Africa and the Middle East, much of it in a very isolated part, and I recall only one visit by a member of the ambassador's staff in the country concerned during the seven years that I was working in that part of the country. But the radio was a constant accompaniment of everyday life. In fact, for one period I began every morning at six o'clock by doing the five-minute physical exercises in tune with what was being broadcast by the World Service. More seriously, in the crises which affected our lives we turned to the BBC Overseas Service to gain a real understanding of the position and to draw some sense of security by recognising that what was going on around us was known to people elsewhere in the world and had been assessed by them.<lb/>
A trivial incident which took place soon after I moved to Guildford made this point very clear to me. We had in the diocese a priest who was then head of religious broadcasting in the Overseas Service. I wanted to meet him, but I was unable to do so until I had been in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0149"/>
<col>281</col>
Guildford for perhaps a year. Then, at the cathedral one night, by chance, I made his acquaintance. I made my apology to him, that I had not met him before, and explained that I had 160 parishes to look after and it was difficult for me to get to know all the clergy in the diocese very quickly. He replied to me, "Bishop, I do understand. I number my parish in millions". I was very envious of him. I realised that, through his work on the Overseas Service, he had the privilege of intimate conversation, through the radio, through the loudspeaker, with millions of people in the homes in which they lived, and that those people were people with whom our embassies and other institutions abroad would probably make little contact.<lb/>
In these days, when radios are available in such quantity and so cheaply, the broadcasts of the Overseas Service are listened to in villages and small towns, in the fields and in people's cars, by all manner of ordinary people who would have no other way of contact with the British point of view or with British interests.<lb/>
I believe that it is of the utmost importance that we speak to these people in the way in which the Overseas Service has done. This is why the specialised language broadcasts which are threatened by the proposed cuts are of particular importance. Of course, we want to represent British interests to the top people in countries where our embassies, trade missions and British Council institutions are; but the circle of people that they can touch is very limited and the radio is a most effective and yet at the same time very cheap way of presenting British people to the ordinary people in the countries across the world. I hope that the Government will bear this aspect in mind in assessing the relative worth of our Overseas Service in comparison with the whole cost of representing our interests abroad.<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, the second point is a much more general point. I believe that the major question facing us today, as noble Lords are well aware, is that of achieving a harmonious world community in which every different nation, every different race, has a part to play and a share in the prosperity of the whole. It is the communications explosion which
<col>282</col>
has played a very large part in making our world one neighbourhood. I believe that it is of tremendous importance in that one neighbourhood of the world that the particular contribution made by the BBC Overseas Service should be maintained at as high a strength as possible. Its responsible news broadcasts, its dissemination of worthwhile information and, above all, its presentation of democracy at work day in and day out in all the ups and downs of political life is a most valuable, and, as it were, clear presentation of a way of life that we ought to offer to people not only behind the Iron Curtain but in the turbulent Africa of our day which is going to have such great importance in decades yet to come. So, my Lords, I would simply ask the Government whether they have considered how worth-while an investment it is to make the broadcasts that the Overseas Service gives in the world community of our time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00785">7.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00786"><member>Lord WEIDENFELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the received wisdom of political life that doctrinaires in Opposition frequently turn pragmatists in office seems to have been strikingly enriched by a new twist; for here, under our eyes, we see a party which, taking pride in its empirical and commonsense approach while on the road to power, once there begets a government tempted by doctrine&#x2014;the doctrine of indiscriminate curtailment of public expenditure. How else can we explain the wisdom of cutting, and, as, I think, crippling, the External Services of the BBC? For this is bound to be the effect of the intended Budget cuts which, for a saving of 10 per cent., would reduce broadcasting time by between 20 and 25 per cent. and endanger the whole overhead structure, quality, in some cases audibility and continued availability of wavelengths and ultimately the efficacy of what will remain.<lb/>
Moreover, these cuts fly in the face of the Government's avowed, and I think seriously meant, pledges and claims, to aid the economic recovery and export potential of this country and to stiffen and strengthen its defence posture within the Western Alliance. There is no doubt that the BBC's External Services are an important and powerful sales aid to British industry. Approximately 60 hours each week of BBC transmissions going<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0150"/>
<col>283</col>
abroad are concerned with promoting exports directly or indirectly. This is just under 10 per cent. of all external broadcasting in a total of 39 languages. Twenty-five of these 60 hours consist of direct promotion of British products and over 30 hours deal with invisibles; that is, research, the facilities of the City of London, consultancies, and tourism.<lb/>
In projecting the British and Western way of life to the disenfranchised listeners of the Communist world or to citizens of repressive r&#x00E9;gimes elsewhere, the BBC has always been a powerful arm of democratic defence. Its role for instance, in the Portuguese revolution was of outstanding importance. Its reports on the tumoil in Africa, Lebanon and Central America have been landmarks of responsible and courageous news gathering and commentary.<lb/>
It is, or course, true that the Government directive through the Foreign Office to the BBC asked for the retention of the World English Service and of the programmes to the Arab and Communist worlds; but their retention within a drastically cut budget will cause such havoc in the structure of the service as a whole that the end result may well be grossly damaging to the whole service. In fact, the three optional "packages" which the Corporation has put forward by way of illustrating how the residual services would work, are all Pandora boxes, each creating invidious problems of their own.<lb/>
Take Package One, for instance, which would involve the closing down of all vernacular services to Western and Southern Europe and Latin America: German to the DDR as well as to the Federal Republic, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Greek, Turkish and Finnish. Thus, our friends and neighbours in Europe would be entirely cut out. This is absurd as well as dangerous. In normal times, political, economic, and cultural programmes serve clearly-defined and useful purposes by ensuring continuity of contact. In times of crisis, the voice of Britain is even more relevant.<lb/>
Package Number Two would, with one magisterial sweep, eliminate our broadcasting to the Indian subcontinent, Iran, Burma, the whole of Southeast Asia and the Far East as well as Black Africa. The third
<col>284</col>
package would involve the whole of Western and Southern Europe plus the Arabic Service. And none of these, faulty as they may be, would achieve the total saving required; so that more, fresh, savings would have to be found elsewhere.<lb/>
One of the paradoxes is that if we were to remove all broadcasting to Europe west of the Communist world we would only pinpoint the political warfare character of the remaining services to Eastern Europe. Both the man in the street and the authorities in those countries would feel themselves targetted, singled out for special attention, while today they can hear for themselves that BBC news and comment is universal and neither angled nor targetted in a narrow, propagandist way.<lb/>
In fact, these cuts are the sort of recommendations proposed by the ill-fated Berrill Report which was so overwhelmingly rejected by opinion formers and the public alike some 12 or 18 months ago, and it is not without irony that the party that helped to bury Berrill now wishes to exhume him.<lb/>
My Lords, previous speakers in this debate, and, I feel quite sure, those who follow me, are nearly unanimous on the great achievements, past and present of the External Services, It is no secret that representations on the highest level have been made in the United States and Western Europe to Her Majesty's Government to desist from these short-sighted cuts. Many noble Lords may have seen editorials in the <i>Herald Tribune</i> emanating both from the <i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times, </i> explicitly appealing to the British Government to keep the BBC's external programmes intact. I think that a Conservative Government should be especially mindful of tradition and continuity in recalling the record of the BBC's External Services. There is no need to dwell nostalgically on the past only; no need to go back either to the Bronze Age of British Broadcasting under John Reith and Stephen Tallents or to the Heroic Age of William Haley and Noel Newsome. The immediate past and the present are just as creditable.<lb/>
I would urge the Government to desist from carrying out these cuts and to let the Corporation carry on. It is for the Government to explore where the money can be found. Perhaps it can be found in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0151"/>
<col>285</col>
Whitehall, and the departments concerned with overseas trade and tourism could surely dig into their pouches. Defence expenditure, which the Prime Minister has pledged to maintain and expand, should include contributions to the spreading of the democratic message in the Communist sphere. Already the Defence Department pays, if I understand rightly, one-fifth of the expenditure of the BBC's monitoring service, an invaluable source of reliable reference which should on no account be diminished in scale. To the argument that money is wanted everywhere else at the same time in Whitehall I submit that sometimes, given a sense of perspective and priority, it is quite justifiable to rob Peter in order to pay Paul.<lb/>
My Lords, in sum, external broadcasting is an essential public and national service, and only as a last and desperate result should it be considered, if all else fails, to explore how the private sector, industry and trade might possibly share part of the burden. There are plenty of examples: Some of our cultural institutions, for instance, are kept afloat by a judicious mixture of grants from the Exchequer and private contributions. Our great industrialists and traders have every reason to help keep the BBC's External Services healthily alive. The <i>Economist</i> has recently even dared to say a cautious word in favour of institutional advertising (although this may perhaps be anathema to the hierarchs of Portland Place).<lb/>
But I believe that, all in all, the best, indeed the only just solution, would be for the Government to pause, reflect and withdraw their request for cuts, and to allow the BBC to continue to project an image of Britain and her people, their quality of life, their achievements and grave challenges, in a manner which is essentially truthful and, on balance, truly admirable.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00788"><member>Lord CHALFONT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am reluctant to believe that it is a reflection of our priorities that a House that was so full and attentive during a debate on laboratory animals should become so relatively empty for the Unstarred Question of the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa. I personally am extremely grateful to him for raising this Question this even
<col>286</col>
ing and doing so in such an impressive and moving way.<lb/>
I understand from certain news reports this morning that we may be pushing at an open door. I have been unable to confirm these reports. In the absence of any reliable newspaper of record&#x2014;a situation which I hope will be remedied on 13th November&#x2014;I can only conclude that possibly we still have a problem with which to confront Her Majesty's Government. The basic arguments in this case have already been eloquently deployed: the political arguments by the noble Lords, Lord Buxton of Alsa and Lord Gladwyn; the more technical ones from the depth of his experience by the noble Lord, Lord Weidenfeld; and the moral arguments by the right reverend Prelate. We have heard&#x2014;and heard it put cogently&#x2014;about the need for a British viewpoint to be expressed around the world in a way in which the BBC Overseas Service so eloquently does it at the moment. We have heard about the need for the continuation of impartial sources of news and information. We have heard also about the irreversible nature of these cuts. If they are made in the way in which it is at present proposed, they cannot be reversed. There are many powerful reasons why this is an irreversible trend.<lb/>
Having accepted all those arguments and expressed my total endorsement of them, I want to bring up one rather special point in this debate. It goes back to something that the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, said about the information battle that goes on in the world. It seems to me ironic and tragic that, at a time when we in this country are proposing to cut the volume and quality of our overseas information service, Radio Moscow should be developing one of the best and most effective world broadcasting services on the air at the moment in English and in the vernacular language.<lb/>
In my own experience&#x2014;and I travel a good deal around the world and carry with me a specially equipped radio set&#x2014;it is already easier in most places in the world to listen to Radio Moscow doing its World Service broadcasting in English on what they call a five by five transmission service&#x2014;in other words, a perfectly clear atmospherics-free transmission service&#x2014;than it is to receive the BBC.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0152"/>
<col>287</col>
Radio Moscow's World Service is now broadcasting a virtually 24-hour service around the world in English. Some 19 hours a day come from Radio Moscow World Service&#x2014;RMWS. Part of that is provided by a station called Radio Peace and Progress which, coincidentally, uses the Radio Moscow transmitters.<lb/>
That leaves a gap of five hours in the day from 11 o'clock at night until 4 o'clock in the morning. That gap is now being filled by Radio Moscow broadcasts, also in English, to the North African subcontinent. As I say, this means that Radio Moscow is now broadcasting 24 hours a day in English&#x2014;I am speaking only about their English service broadcasts at the moment. On the 27th July, in a broadcast on the Radio Moscow World Service, the presenter of the programme conceded that the whole of this new Radio Moscow World Service was patterned upon the BBC World Service. He said they now had a happy balance&#x2014;those were his words&#x2014;between news, comment and features. He went on to say in that light, ironic way that Russian announcers have: "Perhaps listeners might find some outward resemblance to the BBC World Service". It is not an outward resemblance, it is practically a carbon copy of the BBC World Service. There is a news bulletin every hour; not on the hour because that is when the BBC puts out its service, but at ten minutes past every hour, after the BBC has put out its news service. This is followed by features: "Twenty-four Hours", "The World Today". The names are even the same as those of the BBC World Service. Then there is half an hour of music designed to keep the listeners' attention until the next cycle begins. It is exactly upon the pattern of the extremely successful service that the BBC has been putting out for so many years.<lb/>
There is now a listeners' letters programme that goes from Radio Moscow in English beamed directly on Great Britain and Ireland. It has a staff&#x2014;this is information from Radio Moscow, not from me&#x2014;of several thousand people and it receives 300,000 letters a year from the area to which it is beamed. The conclusion to all this is that we are now being confronted by the Soviet Union for the first time in a systematic and organised way in the information field. It seems to
<col>288</col>
me that it will be disastrous at this stage to impose any cuts at all upon what is without any doubt the best broadcasting service in the world. I am not speaking now of our domestic services, about which I have certain modest reservations. I am speaking of the World Service of the BBC, which I say without fear of any contradiction is quite simply the best broadcasting service in the world.<lb/>
These cuts are not marginal. One cannot say: "We will make a 10 per cent. cut" and imagine that is going to be 10 per cent. of every programme, 10 per cent. of every hour or 10 per cent. of every service. It is a radical cut and an irreversible cut, as the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, has said. It is being proposed at a time when the Soviet Union&#x2014;at least a potential enemy; I do not think that anyone would argue with that characterisation&#x2014;is beginning to realise the vital importance of influencing world opinion through its broadcasting. Field Marshal Templer, who was my commander-in-chief in Malaya when I was a soldier, coined a phrase&#x2014;
<quote>"Winning the hearts and minds of the people".</quote>
That, he said, was the only way in which we would win the battle against the Communists in Malaya. It was the way that we won it. I believe we are now in danger of losing the battle for the hearts and minds of the people of the Third World, and of the people of the world as a whole.<lb/>
I recognise, as I think everyone in your Lordships' House will recognise, the need for cuts in public expenditure. Perhaps not everyone would agree with that basic premise, but if we were proceeding from it I believe, as the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, said in his moving speech, that it is important not to make cuts across the board and not to extend those cuts, for example, into areas which might affect our national security and survival. I shall not talk this evening about the defence budget because it is not immediately relevant to this debate, but I would say, and say with the utmost seriousness, that part of our defence and our apparatus of survival and part of the way of pushing back the forces of darkness in the world is the spreading of information, impartial information, objective comment and a clear, unequivocal endorsement of our way of life.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0153"/>
<col>289</col>
Are we really, seriously, for the sake of an "across the board" cut in public spending, going to destroy that? If we are, then as Ernie Bevin once said in his inimitable way:
<quote>"Once you open that Pandora's box, you never know what Trojan horse is going to come out".</quote>
The BBC World Service, my Lords, is the only service in the world capable of discharging this task. "The Voice of America", technically brilliant, cannot do it. They are identified with a certain kind of political prejudice in the minds of people who listen; and that identification does not occur in the case of the BBC.<lb/>
I want to conclude by coming back to my point about Radio Moscow. The Radio Moscow World Service&#x2014;and note that even the name is a copy of our own&#x2014;is now becoming required listening all over the world. I spoke earlier about its efforts in the English language. Perhaps we ought also to remember that it broadcasts in over 80 languages and dialects for a total of more than 2,000 hours every week. Of those, about 270 hours are, as I have said, in English. This comprises&#x2014;and I repeat it because I think it needs repeating&#x2014;a round-the-clock service in the English language, beamed to this country and to all the other countries in the world where there are English-speaking people. I think we are in danger of being confronted now not only with a predominant and overwhelming military apparatus by the Soviet Union but with a superior information and communication apparatus as well. I believe very seriously that we should not at this stage be cutting what the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, has rightly called "our finest export".<lb/>
I trust I shall not introduce too abrasive a final note into what has been up to now a reasonably constructive and well-mannered debate, but I trust that Her Majesty's Government will not take this matter lightly. This is a matter at least as important, in my opinion, as those matters with which the noble Lord the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is dealing perhaps elsewhere at this moment. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, has said that this is a matter which might even go outside Parliament. It might even be a question of appealing to the common sense and to the deeply-held opinions of the people of this country about the role of this nation in the world.<lb/>
<col>290</col>
I should like to come back to the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Buxton. He asks Her Majesty's Government
<quote>"Whether they will ensure that &#x2026;there will be no curtailment of the BBC's overseas broadcasting services&#x2026;".</quote>
That is a fairly unequivocal question, and I hope that the noble Lord, when he answers it on behalf of the Government, will be able to say that there will no such curtailment. I would conclude my remarks simply by saying that, if he does not, I hope that Her Majesty's Government will not believe they have heard the end of this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00789">7.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00790"><member>Lord HILL of LUTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, already in this debate, opened so strongly and so vigorously by the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, there has been a severe condemnation of the proposal to make cuts of the order of which we have read. We have no firm indication of what has been planned, but I should be surprised if there had not been a spreading of some "guidance" or some information which gave quite accurately the indications that we have read in the Press. We cannot help remembering that almost exactly two years ago we were discussing the proposals of the Think Tank, and your Lordships will remember that the underlying principle was that the best form of persuasion was economic success and, if you were not being economically successful, then cut down the persuasive effort.<lb/>
In a debate in this House, that policy was destroyed, as indeed it was elsewhere. It was destroyed, and in that debate a great deal was said on all sides of the House about the immense value of the BBC's overseas services. And now, I am making the assumption that the proposal was to reduce the expenditure on the Overseas Services by 10 per cent., or some &#x00A3;4 million. I hope it will be denied and I hope we shall be told that this is entirely false and there is nothing in it. So I am going to speak on that assumption. Now the proposal is to do in one fell swoop what in fact the Think Tank proposed to do over a number of years. It is a more severe proposal than that which was put forward by the Think Tank. At least they put forward some arguments, even though we destroyed them. As yet we have heard no arguments,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0154"/>
<col>291</col>
apart from the general one of economy in public expenditure, put forward in support.<lb/>
I wonder whether I might just try to quantify what the proposals for the saving of &#x00A3;4 million might mean. As others have done, I assume that we are well informed and that the World Service in England will remain. I assume there will be other services; for example, those to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Thirdly, I assume with some irony that it would be an odd change of policy if our voice were to be silenced in the oil-rich States of Arabia. On those assumptions, what could this amount to? Staff would have to go&#x2014;some hundreds of staff would have to go&#x2014;-and so would the services in which they work. The choice will be Latin America, Iran and, as others have said, the Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia, the Far East and Africa&#x2014;any one or all of them. In these areas the services in their own languages will go, but the World Service in English cannot replace services in the countries to which the broadcasts are directed. After all, if you take the population of India, only 2 per cent. speak English and some of them not very well. Nine out of 10 of the BBC's audience in Northern India listen to the BBC in the vernacular. So let no one pretend that the preservation of the World Service will do much to reduce the impact in many parts of the world. Even where English is the second language, broadcasting in their own language is far more effective.<lb/>
If the service is cut by 10 per cent., then it is likely on my calculation that services in 12 to 16 languages will have to go. Even half of that cut would mean serious damage. The possibilities are no broadcasting in German to East or West Germany, Austria or Switzerland; no French to French-speaking Africa or Metropolitan France; no Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Greek, Turkish, or Finnish; no broadcasts in Portuguese to Brazil or in Spanish to Central or South America. That is the size of it, even though there are choices within that range. Money can be dredged by cutting services to the Commonwealth or the Third World. Losing the only three vernacular languages in which the BBC broadcast, the cuts would extend to
<col>292</col>
broadcasts in Persian, Bengali, Tamil, Malay, Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Hindi, Urdu, Japanese, Burmese and Chinese. This is the scope of the reduction which is likely to follow a cut of 10 per cent. in the BBC's grant, or &#x00A3;4 million.<lb/>
That is what we are talking about, two years after the debate in which we condemned cuts that were to be imposed more slowly and for another reason. It really is astonishing how frequently this comes up. Surely the Government realise the immense value to the country's reputation of these unbiased and objective broadcasts. It is their very existence, as well as their informative and educative effort and the reputation for objectivity, which is part of this country's good name overseas; and it is their professionalism, reliability and comprehensiveness which have ensured this international significance.<lb/>
I would repeat the point made plain by the noble Lord, Lord Buxton. Broadcasting cannot be turned off like a tap. You cannot turn it off and then turn it on again. If you stop a language service, the audience goes to a less desirable, less amiable service, to put it mildly. The staff disperses, the frequencies are usurped, pinched, borrowed and occupied by other countries. You cannot stop one month and restore the service the next. That is absolutely clear and undeniable. If you cut a service, you no longer have a BBC time, place or wavelength on which to build a larger audience when you want it at a time of crisis. It is finished and over and done with.<lb/>
I shall say no more, because so many valuable contributions are being made covering the same ground, but I must just say this. Broadcasting is an aspect of a nation's own view of itself. That is what external broadcasting is. Surely the Briton of today, however difficult the time, has not so small a conceit of himself that he prefers silence, abdication and the triumph of untruth&#x2014;for that is what has been demonstrated by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont. I would urge the Government to think again.<lb/>
I saw a good deal of this service until seven years ago. I have no reason to advocate it, to speak for it, except the recollection of its own magnificence. It really is a tremendously important part of the presentation of Britain overseas. There is a capacity to make democracy

work. There is a serenity&#x2014;it is difficult to find the words&#x2014;and there are qualities in this country which are admired throughout the world, although we do our best by our own troubles and our own self-criticism to destroy the image. It would be a tragedy if this damage were done to our Overseas Services and to our country&#x2014;for that is what is involved&#x2014;in many parts of the world, and to their image of us, for &#x00A3;4 million.<lb/>
I hope that the Government's spokesman tonight will confirm that what we read in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday was a quiet hint of an impending reversal of view, although it could possibly have been one of those comforting little noises which have no more meaning than to gain a day or two. The Government will go up in our estimation if, having looked at this subject and having heard the arguments expressed, they decide that these cuts are not for us to make. We cannot afford to make them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00794"><member>Lord MORRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have often thought that the conduct of a nation's foreign affairs&#x2014;surely, the most subtle of all the governmental arts&#x2014;might be likened to a highly sophisticated, high fidelity sound reproduction system, in that its performance can only match the quality of its weakest component. It is a waste of time and money to match inferior speakers or a cheap pick-up head to a sophisticated amplifier. The Government of the day can be likened to the owner-operator of the system. They choose, finance, maintain and operate the equipment. The Whitehall apparat can be likened to the amplifier which synthesises the input, attenuates the power and controls the output. It is the information services which can be likened to the speakers, whose quality makes the performance arresting or otherwise.<lb/>
<col>294</col>
If the owner-operator starts poking about with the equipment, there will result wow and flutter, distortion, loss of audibility or, indeed, no sound at all. The sound will lose its fidelity. The audience will lose faith in what they hear&#x2014;if they hear anything at all. They will go away and, as other noble Lords have said previously, they will never come back. This is precisely what Her Majesty's Government are threatening to do. We should take no heart from what I am sure the Government spokesman will say, "These proposals are minuscule; they will have very little effect", for, as you have heard from other noble Lords they will have a terrifying effect. The analogy which was used in a letter in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> only today was the "salami effect" of the cheese-paring and the cutting of costs in previous years. This is the final slice that lops off the nub of the salami.<lb/>
I beg to remind your Lordships that notwithstanding previous years, the BBC put into effect cuts of &#x00A3;390,000 in 1974&#x2013;75. At the same time, spread over a period of four years, cuts of &#x00A3;1,760,000 were made. In 1976&#x2013;77, cuts of &#x00A3;288,000 were made. In 1977&#x2013;78, cuts of &#x00A3;541,000 were suffered. And in 1978&#x2013;79 the BBC were asked to absorb cuts of &#x00A3;732,000.<lb/>
Allow me to give your Lordships a concrete example of just one of the effects of these cuts. In the case of the Latin-American service, every single one of the supporting services has been completely eliminated. The publicity, the promotional services, the travel services and the research back-up just do not exist any more. Only direct broadcasting costs remain. The BBC have not got one office in the whole of Latin-America&#x2014;not one. They used to, but it has all gone. How the BBC maintain the standard that they do without these back-up services I cannot understand, yet they are being asked to absorb even more cuts. Meanwhile, the Voice of America has overtaken us in the Latin-American theatre, as have Russia, Germany and the Warsaw Pact countries.<lb/>
I keep asking myself, as many noble Lords must have done, why the Foreign Office have not cried out in pain, "Enough is enough. Leave this most effective instrument of our foreign relations alone". The only answer that I can see lies in the conflict of interest, in that the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0156"/>
<col>295</col>
Foreign Office represents Government speaking to Government, whereas the BBC represents nation speaking to nation, people speaking to people. And, my goodness me! do they not do it better! It appears to me that in full view of the whole world Her Majesty's Government are attempting to throttle themselves and the nation.<lb/>
With your Lordships' leave, may I quote one short leading article as an example. It is from an Argentinian publication called <i>La Prensa </i> which, believe me, has in the past been in no way friendly towards us. On 10th October they wrote:
<quote>"The Argentine republic has been traditionally friendly to the United Kingdom. Aside from certain matters, the long-standing political and economic bonds remain between the River Plate and Britain. They watched the dawn of our independence with favourable understanding. Over the years, among us and also among others of significance, an Anglo-Saxon culture has taken root and extended to literature and public law. Lastly, the economic relations with the hub of the British Empire"&#x2014;</quote>
I like that&#x2014;
<quote>"have been multiple and productive. That and, above all, the community of fundamental political interest should persuade Mrs. Thatcher's government not to sever a magnificent system of radio-communication that is a bond of union between their country and so many on this continent."</quote>
Governments may choose not to heed public opinion, if they must, but I beseech Her Majesty's Government to listen with great care to the great men&#x2014;to one of our most distinguished diplomatists; namely, the noble Lord, Lord Trevelyan, who wrote in 1973:
<quote>"The most effective British activity in the wide realm of information is the Overseas Service of the BBC".</quote>
And similarly to the noble Lord, Lord St. Brides, who, in a memorable maiden speech in November 1977, said:
<quote>"To my mind, a country which can no longer achieve all its ends by the sheer weight of military and economic power needs to put more, not less, effort into the protection of its interests by other means. Britain's position in the international community has certainly changed since 1945. But the means of maintaining and developing influence in the world have changed, too. They have become less palpable. They require more intellectual and imaginative effort, and less brute force. In the new, much more open, situation which has resulted, we can more than hold our own if we wish, and provided that we continue to manifest a will to excellence and the desire to compete, and if possible to lead, which goes with it".&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 23/11/77; col. 885.]</quote>
<col>296</col>
Above all, however, I beseech the Government to listen to the words, quoted so pertinently by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, of my noble friend Lord Home of the Hirsel in that same debate. Big Ben does not toll only at Westminster. It tolls in the hearts and minds of oppressed and muted millions and, indeed, in what is left of the Free World.<lb/>
I beg Her Majesty's Government not to muffle our nation's future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00795">7.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00796"><member>Lord HANKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to support a great deal of what has been said in this debate, notably by my noble friends Lord Weidenfeld, Lord Chalfont and Lord Hill of Luton. I shall not repeat the information which they have given but I can certify that it is absolutely valid.<lb/>
I have much experience of the BBC External Services. For a great many years I travelled as a diplomat, and I have also travelled since my retirement. I, like the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, always carry with me a short wave radio. One can always hear the BBC, literally anywhere in the world, at 8 a.m. local time&#x2014;generally loud and clear. And there are numerous other broadcasts as well. I can certify that the BBC is very widely listened to abroad, both in English and in local languages, often by distinguished people. For instance, when I was Ambassador in Sweden Mr. Tage Erlander, the very distinguished Prime Minister, listened every morning to the BBC, to my certain knowledge. There are huge audiences in the Middle East and in Africa. I agree entirely with what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford said about that.<lb/>
The second point I want to make is that an audience, especially one of interest and respect such as the BBC has, really cannot be turned on and off like a tap. My noble friend Lord Hill of Luton made this point, and I want to drive it home. At least you can turn your audience off, but you cannot turn it on again. Once it has gone it has gone. I had a tragic experience of this. When I was Ambassador in Stockholm there was one of these periodical economy drives. They are very necessary, as I know only too well. The Foreign Office decided to abolish the information section of the embassy, and the result was absolutely disastrous&#x2014;as, I must frankly say, I had
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0157"/>
<col>297</col>
foretold that it would be. We just could not give the journalists and others all the support that they needed. After a year and a half or so, the Foreign Office changed their mind and sent back a really excellent information secretary. However, it took him a year and a half to get going, and we lost virtually three years of work over this to-ing and fro-ing.<lb/>
When the Foreign Office sent back the information secretary they decided to suppress the British Council post. The Swedes were immensely upset about this. They took on the running of the British Institute and, frankly, they ran it every hit as well as we did. They supplied English teachers to the whole of the Swedish educational system. It was admirably done, and I think that they still do it that way. In due course, the British Council sent back a very good man, but we had lost an immense number of contacts; and especially we had lost respect and contacts in the universities, the schools and among the intellectuals. So the lesson from that, as the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, so wisely told us, is that we must not go to-ing and fro-ing; we must not chop and change. This is a cardinal British sin. We must have the strength of mind and the character to do things well and jolly well stick to them.<lb/>
My third point is that any of your Lordships can easily hear for yourselves what the BBC external services are like. You do not need a short wave set. All you have to do on a Saturday morning&#x2014;and I say Saturday because it is easy; you do not have to go pounding off to the office&#x2014;is to turn on the medium wave at round about 450 metres and you will hear a truly admirable news service which is much better than the domesticities of Radio 4, giving a balanced account of everything that is happening in the world, followed by a newspaper review, followed by a review of the weekly periodicals which is of fascinating interest. It is a broadcast of real intellectual perspicacity. The BBC are greatly to be commended on the way they do this and if your Lordships listen on Saturday morning I am sure you will share my view.<lb/>
That brings me to my fourth point. One cannot imagine how valuable and important an objective source of news and balanced common sense and real intellectual perspicacity is overseas in the world we live in. All too often as we travel
<col>298</col>
across the world the local presentation of the news is distorted by ideology or propaganda or plain prejudice. I can give a striking personal example. In May 1968 I went to the Soviet Union with a parliamentary delegation, and incidentally with my short wave radio. Every morning at 8.15 I went down to breakfast and gave the other parliamentarians, British and Soviet, the news of the day as presented by the BBC. It happened to be a rather dramatic period. It was the time when there was a student revolt in France, the barricades were up in the Quartier Latin in Paris; there was a general strike with seven million men on strike in France. General de Gaulle had to cut short an official visit to Rumania and come back to control the situation. There were rumours of Soviet troop movements in the south of Poland, near the Czechoslovak frontier, described by an official Polish communiqu&#x00E9; from Warsaw as"preparations for summer manoeuvres". The Soviet Prime Minister had talks in Prague, described in an official communiqu&#x00E9; issued by Mr. Dubcek's Government. There was a naval incident in the Arctic with an American aircraft carrier and a Soviet pilot who was buzzing it, who missed his foothold&#x2014;if that is the right term&#x2014;fell into the sea and was pulled out by the Americans. Not a word of any of this appeared in the Soviet press.<lb/>
I think it was either in central Siberia or the Caucasus that our extremely kind, courteous and generous Soviet hosts said to me over the breakfast table"Now look here, Lord Hankey, a joke is a joke is a joke. You have really had us on quite long enough. Do admit that it is all fun". I said "Honestly, it is not. Come and listen to my radio tomorrow morning". As a matter of fact, the Soviet Press carried the news the next day and our dear Soviet hosts were horribly embarrassed and indeed dumbfounded to find the extent to which the wool was pulled over their eyes by their own information services. I should like to say that in Eastern Europe there was at that time a great deal of radio jamming but one could always hear the BBC because the Soviet authorities themselves wanted to know what the BBC was saying, so there was always a window and, with a little ingenuity, one could always find it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0158"/>
<col>299</col>
In this case I say, "Well done, the BBC". They did a magnificent job and they are still doing it and have been doing it ever since. In varying degrees it happens all over the world where truth is being suppressed or modified. In a world where truth, mercy and justice&#x2014;those cardinal Christian virtues&#x2014;are being undermined; in a world where democracy really has its back to the wall in so many places and where the moral and political ideals to which we are firmly attached need constant restatement and emphasis; in this world where our whole liberal civilisation and all our human rights are now at risk ; how vital it is, not only to Britain but to Europe and America and all our friends in every continent, to give the news objectively and to say fearlessly what we think and believe day by day across the wireless waves to the whole world in the excellent world language which is our marvellous heritage and also in the languages locally used. I beg the Government to take my heartfelt plea seriously and so far as possible to keep the BBC External Services going, on at least their present scale, and above all to hold on to our well chosen wavelengths and maintain the power of the transmitters.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00798"><member>Lord FERRIER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, as it were, he referred to the "Weekly World" on the Overseas Service: Why can we not get it here? We get "News Stand" at five minutes to 10, but that is not half so good. However, that is by the way. Something that my noble friend Lord Buxton of Alsa said towards the end of his excellent speech reminded me that I received a letter over the weekend from the "boy" who was in my service for nearly 30 years. I would remind your Lordships that "boy" is a corruption of "Bhai" meaning brother. I think that is not generally appreciated. This dear friend of mine and my family, now, alas! quite blind in his home in Gujarat, where he has a first-class radio set, in his letter dictated to a letter writer, said:
<quote>"I am listening daily to the radio and sometimes I hear of your Scotland".</quote>
I think that is very nice of him; presumably of course in the vernacular, and as the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, pointed
<col>300</col>
out these vernacular broadcasts are of great importance in this vital service.<lb/>
However, this is a trivial matter compared with what the noble Lords, Lord Buxton of Alsa, Lord Chalfont, Lord Hankey, and all the "big guns with whom I am mixed up at this moment, have been saying. Nevertheless, the item is a little window on the dangerous world in which we live. The Prime Minister has done the right thing in drawing attention to the menace of Russian superiority in men and weaponry. The noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, has said it better than I could and so I shall not develop the point, but I should have liked him to go further. He said, "No cuts". Of course, but if we cannot match the weaponry, why can we not match the weapons of the sound waves by increasing the advantage which the BBC service&#x2014;thank goodness!&#x2014;still holds and has worked at for so long? It is not that we cannot afford to: my Lords, we cannot afford not to.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00800"><member>Lord AUCKLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a most opportune time to discuss the problems facing the BBC's Overseas Services, particularly in the light of the substantial cuts which Her Majesty's Government are being forced to make in many areas and which the vast majority of responsible people regard as being a necessary evil. But, my Lords, there must be some discernment as to where these cuts are to take place. In recent years this country has been the butt of some scurrilous denigration, much of it within our own shores, but some of it, alas!, from overseas, and some of it from sources overseas where one would least expect it. How better to counteract this kind of problem than not to cut but to strengthen our Overseas Broadcasting Services? In times of difficulty the thing that really matters is communication. Communication between countries is the linchpin of the democratic way of life, revealing credit where it is due&#x2014;and this is revealed all too infrequently now&#x2014;and debit where it is due, which is sometimes overdone.<lb/>
I want to refer briefly in the major part of my speech to one country, a country I happen to have been to, and that country is Finland. Finland has been mentioned in the course of this debate, and I believe that Finland has a special qualification to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0159"/>
<col>301</col>
get a particular mention. If one looks back in history a few years, if it had not been for Field Marshal Mannerheim and his insistence on keeping Finnish troops on Finnish soil after the last war the odds are that Finland would have gone the same way as, alas, Czechoslovakia has so tragically gone. I have only visited Finland once, on a Parliamentary delegation some ten years ago, but I keep in very close contact with that country, with people in business, in the diplomatic service, in the arts and in many walks of life, and also with a number of Finnish people in this country.<lb/>
The voice of Finland is broadcast alone by the BBC. America and Germany do not broadcast in Finnish. Some 225,000 Finns listen regularly to the BBC. What would happen if the Finnish transmissions were cut out? It would mean that Russia and Poland would get a virtual monopoly. One only has to look at a map to see that Finland lives very much in the shadow of the Soviet Union. If you go, as I did, north to Tornio and to Rovaniemi, you are within about 30 miles of the Estonian border. It is absolutely vital that we keep contact with a country which fought the Russians very bravely in 1939, which had much of its northern country, particularly Finnish Lapland, razed by the Germans, which had to pay enormous reparations to Soviet Russia, but which today nevertheless manages, despite inflation, to maintain a relatively strong economy.<lb/>
A short time ago, the BBC television service put out a series of programmes. I think it was entitled "Under the Russian Bear" or some such title, and one country chosen was Finland. I presume that the gentleman who presented this programme had been to Finland recently. I must admit that I only saw the last few moments of the programme, but I read the extracts very carefully in that admirable journal, <i>The Listener.</i> The programme, which seemed to depict Finland as a country which no tourist could visit without being followed and other such sinister manifestations, bore absolutely no relation to what I saw and to what a number of people who I know have been to Finland have seen in recent years. One can move about quite freely. English is the second language in the schools. There is a considerable exchange of tourists, although not enough British people go to
<col>302</col>
Finland, largely because it is expensive. There is every opportunity for very much more communication between these two countries, but only if the broadcasting of the Finnish service is maintained, and I think I have said enough in this connection to justify that.<lb/>
I should like to quote very briefly from a letter written by a Finn only a very short time ago:
<quote>"I visited some friends in Estonia last summer. I asked them how often they listened to the BBC and they said many times a week. This seems to be a common practice, at least in Tallin".</quote>
which is the capital of Estonia&#x2014;
<quote>"I asked them why they did so, and they said that the Russian news were complete rubbish and the Finnish TV news were very much 'softened' &#x2026; So, they said, the only source for interesting news were the Finnish news on the BBC. Sometimes these, too, have been jammed. My friends asked in particular to thank you for your news bulletins and for the information you give about the communist countries (defectors, etc.). They also praised your news for their 'freshness'."</quote>
My Lords, this country has a trade deficit with Finland. We need to export more to that country, and in what better way could this be at least helped than by ensuring that the Finnish service is not only maintained but strengthened? I submit to the taxpayer that that could be done at relatively little cost. I read the article in the <i>Daily Telegragh</i> this morning. One must wait and see whether it is true. If it is not true then the situation is indeed gloomy.<lb/>
I turn away from Finland to that, at the moment, very unhappy, very lovely country, Czechoslovakia, which I also visited not very long ago. Many Czech people love this country and have fought for this country, and the BBC could do and is doing much to alleviate the sufferings in Czechoslovakia.<lb/>
Mention has been made of the Overseas Service of the BBC. I entirely endorse all that has been said about the excellence of its programmes, its news bulletins and the correspondence column which covers many countries. We in this country have much to praise ourselves for as well as much for which we must accept criticism. Even at a time when cuts in public expenditure are necessary, if we were to advertise our own plus points as well as we do our minus points&#x2014;which is done so effectively by those who work so conscientiously for the Overseas Service of the BBC&#x2014;the state of this country could gain much.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00802"><member>Lord RITCHIE-CALDER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise that my name does not appear on the list of speakers, but I have been out of the country and was not sure whether I would be back in time for this important and critical debate. At least I want to stand up and be counted. The remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, about the relative importance of military and political economies reminded me of how during the war I had a pretty heavy commitment as the Director of Plans and Operations for Political Warfare. We&#x2014;that is to say myself, the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, the noble Lord, Lord Weidenfeld, and many others&#x2014;were trying to build up what we called rather pretentiously the "Fourth Fighting Arm". That was the political warfare element and an important part of that was the BBC and its Overseas Services.<lb/>
<i>Apropos</i> what we are saying about the Overseas Service today and what it has been doing over the last 30 years; it is a great tribute to us, the BBC in particular&#x2014;some of us were trying to manipulate it&#x2014;that we maintained the total integrity of the BBC. As regards that integrity I vividly remember that I had great battles in which I was fighting something called"the projection of Britain". The "projection of Britain" would nowadays be regarded as the advertising of Britain, the public relations of Britain. I maintained, and I still do, that the most effective propaganda for Britain, the most effective projection of Britain, is to show how Britain behaves&#x2014;not to show what it is doing, but to show how it behaves. Therefore, the whole of our services&#x2014;and they have continued to be so&#x2014;were built up with the power of independence and a scrupulous regard for truth which we insisted on respecting. I am talking again as though we were trying to manipulate the BBC; but we insisted on respecting the total integrity of the BBC in its presentation of facts and also on recognising that what was said critically, often by people from various other countries on their own services, was a very important aspect of our promotion&#x2014;that is, we were letting them criticise us. We built this up until the end of the war when I insisted that Great Britain had lost a great deal. However, we recognised at the end of the war, as we must recognise now, that the BBC was
<col>304</col>
our greatest single asset. We had an authority which we could not have bought. There was no way in which we could have exploited the situation to create the authority that we had, except for the war.<lb/>
I come back to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa. He said that we must not cut the life support systems of these people. We had become the life support system of the resistance movements everywhere in Europe. I insisted then, and I still insist today, that the whole face of Europe was turned West&#x2014;not to Britain as a self-advertised Britain, but to London which had become the lighthouse, the only beacon in the Western World. They turned to us as a point of reference. The fact that we behaved well in those circumstances was to our credit, but we could have built into that authority a great influence which we could have exercised; but I am afraid in many instances after the war we failed to do so.<lb/>
Today something still remains. The remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, about the parallel with the military are absolutely indisputable. We used to talk about the BBC as our "grand fleet in being"; we were keeping it intact and not allowing it to disgrace itself, and even if it wanted to do so we would not let it. It was the biggest instrument that we possessed. It was our fleet in being. We should not take our Overseas Service and put the ships into mothballs&#x2014;if we do so we shall sink them. It is a Scapa Flow: we would be putting them at the bottom of the sea, because as everyone agrees we would not be able to restore them. If we lose the people, we would have no crew. We would have sunk the grand fleet. That is what we are proposing to do. I say to the noble Lord the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whom I deeply respect, that I hope he will not go down in history as the man who succeeded in doing what neither Goebbels nor the Russians ever succeeded in doing, namely, shutting the mouth of Britain.</membercontribution></p>

There is a matter that I should like to raise and which I suspect has not been raised by other speakers. It is a matter about which I feel strongly and, as we have a debate on this subject so rarely, I should not like to lose the opportunity of raising it tonight. I have raised this matter on the radio and I have written about it in newspapers, and I should like to say it to my noble friends here tonight.<lb/>
We all pay tribute to the Overseas Service of the BBC and in general I have no wish to disagree with my colleagues about that. Certainly that part of it which goes out in English, which is the part that I can hear and understand&#x2014;in part anyway&#x2014;when I am travelling about the world, is one that I am always very glad of, proud of and feel pleased that there is such a clear and trustworthy source.

However, I have recently begun to worry a great deal about other parts of the Overseas Service of the BBC&#x2014;those parts which we do not normally hear and which even if we did we normally would not understand and therefore would take for granted.<lb/>
Two recent examples have worried me. A similar example occurred when I was Foreign Secretary. While negotiating in Moscow on some delicate matters, I found myself in great difficulties due to the absolute and, as I then thought, rather arrogant refusal by those who were running the Russian service of the BBC to consider the foreign and diplomatic policy of Her Majesty's Government and the negotiations in which I was then engaged, and who, instead, insisted upon exercising their total independence of the Foreign Office and created some considerable difficulty for me. There is a case for telling Ministers that it is time we had an inquiry&#x2014;it would probably be better done by Parliament than by anybody else&#x2014;into the way in which the "own-language services", if that is a clear statement, of the Overseas Service of the BBC are being conducted, how
<col>306</col>
policy is being made and to what extent, if any, the foreign policy being pursued by Her Majesty's Government at any time is taken into account.<lb/>
In parenthesis let me say that we must remember that, although we in this House know about the independence of the BBC, it is very difficult to get that clearly understood in countries which themselves have no such independent organisation. They know that the BBC is funded by the Government and they assume that it must therefore be&#x2014;as it would be in their own countries&#x2014;a government service. All of us who have travelled must have had the same experience as I have had in trying to explain to foreign statesmen, politicians and newspapers that that is indeed not so. Although I would not have it otherwise, I believe that it is necessary to be quite sure that those who run what perhaps could be called the covert operation of Bush House are in some way democratically responsible&#x2014;if not to the Government, then to whom?<lb/>
Let me give the examples of the recent past which I have very much in mind. Last November and again last January I was in Iran, closely in touch with both Her Majesty's Government and with the embassy, but acting as an independent and individual Member of this House and, therefore, disownable by everybody. However, what worried everybody in Iran&#x2014;the British embassy, British businessmen, Persian journalists and other nationals&#x2014;was the extent to which they regarded the BBC Parsee service as exceeding all bounds of news or justifiable attitude-striking in its comments. I had transcripts made for me by our embassy and I had transcripts made by Iranian journalists who had been imprisoned by the Shah, and it was evident that not only were we broadcasting from here news of what was happening, but that we were broadcasting calls from, for example, Khomeini in Paris to the people in Teheran to rise and do things, to engage in disorder. There is the disputed question of whether on one occasion they actually broadcast instructions as to how to make Molotov cocktails, but certainly there were calls to go on strike the next day. On my return when I challenged this I was told that it was news because Khomeini had said it in Paris. Then it became news the next day because it had
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0162"/>
<col>307</col>
happened in Teheran. In all the answers that I received to my protests I was met with a very fanciful and unreal defence.<lb/>
This is a danger when our own-language service is bound to be operated by emigres and by others who are here because they are opponents of the existing r&#x00E9;gime. Unless one is very careful, an enormous amount of bias will be injected. It is unlikely that Mr. Gerald Mansell or his acolytes at the BBC actually read Parsee easily enough to be fully up to date day by day with what is being said by these emigre broadcasters. Last November many people still thought that we had a chance to help get some other government in Iran, either with the Shah still there or with him absent, which would certainly have been a much better situation than the one we have at present. However, the overseas Parsee service of the BBC was not only delivering, in the guise of news, anti-Shah and anti-r&#x00E9;gime propaganda; it went even further and was delivering pro-Khomeini propaganda. There is no dispute that that is what was being done. Not only in my view but in the view of the business community, other journalists and certainly of the British Embassy they had a very great deal of responsibility for building up the Khomeini campaign which has produced the disasters today, which are certainly as bad as the worst under the Shah, and I suspect very much worse.<lb/>
That worried me in November when there was still a chance to do something else; it worried me when I returned in January at the invitation of everybody who was struggling to do something; I saw it in an even more exaggerated form then. All appeals that they should desist or that they should be much more careful, or that they should listen to the Foreign Office were refused. I know very well that the Foreign Office here, our embassy there and various very distinguished people in this country, to whom appeals were made, made great efforts to persuade everybody from Micheal Swann to Gerald Mansell and other people at Bush House for Heaven's sake to reconsider the depth of the seas into which they were getting.<lb/>
I have spoken to people about this since, and as I say I have written about it. I might have forgotten it or tucked it away in the back of my mind like my previous
<col>308</col>
Moscow experience 10 years ago, except that one night a few months ago I was watching on BBC 2 a broadcast and then there was a rebroadcast of a film on what is called the "Markov affair". This had to do with the death of a Bulgarian refugee who was stabbed with an umbrella point and died rather horribly, poisoned by, it was thought, agents of the r&#x00E9;gime. The r&#x00E9;gime in Bulgaria is very different from the r&#x00E9;gime in Persia. I do not feel any softer about the r&#x00E9;gime in Bulgaria than about the other&#x2014;that is for sure and certain. However, I was horrified by what the BBC showed in the film of the Markov affair. They were very proud of themselves because they showed the film twice. They emphasised that Markov was almost certainly murdered because he was broadcasting propaganda against the r&#x00E9;gime and the leaders of the r&#x00E9;gime in his native land, and that this had so stunned the leaders of the r&#x00E9;gime and was having such an effect that they had decided to eliminate him, and had made attempts to eliminate other members of the BBC's staff. But then I stopped, because that worried me as much as the Iranian matter. What business has a Government funded service to be broadcasting propaganda against the r&#x00E9;gime of a country with which Her Majesty's Government feel it politic to have friendly relations? Who is making the foreign policy of this country?<lb/>
I got very worried indeed by the Markov account. I think that somebody has to be asked to look at the directions, because all one's attempts to raise it seriously and in an understanding way with the BBC have failed, because they simply say that one is trying to make a case for the Foreign Office. They have a jaundiced view of the Foreign Office, and they do not wish to have any connection with or control by the Foreign Office, which in a way I hear many people say. But in point of fact the desire to be independent of the Foreign Office does not in my view justify running what amounts to a separate foreign policy. Certainly in the case both of Iran, which I know of first-hand, and of Markov, which I know from their own broadcasts, the BBC were running a policy which was not the policy of our diplomats <i>en poste</i> or of the Foreign Office at home.<lb/>
This brought a comparison to my mind. Some years ago in the 1950s I was intro-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0163"/>
<col>309</col>
duced to, and got very interested in, the operations of Radio Free Europe. It operated from Munich with American funds. It again got terribly involved in running covert propaganda operations. That went on right up until recent times when the American Congress, in the aftermath of Watergate, insisted that the funds of Radio Free Europe should be provided by Congress, and that a Select Committee of Congress should satisfy itself about the operations of Radio Free Europe because of the effect that what they had been doing was having on United States' relations with eastern European and other countries.<lb/>
I express no view as to whether the United States Government's policy or Her Majesty's Government's policy is right about those countries. That is a matter about which we shall argue on another occasion. But I say that until it is changed it is highly dangerous to have a private empire in the bowels of Bush House, employing emigr&#x00E9;s, employing refugees from existing r&#x00E9;gimes, conducting&#x2014;it is done covertly but it is open in the sense that it can easily be heard&#x2014;their own covert operations against the r&#x00E9;gimes with which we chose to have friendly relations.<lb/>
Whatever may be the Government's answer to this Motion tonight about making some cuts&#x2014;and I am pretty certain that some cuts can be made, as one can always find room to make cuts in almost any service, and I do not want to support any view that may have been expressed that you can easily think you can transfer the cuts proposed for the Overseas Service to other foreign department services without also doing damage to the other foreign services&#x2014;I ask them to consider my proposition that the two House of Parliament should be asked to set up a Joint Committee. This could examine what is going on and discover how policy is decided in this part of the Overseas Services, who directs it, to whom he or they are responsible, and whether any changes ought to be made from here on to secure Parliamentary, if not Government, control. I apologise again for intervening on this point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00806"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the
<col>310</col>
noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, for having introduced this Unstarred Question today and for having initiated the debate. It would seem that there has been an astonishing degree of unanimity in the House when it has come to consider what we will think of for the moment as the projected cuts that the Government may have in mind to impose on the BBC External Services. The noble Lord, Lord George-Brown, will perhaps forgive me if I do not deal immediately with the point he raised, but I shall endeavour to refer to it in the course of what I hope will be a short rejoinder this evening.<lb/>
On the 27th July, in answer to a Parliamentary Question concerning the future of the Overseas Services, the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, said that there was a review of expenditure. He was pressed in this House as to its possible extent but he declined to commit himself beyond saying, as it was quite proper for him to do, that of course it would be incorporated in the normal way in the Government's statement on public expenditure which&#x2014;and the noble Lord will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;is expected towards the end of the autumn. This has not discouraged rumour. It has been said, and I have reason to believe, that the Foreign Office at any rate until quite recently has been asked to effect something like &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million of savings on the BBC Overseas Service. As I said, we cannot say that these are firm Government proposals yet, but the reports are that cuts of this magnitude are in contemplation. I hope that after listening to the debate this evening the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, who is to reply, may be able to assure us that after giving mature consideration to the whole question these cuts will not in fact take place at all. Or he may be constrained to say that the Government have not yet made up their mind, and will take faithfully into account the views which have been expressed in this debate by the 11 or 12 noble Lords who have spoken.<lb/>
When we are considering cutting the services, or effecting economics in the Overseas Service of the BBC, what are we really doing? What we are really doing is&#x2014;and I shall return to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord George-Brown&#x2014;cutting down the quantity and spread of information that is going out from these islands to the rest of the world. Sound
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0164"/>
<col>311</col>
radio has a great advantage over other forms of media expression, because for vast parts of the world television is quite out of the question for the vast majority of people. It is different from the Press&#x2014;on the assumption that a free Press had full circulation throughout all the populations of the world&#x2014;because the great mass of humanity, although it can speak and can hear, cannot read. Of course radio, particularly where it is addressed to these millions of people in their own language, is something they can understand, even though they cannot read. What we are in effect considering, therefore, is the possibility that the Government of the day may be taking away the only means that millions of people have of knowing what is happening in the remainder of the world&#x2014;what is happening in the United Kingdom, in Europe and elsewhere.<lb/>
I can well understand the views of the noble Lord, Lord George-Brown, who bearing in mind the time he was a distinguished person in a very distinguished series of offices, might have found independence highly inconvenient to Government. One of the great strengths of the BBC's Overseas Service, whatever errors it might make, is precisely that point; it is not susceptible to governmental pressures or to those pressures that are overtly and ruthlessly exerted in totalitarian States. It is known to be independent and it is known that many politicians&#x2014;not, I trust, the noble Lord&#x2014;would like to have it less independent than it is.<lb/>
It may well be the case, in the broadcasts on the Overseas Services, that where convenient they employ the services of emigr&#x00E9;s, and we know that the enunciation of truth can be taken as an attack on the r&#x00E9;gimes in certain dictator countries. It may be taken, as Lord George-Brown said, as propaganda; there are many in this world to whom all truth is dismissed as propaganda if it is inconvenient to the dictator and the dictator States. Although I would not invite the House&#x2014;I would not dream of doing so because I am not an expert in these affairs&#x2014;to accept the BBC Overseas Service as being the last word in perfection, I am reasonably satisfied that a genuine and objective effort is made to convey what they consider to be the truth to the outside world,
<col>312</col>
and I would not resist in the slightest any inquiry to determine whether or not that is in fact the case.<lb/>
We talk from time to time about the necessity for the Free World to match up in terms of armaments, manpower and science to those other countries which live under different systems from ours in the West and which, it is apprehended, present a threat to the Free World. Indeed, the Prime Minister herself recently emphasised the necessity for the West, and in particular the United Kingdom, to play its part in preserving at least parity with the military menace which is apprehended from other sections of the earth. Therefore in the United Kingdom, in spite of all the cuts it has been found necessary to make in all types of social expenditure&#x2014;with consequences that were adequately dealt with by my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell in the debate yesterday&#x2014;there has been a deliberate increase in expenditure on defence.<lb/>
I listened with interest to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont. We are currently engaged, when we are not retiring behind our defences and improving them, in a battle for men's minds, and in terms of military defence that battle plays a very significant part indeed. My noble friend Lord Ritchie-Calder referred to the whole question of psychological warfare during the last Great War. The battle for men's minds is the most important thing of all, bearing in mind that out of the 152 nations in the United Nations, only about 30 have the freedom of media expression such as we have in the United Kingdom and in other countries of the West.<lb/>
In terms of defence alone I cannot understand what has, or may have, got into the mind of Her Majesty's Government, who are passionately addicted to defence. Yet when it comes to this vital part, evidently they are seriously considering mutilating the service, and in exceptional circumstances. I could understand the position on 27th July last when the Foreign Secretary, the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, said the matter was under review. But since that time we have had a number of uncovenanted benefits on the credit side of the balance sheet which must have given the Prime Minister rather greater room for manoeuvre than she might otherwise have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0165"/>
<col>313</col>
thought. They might even have given the Chancellor of the Exchequer some slight cause for rejoicing.<lb/>
Noble Lords will recall that on Monday we had the uncovenanted bonus of &#x00A3;14&#x00BD; million which are to be the savings as the result of the abolition of exchange controls. So there is &#x00A3;14&#x00BD; million of uncovenanted benefit since these cuts were originally contemplated. Moreover, since then there has become a dawning of the significance of the deficit this county has with the EEC, amounting to some &#x00A3;1,000 million, and, if one reads the Press, the Prime Minister will make every conceivable endeavour to ensure that this country's net liability to the EEC is very considerably reduced. I hope it will be reduced by more than the &#x00A3;4 million or so which is covered ostensibly by these cuts. It would be a poor testimony to the confidence the Government have in the Prime Minister if they were to say that she will not get back more than that.<lb/>
Of course this country can afford the &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million which may be involved here. It is nonsense to suppose otherwise. It is not as though there has been an objective review of the BBC, and apart altogether from any question of asking the BBC to review its own operations, no real coherent reason has been put forward other than the mathematical necessity for making cuts. This is not the technique of Government. This is the technique of the bacon slicer and it is something the country cannot afford to do.<lb/>
I have said that the Overseas Service of the BBC is a vital factor in the nation's defence. It is also a vital factor in connection with trade. On any one of the three packages that have been put forward as alternatives&#x2014;and there is the inescapable alternative of the BBC&#x2014;broadcasts to South America would most certainly suffer in any eventuality. I thought that it was necessary for us to develop our export trade with South America. It is not a very good start to such an operation to cut entirely, or to mutilate, our communications with them.<lb/>
My Lords, I will not weary your Lordships by repeating the arguments that have been put forward so ably from all parts of the House. It would be invidious to mention names. It may be that at the end of the day the noble
<col>314</col>
Lord, Lord Trefgarne, will be able to say that the Government have not committed themselves yet, that they have no real intention of doing anything of the kind, but that they have the intention not only of maintaining the BBC's Overseas Service, but even of increasing it. In that case we should all be very happy to offer the noble Lord our felicitations. But if the Government persist in what must be regarded in any objective language as a completely nonsensical policy, then the verdict ultimately will be as follows. There are cuts in the social services which have been recognised so far as in some cases stupid, in other cases vicious, and in some instances both stupid and vicious. In this particular case if the Government make a decision on the lines feared, they will be completely stupid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00807">8.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00808"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Ferrier referred during the course of his speech to the thought that he was here among the big guns this evening, and I was reminded of an occasion a few months ago when we were in Opposition. I went to South Wales, to a constituency which has hardly ever returned a Conservative MP, certainly not recently. Of course that is why no one more senior was sent. I addressed a gathering of the small number of party faithful who were to be found in that area. When I had finished my speech the local chairman came up to me and said, "Thank you very much for coming. Do you think we could have a Tory big gun next year&#x2014;perhaps Lord Carrington?" I know that Lord Carrington would have wished to be here tonight but other duties well known to your Lordships have prevented him from doing so, and I must therefore do my best.<lb/>
If I was in any doubt about the intensity of feeling on this subject when I came into the Chamber this evening, that doubt has been very firmly dispelled by the speeches which we have heard in this debate. My noble friend Lord Buxton of Alsa, to whom we are indebted for initiating this discussion, has put his point of view very clearly, and he has been powerfully and ably supported by very many of your Lordships this evening. I should like to say at the outset that of course the Government agree with all the powerful reasons which have been mentioned tonight in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0166"/>
<col>315</col>
support of the BBC's Overseas Service, but it is an unhappy fact of life that in Government we very often have to distinguish between the greater and the lesser evils.<lb/>
First of all, we have to be quite clear what we are talking about when we refer to the BBC External Services. Unlike the BBC domestic services, which are financed by the licence fee, the External Services are wholly financed by a Government grant carried on the Foreign Office Vote. Although these services are financed by Government, the BBC have full responsibility for their broadcasting operations and are completely independent in determining the content of news, and indeed other programmes. I shall develop that point a little further when I come to the most interesting remarks of the noble Lord, Lord George-Brown.<lb/>
There are many facets to the BBC External Services, some of them highly specialised like the Monitoring Service which provides speedy and accurate reports of significant news and comment from the foreign transmissions in all parts of the world. There is also the commercially successful "English-by-Radio", whose product is in use in about a hundred countries, and the Transcription Services and Topical Tapes which provide recorded programmes to overseas broadcasters. But by far the best known part of the organisation are the World Services in English and the so-called Vernacular Services.<lb/>
The BBC World Service broadcasts in English for 24 hours each day. It is a complete radio service, providing not only news and every kind of talks programme, but also sport, drama, light entertainment, and music in continuous transmission addressed to all parts of the world. The Vernacular Services (providing broadcasts in more than 30 different languages) do not provide quite such universal coverage, but their broadcasts usually include news bulletins, and topical commentaries of particular interest to the regions to which they are beamed. These services are carried by some 47 transmitters in the United Kingdom and 27 transmitters at relay stations sited around the World.<lb/>
The context in which this debate is taking place is that of the overriding need
<col>316</col>
to keep Government spending to a figure which is commensurate with our resources. It is in this context that the Government have embarked upon a review of all aspects of public expenditure and, as has already been said in both Houses, the BBC as a grant-aided body cannot be excluded from this review. The Foreign Office itself, as has already been announced, has been forced to bear heavy cuts involving 23 posts abroad, besides substantial economies at home, and further staff cuts are still under consideration. Many other Departments are faced with similar painful choices.<lb/>
For the Foreign Office it has been particularly painful and difficult to contemplate reductions in the Overseas Services of the BBC, for who better than our diplomatic representatives abroad can appreciate the value and quality of the BBC's External Services, both because of their high degree of professionalism and because of the image which they project so successfully of a civilised and democratic Britain?<lb/>
Since the inception of the public expenditure review, we have had representations, not only in Parliament and in the Press, but from a wide variety of correspondents both at home and abroad, making special pleas for us to deal lightly with the BBC's External Services. The vast majority of these correspondents have emphasised the value of the World Service in English, which all of us at one time or another, I am sure, have had reason to appreciate. Indeed, I understand that it has a large audience in the United Kingdom as well. The noble Lord, Lord Hankey, and others mentioned this. I have a little personal memory of the Overseas Service of the BBC. I was brought up as a boy in Sussex very close to the main transmitter of the World Service, and I remember that the only thing that I could receive on the crystal sets that I connected to my bed springs at night was the Overseas Service of the BBC, usually in Polish, but none the less interesting when you are nine years old and should be asleep anyway.<lb/>
Let me say that Ministers have not been unmindful of the often eloquent and deeply-felt representations made by people of all political persuasion. We have also taken into account the points of view expressed by the BBC themselves in the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0167"/>
<col>317</col>
consultations they have had with Foreign Office officials. As always, it is a question of priorities. As I have said, the BBC broadcasts in English to the whole world, and in more than 30 other languages to particular areas. Each naturally has its own supporters, but each cannot be said to be equally important to our national interest, contrary to what some of the arguments canvassed publicly in recent weeks&#x2014;and particularly here tonight&#x2014;would, I think, have us believe.<lb/>
My noble friend the Foreign Secretary is firmly resolved to minimise the implications for our interests of any economies in the BBC's External Services; but I am sorry to say that such is the overridding general need to find economies that some at least will have to be made. I regret that I am not yet in a position to give financial details, as these, together with the financial details of economies in other Departments, must await the publication of the White Paper. For the same reason, I am unable at this stage to go into specific details about the nature of the economies which will be made. But I am happy to be able to say that the World Service in English will remain intact; audibility will be maintained and, where possible, improved; and vernacular services to developing countries and to those countries which do not enjoy free and open access to news and information will also be largely unaffected. This announcement will, I believe, allay many of the fears which have been expressed tonight.<lb/>
May I now deal with some of the points raised by noble Lords during this debate. I apologise if I am not able to deal with all of them tonight, but I will, where necessary, undertake to write to noble Lords who have raised matters to which I cannot immediately provide an answer. First of all, the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, asked me whether we could not use some of the existing aid monies for supporting the Overseas Services of the BBC. This is a detailed technical matter which I really do not think I am competent to go into at this stage; and, of course, the details will have to be gleaned from the White Paper when it is published in due course.<lb/>
I was a little puzzled by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton. It indeed followed the general pattern of the speeches on this subject in your Lord-
<col>318</col>
ships' House tonight, and one's memory fails over the years, but is it not the case that during a distinguished ministerial career the noble Lord was himself responsible for considering, if not implementing, a good many cuts of a fairly firm nature in the BBC's Overseas Services? I confess that at a distance of 20 years one's memory plays tricks. It may be that I am wrong, and my researches have not been able to go back that far in the short time that I have had available tonight, but I thought that the criticisms that the noble Lord was levelling at us tonight did not lie too well on the shoulders of somebody who, so far as I can recall&#x2014;and I may be doing the noble Lord a grave injustice&#x2014;was responsible for some cuts, at least, in years gone by.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00809"><member>Lord HILL of LUTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to interrupt him in order that the record may be put straight? The White Paper to which he refers, which he might have re-read in order to approach accuracy, was published 22 years ago. It moved some strength from one country to another, but it increased the amount of money available to the BBC and the British Council ; and each change during my four years of responsibility for overseas information services revealed an increase, not a decrease. A shifting of resources which involved Scandinavia and Portugal, and those only, plus an increase in the amount of money available to those services, is hardly comparable to the minor massacre to which the noble Lord is now referring.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00810"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord had had such a distinguished record in these matters I am surprised we did not hear more about it when he spoke. The expression "shift of resources" is one which I think I have heard before in other contexts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00811"><member>Lord HILL of LUTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord really must allow me to intervene once more. This debate is about reducing the financial resources to the BBC's Overseas Services. On the occasion to which he refers, and on any other occasion during my four years, the change was one of increased resources, and never one of decreased resources.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00812"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not deny that for a moment. As the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0168"/>
<col>319</col>
noble Lord has said, it was 22 years ago and I would not want to claim accuracy of memory in that matter. But I am still a little puzzled that that splendid record did not appear in the noble Lord's speech. He could have compared it, could he not, so favourably with what he is complaining of from this Dispatch Box?<lb/>
A good many noble Lords referred to the "crippling" of the service, for which we are apparently responsible at this time. I really think that that is rather over-egging the pudding. It is really not fair. Noble Lords will have heard what I said just now: that, for example, the vernacular services to developing countries and to those countries which do not enjoy free and open access to news and information will also be largely unaffected. That does not sound like "crippling" to me. I think I would also want to reject the expression, which I noted down from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ritchie-Calder, that we were "sinking the fleet."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00813"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I intervene for one moment? I have been following the noble Lord's argument with attention. I understand his argument on this, that there must be some cuts in the overseas programmes of the BBC because everybody is being cut. On the other hand, it is known to all of us, and indeed to the noble Lord, that the defence departments have been exempted altogether from any cuts. If that is so, does he totally reject the argument advanced here tonight by myself and by others, I think, that the overseas programmes of the BBC are, in effect, in the front line of defence of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00814"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a sort of philosophical point which I would find it difficult to develop from the Dispatch Box at this time&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00815">Several noble Lords: No, no!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00816"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: &#x2014;&#x2014;and I really decline to be drawn along that line. Perhaps I can refer to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. "Of course we can afford &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million", he said; "we are adopting the technique of the bacon slicer". My Lords, failure to adopt the technique of the bacon slicer was the characteristic of the previous
<col>320</col>
Administration, and look at the mess that they got into!<lb/>
I cannot hide from your Lordships the regret with which we have decided that some economies must be made in the BBC's Overseas Service. But when we were elected to office last May we accepted as our principal task the need to contain public expenditure, thus controlling inflation and thus, in due course, allowing our economy to prosper and grow. It is for this reason that we are engaged in a public expenditure review, and it is for this reason, and this reason alone, that we must look for economies&#x2014;happily, fairly modest ones&#x2014;in the BBC's highly regarded Overseas Services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00817"><member>Lord CHALFONT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I return to one point in his very eloquent reply, concerning the apparent decision of the Government not to cut services, as I understood it, to countries which do not have access to free news and information services. Is the noble Lord aware that this is a situation that can change overnight and that this is the great danger of the Government's policies? Countries which today have access to free news and information might not have it tomorrow. Is the noble Lord aware that once the Government have made those cuts there is no restoring them? That is the danger of this kind of policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00818"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord is right that we have to take our decisions in the light of circumstances as we see them today. Although I should like to be able to assure your Lordships that we will change our plans and our broadcasting destinations (if that is the right word) or audiences as the political situation in the countries concerned change, I think I should be wrong to give a commitment to do that now because of the difficulty that that would cause. I failed to deal with a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord George-Brown. Perhaps I can refer to it now. He was concerned, rightly, about difficulties which he experienced&#x2014;and he gave some of his experiences&#x2014;with regard to BBC broadcasts which he felt were on some occasions not as helpful as they might be. The Corporation have a duty to take these matters into consideration. I quote from the licence agreement of the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0169"/>
<col>321</col>
Corporation with regard to these services:
<quote>"The Corporation shall consult and collaborate with the Department so specified"&#x2014;</quote>
which means the Foreign Office&#x2014;
<quote>"and shall obtain and accept from them such information regarding conditions in and the policies of Her Majesty's Government aforesaid towards the countries so prescribed and other countries as will enable the Corporation to plan and prepare its programmes in the external services in the national interest".</quote>
I hope that the noble Lord will agree that that is a helpful provision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00819"><member>Lord GEORGE-BROWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no complaint that there is no more detail than that on the point that I raised, since my late arrival prevented me from giving the noble Lord any hint of what points I may have raised. When <i>Hansard</i> arrives would he consider the record of what I said? In particular, will he consider with his colleagues whether my plea for a parliamentary inquiry into the way in which these services are controlled might be accepted? Perhaps he and I could have a talk some time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00820"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall consider that, but I must confess that I cannot hold out much hope.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00821"><member>Lord HANKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord to consider a point I made of a slightly more technical type? If the Government are going to abandon
<col>322</col>
some of the vernacular language broad-cases, it is important that they should preserve the use of those wavelength channels for the BBC. There is tremendous congestion on the short waves and countries all over the world are trying to steal wavelengths from each other all the time. If ever we want to get back, when the Government (as we hope) have set this country back on its feet, it is important that we should be able to continue to use those channels. If we do not do it in the vernacular, will the Government consider pumping out more English broadcasts on those channels simply so as to go on using them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00822"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will consider that but, as I have said, again, without a lot of hope. It might be helpful to refer to the proceedings of the World Administrative Radio Conference which is taking place in Geneva now and at which the Government are represented. The conference is concerned with the general revision of the entire spectrum of frequencies to particular services but is not expected to assign frequencies to individual countries. The United Kngdom are to propose an increased allocation of high-frequency bands to broadcasting which should, we believe, strengthen the position of the BBC's External Services.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BNOC: PRIVATE INVESTMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00827"><member>Lord LUCAS of CHILWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00828">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00829">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they can give any further details of their plan for wider ownership of the British National Oil Corporation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00830"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY OF DEFENCE (Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my right honourable friend has already announced in another place, Her Majesty's Government are pursuing their objective of giving the public the chance to participate directly in BNOC's oil-producing business. A Statement will be made in due course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00831"><member>Lord LUCAS of CHILWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I have to thank my noble friend for his Answer, may I ask him two questions? Is he aware of the current monopoly position in gasoline production and distribution which is distorting the market, and is he able to give an assurance in that Statement that this monopoly position will not be extended? Secondly, can he give an assurance that such wider public ownership will be designed to ensure that sufficient of the assets will not fall into any one particular grouping, that may have an undue influence in both main and downstream operations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00832"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the noble Lord is correct in saying that there is a monopoly in gasoline production and distribution. So far as the second part of his question is concerned, certainly we would not wish to create a monopoly.</membercontribution></p>
<col>324</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00833"><member>Lord STRABOLGI</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it intended to restrict private investment in BNOC to British companies and British citizens, so that control does not pass into the hands of foreigners?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00834"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think a decision has been taken on the first part of the noble Lord's question. But the intention would certainly be not to see control pass to foreign companies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00835"><member>The Earl of LAUDERDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the steps already taken with regard to BNOC, particularly to restrict their first option on farm-ins and assignments, have already helped to create new confidence in the North Sea?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00836"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl. That is what we would have expected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00837"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, irrespective of the merits of the proposals which the Government are to introduce, while interest rates are at an all-time high because of the Government's total failure to control inflation, is it not precisely the wrong moment to issue shares of any kind on the market?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00838"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall ignore the middle part of the noble Lord's question, with which we would not necessarily agree. I think that the question of the timing and the judgment of how to issue these shares is one of the things that still has to be decided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00839"><member>Lord BROCKWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the reference to wider ownership in the Question, can the Minister say what ownership could be wider than ownership by the whole of our people through our Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00840"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a question which I asked when I was getting briefed for this Question. The short answer is that I think you have to distinguish between ownership by the Government and ownership by individuals or institutions.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0171"/>
<col>325</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00841"><member>Lord LEE of NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the answer he got was a shocking one?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00842"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister say whether the Government are thinking of any methods to ensure wider ownership, in the sense that the Conservative Party thinks of wider ownership, rather than the present limited method?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00843"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry but I do not think I quite understood the drift of the noble Lord's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00844"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, ordinary people do not really deal in the Stock Exchange. That is really the point. I am wondering whether the Government ought to think about wider terms of doing it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00845"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that this Government would believe in wider share ownership.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00846"><member>The Earl of ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not true that ordinary people do deal in the Stock Exchange through their pension funds, life insurance policies and all the other things which go to spread ownership of British industry, so far as is possible, among all classes of society, which is surely what we should encourage?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00847"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I would certainly agree with my noble friend, if he is suggesting that my noble friend opposite is peddling a rather outdated philosophy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00848"><member>Lord STRABOLGI</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, bearing in mind that the Government have said that they have no present plans to sell off BNOC's North Sea assets, will they also confirm that they have no future plans either, so that, since their very commendable U-turn&#x2014;the first, I hope, of many&#x2014;the oilfields may remain safe?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00849"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, again I am not entirely clear about the drift of the noble Lord's question. The intention is not to realise the assets but to ensure a wider ownership of the assets which BNOC have acquired.</membercontribution></p>
<col>326</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00850"><member>Lord LUCAS of CHILWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to my noble friend's answer to my supplementary question regarding monopolies, may I ask him whether he is aware that, in their recent report, the Monopolies Commission accepted that there was a monopoly position already existing? Therefore, may I ask my noble friend again whether he can assure noble Lords and myself that such a position will not be further extended?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00851"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not read the report of the Monopolies Commission to which the noble Lord refers, but I just wonder whether he is getting muddled up between gas and petroleum.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SHEEPMEAT: BRITISH EXPORTS<lb/>TO FRANCE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00852">2.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00853"><member>Baroness ELLIOT of HARWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00854">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00855">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are planning to secure free entry to France for British sheep-meat following the European Court decision.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00856"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES and FOOD (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the French Minister of Agriculture confirmed to our Embassy in Paris last Thursday that although some British lamb would be imported by France, he was not prepared to allow unrestricted access to the French market for British lamb. This decision is totally incompatible with the judgment of the European Court. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is pressing the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Gundelach, to fulfil the Commission's responsibility for upholding the treaties and to take action with the French Government to ensure that they comply with the judgment of the European Court.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0172"/>
<col>327</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00857"><member>Baroness ELLIOT of HARWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for his Answer, may I ask him whether there are any plans for the Commission to make the French abide by the rules of the Commission and whether or not, if it is impossible to do that, Her Majesty's Government have any plans to help in any way those British producers of sheep who are being severely hurt by this policy, which is quite contrary to anything we hoped for when we went into the Common Market?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00858"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend will be aware that some consignments of lamb have been permitted into France. My right honourable friend, who is attending the Council of Ministers at the moment, is concerned to ensure that these consignments will be continued, and he is pressing the agriculture Minister of France to ensure that that should be so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00859"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords can the Minister tell us what action he expects Mr. Gundelach to take to ensure that the French Government comply with the clear order of the European Court?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00860"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be in a better position to answer that question when my noble friend has come back from discussing the matter with Mr. Gundelach.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00861"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that British fruit farmers, particularly Kent fruit farmers, have suffered considerably through the importation of French apples? Although I could not agree that it would be wise to go against a ruling of the European Court, as France has done, would not my noble friend agree that we in this country have various means of putting quite considerable pressure on France to lift this ban on British lamb?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00862"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, because one Member State happens to act outside the judgment of the European Court it is not our intention to do the same.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00863"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Government confirm that this is the first time in history that any member Government of the Community has ever failed to accept and immediately implement any judgment of the Court?</membercontribution></p>
<col>328</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00864"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord is very nearly correct. All I would say to him is that if the Community is going to succeed, as we all wish it to do, then we must abide by the judgments of the European Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00865"><member>Lord GLENKINGLAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend accept my congratulations on the stand he is taking, but will he also indicate to the Government that, should these negotiations fail after the worst period of weather on the hills in history, a period of 13 months, and the worst prices following on enormous increases in costs, they ought to accept some responsibility for looking after their sheep farmers, in the same way as the French illegally are trying to look after theirs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00866"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to that question of my noble friend is, no, because the inference is that we should act illegally, and we shall not act illegally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00867"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister agree that probably the best retort to the French would be for us to put an embargo upon the importation of French wine into this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00868">Several noble Lords: Perish the thought!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00869"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is an ingenious suggestion which would not find a lot of favour with a number of people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00870"><member>Lord GLENKINGLAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I correct my noble friend. I was not asking him to act illegally in any sense at all. However, my noble friend and his colleagues have said that, should other things fail, matters like the hill sheep subsidy would be considered in the light of results at the end of the year. The results have been disastrous but nothing has happened. And that is not illegal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00871"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to my noble friend for having misunderstood his question. It is the Government's intention to take care of the hill sheep and of our own sheep industry, and indeed we shall be doing so.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0173"/>
<col>329</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00872"><member>Lord SAINSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister indicate what the Government policy is with regard to sheepmeat other than free trade within the Community? Am I right in assuming that they are not in favour of a full CAP r&#x00E9;gime, including support buying, intervention prices and export subsidies or the application of monetary compensatory amounts between countries? Would he further agree that if the full CAP r&#x00E9;gime was applied it could be very costly as regards the Community budget?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00873"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are perfectly prepared to consider a Community r&#x00E9;gime for sheep provided that it takes into account the fact that we are the major producer and the major consumer of sheepmeat in the Community, and provided also that it takes into account our relations with New Zealand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00874"><member>Lord CHELWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while naturally being glad that the Government are being so firm about this question, may I ask my noble friend for an assurance that he will not enter into an agreement with the French Government which could possibly damage the interests of New Zealand in this respect, in view of the great importance of the British market&#x2014;indeed, of the whole Community market&#x2014;to New Zealand? In other words, putting it more simply, that there will be no horse trading in lamb.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00875"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think my noble friend can rest assured that in any negotiations over a Community sheep r&#x00E9;gime we shall have very firmly in mind our commitments to New Zealand; and the point that he makes about the reliance of New Zealand on their exports to this country is well known and well taken care of.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HEATHROW AIRPORT: <lb/>PROPOSED FOURTH TERMINAL</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00876">2.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00877"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00878">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00879">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have now received the report of the inspector who held the
<col>330</col>
inquiry into the proposed fourth terminal at Heathrow Airport; and whether in the light of the urgent need for this terminal they have now decided to authorise its construction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00880"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have received the inspector's report and expect to announce their decision shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00881"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I then ask my noble friend, in thanking him for that reply, whether, although the delay occasioned by this long and probably unnecessary inquiry is not the responsibility of the Government, the Government are aware of the fact that the building of this terminal is grossly overdue and that in any event there will be very serious congestion indeed at Heathrow next summer?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00882"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the relief of any congestion at Heathrow, and indeed increase of services elsewhere, for instance at Gatwick, will continue to be the important objective of the Government's civil aviation policies. To this end the British Airports Authority will continue to maintain its present policy of widening the disparity in the landing and the other charges at Heathrow and Gatwick, and indeed the policy will continue of allowing no airline which is not currently operating scheduled international passenger services at Heathrow to begin operations there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00883"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that the terms of that answer, however admirable in themselves, do not indicate any feeling on the part of Her Majesty's Government that there is other than great urgency also to build this terminal as quickly as possible?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00884"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we accept the noble Lord's proposition that there is great urgency but we believe that there is a relatively short time until the publication of the report, and until the report is published we believe it would be in-appropriate to comment further on any steps that might be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00885"><member>Baroness BURTON of COVENTRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in studying this report and in reaching their decision will the Government make sure that in the report there are
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0174"/>
<col>331</col>
definite suggestions for helping passengers with luggage not only to reach the forth-coming fourth terminal but the third, and if those subjects are not included in the report will the Government ask for them to be put in?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00886"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think if the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, will wait to see what is in the report we might then be able to take a firm stand, but I do not think it is right to commit the Government to take any action at this stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00887"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government not take any action until at least the report has been published and noble Lords and others have had a chance to comment? In particular can the noble Lord say what assumption is made in the report regarding the future trends in aviation fuel prices and the elasticity in the demand for air travel which may lead to a much lower rate of increase in the growth of air traffic at all London airports than has hitherto been thought likely?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00888"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the assumptions which have been taken into account in the report will be prepared and put forward in the report. I could not comment further on the noble Lord's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00889"><member>Lord PARRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord accept, while making allowance for the Addison Rules, that Cardiff Wales Airport has spare capacity and would accept traffic as a result of any difficulties that might arise? May I offer the Government that information and the invitation to consider that airport when considering the report?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00890"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are always pleased to receive invitations from the noble Lord, Parry, but noble Lords will be aware after listening to radio reports of congestion on the main motorway to and from London that at this stage the suggestion is, I think inappropriate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00891"><member>The Earl of CORK and ORRERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will Her Majesty's Government ensure that whenever the report may be published there will thereafter be ample
<col>332</col>
time for the preparation of their case by those local authorities and other bodies who wish to oppose the construction of the second terminal at Gatwick?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00892"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that is another question, but the Government have no intention of rushing any authorities into precipitate decisions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00893"><member>Lord PARRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I now offer a further invitation to the noble Lord to travel with me to Wales on the motorway or the British Rail system, which is the fastest and most effective in Britain?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00894"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that Concorde is even faster.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ROYAL COMMISSION ON<lb/> LEGAL SERVICES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00895">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00896"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR (Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I wish to make a statement on the subject of the report of the Benson Commission. I understand that on Monday there is to be a debate on the adjournment in another place, and that it would be for the convenience of honourable Members there who may attend that debate if they had a Statement from me before then. I also have a short speech to make to your Lordships this afternoon on the draft Legal Aid regulations. It would not be in order for us to discuss the Benson Report on the Motions for those regulations to which, as will be seen in due course, it is irrelevant. I therefore consider that it would be for the convenience of Parliament as a whole if I make a short Statement now, even though, in the nature of things it is somewhat devoid of content.<lb/>
The report of the Royal Commission on Legal Services was published on 3rd October before we resumed our labours after the Recess. Volume 1 of the report is over 800 pages long and contains 369 recommendations the implementation of which, if accepted, would rest with a large number of departments and agencies both inside and outside the Government. It is obvious, therefore, that a period of digestion and reflection is required before a coherent strategy can be evolved and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0175"/>
<col>333</col>
that this process will require lengthy consultations with the different branches of the profession and other interested bodies.<lb/>
What I particularly wish to do this afternoon is simply to express our thanks to Sir Henry Benson and his fellow commissioners for the public service they have done over 3&#x00BD; years of unremitting toil, and for the lucid, well written, comprehensive and monumental character of the report which they have produced. I do so all the more warmly and sincerely because I publicly expressed doubts at the wisdom of the then Government in setting up a commission with such wide terms of reference, doubts which to some extent I retain. These, however, do not reflect in any way on my genuine appreciation of the commissioners' work and particularly that of their chairman.<lb/>
I should also like to applaud the statesmanship and wisdom of both branches of the profession and others who co-operated so fully with the commission in their labours and spent many hours of time and work in providing the commission with information on which they could base their opinions. I should also like to endorse the alacrity with which they considered and accepted very many suggestions from the Commission without waiting for their formal report. My Lords, that is what I wish to say.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00898"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for the Statement he has made. I would also say that my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones is particularly sorry not to be able to hear the Statement of the noble and learned Lord. He is attending, in an official capacity, the celebrations in Strasbourg marking the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the Council of Europe and the 20th anniversary of the European Court of Human Rights. While he is sorry not to be here, he is, of course, delighted to be there. I hope that that is a balanced legal observation.<lb/>
My Lords, from this Bench I would ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to accept that we would express our gratitude, too, to the chairman, Sir Henry Benson, in particular, and the
<col>334</col>
other members of the Royal Commission for their long and arduous labours. As the noble and learned Lord has said, the report is very thorough and lengthy, and it would not be doing justice to it, in my submission, if it were not subjected now to deep and careful study, not only by the legal profession and other bodies but by the public as well. The provision of legal services is a vital part of our country's social services, and it is important that it should be exhaustively examined from time to time. Now that this vast report has been produced it is essential to allow time for it to be given careful consideration. It was, of course, published, as the noble and learned Lord has indicated, comparatively recently, and there has not yet, in my submission&#x2014;and here I would also agree with him&#x2014;been enough time to study it fully and to give a considered view on matters of such importance. There is, after all, a very large number of recommendations, and I do not think, if I may say so with respect, that the noble and learned Lord needs to apologise if his Statement is devoid of content on the substance of the report. I would agree that it is not the moment for final decision.<lb/>
My Lords, I would add this and ask the noble and learned Lord to consider it. This report is not only deserving of most careful consideration and study; it is also important that decisions on any necessary action be taken in due course without unnecessary delay. What would be most regrettable, and indeed unforgivable, would be if this matter were to be pigeon-holed. I feel sure that we can rely on the noble and learned Lord to ensure that that does not happen.<lb/>
There is only one other matter that I should wish to mention and to raise with the noble and learned Lord. It has to be acknowledged, I think, that the report has not been greeted with universal acclaim. There are those who would argue that it is not so radical in some respects as might have been hoped for in some quarters. On the other hand, and without wishing in any way to prejudge the view that one might take after more detailed study, certainly the overall view of the profession that the Royal Commission takes is a reassuring one. In saying that, I had better declare an interest as a practising member of the Bar.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0176"/>
<col>335</col>
My Lords, I would just add this point, and ask the noble and learned Lord to accept it, about the profession itself: that it has never shrunk from making proposals on law reform; indeed, members of it have been in the vanguard on this matter, as I have had occason to observe at close quarters. I do not believe that it will shrink from whatever reforms eventually turn out to be needed in the provision of legal services. I would come back to the point made earlier, and ask the noble and learned Lord to accept that the report itself must certainly not be neglected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00899"><member>Lord WADE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I join in thanking the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for making this Statement? I am impressed by the amount of work carried out by the Benson Commission. I have only one question to ask, namely, when the recommendations have been studied may we take it that priority will, if possible, be given to those recommendations that are most urgent? Finally, as I have retired from practice, may I wholeheartedly join in applauding the statesmanship and wisdom of both branches of the profession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00900"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful indeed to both noble Lords for the reception they have given my Statement. I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Boston, that Lord Elwyn-Jones is at Strasbourg at my invitation, and I was very grateful indeed that he was able to accept that invitation. It is most important that we should be represented by a legal figure of adequate weight, and I could not think of anyone more suitable to do it than Lord Elwyn-Jones. I am sorry it has deprived us this afternoon of his comments on the reports, but I am sure we can bear that with patience.<lb/>
It is certainly not our intention to pigeonhole the report. As the noble Lord quite rightly said, we must recognise that there is a very large number of recommendations which depend upon the solicitors' and barristers' professions themselves; they do not rest with the Government and could not be achieved by legislation. I have already held a preliminary meeting in my office about
<col>336</col>
the kind of strategy to follow. Of course, there are things that can be done without legislation, almost straight away; they are not necessarily the things which are most important but the things which are most easily done, if I may say that to the noble Lord, Lord Wade.<lb/>
I cannot give any sort of timetable. The report makes quite important recommendations with regard to the actual ministerial responsibility for some of the legal services, and I am sure the House would not wish to embarrass me by asking what I think about that. At any rate, they are being considered. I quite realise that the media have in a sense, as the noble Lord, Lord Boston, said, been slightly critical of the report, but I think they rather hoped that the legal profession would not only stand in the dock as a result of these proceedings but be convicted. Well, unfortunately they have been acquitted. I do not share the sorrow that this is so. I must say that one of the deepest reasons for which I am grateful to Sir Henry Benson and his fellow commissioners is the courage and objectivity with which they investigated the matters which were put before them and came to conclusions which might not necessarily be popular with those who like to denigrate our institutions but are in accordance, I think, with the evidence. So that is another reason for being thankful. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wade, and the noble Lord, Lord Boston, for what they have said.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LEGAL AID (FINANCIAL<lb/>CONDITIONS) (No. 2)<lb/>REGULATIONS 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00902">3.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00903"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member> rose to move, That the regulations laid before the House on 26th July 1979, be approved. The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in rising to move the first of the two Motions in my name, may I speak to both simultaneously. The regulations increase the income limits both for legal aid in civil proceedings and for legal
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0177"/>
<col>337</col>
advice and assistance. It has become the practice in recent years for the financial limits to be increased annually in line with increases in supplementary benefits. This year the limits were increased considerably in April as part of a package of improvements to the legal aid scheme introduced by my predecessor. May I in parenthesis say that I did think that Lord Elwyn-Jones had achieved a very important victory inside the Government machine by improving those regulations then&#x2014;a thing I had been wanting to see for a long time. He did, to some extent, recapture the ground which had gradually become eroded by the sea since the legal aid scheme was first introduced. The regulations ensure that the real value of the limits achieved in April is maintained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00904">The Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (No. 2) Regulations increase the lower income limit, below which no contribution is payable, from &#x00A3;1,500 to &#x00A3;1,700 a year, and the upper income limit, above which legal aid is not available, from &#x00A3;3,600 to &#x00A3;4,075 a year. Both sets of figures relate to what is called "disposable income" which, as your Lordships will know by now, as we have to say it every year, is a notional figure arrived at after allowances are made for dependants and deductions are made for certain necessary expenses such as income tax, housing costs and the cost of travelling to work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00905">There are corresponding changes to the income limits for legal advice and assistance, the so-called "green form" scheme. The Legal Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (No. 3) Regulations 1979 raise the upper income limit for legal advice and assistance from &#x00A3;75 to &#x00A3;85 a week. Another set of regulations&#x2014;which are not subject to affirmative resolution&#x2014;raise the lower disposable income limit from &#x00A3;35 to &#x00A3;40 a week and amend the scale of contributions payable for persons with incomes above that limit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00906">The allowances made for dependants in both schemes will also increase. These are fixed at one and a half times the corresponding supplementary benefit scale rates, and so, when the supplementary benefit rates increase on 12th November, the allowances for dependants for legal aid and legal advice and assistance will increase automatically.</p>
<col>338</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00907">These increases in the financial limits are intended to ensure that legal aid continues to be available to those who would otherwise be unable to enforce or defend their legal rights. It is estimated that legal aid is now available to at least 70 per cent. of families with children. In 1978&#x2013;79, before the financial limits were increased in April, 152,000 certificates were issued for legal aid in civil proceedings. Over 400,000 claims for payment in respect of legal advice and assistance were received from solicitors. The net cost of civil legal aid and legal advice and assistance was over &#x00A3;33 million, excluding administration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00908">My policy is to ensure that legal aid should remain available&#x2014;to quote the preamble to the first Legal Aid and Advice Act of 1949&#x2014;to those of "small or moderate means", and, unless the level of the legal aid limits is maintained, the legal rights of many people will go by default.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00909">I think that I should explain that in previous years the corresponding Scottish regulations have been debated at the same time as the English ones. Unfortunately, that has not been possible on this occasion, but I understand that the Secretary of State for Scotland will bring his regulations before Parliament in the near future. Corresponding regulations for Northern Ireland, made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under the negative resolution procedure, will come into force on the same day as those relating to England and Wales.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00910">I should also explain that, in addition to the regulations I am now moving which require affirmative resolution, I have laid others subject to the negative procedure which raise the lower income limit and reduce contributions for legal advice and assistance. These come into operation at the same time&#x2014;12th November&#x2014;and require no separate comment. I beg to move.</p>

particular direction. The profession as a whole is most concerned that all those who cannot afford to litigate when they have a good cause should be enabled to do so. We feel very strongly that every individual in this country should have a full opportunity, irrespective of his financial situation, to place a reasonable case&#x2014;about which he is usually advised by the profession itself&#x2014;in the proper courts for a decision. In those circumstances, I personally am grateful to the noble and learned Lord as, I am sure, is everyone in my own particular profession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00913"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join my noble friend Lord Janner in thanking the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for introducing these regulations. I do so also on behalf of my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, who is sorry that he is unable to be here for the introduction of these regulations, for the reasons which your Lordships have already heard. I would only add that it is of course vitally important that the financial limits mentioned by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor are revised so as to keep pace with inflation and are kept in line with increases in supplementary benefits. Therefore, from this Bench, I offer a welcome to the proposed regulations.<lb/>
There is, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has indicated, just one respect in which these legal aid provisions do not quite parallel the supplementary benefits increases, and that is that, whereas the supplementary benefits provisions were updated to take account of inflation from last November, these legal aid provisions are updated only from last April. However, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has also most generously pointed out, there were the increases which were introduced last April. I am sure that we on these Benches are most grateful to him for the observation that he made about my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones.<lb/>
Furthermore, I think that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is to be congratulated himself on having coaxed from a no doubt somewhat reluctant Treasury, some more money. Therefore, I would join him in commending these regulations to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<col>340</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00914"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first I should like to apologise for having, as it were, almost jumped the gun by putting the Question before noble Lords had spoken. It is very easy to make such mistakes and one apologises when one makes them.<lb/>
I am grateful to both the noble Lord. Lord Janner, and the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, for what they have said. I do not think that I had to fight a terrible battle with my colleagues over these regulations. I think that they realised the importance and priority which they should receive.<lb/>
What is, of course, a sad fact for lawyers is that, in a financial situation such as that from which we seem constantly to suffer, we cannot move ahead as fast as we would like. There are areas which the Legal Aid Advisory Committee is constantly urging us to move into and where I would like to move forward if I could. In that respect, I think that I am up against the financial situation. Moreover, of course, there are whole areas of litigation which are not covered at all&#x2014;there is the area of tribunals and all sorts of matters that one would like to consider but that, in the present financial situation, is not possible. Also, and I say this frankly&#x2014;I should not say it as Lord Chancellor but I do say it as a Member of the Government&#x2014;one must recognise that in an age when one is cutting down and economising on essential social services, one must take one's own share on things which perhaps do not excite quite so much compassion but which are none the less important to very many people. I can only apologise for not having a better statement to make, but I am extremely grateful to both noble Lords for being so understanding about the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CRIMINAL INJURIES<lb/>COMPENSATION BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00923">3.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00924"><member>The Earl of LONGFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not intend to move the Motion that the Report be now received, as I intend to ask your Lordships' permission to withdraw the Bill. I am advised that it would be appropriate for me to make a fairly general, though I hope not very prolonged statement, about the matter. The House was kind enough to give my victims' compensation Bill a Second Reading on 3rd July, and on 24th July it passed through the Committee stage. I tried hard between the Second Reading and the Committee stage to modify the Bill in response to points raised by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, and other speakers on the earlier occasion. However, the Minister&#x2014;courteous as always&#x2014;made me feel remarkably like Sisyphus&#x2014;for no sooner had one set of objections been met than a whole lot of new ones were brought forward. The Minister paid friendly tribute to the drafting of the Bill, which was indeed a thoroughly professional job. Even so, he made it clear that this Bill, however amended&#x2014;even if it received a Second Reading here&#x2014;was most unlikely to obtain Government support in the House
<col>342</col>
of Commons, and without that support, for various technical reasons, constituting, as it would, a financial charge, the Bill could not succeed.<lb/>
The Minister made it clear that the Government had set their face against any legislation on this subject at this stage; that is to say, until they had had the chance to study the operation of certain improvements in the existing Criminal Injuries Scheme, which they would be introducing. Those improvements, which have since been made available to us in detail, are by no means insignificant. I hope that I can welcome them in general without being committed to any of them specifically and without disguising my serious regret that some of the most important issues have not been dealt with.<lb/>
The most obvious weaknesses in the present scheme are the fact that such a large proportion of the public&#x2014;and this can hardly be disputed&#x2014;know nothing about it; they do not even know that it exists; and the fact that a high proportion of the rest of the public are unable to make use of it because of the absence of legal aid. I had no idea when I drafted these remarks that legal aid would be in our minds at this precise moment. We are told that the Government are proceeding generously in that direction, though the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has just told us that there are areas which they have not yet been able to enter. We can only hope that they will regard this as one of the crucial areas which they will enter as soon as possible. Under this <i>ex gratia</i> scheme there is also, of course, the absence of any appeal to the courts of the land, which is a grave blemish. There are other defects. Nevertheless, this is a move in the right direction and should be welcomed as such.<lb/>
The Government have also promised a grant of &#x00A3;15,000 to the national headquarters, which will seek to co-ordinate the growing number of voluntary victims' support schemes. At a time when other social services are being cut or restricted&#x2014;rightly or, as many of us think, wrongly&#x2014;it would be churlish for a spokesman on behalf of victims not to express gratitude for this small beginning, which I hope will lead to major developments later on.<lb/>
When I moved the Second Reading of my Bill, I pointed out that it was in no way a complete charter for victims. Indeed,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0180"/>
<col>343</col>
that could not be claimed even for the more comprehensive report produced by the committee of which I was chairman a year earlier, which we debated in this House at that time. Nothing that I am about to say should seem to diminish the urgency for a much wider and bolder approach than anyone, including myself, has yet undertaken. In all humility&#x2014;at any rate, in a qualified kind of humility&#x2014;I am perhaps entitled to point out that since I raised this matter in the House in 1962 there was not a full debate on it until I raised it again in 1978, 16 years later.<lb/>
The Minister has generously acknowledged that our Bill has accelerated the Government's initiative. Ministers are not always so generous, and therefore I throw myself before him in enormous gratitude for that tribute. I am happy to believe that that is indeed so. The committee of which I am chairman considers that it would not serve a useful purpose if we pressed ahead with this particular Bill at present. We shall be returning, sooner rather than later, to the issues involved not only in the present Bill but in the whole cause of victims generally. There are matters on which we shall certainly press the Government hard, as opportunity offers. We shall be pressing for far-reaching improvements in the amended compensation scheme. We shall continue to urge that it should be placed on a statutory basis as soon as possible; and indeed the Government have made it plain that that is their intention as soon as they have sufficient information to go on. We shall be making suggestions, whether or not in the form of a Bill I do not yet know, for greatly improving the machinery of the law courts in regard to victims and for greatly extending the assistance to victim's support schemes. It was not until I was concerned with the drafting of this Bill that I realised how expensive it is to get a Bill drafted. Our Bill cost perhaps &#x00A3;700 and I was told that we got it at a cut rate; that it was only the generosity of very expert draftsmen that enabled us to get it at that price instead of at &#x00A3;2,000. It should be more widely known that it is very expensive to get a Private Member's Bill drafted, so that job usually falls to very powerful organisations if a Bill is at all complicated.<lb/>
I hope that the whole aspiration of reconciliation between the criminal and
<col>344</col>
the victim will receive far more attention than it has hitherto. As I know from first-hand experience, the criminal who tries to apologise to his victims&#x2014;which one would think was an altogether laudable aspiration&#x2014;is not greatly encouraged. There is nothing in the rules about it; officials can spend much time trying to find out how this can be done. But I would not like to say that without remarking that one particular criminal, who has made elaborate efforts, has received much kindness from individual officials and chaplains.<lb/>
For the first time in the 30-odd years that I have been a Member of this House, we have a Government which, whatever their other merits and demerits which are not at issue this afternoon, have actually shown a positive interest in victims. For that the chief credit must no doubt go to the Home Secretary, but not a little of it surely should be allocated to the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, and his officials. I take the opportunity of thanking the noble Lord for the sympathetic interest he has shown since it fell to his lot to deal with victims. My last words must be adapted from those used by a much more famous person: "We shall return". My Lords, I beg leave to withdraw the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-00927"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Motion is put by the noble and learned Lord and before we part from this matter this afternoon, perhaps I might add a word or two to what my noble friend Lord Longford has said. In view of the points which my noble friend has made this afternoon I feel sure that your Lordships will consider that he has taken the appropriate course today, but I should not want this moment to pass without a word of tribute to him. There is no doubt that he has performed a most valuable service in introducing this Bill and in having it debated. It has helped to draw attention to this important matter and it has given impetus to the improvements which are being made and to the consideration of further reforms. Therefore my noble

friend has, in my submission, earned both our thanks and our congratulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00928"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for his decision to withdraw his Bill. I am conscious of the long hours of careful study and deliberation which must have been devoted to the preparation of the Bill, not only by the noble Earl but also by his advisers. This leads me to express special appreciation for the course which the noble Earl has decided upon. I can assure him that all the hard work which has been put into the preparation of the legislation will not have been wasted. There is a great deal in the noble Earl's draft which will be of assistance to the Government when the proposed Bill on this subject is presented.<lb/>
In his remarks, the noble Earl drew attention to three particular weaknesses of the existing scheme, as he sees it. Each of those matters was discussed in Committee, but I should like to repeat an assurance which I gave to your Lordships on a previous stage of the Bill; namely, that steps are being taken to make the existence of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as widely known as possible. May I add that I am genuinely grateful to the noble Earl for his generous words and for his warm welcome for Government support for the National Association of Victims' Support Schemes.<lb/>
There is one other word which I ought to say. The revised Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, which came into effect on 1st October, contains a number of significant improvements, the most notable being the removal, subject to safeguards, of the provision which formerly excluded cases of violence within the family from eligibility for compensation. The revised scheme has been warmly welcomed, and the Government are confident that this expanded and revised version of the scheme which has operated successfully for over 15 years provides the right framework and basis for the permanent statutory arrangements for compensating victims of criminal injury for which the noble Earl has called.</membercontribution></p>

<col>346</col>
the noble Lords, Lord Boston of Faversham and Lord Belstead, have said, because this is a subject with which I personally have been concerned for many years. I should like to support them in thanking the noble Earl for the immense amount of work that he has put into getting matters as far forward as this. I should also like to say how grateful many of us are for the tremendous work that the small working party&#x2014;in their own time and at their own expense&#x2014;have also put into this subject.<lb/>
Whatever else we may have done, it is now well known throughout the country that there is here an area of social concern and of compassionate caring which is moving forward but which still needs to move to completion. I hope very much that having got as far as this, and with the encouraging assurances which the noble Lord on the Government Front Bench has given to us, this will not be the last time that we shall hear of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill, but that it will be coming forward, perhaps in a wider and stronger form in the future. I hope that this may be something we shall hear of again quite soon.</membercontribution></p>

"Victoria", could well become uneconomic. Plum pox spread from Eastern to Western Europe after the Second World War, reached Kent in 1965 and had become established in England generally by 1974. It was soon recognised that the scale of compulsory destruction of trees in affected orchards which would be required by the eradication effort could not be justified, and it was decided that satisfactory control could be achieved by advisory means. It was considered to be essential to ensure that nursery stock remained healthy, and so the Plum Pox (Sharka Disease) Order 1975 was introduced to provide statutory control in nurseries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00934">Until the end of 1978 some assistance was therefore available to nurserymen in the form of compensation for the destruction of suspect plum planting material which had been exposed to known outbreaks of plum pox, and in each of the years 1976 to 1978 an average of approximately &#x00A3;55,000 was paid out in this way. Experience had indicated, however, that the payment of compensation did not necessarily result in the production of badly-needed certified trees, and it was therefore considered that a more positive approach was necessary which would concentrate the limited resources available on incentives to help to secure an adequate and continuing supply of certified fruiting plum trees to commercial orchards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00935">The Plum Material and Clearance Grants Scheme 1979 is intended to stimulate the production of certified fruiting plum trees. Grants of 25 per cent. would be awarded towards reasonable costs incurred in establishing or re-establishing nursery facilities required for the propagation of certified fruiting plum trees. The type of operation which would be eligible for grant would include the grubbing and clearance of diseased and other trees and plant material both on the actual site of the propagation unit and to some extent outside it, to ensure the isolation which would subsequently be required by the certification scheme for which the material would have to be entered before any grant is paid. Assistance is also planned for the purchase of certified mother trees which will be required to provide healthy bud-wood for tree production, and aid would also be available for certified rootstock
<col>348</col>
material and for clearance of some additional land on which rootstocks might be planted out for budding and subsequent growing on.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00936">The Fruiting Plum Tree (Planting Grants) Scheme 1979 provides for grants to be paid for the planting of certified fruiting plum trees in existing or proposed commercial orchards in which plum pox is not known to exist or where adequate steps are being taken to control the disease. The rate of planting grants which apply for 1979/80 are 50p per maiden tree or &#x00A3;1 for a two-to-three-year old tree.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00937">My Lords, in addition to encouraging efforts to improve the overall health of plum trees, this scheme will stimulate demand for certified plum trees and so provide a measure of help for nurserymen engaged on the production of certified fruiting plum trees. Both schemes will, of course, be subject to the usual protective devices. In both cases the application must feature a minimum amount of work before it can be eligible. In both cases the basic agricultural or horticultural unit involved must be viable and capable of providing a living for the occupier.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00938">The schemes are planned to operate for five years, after which they will be reviewed. The anticipated expenditure is based on an average of &#x00A3;86,000 a year covering both schemes, and making a total amount to be allowed for of &#x00A3;430,000. That is the background of the regulations now before your Lordships. In essence the regulations are simple, and they allow the appropriate Minister to make modest grants which could be of genuine benefit to this relatively specialised sector of the horticultural industry. I therefore commend these schemes to your Lordships. I beg to move.</p>

<title>EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES<lb/>(DEFINITION OF TREATIES)<lb/>(INTERNATIONAL WHEAT<lb/>AGREEMENT) ORDER 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00945">3.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00946"><member>Earl FERRERS</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 25th July, be approved. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I should explain that the International Wheat Agreement 1971 comprises two conventions, the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention. The objectives of the Wheat Trade Convention are to further international co-operation in connection with world wheat problems, to promote the expansion of international trade in wheat and wheat flour, to contribute to the fullest extent possible to the stability of the international wheat market and to provide a framework for the negotiation of economic provisions in a new Wheat Trade Convention. However, this convention is simply a forum for discussion in that it has no economic provisions to enable direct action to be taken on the market.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00947">The objective of the Food Aid Convention is to carry out a food aid programme with the help of contributions for
<col>350</col>
the benefit of developing countries. In practice the convention lays obligations upon its members, who are all donor countries, to make available specific minimum quantities of cereals as food aid each year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00948">The International Wheat Agreement came into operation on 1st July 1971 for a period of three years. Since 30th June 1974 it has been extended periodically by protocols, each extension being subject to Parliamentary approval to give it the force of law in the United Kingdom. The most recent extension expired on 30th June 1979. Protocols extending both conventions for a fifth time, for a further two years to 30th June 1981, were established by a conference of member Governments in March this year and entered into force on 1st July. The main purpose of extending the conventions is to keep the machinery of the International Wheat Council and Food Aid Committee in being; these are, respectively, the governing bodies of the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention. Their continued existence provides fora in which discussions on new conventions can continue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00949">After a number of years of negotiations within the International Wheat Council in London, it was decided to convene a negotiating conference in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in February 1978. The aim of this conference was to conclude a new international grains agreement which would comprise a new Wheat Trade Convention with economic provision, a new Food Aid Convention with an objective of 10 million tonnes of aid annually and a consultative arrangement on coarse grains trade. Three sessions of the negotiating conference were held in Geneva and, by the end of the third session, negotiations on coarse grains and food aid were nearing conclusion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00950">Discussions on the economic provisions to be included within a new Wheat Trade Convention, however, ran into difficulties and it became apparent that certain fundamental issues could not be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties to the negotiations. The chairman of the conference therefore suspended proceedings until such time as a basis for their resumption should emerge.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0184"/>
<col>351</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00951">It is perhaps not surprising that the suspension of negotiations has been widely deplored by other international organisations concerned with world food security. It is apparent that failure to stabilise the wheat market must place developing importing countries at risk as to the availability of supplies at prices which they can afford. We are therefore anxious to ensure that negotiations should continue as soon as there is a reasonable basis for further discussion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00952">The International Wheat Council is making every effort to address itself to the outstanding issues, but in the meantime the extension of the present agreement is not only the best which can be achieved, but it is in itself a contribution to world food security since it provides for the continued availability of food aid to those who need it, and it also encourages Governments who are parties to the agreement to keep a careful eye on the developments of the wheat market. I therefore hope that your Lordships, who have approved the extension of the agreement on a number of previous occasions, will feel they can do so today. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00953">Moved, That the European Communities (Defininition of Treaties) (International Wheat Agreement) Order 1979, which was laid before both Houses on 25th July, 1979, be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Ferrers.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00954">3.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00955"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation and, as with the previous order, I believe it essential that the Government should have this one. The noble Earl mentioned food aid, and there has been difficulty over this, as he said, I have with me a whole brief on the subject which I have collected myself, including details of the whole impact on the Tokyo Round. For example, in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 17th January appeared the headline, "Wheat talks discord threatens trade pact." There are considerable difficulties over this. We are part of the Community, but wheat and cereals are very important politically and economically in the world and naturally we should play our part.<lb/>
I notice another former Minister of Agriculture, the noble Viscount, Lord Amory, in his place; no doubt he remembers standard quantities when we used to import wheat from the United States.
<col>352</col>
I was in a similar position. I see now, however, that we are going to export cereals on a considerable scale, and I have with me the excellent British publication <i>Farmer and Stockbreeder.</i> Though it is the NFU's publication, it is very good and I would advise anyone who wants to know about cereals to read its marketing page. For example, one headline reads, "Cereals exports big again." So we are to go in for exporting considerably&#x2014;and I am all for that. I always believed when I used to go to Europe that Britain should export more though many people thought we should contract.<lb/>
I welcome this move, but I hope we can argue these and other matters in a one day debate devoted specifically to agriculture. I do not think one can raise big issues of this sort when discussing an order of this type in the way one can in a full day's debate, I hope therefore, perhaps early in the New Year, we will have a full day on agriculture. After all, Labour Governments and Oppositions have always treated agriculture much better than their Conservative counterparts. I am delighted that I can put this marker out, so to speak; I do it with the best of intentions, and in my view the Minister deserves to have his order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00956"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I really am indebted again to the noble Lord, Lord Peart. When I realised he was going to answer for the Opposition on these orders, I knew the depth of his knowledge and, considering the intricacies of the Ministry of Agriculture, I wondered what he would say. All I would say is that when he wished the Government well with the order and commended the NFU for their publication and made his nice little point about the Labour Party looking after agriculture better than the Conservative Party, I thought that that was not quite what I was expecting from the noble Lord. I would only tell him that of course he would be entitled to discuss these very complex wheat problems on this order, but I am obliged to him for being able to find that he would not wish to do so. And of course if he wishes to have a debate on agriculture in the future, that may be a very good thing; I am sure that could be arranged through the usual channels, of which he is a pillar. I am grateful to the noble Lord for his agreement to this order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DRUGS: INCREASE IN MISUSE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00958">3.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00959"><member>The Earl of DENBIGH</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what action they propose to take on the increase in the use of drugs disclosed in the statistics of the misuse of drugs in the United Kingdom 1978, set out in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin of June 1979. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question that stands in my name on the Order Paper. My interest in this particular subject arises from the fact that I am the chairman of the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse. This is a national co-ordinating agency for voluntary services working with people who have drug-related problems. With regard to my Question, I wish particularly to concentrate&#x2014;in relation to the Home Office statistics&#x2014;on first notifications, rather than on overall notifications, because I believe that this is where the problem is shown up best. In 1977 there were 1,108 new notifications to the Home Office. By 1978 the figure had risen to 1,352, and although the figures are not yet officially available, I am led to believe that the first six months of 1979 have shown an increase of over 20 per cent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00960">We must look also at the whole question of dissatisfaction with the notification system. As I understand it, doctors are required to notify only known or suspected addicts using opiate or opiate-type drugs. This does not include barbiturates or amphetamines. Many addicts are reluctant to be notified, for a number of reasons, one of which is fear of police involvement should it be known that they are addicted to drugs; they might be raided and further harassed in the courts. Therefore these cases are not included. Consequently, I believe that the figures shown in the statistics do not realistically reflect the number of drug addicts and people with a drug dependency problem in this country. There must also be increasing concern over the abuse of prescribed drugs by the people for whom they have been prescribed. This is a problem. Furthermore, the large number of prescriptions is tending to lead to a black market in barbiturates and amphetamines, which are increasingly being abused in conjunction with alcohol.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00961">Dr. Anthony Thornley, to whom I was talking the other day, and who is a consultant psychiatrist at Parkwood House,
<col>354</col>
Newcastle, believes that the national level of prescription has tended to be related to the level of abuse in the country; for example, the more prescriptions there are, the greater the number of drug abuse problems the country is likely to have. I was interested to read in the <i>Daily Mail</i> this morning that in America a USA congressional committee investigating drug abuse reported that a staggering 44&#x00B7;6 million prescriptions for the mild tranquiliser valium were issued in one year alone. It goes on to say that dependency on even minor tranquilisers can be harder to "kick" than can heroin, and ultimately may cause brain damage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00962">I suggest that new research into these milder types of drug is urgently needed in order to find out what types of treatment are required and where this is needed. Her Majesty's Government's cuts in public expenditure must lead to fewer facilities for what I believe is an underestimated and growing problem. Many of the non-statutory services, which are mostly funded by central or local government, are at present facing serious financial pressure and uncertainty. Many of their funding sources are drying up; even the aid which should be coming to them is being delayed, and they have no real idea of what their budgets for the current year or future years are likely to be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00963">I should like to say a little about the rehabilitation houses. In 1978 nine rehabilitation houses, with approximately 260 beds available, received 1,500 applications for treatment&#x2014;that is to say, addicts who actually requested that they should receive treatment on a voluntary basis. Unfortunately, 75 per cent. of these had to be refused due to lack of space. Coming back to the Home Office figures, 40 per cent. of the addicts who privately requested treatment were not notified to the Home Office. In the same year one central London hospital alone admitted over 850 drug dependent overdose patients. Based on the figures that the Government are issuing, and for one hospital alone, I find that rather terrifying.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00964">Many young addicts come from broken homes and have a bad history of home life. Therefore we believe that counselling and rehabilitation, rather than psychiatric hospitals or prison sentences, is very
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0186"/>
<col>355</col>
important. One of the reasons to which I refer may well commend itself to Her Majesty's Government. The cost of rehabilitation is approximately &#x00A3;56 a week, whereas I understand that to keep someone in prison costs approximately &#x00A3;115 a week. I also understand that last year over a thousand people who were sent to prison were on arrival judged by the prison medical service to be drug dependent. I do not wish to connect that fact with what I am to say next, but I believe that we really must question whether drug addicts or people with a drug dependency problem should be treated as criminals for possession of substances to which they are addicted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00965">The problem is becoming more of a national one. It used to be mainly centred in the South-East, and particularly in the Greater London area. But over the last seven years, there has been a 127 per cent. increase of notified addicts outside the Greater London area. Many of these addicts have no facilities available to them. Even in areas where treatment centres are available, the number of general practitioner notifications appears to be increasing over the number of treatment centre notifications. I would suggest that this means that treatment centres are not containing the problem.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00966">Her Majesty's Government must do more research into the problems of drug abuse, and treatment and rehabilitation services should be expanded. We also believe that intervention is extremely important. City Road Crisis Intervention Centre, for instance, which is a relatively new centre operating in London, is the only non-opiate multidrug abuse centre anywhere in this country. It appears initially to be very successful, yet through an uncertainty of funding&#x2014;it was originally guaranteed finance for three years&#x2014;it may have to cut back on its proposed programme and might even be forced to close. I hope that this will not happen, as the type of work that the centre is doing is desperately needed. I also believe that we must look very closely at early intervention into drug problems before people are totally addicted. May I ask Her Majesty's Government to think seriously before allowing any of the services relating to drug abuse to suffer from financial cuts.
<col>356</col>
At a time of expanding drug abuse more facilities and research are needed, not less.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00967">3.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00968"><member>Baroness MACLEOD of BORVE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords in the House will be most grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, for instituting this debate this afternoon. Those of us who have to deal with young people have realised for some time that drug abuse is an escalating problem, and I fear that it will continue to be so in the future. I personally am most grateful to the noble Earl for bringing this question to the notice of the House. However, he highlights only half of the problem, and I believe that unless Members of the House have personal experience of people who are suffering from the results of drug abuse, it is very difficult for them to realise the degradation in which people become involved due to the misuse of drugs.<lb/>
We are told by the Home Office that in 1978 13,400 people were found guilty of offences involving controlled drugs; that was 5 per cent. more than in 1977. The number of addicts known to the Home Office to receive narcotic drugs from medical practitioners as treatment was 2,408 as at 31st December 1978. Anyone who reads the relevant Home Office documents will be aware that they use the phrase "known to the Home Office", and I would submit that those cases known to the Home Office represent not even the tip of the iceberg. They do not come anywhere near the figure of all those involved in drug abuse in our society today.<lb/>
As we all know, the importation of drugs continues to increase. It increases from the Middle East, it increases from the Far East. As an island, it is perhaps easy to import drugs into this country; it can be done by sea and by air. Whatever the ultimate destination of the drugs may be, whether it is the Continent or this country, it is very easy to import drugs here. They take up very little space. For instance, the other day I had to deal with a case which involved a small suitcase which had a false bottom, which was very small indeed. The opium which it contained when it was found at Heathrow, when put on the street, had a street value of &#x00A3;275,000. So it pays; and what we have to try to do is to make
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0187"/>
<col>357</col>
people more aware, not only that many young people's lives are being ruined by drugtaking but also that, unfortunately, it is a very financially rewarding part of some people's lives.<lb/>
The human degradation that I speak of I have seen many times. For instance, I had an office near the seamy end of Jermyn Street, just outside Piccadilly Tube station exit. There, there were just bundles of people. You could not really tell that they were people until the police came and rounded them up, put them into ambulances and took them away. They were all people who had been given drugs on prescription at a local chemist shop and who were then selling those drugs on to other people waiting for them at Piccadilly Tube station. This goes on day in and day out. Until fairly recently there was a slowing down in the taking of drugs. The high point was supposed to be about 1973, but, unfortunately, because of the situation in the Middle East and the Far East, more drugs are now getting into this country than ever before.<lb/>
Something has to be done to try to stop it. But how? Most of the people who buy drugs are young people, and the young people are notoriously difficult to reach. In other words, they do not read the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> they do not read <i>The Times,</i> and they very rarely watch television. They are very difficult people to make aware of the situation they are bringing upon themselves. The three social evils that are with us in this country today, in my view, are alcohol, smoking and drugs. The advertising of alcohol is not allowed, but as we all know it can be a killer in the end. The Government, by putting a notice on every packet of cigarettes, advertise that smoking can also be a killer. But in the case of drugs it is very difficult indeed. Drugs can be taken in tiny pellets, and you cannot possibly put any warning sign on them to any young person that a particular drug could kill them. So I am asking the Government whether they could possibly find some way of advertising the possibility that a young person will lose his or her life by taking drugs.<lb/>
One way of doing it, I suggest, is this. I am sure most of your Lordships will remember that there was a horrific poster that went up on many of the hoardings in this country which said,
<col>358</col>
<quote>" Keep death off the roads ".</quote>
People were very frightened by this. It was specifically horrific; and I should like to ask the Government whether they could put something like that on the hoardings of this country dealing with drugs, because in my view that is about the only way in which we shall get at the young people. It could be something showing somebody very near to death&#x2014;which I have seen many times&#x2014;because of the misuse of drugs. Perhaps there are also magazines ill which we could advertise. I have heard of one called <i>Time Out,</i> which I think is read by a lot of young people. It may be that we could have an advertisement inserted in that.<lb/>
I should also like to see more visible means of enforcing our laws at the various ports and airports in this country. For instance, would it not be possible to have more dogs, which we are told can sniff out drugs, at our airports and at our docks? I know they have to be trained, but it might well be worth it. Then, something which the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, mentioned, I should like to encourage the provision of more places, either voluntary or under the NHS, for addicts who wish to be cured. This is one of the troubles with drugs, as it is with alcoholism: if you do not wish to be cured you will not be cured. I also want more rehabilitation units, and I think these can be provided on a voluntary basis as well as through the NHS. But, my Lords, because of the escalation of the importation of drugs they are bound to be more widely used and more young people&#x2014;those people we know; those young people (perhaps I should not say this) who are somebody's children&#x2014;will continue to lose their lives because, perhaps, we have not taken the trouble to draw the attention of young people to the possibility that the drugs they take will kill them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00969">4.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00970"><member>Baroness PHILLIPS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to intervene in this debate for one moment and to thank the noble Earl for asking this Question today. Since he has couched it in very wide terms I hope Her Majesty's Government will deal with it in wide terms. It is always interesting, when dealing with people who come before the court, not merely for drug offences but for other reasons, to observe the number of people who plead
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0188"/>
<col>359</col>
that they committed an offence because they were under the influence of a drug at the time. Occasionally, one is led to the belief that two-thirds of the population are walking about under the influence of some drug or other; and I should certainly like the Government to take this Question in its widest terms. Can we look a little more into what seems to me to be the over-prescription in which the medical profession appear to indulge? Luckily, I do not have to go to "the quack" very often, but if you have anything wrong with you these days you are offered only one of two remedies, surgery or drugs. Surely there must be a much better way to discover, first, the cause, and, secondly, the cure, for certain illnesses to which mankind appears to be prone. I would suggest that perhaps many of those who are drug dependent became drug dependent originally because they had a drug prescribed for them for some particular disease or, indeed, sometimes, for some particular pain, although we understand that pain is an indication of some much greater malady.<lb/>
I should therefore like to impress upon the Minister that this is a much wider question than the mere dealing with the drug dependent person who comes before the court because he is accused of an offence connected with drugs. Far too many people commit offences while under the influence of drugs; and these are not necessarily the drugs which we know are categorised&#x2014;cannabis, heroin and so on. I believe there is a far wider issue here, and it is something which we must look at in our time. On one occasion&#x2014;I think it was in 1975&#x2014;I recall there was an inquiry into the fact that a certain chemical company, a Swiss company, had overcharged the National Health Service for drugs. I seem to recall that the matter was raised in this House. What horrified me was not the profit the company were making&#x2014;that was bad enough&#x2014;but the size of the business that was being done; the millions of prescriptions for drugs which were being issued each week. May I, therefore, ask Her Majesty's Government to take up this valuable and timely question, in its widest context?</membercontribution></p>

<col>360</col>
of the subject at all but I was shocked by something that the noble Earl told us in his speech and which was confirmed by my noble friend Lady Macleod. In my ignorance, I had thought that the drugs problem was tending slightly downwards, that it had improved from the position of some years ago. I did not realise that its incidence is apparently turning up again now, owing, presumably, to the tremendous number of ways in which drugs can be imported. I happen to believe that addiction to drugs is the worst fate that can possibly overtake young people. It is more disastrous than anything else. It kills; and there is so little time to get the matter put right. With alcoholism there is a rather longer period to get it put right. I found the instances given to us by my noble friend Lady Macleod very moving indeed.<lb/>
I only hope that if it is true that this problem&#x2014;which there was some reason to think we were getting the measure of a few years ago&#x2014;is tending upwards, my noble friend when he comes to reply will assure us that the Government are taking it very seriously indeed and will pay a great deal of attention to what the noble Earl has told us in his opening speech.</membercontribution></p>

He speaks with great experience as chairman of the Standing Conference on Drug Abuses and he has a very wide knowledge of these matters. As he said, this is increasingly a problem and a matter which is of widespread and growing concern throughout the country. Indeed, to any of us, whether it be in the courts or in other ways, who have seen those who have been affected by it, it is a deeply distressing one, too; as, for example, the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, mentioned tonight particularly in her references to young people.<lb/>
I do not want to repeat the valuable points that have been made by the noble Earl, by the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, and by other speakers in this debate tonight. One of the questions
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0189"/>
<col>361</col>
which the noble Earl raised in the course of his remarks was whether we should treat as criminals those with a drug problem. That is, I think, a question which is receiving increasing attention in many quarters. It poses some extremely difficult problems, obviously, and ones into which I do not wish to go in detail tonight. Indeed, in a matter so complex, this is probably not the occasion to do so.<lb/>
One of the points which arise and which have been receiving closer attention in some quarters in recent months is whether or not, in relation to the question as to how we treat those with a drug problem (whether we treat them as criminals or not), to remove or reduce, at least, in part, the alternative of imprisonment as far as certain drugs are concerned. The one which has been most spoken of in this particular connection is cannabis. Again, this is not perhaps the occasion to go in depth into those considerations; but I think that at least one of the points that we should need to bear in mind very firmly in considering whether any action of that kind should be taken, would be what we should do if, in fact, we removed the alternative of imprisonment. If you remove it simply, you also must bear in mind that in doing so you remove the alternatives to either imprisonment or a fine&#x2014;which on many occasions have proved very valuable. I am thinking of such alternatives as community service orders and dealing with those convicted on drugs matters in other ways of that kind.<lb/>
It may be that a way of achieving that could be found; that is to say, not simply removing imprisonment as a penalty and thereby losing those other (in many cases valuable) alternatives as well. It is, I think, one, and only one, of the things which would have to be given very close and serious consideration if that policy were to be further pursued.<lb/>
The only other matter that I would mention tonight is a point which arises out of the Home Office <i>Statistics Bulletin,</i> published on 19th July, which is the subject of the noble Earl's Unstarred Question. That is the paragraph on page 2 which says:
<quote>" In 1978 the average age of drugs offenders continued to increase. Of those found guilty of offences involving controlled drugs in 1978, 24 per cent. were under 21 and 17 per cent. were aged 30 or over; in 1977 the corresponding
<col>362</col>
proportions were 24 per cent. and 15 per cent. respectively, and five years earlier, in 1973, they were 44 per cent. and 8 per cent. respectively.".</quote>
I think that many of your Lordships would find that trend (and is it a growing trend) very interesting, indeed. So often when one looks at this matter one is tempted to interpret it in general terms as tending rather in a reverse direction from what those figures show. What conclusions one draws from them is much more difficult; and still more difficult is it to decide how to act upon any conclusions that one does draw. In some ways, a trend of that kind is perhaps something of a comfort; in other ways, it is a very disturbing one. That is another matter which would have to be borne very carefully in mind in deciding future action on this difficult problem.<lb/>
That was all that I was proposing to say to your Lordships tonight. I would emphasise my gratitude, I am sure shared by noble Lords in all parts of the House, to the noble Earl for having raised this important matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00975">4.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00976"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no doubt that in this Unstarred Question the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, is raising a very important issue. The ravages of drugs misuse leave their mark worldwide and the figures published by the Home Office of the use of drugs in the United Kingdom in the year 1978&#x2014;which are really the subject of the noble Earl's Unstarred Question&#x2014;undoubtedly point to a pattern of misuse which is increasing. I join with my noble friend Lord Amory in saying that I must admit that before I went to work at the Home Office I was under exactly the same impression as he. I had understood that the incidence of drug misuse and, indeed, the amounts of drugs illegally brought into this country and recovered were reducing. I was wrong; and so, I say with respect, was my noble friend. I join with him in being grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, for raising this debate this evening.<lb/>
My Lords, the cases of persons whom doctors suspect of being addicted to any one of 14 narcotic drugs controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 are, as noble Lords will know, notified to the chief medical officer at the Home Office. Between the end of 1977 and 1978 this
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0190"/>
<col>363</col>
figure rose from about 2,000 to 2,400. There is reason to believe that a partial explanation for the increase of 400 last year lies in improved notification because the Home Office and the Department of Health took special steps during that year to remind doctors of their obligation to notify.<lb/>
At the same time, my noble friend Lady Macleod is absolutely right to emphasise the limitations of these statistics. They do not include those whom doctors have failed to notify&#x2014;the noble Earl certainly made that point as well&#x2014;nor addicts receiving drugs wholly from illicit sources, nor addicts of non-notifiable drugs such as the barbiturates&#x2014;again mentioned by the noble Earl&#x2014;which are not yet controlled under the 1971 Act. The figure of 4,100 addicts, which certain reporters in the media seem to prefer to use, is an unofficial aggregate of the number of addicts known at the beginning of the year and those coming to notice during the year. Your Lordships may have seen this figure; that is how it is made up, as we understand it. This figure also has to be treated with some caution since we do not know the reason why 1,700 addicts apparently stopped receiving treatment during the year. We know that 60 of them died during 1978; of the rest, there is no ready means of knowing what proportion withdrew from treatment to maintain their addiction from illicit sources.<lb/>
As the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, has made clear in his speech, the problem to which the notification statistics do not give us an answer is to quantify the number of persons who may be addicted but who manage to maintain their addiction by resort to the illicit market and who therefore do not come to the notice of the Home Office. This is something which has troubled all who have taken part in this short debate. Perhaps the most scientific indication that we have had of the possible size of this unknown grey area of narcotic addiction is contained in studies which were carried out by Dr. Hamid Ghodse into the drug problems dealt with by 62 London hospital casualty departments. The research of Dr. Ghodse suggests that possibly there are as many persons who are addicted to a narcotic drug and are not notified to the Home Office as there are notified. On that
<col>364</col>
basis, the Home Office figures should be doubled in order to arrive at a realistic figure of the total incidence of narcotic addiction.<lb/>
My Lords, just to set it in context, that means even if we base our calculations on the much quoted figure of 4,100&#x2014;which, as I have indicated, we do not regard as altogether valid&#x2014;the total number of narcotic addicts falls considerably short of 10,000. None the less, it is a terrible figure. I am sorry, but I am afraid that worse is to come. We have to ask the question: How much smuggling of narcotics actually goes on? My noble friend Lady Macleod particularly put this point. We know that in 1976 the customs seized 16.65 kilogrammes of heroin; the figure was 58.40 kilogrammes in 1978, and so far in 1979 it is over 30 kilogrammes. That suggests a growing illicit market in this country. Incidentally, these figures are of seizures by customs officers only and do not include police seizures, which I am not including because police seizures of drugs may be seizures of drugs which have come from perfectly lawful storage within this country and do not affect drugs brought illicitly into the country.<lb/>
Follow-up investigations by the customs have indicated that a great deal of heroin which has been smuggled in is intended for destinations elsewhere. It is an extraordinary figure, but it was reckoned by the customs that last year 90 per cent. of smuggled-in heroin was destined to be smuggled out again. The most significant factor this year is the substantial quantity of Iranian heroin seized between February and May which I am afraid to say we are sure was aimed almost exclusively at the United Kingdom. This of course has coincided with the period of abnormal unrest and instability in Iran.<lb/>
I hope that I have not spoken for too long about narcotic addiction; but I have done so in order to show, I hope, the difficulty of assessing the threat from the illicit market. As the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, has said, the problem of drug abuse goes a great deal wider than that. Certain barbiturates, which noble Lords specifically mentioned, often in combination with other drugs and alcohol, seem to pose a numerically larger problem than that presented by heroin. There is no doubt that barbiturates are addictive and both misuse and withdrawal can be
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0191"/>
<col>365</col>
highly dangerous. On the recommendations of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the Government have decided that they should be brought within the controls of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and the appropriate measures to do so will be brought forward when we have resolved some difficulties concerning the capacity of the Forensic Science Service to play their part in these controls.<lb/>
May I turn now to what, much more predictably, your Lordships felt was the important part of this debate&#x2014;namely, the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. May I at once pay tribute to the work which is being done by the voluntary organisations in this field and, in particular, SCODA, of which the noble Earl is chairman, in co-ordinating that work. So far as the treatment of addicts is concerned, whatever criticisms of detail may be levelled at the present services, the basic policy of providing treatment through, and restricted to, drug treatment clinics has played an important part in at least retarding the rapid growth of narcotic addiction, particularly in the 1960s and early 1970s. If the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, will forgive me, I should not like to follow her up the road of discussing the prescription of drugs by the medical profession. That involves very serious issues of medical freedom, but I take the point of the noble Baroness&#x2014;as I shall show&#x2014;that this whole matter must be looked at on a very wide canvas.<lb/>
The noble Earl has called for more research. One of the difficulties facing health and local authorities in planning services for drug misusers of all kinds is the lack of adequate information about the nature and extent of drugs misuse in their areas. A joint DHSS/NHS working party, which was set up to advise on this problem, has recommended the establishment of a network of communication at local level. The establishment of such a network would involve representatives of both statutory and voluntary organisations, including NHS and local authority officials. The aim would be to establish a system of gathering key information on local problems of drug misuse which would be of use to local authorities in deciding their priorities. However, information gathering can itself put quite a burden upon resources, so the Department is at present on the point of commissioning
<col>366</col>
research to look into the problems of simplifying local information gathering, the results of which it is hoped will minimise the task of the health and local authorities.<lb/>
May I say that I entirely agree with the noble Earl that we must continue to try to seek ways of advancing in the fields of treatment and rehabilitation. In May of this year the Treatment and Rehabilitation Working Group sent a questionnaire to drug treatment centres throughout England and Wales requesting information about multiple drug users, treatment facilities available outside London, liaison with other treatment centres, treatment policy and the work of drug liaison committees. The replies are at this moment receiving consideration by the working group and I have no doubt that their report and recommendations will be presented to the Advisory Council as a basis for further advice to Ministers as soon as possible.<lb/>
Finally, on the aspects of treatment and rehabilitation, the Government would acknowledge the initiatives of SCODA in establishing the crisis intervention centre known as Cityroads, to which the noble Earl referred, for the purposes of providing a 24-hour service to young drug misusers who are discovered in London suffering from the effects of drug misuse. This project, which is funded by the London Boroughs Associations and by the Department of Health and was opened in May 1978, is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe. Its work will be reviewed after three years to see if it should continue as part of the normal services. As the noble Earl knows better than I do, the Department of Health has also funded an independent research programme to evaluate the experiment through London University's Birkbeck College.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Macleod has called for more visible means of preventing the importation of drugs at ports and airports. Really this was what I had in mind when I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, that I took her point that this must be looked at on a very broad canvas. May I say that the police and customs, acting together, have recently brought about some extremely large seizures of drugs and their joint efforts are continuing. In one recent operation, four and a half tons of cannabis and a quarter of a million pounds in cash were
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0192"/>
<col>367</col>
seized and in another one and a half tons of cannabis. I suppose that the sum of human misery in those materials seized really hardly bears thinking about. I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the dedication and courage of the young customs officer whose tragic death while carrying out one of the anti-drug-smuggling operations which I have been mentioning was reported recently.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00977">Several noble Lords: Hear, hear!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00978"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: Without men like this, our drug problem would undoubtedly be very much worse. Customs staff at ports and airports are kept as well informed as possible of drug-smuggling trends and new methods of concealment. Mobile task forces and special baggage crews have been established now to add an element of unpredictability to the pattern of control and to enable efforts to be concentrated to meet particular needs.<lb/>
My noble friend asked me about drug-sniffing dogs. Customs have substantially increased the numbers of heroin-trained drug-detector dogs in service at ports, and have enlarged and modernised their fleet of Revenue cutters to counter smuggling by small craft.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00979"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord makes his final statement, may I say that I have sat through this fascinating discussion and I should like to ask a question anent the misuse of drugs. If the Euthanasia Society are going to publish a document to show people how to commit&#x2014;shall I call it?&#x2014;<i>felo-de-se,</i> it may be a philosophical question for some and for others it may be a Christian question about doing away with one's life. This may encourage groups of people to say that drugs of certain potency should be available. I think it is worthwhile getting on the record a request for the Government to exercise their minds over this question. It is more than a philosophical question: it has to do with the basis of, I think, civilisation in our society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-00980"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. As he will realise from his experience in Government, I am in fact speaking for two Departments: for the Home Office and
<col>368</col>
for the Department of Health and Social Services. I will undertake to draw to the attention of both Secretaries of State what the noble Lord has said in his intervention at the end of this debate.<lb/>
May I add one final point. If we are looking to try to keep drugs out as well as we can and if we are trying to support as well as we can the enormously good work done by people like the noble Lord and those working with him in this country, I do not think it is irrelevant to say that one has also to look at the whole problem in an international context. I think your Lordships would like me just to say that the United Kingdom is playing a very active part in the work of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and contributes to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control, which is trying to tackle the narcotic problem at source by such methods as crop substitution programmes in the areas of what is known as the "golden triangle" in South-East Asia and other places where the plants producing these raw materials are grown. I can assure your Lordships that the Government will continue to give really serious attention to the problem raised by the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, today. In particular, they will consider most carefully the recommendations received from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01002"><member>Baroness VICKERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01003">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01004">To ask Her Majesty's Government what action they propose to take in regard to the army tanks which were ordered by the Shah of Iran.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01005"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of DEFENCE (Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Iranian order involved the supply of over 1,200 Shir tanks. When the Iranians repudiated their contract with us in February of this year it was necessary for us to bring the contracts with the Royal Ordnance Factory, Leeds, and its subcontractors to an end. ROF, Leeds, were then left with a small number of partly
<col>372</col>
completed tanks and materials for others, which together amounted to nothing like the full order, which would have taken several years to complete. Various options are being considered for the disposal of these tanks, including the possibility of finding other customers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01006"><member>Baroness VICKERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that reply, may I ask whether he does not think it essential for our Army to have the necessary equipment to carry out their full training and duties, and would it not be possible to have some of these tanks allocated to them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01007"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Vickers, is quite right. The implications of the repudiation of the Iranian contract upon the British Army are being studied, and certainly one option includes the possible purchase of additional tanks to strengthen our existing armoured capability in the light of the growing threat from the Warsaw Pact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01008"><member>Earl FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if in the event the British Army does get some of these tanks, can my noble friend give an assurance that it will not delay the introduction of the successor to the Chieftain?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01009"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is an extremely relevant question. This is one of the most important considerations. The British Army is extremely anxious that the introduction of what is known as MBT.80 should not be delayed, should it be decided to take some of these other tanks into service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01010"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord be good enough to say whether the whole concept of armoured fighting vehicles is being studied in relation to the development of Copperhead and, if so, what steps the Government are taking about it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01011"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord suggesting that the day of the tank is over&#x2014;because if he is, that is not the current perception, as far as I am aware, certainly of the British Army, or indeed almost any other army.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0195"/>
<col>373</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01012"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I neither said it nor suggested it, but I read the American Secretary of State's Defence Statement every year and the Americans are obviously spending a considerable amount of money on the development of Copperhead, which, I hope the Minister is aware, is a laser guided weapon. If it is developed and is successful the whole concept of armoured fighting vehicles will have to be examined. I am not saying what should be done. All I want to know is whether, quite apart from spending money on a defence programme which I regard as useless, some regard is being taken of technical developments in other countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01013"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is inviting me to indulge in a philosophical discussion about the whole nature of tank warfare in the future, which goes a little wider than the Question. What I am saying to him is that, although anti-tank weapons are increasing in their lethality, so is the defensive capability of tanks increasing; and the current thinking is that you still need tanks, and will need tanks right up to the turn of the century.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DOUBLE GLAZING AND ENERGY<lb/>CONSERVATION</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01015"><member>Viscount MOUNTGARRET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01016">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01017">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether in the interests of fuel economy, notwithstanding the present requirements to cut back Government expenditure, they will consider giving householders a grant towards the cost of installing double glazing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01018"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have no present plans to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01019"><member>Viscount MOUNTGARRET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the brevity of my noble friend's reply leaves me a little stumped for a supplementary question. Surely my noble friend must be aware of the logic
<col>374</col>
of the Government giving grants to householders for the insulation of their roofs to conserve energy. Would it not be logical to extend this to the double glazing of windows, in order also to conserve oil?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01020"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I totally appreciate what my noble friend is saying, but my advice is that double glazing is not cost-effective in terms of energy saved, unlike loft insulation, and of course it is much more expensive. It would therefore be a less effective use of our limited financial resources.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01021"><member>Baroness GAITSKELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord whether the Government are aware of what double glazing costs today, and whether they would take that into consideration when they are thinking about our energy position?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01022"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness; she has really taken the words out of my mouth. It is precisely because of the cost of double glazing that we think our resources can be better used. There are still, it might interest noble Lords to know, some 5 million dwellings without loft insulation, which we think is most needed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EEC: BREACHES OF MULTI-FIBRE ARRANGEMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01025">2.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01026"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01027">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01028">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make representations
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0196"/>
<col>375</col>
to the EEC to speed up the machinery for investigations into breaches of the multi-fibre agreement and other EEC textile arrangements by countries exceeding their agreed quotas, selling at politically manipulated prices or providing subsidies by way of supplying low cost fuel or selective tax reductions, in view of the estimated three years delay in cases of flagrant abuse already submitted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01029"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no quota under the Multi-fibre Arrangement has been exceeded. The Government are satisfied that where other suppliers exceed agreed or notified levels action is taken as quickly as possible. Allegations of dumping or subsidy are investigated by the EEC Commission under the relevant provisions of the GATT. I know of no case which has been subject to a delay of three years, but if the noble Baroness would care to send me details I will look into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01030"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for that reply, I am frankly staggered by it, because there have been representations on excesses of quota, some of up to nearly 100 per cent., put by the industry to the EEC. Whatever it is called, whether it is exceeding the quota or whether it is breaking the understandings of the GATT and the multi-fibre agreement on unfair competition, there is ample evidence that goods are coming from Eastern Europe at prices less than they cost. Following the reply to a Question in the other place yesterday, the noble Lord must be aware that the American Government is aiding its industry by ill-concealed subsidies on fuel costs that have had a disastrous effect in the imports into this country of carpets and polyester fibres, which increased in the first eight months of this year by over ten times what they were in the whole of last year. Whether the noble Lord calls it dumping or not, it is not fair trading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01031"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lady Hornsby-Smith has covered a varied number of points in her supplementary question. However, she opened with a comment on quotas. It would be reasonable if I were to point out to my noble friend that, as regards particular textile quotas, under the Multi-fibre
<col>376</col>
Arrangement the limit cannot be exceeded because we do not issue import licences beyond the quota levels. My noble friend mentioned other arrangements, but where restrictions are embodied in those other arrangements under voluntary restraint agreements, we in this country are not authorised to suspend the issue of licences; but, if it seems to the industry or to the Government that the agreed levels are about to be over-licensed, then the first action that the Government can and must take is to inform the Commission. My noble friend also raised a point about one specific aspect of imports from the United States. The Government are considering that point with urgency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01032"><member>Lord RHODES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the noble Baroness has a case and that what she says can be substantiated? Is the Minister also aware that there is grave reluctance on the part of EEC officials to invoke any of the safeguard clauses provided under the Treaty of Rome? One of the principal reasons for that is the shortage of staff. Whether the action is deliberate or not we do not know. However, we should be very glad if the Minister could find out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01033"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not entirely clear about where there is a staff shortage&#x2014;whether it is at the EEC or in this country. If the shortage of staff is at the Commission I do not think that the Government can be held responsible. If the noble Lord is complaining of a shortage of staff in the Department of Trade, I would not necessarily agree with him on that score. Certainly the House may feel that my noble friend Lady Hornsby-Smith has a case. The Government are looking into it and are aware of most of the abuses. But, as I pointed out in my original Answer, if the noble Baroness knows of a particularly outrageous case of dumping I should be very glad to look into it and try to settle it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01034"><member>Lord RHODES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is confusing the issue. The noble Baroness is talking not about a case of dumping but about fixing the quotas. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether he will inquire in Europe. It is as regards the policing of the safeguards that labour is in short supply.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0197"/>
<col>377</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01035"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far as the Government are aware, the Commission is doing everything it can to invoke these safeguard arrangements, and I think the Government are satisfied that these arrangements are satisfactory. Nevertheless, I will look into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01036"><member>Lord DRUMALBYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend able to say what happens to goods that are landed in excess of quota? Is it not the case that goods are sometimes landed in other countries&#x2014;this even happens before they are actually landed&#x2014;and then they are transferred to this country, and they get in?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01037"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that question is verging away from the original Question. However, I shall certainly look into the matter and inform my noble friend in detail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01038"><member>Lord HALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the noble Lord aware that the Commission itself has said time after time in evidence that it has not sufficient staff to monitor all aspects of this agreement? Some frontiers are not being pursued by officers of the Commission at all. Imports are coming in from all over the world. Is he further aware that another factory, which has been operating in Oldham for 125 years, has been closed down permanently within the last fortnight; that there has been an increase of 6,000 redundancies in the woollen section of the industry since this Government came into office; and that the Commission itself says that it is essential that the EEC should have a viable and successful operating textile industry? Is he also aware that the cessation of the multi-fibre agreement and the erection of factories in South-East Asia&#x2014;usually with American capital&#x2014;are rendering the situation beyond remedy unless there is immediate action by this Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01039"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are aware of the situation as regards products&#x2014;under both the Multi-fibre Arrangement and other voluntary arrangements&#x2014;entering the country from South-East Asia. However, I think that that question is a little wide of the Question that has been raised as regards the EEC Commission. The Government cannot be responsible for the shortage of staff in the EEC Commission, but the Government are doing their best to assist so far
<col>378</col>
as possible in the monitoring. The Government are not responsible for the EEC.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01040"><member>Lord BARNBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend fully aware of the degree to which the very efficient wool textile industry is now being oppressed by imports and that it is causing great unemployment and distress? In his second supplementary reply he put emphasis on the quotas. Does he understand that, apart from quotas, the main pressure comes from politically-priced products from Eastern countries? Also, is he aware that the result of the pricing of oil in the States enables yarns and other materials to come into this country? Will my noble friend alert himself to the extent to which unemployment has increased?&#x2014;as has just been mentioned by a noble Lord opposite. In the last two years the way in which the high register of employment in the wool textile industry has fallen is distressing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01041"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are indeed aware of the level of unemployment in the wool textile industry. Nevertheless, the Government believe in upholding agreements, such as are embodied in the multi-fibre agreement. I do not think that I can go much further on the question of United States oil pricing than I went in my original Answer to my noble friend Lady Hornsby-Smith. At present, that is as far as I can go.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATIONAL BEEF BREEDING<lb/>HERD</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01043"><member>Baroness ELLIOT of HARWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01044">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01045">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to prevent any further decline in the national beef breeding herd.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01046"><member>Lord SANDYS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the June census results showed that the rate of decline of the beef breeding herd is much reduced, and with support levels for beef
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0198"/>
<col>379</col>
producers almost 14 per cent. higher than a year ago I should hope that this trend towards stability will continue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01047"><member>Baroness ELLIOT of HARWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply, which is certainly quite encouraging. Does he realise that although it may be improving now the decline in production of beef has been so great that it is back to 1972&#x2013;73 levels? It is very difficult to build up the national herd of beef if, at the same time, we allow the individual herds to get smaller. I hope the Government realise that this is a very urgent matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01048"><member>Lord SANDYS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government indeed realise and appreciate that the present beef-breeding herd is at or approaching the 1972 level. Meanwhile, I must draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that the dairy herd is very much at the same level as it has been during the past eight or nine years. The only matter which is under direct domestic control by Her Majesty's Government is, of course, the hill livestock compensatory allowance, which is currently under review, and the Government intend to make an announcement on this before the end of November.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ALCOHOL ABUSE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01050">3.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01051"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member> rose to call attention to the growing seriousness of the problems caused by alcohol abuse in the United Kingdom; and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: My Lords, the last debate in your Lordships' House
<col>380</col>
on this subject was in March 1975, which is four and a half years ago. The Motion was then to call attention to the ever-increasing problem of alcohol abuse, May I state to your Lordships this afternoon that if ever Is use the words "he", "his" or "him", it refers also to "she". "hers", or "her".</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01052">As a recovered alcoholic, I am often asked for my definition of "an alcoholic". I reckon that it is someone who has a totally unsatisfactory relationship, both domestically and in business; someone who suffers from hangovers and amnesia and who is absent from work frequently. If these symptoms occur with monotonous regularity, in all probability that person has a drinking problem. Since our last debate, the problem has still further increased, causing even more devastation of both family and the community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01053"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Earl will allow me to interrupt him. We on this side of the House quite frankly cannot hear him. Would it be possible for him to stand nearer a microphone? I would not interrupt him but for the fact that we want to hear what he says.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01054"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, and hope that my new position is better. This increase in the problem has been caused partly by general ignorance of the illness, coupled with a reluctance to recognise the scale of the problem. The services for the sufferer and the family are still inadequate. In industry, both management and the trade unions do not very often recognise the problem drinker. In 1975 I suggested that some proportion of the tax revenue from drink should be earmarked towards helping to meet this nationwide disaster which, let us face it, costs us millions of pounds in shoddy work, accidents and absenteeism.<lb/>
Today the alcoholic is rarely the "meths." drinker on the park bench or the proverbial stage drunk propping up a wall, although we do have a phantom drinker in the Palace of Westminster who, most days, leaves an empty wine bottle in one of the waste paper baskets in the Library. However, there is a growing awareness of the problem. That awareness has largely been brought about by action by the Government, voluntary
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0199"/>
<col>381</col>
organisations and the medical profession, as well as by the not inconsiderable amount of publicity through the wireless, television, newspapers and magazines.<lb/>
So who is the alcoholic? He is the man or the woman next door, the duke or the dustman; he is in the boardroom or on the shop floor; he is a sad and lonely figure who thinks that the rest of the world is out of step with him. But, above all, he is a sick person, suffering from a severe illness which only too often leads to an early death, thus causing untold grief and suffering not only to his nearest and dearest but also to many innocent bystanders. There are some narrow-minded and bigoted people who say that the illness is self-inflicted and, as such, it is a just punishment. It is, they say, "something one does not really want to talk about in the best circles". But that attitude only makes matters worse, as the sufferer also has to bear a quite unjustified stigma and, as a result, is far less likely to ask for help.<lb/>
In 1975 it was estimated that there were 400,000 alcoholics in the United Kingdom; in 1976 the DHSS said that there were 500,000, and since then the Office of Population and Census has put the figure nearer 600,000. As the alcoholic affects his family as well as outsiders, there must be nearly 2 million people who realise the gravity of the situation and the problem with which we are surrounded.<lb/>
I should like to give a few brief figures, simply for comparison. The total number of drunken offences in 1973 was below 100,000 and in 1978 it was just under 109,000. In drunken driving offences in 1973, less than 50 per cent. of the unfortunate people had a blood alcohol concentration of 150 milligrammes, but in 1978 that total was raised to 58 per cent. Lastly, the <i>per capita</i> consumption of absolute alcohol was in 1973 7.9 litres and in 1976 9&#x00B7;7 litres. I am afraid that I do not have the figure for last year. Those figures speak for themselves and I shall not bother your Lordships with any more.<lb/>
The Royal College of Psychiatrists commented on this upward trend when concerning itself with alcohol. It said:
<quote>"In any population there exists a small percentage of people whose drinking is on the borderline between relatively safe and harmful
<col>382</col>
drinking. However, in a population of millions, a ' small percentage ' will imply hundreds of thousands of people. If for that sector of drinkers alcohol is made more available, in a borderline of drinkers the increase may be just sufficient to damage some tissues of his body, or crucially impair the capacity to work, or to make the marriage intolerable for the spouse. A further grave possibility is that the borderline drinker will increase his consumption just sufficiently to induce the dependence syndrome".</quote>
I think that the Royal College of Psychiatrists has given us a dire warning that we are
<quote>"in the grip of an endemic disorder of frightening magnitude".</quote>
Even the Commission of the European Communities has now entered the field. A report for the Director-General for Employment and Social Affairs, Health and Safety Directorate, said:
<quote>"The increased use of alcoholic beverages throughout Europe over the last decade or so has now produced a situation warranting grave concern characterised by widespread damage to the social well-being, the economic function and the health of the population".</quote>
The report goes on to urge action which needs to be taken by member Governments in the field of prevention, and the provision of treatment services, and also urges that these services must be adequately supported.<lb/>
It is most gratifying that the last two Governments, both Tory and Labour, encouraged local services for alcoholics by making matching grants with local councils. These local councils have been more than ably aided and abetted by the National Council on Alcoholism under its indefatigable chairman, Sir Bernard Braine, and its director, Mr. Derek Rutherford, as well as the rest of his highly efficient though very small staff. But there are grave fears about the maintenance of these existing services, not just for the unmet needs in many areas but for sustaining even the present assistance, which in many cases is still not adequate. If the public expenditure cuts fall on these services it will, alas! in many cases mean no service, because alcoholism is still a dirty word and it is also unfashionable. In 1975 the Secretary of State for Social Services set up an Advisory Committee on Alcoholism, and it issued three reports. The first one was on Prevention; the second on the Pattern and Range of Services for Problem Drinkers; and the last one was on Education and Training. Professor Kessel of Manchester University and his
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0200"/>
<col>383</col>
colleagues deserve our congratulations. However, I understand that there has as yet been no official reply from the Government.<lb/>
There are five main points that I should like to bring up over prevention. First, health education designed to alert people to the dangers of alcohol and to discourage excessive drinking should be encouraged and expanded. Secondly, the presentation of alcohol to society, particularly in advertisements and the media, should be modified to produce a less one-sided picture of its effects. Thirdly, fiscal powers should be utilised to ensure that alcohol does not become cheaper in real terms. Fourthly, legal restrictions on availability of alcohol should be enforced rigorously and not relaxed until there is sufficient evidence that to do so would not cause increased harm. Fifthly, people who may be developing a drinking problem should be encouraged to recognise the problem and to seek help.<lb/>
The second report, on the Pattern and Range of Services for Problem Drinkers, emphasised the role of the primary care team and social workers in identification of the problem, backed up by specialist workers at the secondary level. I should like to give two short quotes here. First:
<quote>"We intend that every person with a drinking problem should be able to find the help he needs."</quote>
Secondly:
<quote>"People should find treatment and care near where they live, and the services providing this must be responsive to their individual needs, personal and social, and therefore capable of adapting to a variety of circumstances by providing a comprehensive range of treatment and care measures."</quote>
Having praised the report, may I say that perhaps it did not go far enough financially, but maybe this was because the shadow of economic restraints held it back. However, it pointed out that even within the present manpower resources, and with better co-ordination and co-operation between existing statutory and voluntary services, with only a little extra financial outlay a considerable effect and improvement could be achieved. But to tackle the problem 100 per cent, more money would be needed. If society wants to drink alcohol, then society should pay for the services for those who suffer, especially the families.<lb/>
I am an executive member of the National Council on Alcoholism, and the
<col>384</col>
council often finds itself in an impasse, as local authorities are often too slow or too idle to take advantages of the finance offered them by the Government. One local authority misguidedly thinks that if there is a deficit Central Government will make it up and, as a result, the local council gets no further grant aid. Somehow the Secretary of State must find an answer to this if these local services are not to suffer. Pressure must be put on the local and area health authorities to do more, but they must be backed up by a national response.<lb/>
The Advisory Committee further urged the DHSS and the Welsh Office, regarding grant aid to voluntary bodies, to review their policies,
<quote>"with a view to providing a more flexible range of help to voluntary agencies as well as continuing a modest expansion of the hostel programme. We also consider that DHSS and Welsh Office should examine ways of providing an impetus to the development of services. In particular we consider that the provision of financial help from authorities to enable services in this field to be established should be considered. Possible ways of providing this finance would be:
<ol>
<li>i. special payments by DHSS and Welsh Office to Local and Health Authorities to help establish services;</li>
<li>ii. special arrangements to authorise for the same purpose;</li>
<li>iii. active support for urban aid proposals related to those with drinking problems;</li>
<li>iv. the provision of money to help for the payment of key staff. We consider that this is particularly important as the provision of one active co-ordinator in each Health Authority could, at only fairly slight cost to DHSS and Welsh Office, provide a considerable thrust to the development of services".</li>
</ol>
</quote>
As I have said, the lead that the last two Governments have given has been most encouraging. There are now 20 Local Councils on Alcoholism. But this is only a beginning. The demands for these services grow daily. Since the last time I asked that industry and the trade unions should take a keener interest in this matter, the National Council on Alcoholism Working Party, under Sir Bernard Braine's chairmanship, has had a marked effect in this area. I understand that it has stimulated the Health and Safety Executive to look at codes of practice for problem drinkers. In fact, only last week in Cardiff Sir Bernard chaired a meeting of over 70 representatives from leading industrial firms and nationalised industries in Wales. Such a number would have been inconceivable 4&#x00BD; years ago.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0201"/>
<col>385</col>
Mr. Ray Buckton, the General Secretary of ASLEF, speaking on behalf of the trades unions, said in February of this year to the National Council:
<quote>"The specialist statutory services are patchily distributed and poorly co-ordinated. If they were used by the majority of problem drinkers they could not possibly cope. Voluntary agencies have expanded to meet these unmet needs, and they do an excellent job. However, they are hampered by two factors, a shortage of funds and a lack of co-ordination with the statutory services.</quote>
<quote>"I cannot emphasise the deep concern felt by the trade union movement to improve the situation with regard to alcoholism at work. In order to assist management and trade unions in formulating a code of practice it will be absolutely essential to convince those ordinary working men who are problem drinkers, and their workmates, that they are going to be helped, not penalised.</quote>
<quote>"They must be encouraged to seek professional help with the certain knowledge that their job security and future career prospects are protected to the fullest possible extent. We are already pressing the HSC [the Health and Safety Council] to require employers to employ or to have on contract wide-ranging health and safety specialists. The relevant specialists would play a useful role in the early identification of the problem drinker."</quote>
My Lords, I have covered most fields except the courts and prisons. The magistrates and the police must be better educated and informed. It is a waste of time and money putting alcoholics in prison.<lb/>
No doubt the Government will say that taxes are not gathered for specific purposes, but there is a precedent for special levies. The Licensing Compensation Fund was set up in 1904 to curtail the renewal of certain licences in an attempt to lessen alcohol consumption. Do we not therefore have a strong case to do the same as is done in New Zealand where there is a levy for this purpose? I have said that a society must look after itself, and our society, which last year obtained &#x00A3;2,585 million revenue from drink, must, I maintain, spend a not inconsiderable proportion of this sum to reduce the consequences that the abuse of alcohol does to society.<lb/>
The cost of alcohol cannot be quantified by the price of a pint of beer or a bottle of Scotch. We must add the human costs&#x2014;the battered wife, the confused and disorientated child and the health and social wellbeing of a once productive human being. If we are to win this battle, the greatest stumbling block, the stigma, must be removed, for it is completely
<col>386</col>
unjustified. While it remains it prevents the unfortunate sufferer from admitting his illness, let alone allowing him to consider getting help and treatment. We must remember that the drinking alcoholic is partially insane and is totally incapable of fighting his addiction alone. He is one of the more unfortunate and lonely characters in the world, despised by many and understood by few. He has reached a situation from which he can see no escape, and as such continues down this ever steeper and more slippery slope towards his ultimate and premature destruction. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01055">3.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01056"><member>The Lord Bishop of SOUTHWELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House would feel it very remiss if there were no comment from these Benches in this debate. I speak not as one who has any personal responsibility within my Church or anywhere else for any of these matters; I speak as one who is concerned as a citizen, as a Christian, as a parent and as one who in his own diocese must have some responsibility for seeing that social problems of one kind or another are studied and worked at. I am sure the whole House will be grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for introducing this debate and for the way in which he did it, with such clarity and sympathy.<lb/>
The picture which the noble Earl painted of the present situation is very disturbing. In my speech I shall concentrate on a few issues that might perhaps provide opportunities for action, but first I wish to make it clear that we are speaking about the abuse of alcohol. Like a great many things in life, what can be a joy and benefit can become a terrifyingly dangerous commodity, and some people, as a result, feel that the only solution in this kind of situation is that of total abstinence for themselves. I admire them. I do not myself abstain. But none of us can make people moral by legislation ; all we can do is to provide certain protections which make it difficult for people who are vulnerable to do what is unwise for themselves and their friends, for, as has been pointed out already, every alcoholic is a person who has a family, with many people around him, so the total numbers involved in this country are considerable.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0202"/>
<col>387</col>
The statistics published in the Home Office pamphlet <i>Offences of Drunkenness, England and Wales,</i> 1978 reveal the fact that prosecutions for drunkenness reach their peak among young people at the age of 18. The real worry today is that that problem is on the increase, and on the increase among young wage-earners, perhaps an increasingly affluent section of the population, and it is in that section that perhaps the problem is greatest. I am sure that problem drinking is the result of a whole complex of anxieties. I am told that mothers with young children are particularly vulnerable in this field, and of course this is a problem in all classes of society; what is drunk may be different in different areas of society, but I am alarmed at how much of what is called the hard stuff is drunk by the young.<lb/>
As a country we are drinking far more alcohol, and it is therefore inevitable that there should be an increase in the problems that arise from it. I am told that 1969 was a significant year in our country in respect of this problem; there was a vast increase in the consumption of alcohol because at about that time it became very much easier to buy alcoholic drinks in the shops, and this leads me to one of the main suggestions I have to make. In this country there are very different policies about how alcohol is allowed to be sold. In the City of Nottingham, which is in the area from which I come, a very real effort is made to ensure that in large shops the sale of alcoholic drinks is confined to a particular part of the shop where it is enclosed and steps are taken to see that payment is made separately from other times; and this controlled sale outlet provides a much greater chance of being able to ensure that alcohol is sold to the right people. Indeed, many stores have expressed gratitude at the tough line which has been taken in this matter, feeling themselves that they can be much happier about the control of their sales in consequence. I am sure we must do all we can to help in this way so that the sale of alcohol through the shops is rather better controlled.<lb/>
One factor in the increase in the sale of alcohol, as has already been pointed out, is the price. Twenty years ago the young could not afford to drink. At that time drugs were a greater problem
<col>388</col>
than alcohol. Today, though many people may disagree with me, alcohol is relatively cheap; at any rate it is cheap enough to make it an increasing temptation for us all. I know that fiscal measures&#x2014;increasing the price of drink&#x2014;have been considered, and in the light of the problem we are facing today it may be that the cost of alcohol should be increased as a deterrent. The fact that the sale of alcohol is big business is evident by the amount of advertising that supports it, and I am told that even in magistrates' courts Queen's Counsel are employed to support applications for licences.<lb/>
In the end, problem drinking is a personal problem on which an individual has to make a decision. As a parent I have always regarded it as a duty to teach my children how to drink so that they can cope with the temptation to drink too much, but parental responsibility is not at its highest in the country at the moment, and indeed it is well known that the children of alcoholics are more likely than any other children to become alcoholics. We need to maintain and increase educational programmes in schools and other places. This is part of the exceptional work of the National Council on Alcoholism, which has already been mentioned by the noble Earl and which, as your Lordships have heard, has over the years been trying to set up local branches. Many of these are voluntarily based, and the tragedy is that a considerable number of them may well come under threat of extinction because of a cut-back in local government financial support. In all cut-backs the voluntary field is beginning to feel the pinch, and I would plead for a recognition of the work which volunteers are doing and that it shall not be lost in an indiscriminate cut-back which disregards the quality of that work.<lb/>
One interesting piece of work, which is quite local to me in Derbyshire, is that conducted by one of the Bishop's advisers who is himself concerned with educating those who are seeking to educate others&#x2014;social workers, teachers and clergy. He is concerned about how to provide the knowledge and support that they need in educating and counselling those who are in a vulnerable position. I believe that one of the recommendations of the Government Advisory Committee on
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0203"/>
<col>389</col>
Alcoholism&#x2014;which was quoted by the noble Earl&#x2014;is very important: that anyone who is in need of help should be able to find someone to help. This requires publicity. It requires an adequate provision of help locally.<lb/>
Several suggestions which will affect the availability of alcohol are being mooted at this time. One is the Bill&#x2014;I think not yet published&#x2014;which will be presented in another place and which will affect licensing hours. Another is the suggestion that there should be more adequate provision for children at public houses, so that they are not left at home, on the streets or in the car while their parents drink. I am sure that this has much to commend it. But the plain fact is that if the constant consumption of alcohol is made easier, the problems are bound to increase.<lb/>
No one wants to deprive anyone of the pleasure of drinking, or of drinking in comfort, but I do not think that at this time we can as a nation afford to turn a blind eye to the danger signals in our society; and problem drinking is certainly throwing up a great many danger signals. I am told that addiction is much more likely among young people than it is among older people. That may be a comfort to me, my Lords, but it is not a comfort so far as the whole country is concerned. I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject. It is a matter which must not be left at the level of debate, but supported by wise legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01057">3.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01058"><member>Lord SOPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful, as the House will be, to the noble Earl for reintroducing this topic. I reflect that many years ago it was my privilege so to introduce it, and I remember repeating myself on a number of occasions when I ask the question, to which I find the answer perhaps more obvious now than heretofore, as to why it is that a problem of this size and gravity should require the constant attention of your Lordships' House, as if it has been under-valued, under-rated, and not understood. I suggest that there are probably two reasons. One is that alcoholism is an uncomfortable and unpopular topic, and suffers for the same kind of inhibition which I remember Calverley recorded in his poem about smoking:
<col>390</col>
<quote>"Tobacco is a filthy weed,
I like it."</quote>
There must be a large element of secretiveness, some induced, some voluntary, on the question of whether or not this is a problem which needs the close scrutiny of such a debate as this.<lb/>
The second reason is perhaps that there is a confusion among those who now belong to a group concerned with alcoholism, as if we are the residual legatees of the teetotal lobby, and this causes quite a number of otherwise wellwishers to suspect an extravagance in our claims today, as I think I must admit, as a life-long teetotaller, that I belong to the Band of Hope in which I was reared. It is not true that alcohol is the devil in solution, and if I may offer some slight comfort to your Lordships' House, it is my theological proposition that when the Kingdom of God comes, light wines will be permitted.<lb/>
But the problem, as it now faces those who look out upon the social effects of the consumption of alcohol, altogether overshadows the personal concerns as to the probability of Hell for those who imbibe the alcohol itself. It is in this social context that I would seek to reinforce what the noble Earl has already said so cogently. This is a monster evil, and by any calculable determination it is the kind of evil which is tending to grow, and it is the kind of evil of which there is a form of geometric progression.<lb/>
I shall confine myself to one or two additions to the statistics so economically presented by the noble Earl. It is true that over the last 10 years there has been an 87 per cent. increase in the total consumption of alcohol. It is also true that from 1955 to 1977 there has been an increase of 17,000 in the number of youngsters under 21 who have been convicted of drunkenness. I am careful to read these figures because, although generally I am not addicted to notes, I do not want anybody to get the impression that I am speaking vaguely or generally. These are attested statistics and should, I suggest, be accepted as such. Drinking and driving offences have doubled over the last seven years. What is more sinister is that there has been a progressive increase in the consumption of alcohol because of its availability and its relative cheapness, as my noble friend has already stated.<lb/>
What brings many of these points to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0204"/>
<col>391</col>
focus is the situation that now I endeavour to understand from the Government, though I find it confusing. So far as I am aware this is the position. Whereas up to 1973 the responsibility for custodial and other services for alcoholics was a matter for the Home Office, in 1973 it was passed over to the DHSS, which in turn passed it on to local authorities, though at the same time the department was prepared to make subventions to the local authorities in order that the services might be maintained. The decision has been taken to cease in a year's time, or in less than a year&#x2014;and I read with great care&#x2014;the funding responsibility for hostels in their areas by no less than 11 local authorities when the effects of circular 21/73 on funding will come to an end next year. Eleven local authorities have already indicated that they will no longer be able to support such institutions and services, and I suspect that over the next few months the number will tend to increase. It is known that there are 2,000 beds required, and I would beg to delay your Lordships by saying a little about the consequence of this particular situation as it affects those beds. According to the present calculations, the expiry of Government funding will mean that instead of the required 2,000 beds, no greater number than, say, 600 w ill be available.<lb/>
I speak with personal knowledge of these matters, having been responsible for setting up one of the complete alcoholic services in London. I look with despair, almost, on what will happen when these services are no longer funded and, in most cases, have to cease. Two services&#x2014;the Leeds detoxification service and the South-east London service&#x2014;have already been declared to be no longer available for the allocation of resources. My Lords, if you are going to do anything at all for the alcoholic then it must be upon a three-tier system: first of all, there is the necessity for detoxification; secondly, there is the requirement for rehabilitation; and, thirdly, there is the need for the kind of protective housing which in normal circumstances will prevent the relapse of the man who recovers from an alcoholic condition but is never more than a permanent convalescent. There is no complete and final recovery from alcoholism to which any doctor
<col>392</col>
would put his name.<lb/>
These are conditions which I will not harass this House by repeating or by excoriating. It is my intention, rather, in the time which is available to me, to say something about what appear to be possible and sensible plans which can be put into operation to abate this scourge. The first is that the DHSS should take active and overall responsibility for the maintenance of those hostels which are efficiently run and those hostels which have demonstrated their ability to curb this evil. Secondly, that there should be a recognition on the part of those who took drunkenness out of the criminal law that they should reflect upon what they have done. Instead of sending the drunk to prison they imposed upon him a sentence of fine&#x2014;which he was totally incapable of paying. Therefore he ended up in prison by a more circuitous route, but almost inevitably. It is a sheer waste of time to apply the fining principle to the drunk, who is totally incapable of paying it and, therefore, as I say, in fact ends up in prison.<lb/>
As to the realm of advertisement, if it is good enough to attach in writing or script to a packet of cigarettes that smoking is a dangerous habit and can cause damage to health, then I would say that it is overwhelmingly important that every advertisement for the imbibing of alcohol should be accompanied by the statement&#x2014;which every doctor would subserve and our experience would confirm&#x2014;that alcohol is a dangerous drug and can cause damage to those who do not know how to use it moderately. I wonder what would be the effect on the innumerable and, to me, nauseating advertisements on television after nine o'clock at night, which seem to encourage the belief that if you desire virility then you must top it up with constant and copious draughts of alcohol. I find this ridiculous, I find it nauseating; and I should like to see those who participate in this particular exercise being required to say as part of their advertisement that of course the intake of alcohol will be dangerous if it is taken in immoderate amounts. It is as reasonable as the somewhat ineffective but at least well-intended attempt to curb the habit of smoking, and I believe it would be an excellent way of at least calling attention
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0205"/>
<col>393</col>
to the immoderate and, in my judgement, insufferable kind of greed which is stimulated by the kinds of advertisement which appeal, as it seems to me, to most of the seven deadly sins.<lb/>
There is, my Lords, a sum&#x2014;it is over &#x00A3;4 million in amount&#x2014;which was part of the Licensing Compensation Fund. There are some who would regard this as tainted money and who would not like to touch it; but, strictly speaking, there are only two kinds of tainted money&#x2014;that which is improperly minted and that which is illegally possessed. It may indeed be unregenerate cash, but I would offer it, shall we say? a second birth. If you will give it to me, I will baptise it, because I believe that this &#x00A3;4 million could be excellently used in the retention of the services which are now imperilled and which are a recognition that we live in a society in which the Muslim argument in the matter of alcohol is a lot stronger than most of us are prepared to admit.<lb/>
May I, then, in conclusion, say a little about society. We are told that alcoholism is a stress complaint; that it is an accompaniment of "the rat race" I find it intensely disagreeable to contemplate the kind of attitude which is prevalent today that the end purpose of one's activity should be an enlightened self-interest, for in such days as these such enlightened self-interest is a stressful occupation, to be unfavourably compared, as I see it, with the community which I hope to serve. Secondly, it was said in the early days of the Industrial Revolution that two penn'orth of gin was the quickest way out of Manchester. Those who, in the last century, talked of religion as the opium of the people would, I think, have been much more accurate if they had talked about alcohol as being the opium of the people. It is my experience as a social worker that the attitude to alcohol is very often that it is a means of escape from a world in which people, especially young ones, find it pretty difficult to live, and in which many of them are denied the opportunity to make any contribution to the society in which they live.<lb/>
Alongside all the efforts which decentminded people should make in the name of Christianity, in the name of humanity, for a curbing of this particular vice&#x2014;this vice and this disease of alcoholism&#x2014;
<col>394</col>
it is at the same time not part of a Marxist doctrine but of a very sensible Christian one to suggest that, if you create a society in which there is less stress and less encouragement to opium, you will have created a society in which alcoholism will diminish. It is that hope which I cherish, and it may be that our discussion this afternoon may move in that direction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PRISON SERVICES IN THE UK: <lb/>THE MAY REPORT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01059">3.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01060"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The Statement is as follows: <lb/>
"The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the United Kingdom Prison Services under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice May has been published today. First, my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern Ireland, and I, thank Mr. Justice May and his committee for their remarkable efforts in producing so comprehensive a report in the space of only 10 months.<lb/>
"The May Committee was established because, as I know my predecessor, the right honourable Member for Leeds South, will confirm, all is not well with our prison system. But, as the committee themselves have emphasised, that does not mean that nothing is right. I endorse entirely the committee's view that we have been fortunate indeed in the men and women who staff our prison services. This does not simply mean the prison officers and governors&#x2014;it includes all of the staff of individual establishments, regional offices and headquarters. A particular tribute is due to the staff of the Northern Ireland Prison Service who have had to work under conditions of which the House will be only too aware.<lb/>
"The report draws attention to some fundamental problems. The rise in the prison population and the consequent overcrowding in many prisons is perhaps the most obvious. The committee recommends that we should pursue
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0206"/>
<col>395</col>
alternatives to imprisonment wherever possible but concludes that there are no acceptable developments which will absolve us from the need to support for the foreseeable future a substantial prison population. Moreover, there are other major problems such as the decay of many of the buildings, the poor physical conditions and sanitary arrangements, the rise in the number of criminally sophisticated and violent offenders and the consequent increased problems of control.<lb/>
"We welcome the report's insistence on the constructive aspects of imprisonment and its concept of positive custody ' with its emphasis on work, education and openness of approach. For non-violent offenders we welcome the committee's advocacy of shorter sentences.<lb/>
"The committee saw one of the principal requirements for the future as being the improvement of morale and efficiency in the prison services. To this end, it has made a number of far-reaching recommendations, confined to England and Wales, on the management and organisation of the Prison Department. I welcome the objectives that the committee has set and its emphasis on the standing and sense of identity of the Prison Service and shall have them firmly in mind in considering this important group of recommendations.<lb/>
"The committee makes a number of recommendations on pay and allowances, some for implementation straight away, and some for further consideration in conjunction with the unions concerned. It recommends that the pay of prison officers should continue to be linked with Civil Service rates under the formula which has been in operation since 1958 in accordance with the recommendations of the Wynn-Parry Committee. In recognition of the increased demands of the prison officers' job since the review by the Wynn-Parry Committee, the May Committee recommends new pay scales involving an increment of about 6 per cent. on the third stage of the pay increase agreed this year under the existing formula. The committee also recommends new pay scales for prison
<col>396</col>
governors again involving an increase on the third stage of the Civil Service pay settlement and that all the new rates should date for pension purposes from 1st April 1979. The committee also considered a number of claims by the Prison Officers' Association for the payment of what are known as "continuous duty credits", and it recommends the acceptance of three of these claims from varying dates. In addition, the committee made recommendations relating to the Northern Ireland Prison Service. The Government for their part accept and are prepared to implement all these recommendations on pay and allowances.<lb/>
"The committee stressed the need for greater efficiency in the use of manpower and for reductions in the present high level of overtime. We share the committee's view. We shall need to examine carefully in consultation with the staff associations ways in which we can achieve these important objectives and deal with the recommendations on such matters as industrial relations, the role and training of staff, recruitment and conditions of service. The committee has also recommended a significant extension of the prison building programme as well as improvements in working conditions and facilities for staff. We shall need to study these recommendations carefully, taking account of the nation's total resources and the many claims upon them and our commitment to support and improve the prison system.<lb/>
"The May Report presents all of us who are involved in our prisons with an opportunity and a challenge&#x2014;an opportunity to tackle the problems of our prison system and a challenge to build on what has already been achieved. As the committee has said, those who would turn their backs on our prisons, turn their backs on society and its values."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01061">My Lords, that is the end of the Statement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01062">3.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01063"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, for repeating this important Statement this afternoon.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0207"/>
<col>397</col>
I should like also to join him in thanking the chairman, Mr. Justice May, and the other members of the Committee of Inquiry for the thorough way in which they have carried out this inquiry, for all their strenuous work, sometimes carried out in unusually difficult circumstances, and also for having done their work so expeditiously for an exercise as demanding as this. It is true that it has taken longer than was originally envisaged, but it would have been quite wrong for them not to take additional time. I should like also to join with the noble Lord in the tribute he has paid to all of the staffs of the prison services in their very difficult and not infrequently hazardous task, and particularly to underline and commend his observations about the staffs in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
I would ask the noble Lord to accept that we on this Bench agree that time will be needed to study many aspects of the report. It is a very detailed one. It will need close examination and, no doubt, consultation with appropriate bodies including the Prison Officers' Association. But there are some things which are more urgently needed, some of which the noble Lord has indicated in repeating the Statement this afternoon. I refer to some of the recommendations on industrial relations matters.<lb/>
The noble Lord will recall the main reasons why the May Committee of Inquiry was set up originally, which concerned the very serious situation and industrial unrest, indeed approaching anarchy, in some quarters. I would ask him to bear in mind the need for some action on some of the recommendations on industrial relations&#x2014;which matter is particularly important.<lb/>
For the sake of brevity this afternoon, I would refer to four paragraphs only on this matter in the summary of recommendations on pages 286 and 287 of the report, where it is said:
<quote>"Despite the substantial fund of loyalty and sense of duty that still exists in the prison services, willingness to resort to industrial action has increased in recent years, and still continues".</quote>
It goes on:
<quote>"Action taken has affected the administration of justice, prison administration and the welfare of inmates and has, on occasions, run counter to the stated position of the POA on the limits of acceptable action".</quote>
<col>398</col>
There are two other matters on the following page to which I would refer. They are:
<quote>"Staff must acknowledge that there are certain issues which can never he settled locally, and must be for national negotiation";</quote>
and:
<quote>"The Home Office and the CSD"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the Civil Service Department&#x2014;
<quote>"should give consideration to a return to the situation in which matters of pay and conditions of service are negotiated directly between the Home Office and the POA".</quote>
There are important and urgent matters in the sphere of industrial relations which need more urgent attention than perhaps some of the other recommendations, and I would ask the noble Lord to bear that in mind. What he has said about pay, following the committee's recommendations on pay, I would welcome very warmly indeed and commend the Government for the speedy action they have taken.<lb/>
I should also ask the noble Lord to bear in mind, in considering the action on this report, that as far as the structure of the prison services is concerned, particularly in England and Wales, full weight should be given to the need to maintain ministerial and parliamentary accountability. I think it noteworthy here that the report does not recommend, for example, a return to the old Prison Commission. The report also mentions&#x2014;and perhaps he would feel that this is another significant point&#x2014;the need to improve the lines of communication.<lb/>
There are only two other brief points that I wish to mention. The first is the role of the prison officer. One of the commonest criticisms that one hears&#x2014;and it comes from many prison officers themselves&#x2014;is that they are not able to play a full part in the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders. I would ask the Government to keep that point, too, in the forefront of their minds in considering action. I think it is also vitally important in deciding on the future of the prison services to consider, at the same time, the alternatives to prison. Here I would agree with the pointers that the noble Lord has given. The report has some valuable comments on this. Also in this connection, there is at least the comment in one of the paragraphs of the Statement (where the noble Lord
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0208"/>
<col>399</col>
is referring to a passage in the report) saying:
<quote>"For non-violent offenders we welcome the committee's advocacy of shorter sentences".</quote>
This is something that my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones urged on magistrates up and down the country during his period as Lord Chancellor.<lb/>
The only other question I would ask the noble Lord is concerned with buildings. In a reference to the report the noble Lord said:
<quote>"The committee has also recommended a significant extension of the prison building programme as well as improvements in working conditions and facilities for staff."</quote>
In this connection I would ask whether or not the exemption from expenditure cuts of law and order matters applies here. In my submission, we must aim for greater public awareness of the problems of the whole of the prison services; and, given that and the will, improvements can and must be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01064">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01065"><member>Lord WADE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I join in thanking the noble Lord for repeating the Statement. I should like to join most heartily in paying tribute to the members of the committee and, of course, in addition, to the chairman, Mr. Justice May. I would again pay tribute to the prison services. As to the recommendations, it is difficult to suggest degrees of importance; but would the noble Lord agree that high priority should be given to the recruitment of staff suitable for this type of rather specialised work and, secondly, to pressing on with a new building programme? It is true that all this costs money; but is it not also a fact that it would be a wise economy to incur this expenditure and that in the long run it would be for the benefit of the life of the community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01066">4.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01067"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to both the noble Lords, Lord Boston of Faversham and Lord Wade, for their comments on this report. May I just say this in reply: although, as the committee says, there were fundamental reasons for the setting up of the May inquiry, of course the immediate reasons were the disputes on pay and conditions. The committee recommends that it is
<col>400</col>
important to tackle the causes and not the symptoms of trouble. In picking out the particular recommendations on industrial relations which the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, picked out, I would guess that he agrees with that general recommendation of the May inquiry that it is the causes and not just the symptoms which need to be tackled.<lb/>
I should like to give the noble Lord an assurance that my right honourable friend will be having early discussions with staff associations on the report's findings, not least on the matter which the noble Lord raised and on which I know the May Committee and many prison officers feel very deeply&#x2014;the idea that the prison officer's role should be extended. On the second point to which I need to reply to the noble Lord, he was good enough to note in his remarks what the Statement said&#x2014;namely, that my right honourable friend had accepted absolutely the report's recommendations about the increases in pay. So far as the building programme is concerned&#x2014;a matter to which both noble Lords referred&#x2014;your Lordships may like to know that there are five new prisons in planning at the moment&#x2014;and this stems from the previous Government&#x2014;which will provide some 5,000 new places by the end of the 1980s. We shall consider very carefully over and above that, taking into account our total resources, the further capital expenditure which the May Committee recommends is needed on our prisons.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wade, asked about recruitment. He is absolutely right: the current shortage of prison officers at the moment, as against the staff establishment, is about 1,200. However, the current shortage, if one is to do away with unconscionable overtime, is about 3,500 prison officers. At the moment my right honourable friend's Department is engaged upon a considerable recruiting campaign and we are finding that there is a response.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ALCOHOL ABUSE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01068">4.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01069">Debate resumed</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01070"><member>Lord AUCKLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Kimberley has chosen
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0209"/>
<col>401</col>
a most opportune time to debate this extremely important social subject. It is perhaps a quirk of fate that it follows yesterday's debate on the misuse of drugs. It is a well-known fact that the menace of drugs, particularly among young people, has now to a large extent been replaced by the menace of alcohol. Not for the first time the noble Lord, Lord Soper, has contributed valuably to this debate his experience of working with many of these unfortunate people.<lb/>
I have several close relatives who are engaged in the hotel and licensing trade. Certainly the Licensed Victuallers' Association are extremely concerned about the question of alcohol abuse and of alcoholism. Of course, it is a fact that alcohol abuse is the state of affairs which eventually leads to alcoholism. There are really two stages here. If the abuse of alcohol, particularly among certain young people, can be counteracted, then the dangers of full-blooded alcoholism can largely be arrested.<lb/>
It was a relief to learn that the proposal to license motorway caf&#x00E9;s and other places of refreshment has been turned down. I hope that my noble friend who is to reply can give a categorical assurance that this proposal really has been turned down. Speaking from the point of view of the insurance industry&#x2014;in which I have an interest to declare&#x2014;the licensing of these places would have brought enormous problems, particularly with young drivers who might be involved in a fearful accident which would cause not only possibly tragic loss of life and limb but enormous problems of litigation. Of course, on the roads it is quite possible for a person to drive off the motorway for two miles down an unclassified road to a public house, or even to pull into a layby and drink from refreshment provided from a picnic basket; but at least it is good to know that the idea of licensed premises on motorways is not to be with us.<lb/>
I was particularly interested in the speech of the right reverend Prelate, the Lord Bishop of Southwell, when he referred to Nottingham, because our elder daughter now teaches in Nottingham and so we visit that city from time to time. There is a particularly interesting article on page 11 of the magazine called the <i>Licensee,</i> which has been provided to
<col>402</col>
some of your Lordships today and which refers specifically to Nottingham:
<quote>"Magistrates in Nottinghamshire are pointing out to off-licences throughout the county the problems caused by alcohol being readily available in certain premises."</quote>
It goes on to say:
<quote>"And at a recent meeting of Eastwood LVA, members were told of a letter which has now been sent to off-licences by the clerk to the justices of the Nottingham and Bingham Petty Sessional Division. It was hoped that all courts in the county would send out similar documents."</quote>
Furthermore, the letter goes on to say:
<quote>"The main causes for concern are undoubtedly those off-licences which operate on a self-selection basis."</quote>
Only the other Saturday morning my wife and I were shopping in one of the large supermarkets in Surrey. It so happened that I was purchasing some wine. It is true to say that in this particular supermarket the wine and alcohol department is separated from departments selling baked beans and so on. However, I am convinced&#x2014;and I discussed this with my wife (who is a magistrate) this morning&#x2014;that the staff of these shops can rarely cover the proper supervision of youngsters who purchase a bottle of whisky or gin. I am speaking here not so much of wine as of spirits. These youngsters may say, "This is for my father", and the rather harassed young lady at the cashing-out desk has presumably to bear this in mind.<lb/>
off-licences and public houses are subject to rigorous inspection. My wife serves prominently on the local licensing committee of our local magistrates' bench and I wonder whether my noble friend is satisfied that the same stringent rules apply to supermarkets and other places which serve alcohol&#x2014;as I say, not so much wines, or even beer, but whisky, gin and other spirits&#x2014;which young people consume and which can do untold damage. Nobody wishes to be a "Scrooge" in these matters, but it is quite clear from figures which have been published that there are all too many young people who are under age&#x2014;sometimes well under age&#x2014;consuming these drinks.<lb/>
As regards sports grounds, I suppose it would be too much to expect any suggestion to be adopted that the Cup Final should be played on "dry grounds or that there should be further limitations on licensing premises at sports grounds;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0210"/>
<col>403</col>
but this may well have to come because so much of the hooliganism which is caused by a small number of people&#x2014;and I repeat" a small number of people"&#x2014;at football matches and other sporting occasions is the result of too much drink having been consumed. Then vandalism increases. In magistrates' courts the defending counsel will often plead, "He had a little too much to drink". I hope that magistrates, on hearing that, will impose a much more severe sentence, because I have always believed that the taking of alcohol is no excuse for hooliganism or any similar crime.<lb/>
We are approaching now the Festive Season, with office parties and so on. We are approaching the season when business people are under more and more stress, and all too often the bottle, whether it is in the boardroom or whether it is liberally handed round among young people at office parties and so on, can sow the seeds of alcoholism.<lb/>
Mention has been made of mental hospitals and of the number of people undergoing mental tratment through having been forced, one way or another, into this very tragic situation. A very good personal friend of mine was captain of the England Rugby XV. He started at Lloyds of London at the same time as I did. Unfortunately, he became addicted to the gin bottle, and although he was cured of that he then went on to beer and died in his late forties, leaving a widow and young children. This kind of situation can be multiplied many times.<lb/>
My Lords, I accept that this has been a gloomy speech. The debate is concerned with an unhappy but vital subject. It does not indicate that alcohol is evil&#x2014;that is far from the truth: many worthy people are engaged in the making of wine or other forms of alcohol&#x2014;but it is incumbent that everything should be done to prevent what is on the Order Paper&#x2014;in other words," alcohol abuse"&#x2014;before we get to the ultimate tragedy of alcoholism.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS<lb/> (AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES)<lb/> MEETINGS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01071">4.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01072"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES and FOOD (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>:
<col>404</col>
My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to repeat a Statement which is being made in another place by my honourable friend the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Statement is as follows: <lb/>
"My right honourable friend, who is this afternoon accompanying the Prime Minister on her visit to the Chancellor of the Federal German Republic, represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 29th October and at meetings of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 29th and 30th October.<lb/>
"The Fisheries Council agreed to set up a high-level group of officials to consider the state of fish stocks and the proposals which the Commission intends to put forward for their future management. This will prepare the way for discussion at the next meeting of the Council on 3rd-4th December, and will enable a fresh start to be made on the negotiation of an acceptable common fisheries policy. The Council also extended to the end of the year, on terms which continue to safeguard the United Kingdom's position, the existing Council decision on fishing operations in 1979.<lb/>
"At an informal meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture), Vice-President Gundelach described the crisis approaching for the Common Agricultural Policy through its rising cost and the impending exhaustion of the Community's own resources ' which finance it. There was a general discussion of possible methods of reducing the cost of the policy, particularly on milk and sugar. The Commission will be making proposals in due course. My right honourable friend made it clear that the United Kingdom would not agree to any increase in the ceiling on own resources ' or any measures intended to evade the effect of that ceiling in limiting the cost of the CAP.<lb/>
"The formal meeting of the Agriculture Council was concerned almost entirely with sheepmeat. My right honourable friend informed the Council of recent developments in relation to France's import restrictions and demanded an assurance that the French
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0211"/>
<col>405</col>
Government would comply with the judgment of the European Court by removing immediately and permanently all levies or restrictions of any kind on imports of sheepmeat from the United Kingdom. The French Minister declined to give such an assurance. Other Ministers expressed the strongest disapproval of France's attitude. My right honourable friend made it clear that this was the first time that a member country had decided positively to ignore the Treaty and the verdict of the European Court, and that this constituted a threat to the very foundations of the Community. The Commission supported the view of my right honourable friend and stated that the action of the French Government was not just playing with fire but was playing with potential catastrophe. The Commissioner stated that he would be raising this crucial issue at today's meeting of the Commission and would be recommending that they should take action against the French Government to secure early French compliance with the Court's decision.<lb/>
"There was also some further discussion of proposals for a Common Market organisation for sheepmeat, but no progress was made. France proposed the unbinding of the Community's obligations to New Zealand and other third countries under the GATT, so as to enable the Community to control or reduce the levels of imports. My right honourable friend said that in no circumstances would we agree to any diminution of New Zealand's rights. He also rejected French suggestions for intervention measures, and made it clear that we could not accept proposals for Community financed premiums which discriminated grossly against the United Kingdom, or any regime which did not fully safeguard the interests of British producers and consumers, and New Zealand."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01073">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01074">4.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01075"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have carefully read the Statement, and I must say that if I were in the position of the present Minister of Agriculture in Europe, I should have taken a similar stance. I support very much what he has done
<col>406</col>
and I welcome the Statement and the attitude of the Government on this matter I have one or two short questions on fisheries. I know that here there has been a problem, especially over Norway pout, and I saw some of the difficulties reported the other day in the <i>Financial Times.</i> I think it is the kind of problem which could easily be settled by bilateral talks between Ministers in the Council. I am sure, knowing his track record over the period when I dealt with him, that the new Danish Minister, Paul Dalsager, will be responsible on this matter.<lb/>
On the other hand, I agree that it is a wise decision to set up this new high-level group of officials to consider the state of fish stocks, and obviously we shall have to look carefully at the proposals which come forward for their future management. No doubt this will provide us with an opportunity at some later date to probe the Government on this matter. I gather that this will prepare the way for a discussion at the next meeting of the Council on 3rd and 4th December, so I should be grateful if the House could be informed of progress in this field.<lb/>
On the question of the exhaustion of resources, I noticed today, again in the <i>Financial Times</i>&#x2014;which I think covers Europe very well&#x2014;that Gundelach has stated that the Common Market is going broke. I know that some people would like this and would welcome it. I should not. I think it would be a tragedy if the Community ended with this kind of occurrence. I want the Community to work. I used to be a critic of the Community, but from my own experience there I believe that we should make it work and should make our own contribution felt. That is certainly the view of most people.<lb/>
On the question of reducing the cost of the policy, particularly on milk and sugar, as I have said, the Commission will be making proposals in due course and I hope that the Minister will be firm on this subject. I am certain that he will. I know that he has said he will and that he would not agree to any increase in the ceiling on our own resources, or any measures intended to evade the effect of that ceiling in limiting the cost of the CAP.<lb/>
On sheepmeat, which has, of course, captured the headlines, the Government's
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0212"/>
<col>407</col>
stance is quite right. I was glad that we were enabled to get at least one truck load of sheepmeat into France. We must keep up the pressure. I think that the French are very wrong here, and everyone accepts that. I am very glad that the noble Earl reported today on further discussions and proposals for a Common Market organisation for sheepmeat. He said that no progress was made. He also referred specifically to New Zealand. We must not let New Zealand down. I have said this over and over again, even when some of our own people were trying to restrict exports of New Zealand farm products and dairy products to this country. I have always&#x2014;in Brussels and out of Brussels&#x2014;defended New Zealand, because I believe that New Zealand is British in the best sense. That is not being a jingoist in any way. I hope that there will be no let down on this issue, because we owe so much to New Zealand farmers and to the New Zealand people. So, generally, I welcome the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01076">4.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01077"><member>Lord MACKIE of BENSHIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to welcome the Statement. Particularly, it is right that we are now talking once again on a common fisheries policy. It is vital that we settle on a common fisheries policy in the near future, because we have tremendous problems coming along with the applications to join of Spain and Portugal. I would ask the Government to remain firm on one matter: that we in this country control the breeding grounds in our own areas. I say that because only we have the equipment and experience and&#x2014;indeed, as would appear from the actions of some of our partners&#x2014;the desire to control the breeding grounds. In this, I hope that the Government will remain firm.<lb/>
With regard to sheepmeat, France is not being as clever as she usually is. She is not appearing to be <i>communautaire,</i> and I hope that, while being fairly firm, we shall not be too sanctimonious, as our own record in the Common Market under certain Ministers in the last Government&#x2014;not the noble Lord sitting beside me&#x2014;is not too good.<lb/>
While I admit that the end price is the important thing for the sheep farmers of this country, I hope that the Government
<col>408</col>
will not evade their responsibility for the hill farmers of this country, will look again at the compensatory allowances and will try to put them up to the maximum permitted under the EEC regulations. Of all the farming communities here who are genuinely suffering, there is no question that the hill farmers are the people who are most affected. I hope, indeed, that the Government will look at that point very closely. Otherwise, with regard to the top end of our costs in the EEC, there is no doubt that it must be done within our own resources. But I hope that if the Commission are talking again of a co-responsibility payment in milk, the Government will insist that this applies evenly over the whole of the EEC, and does not attack and do harm to the more efficient herds, particularly those in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01078">4.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01079"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful both to the noble Lord, Lord Peart, and to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, for the support and welcome which they have given to this Statement. It is a very difficult situation indeed. I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Peart, say that if he had been at the Council of Agricultural Ministers he would have taken decisions very similar to those which my right honourable friend has taken.<lb/>
With regard to fisheries, about which the noble Lord, Lord Peart, asked one or two questions, I think that the best way of answering him is to say that the whole matter is still the subject of negotiation. These talks are to continue at a very high level, to see whether there is a way of getting over the problem and meeting the difficulties which other countries have found; and, indeed, which we have found. My right honourable friend is certainly open at any time to have bilateral talks with other Ministers on fisheries questions, and indeed he has done so. But I should like to give both the noble Lord, Lord Peart, and the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, the assurance that the fishing is to be discussed on its own merits. It is not a question to be traded over or bartered with any other aspects of the Community. It stands or falls and is discussed on its own merits.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peart, said that he wanted the European Community to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0213"/>
<col>409</col>
continue, even though he was not at first enamoured of it. I agree entirely. It would be a total disaster if circumstances were to come about where the Community did not continue. It is our fervent hope and desire that it will, and these discussions which we are having are in order to resolve problems which Member States have, both internally and in relation with others. This is something which is not a cause, and should not be a cause, of a breakdown. Nevertheless, the action which the French have taken over sheepmeat is unique, is unprecedented and is undesirable, in so far as it is an action which strikes at the heart of the concept of the European Community. We hope very much that they will see the light, that wisdom will prevail, and that they will turn round and agree to conform with the judgment of the European Court.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peart, said that he did not want New Zealand to be let down, either, because they are the most British of people, in the most generous sense of the term. I agree with him. The Government are most concerned that the rights and agreements which have been arrived at for New Zealand should continue. I have had the privilege of going out to New Zealand and I realise how dependent that country is on its exports to the United Kingdom. This is part of the Community's responsibility, and they acknowledge it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, referred specifically to sheep farmers. While outside the general concept of the Statement, this question is attached to it because of the sheepmeat regime. I can assure the noble Lord that the present Government are highly concerned to ensure that the hill sheep farmers are reasonably, adequately and properly looked after and protected, in so far as it is consistent with Community obligations. I can give him an assurance that we are concerned to ensure that that part of the agricultural industry is permitted to continue and indeed, one hopes, to flourish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01080"><member>Lord WALSTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as someone who sits on these Benches and as a very old supporter of the EEC, may I be allowed to add my voice to those who have welcomed the Government's line.
<col>410</col>
I believe that they are taking a wise line, not only from the point of view of this country but also from the point of view of the future of the Community. May I assure the noble Earl that it is far better to be, as he and his colleagues are now attempting to be, tough, but in a very rational manner, over the two outstanding issues of fisheries and the import of New Zealand sheepmeat and our own export of sheepmeat to the Continent, rather than to shilly-shally and try to reach agreement on a matter of principle where there is only one question as to the right line to be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01081"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Walston, for his support and for the observations he has made. These issues are so vitally important to individual industries within a country and within countries that it is very easy for them to get blown up, almost out of context. They are vitally important. However, the purpose of the EEC is to resolve conflicts and differences. It is our intention to resolve those differences and not to make them become a point of conflict.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01082"><member>Lord PORRITT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that this is completely out of order but I should like to add my voice to that of the noble Lord, Lord Walston, in thanking the noble Earl for his remarks about New Zealand. I can assure the noble Earl that they will be very sympathetically received in the country to which he referred.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ALCOHOL ABUSE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01083">4.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01084">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01085"><member>Lord PORRITT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may resume this slightly staccato debate, first may I thank the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for introducing this subject which has already aroused considerable interest in your Lordships' House and which, I would suggest, is of increasing and very urgent importance. It interests me, too, that yesterday we should have had a debate on drugs, introduced by the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh. After all, alcohol is a drug. However, in the thoughts of most of the people who are concerned with these matters it is becoming separated from the hard drugs. It is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0214"/>
<col>411</col>
becoming separated because it is taking the major place: not in the Press, not in the drama that it engenders in various media, but in actual fact.<lb/>
Figures in respect of alcoholism are rather hard to discover and must of necessity be somewhat vague. However, I read recently in an American journal concerning the problem of alcoholism that the odds are now approximately 10 to one&#x2014;that is to say, 10 alcoholics to one heavy drug addict. How genuine that is I cannot say, but it gives your Lordships some indication that the alcoholic is getting well ahead of the hard drug addict in this miserable race.<lb/>
We are talking of a global subject. We are not unique in suffering from an overdose of alcoholism. In fact, the history of alcoholism is quite fascinating. It goes back well into Babylonian days, if not before. If one studies a graph of the incidence of alcoholism through the centuries, one finds that it is a quite steady graph showing a rise and a fall, a rise a little higher and then a fall, and a rise again. At the moment, we are on the rise again.<lb/>
If one studies its history, it is interesting to see why the fall occurs and what stops the rise. In general, it is due to two things, both equally difficult. One is an excess of restrictive legislation which is almost self-defeating. The other is the decadence and disappearance of the country or race which over-indulges in alcohol.<lb/>
As I have said, at present we are facing an increase everywhere in the world. America is suffering badly. The Continent of Europe is suffering, including even our friends in Russia who do not say much about it but who are, I believe, very seriously involved in this problem of alcoholism. Here in the United Kingdom, very sadly, we have had a sudden&#x2014;and when I say "sudden" I mean in the last two or three years&#x2014;upsurge in numbers. Even more sadly, this upsurge involves more women and children than ever before. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Soper, who mentioned adolescents of 17 or 18. It goes below that age&#x2014;considerably. Fourteen and fifteen year-olds are now by no means uncommon. I can give a personal example of this. I have a son who is a teacher. On several occasions he has had to send boys out of the room after the lunch interval
<col>412</col>
because they were definitely under the influence of alcohol after the lunch break. That is an example of what is happening.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have heard, and I believe that this is a fairly reasonable suggestion, that the total number of alcoholics known&#x2014;and let us underline" known&#x2014;" in this country at the moment is well over half a million: probably 600,000 to 700,000 people. Those are the known individuals, but the number unknown must be infinitely greater. If to every one of those known and unknown you add on their families, friends and co-workers, you have a large army under the influence of alcohol.<lb/>
I was not intending to speak in the debate, but after what I have heard this afternoon I am glad that I decided to do so. Your Lordships have heard about a number of institutions, but not about the Medical Council on Alcoholism of which I am the humble president. The Medical Council on Alcoholism was founded by Lord Rosenheim, some 15 or 16 years ago, and I shall tell your Lordships why in a moment. He, very sadly, died and was unable to bring his enthusiasm and great knowledge to bear upon the problem. However, we have gone on. We have not struggled on; we have gone on steadily and slowly since then. And in recent years, thanks to the very marked co-operation of the National Council on Alcoholism and of Sir Bernard Braine in particular, its chairman, we have made rapid steps forward.<lb/>
The National Council and the Medical Council both occupy the same building. This fact is due&#x2014;let us give credit where credit is due&#x2014;to the support, both financial and moral, of the Department of Health and Social Security, which, as noble Lords have heard, has sponsored a number of homes and hostels, drying-out homes, throughout the country. One hopes that they can continue. This combination of the NCA and the MCA has begun to produce results. I should like to say in passing that we have the very definite support of the Alcohol Education Council, a high powered body which works at the Maudsley Hospital and is therefore largely psychiatric. The combination of these forces has begun to show something really worth while.<lb/>
The reason why I wanted to speak today&#x2014;I am not being at all biased or
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0215"/>
<col>413</col>
narrow&#x2014;was in order to try to underline the importance of the medical aspect of alcoholism. This has been called, and is still called in certain places, a disease. The name was quite popular but it is probably not a very good name to put to it. This afternoon somebody used the word "illness" and I think that is a far better term for it, but if we use the word "disease" it is easier to discuss because, from a medical point of view, we can speak about the diagnosis and the treatment and one cannot treat very effectively if one cannot diagnose. Before both, of course, there comes investigation and, having got that far, one can then begin to speak about prevention, which is the most important thing of all.<lb/>
In this field of prevention, I want to stress the role of the doctor. I am not speaking of the specialist but of the average good, hardworking GP, on the simple basis that he is the man with knowledge&#x2014;or we hope he has knowledge&#x2014;who will get into the familial environment and be able to recognise early the symptoms which tend to point towards the development of alcohol dependence. That is a fairly simple statement but it is extremely difficult to do. The dividing line between hard social drinking and alcohol dependence is quite undefined and is very hard to define, but it is in that dim sphere that we hope an educated medical man will be able to help. The purpose of the MCA is to educate the doctor and the doctor-to-be. That may sound rather rude to our profession but in fact most doctors are woefully ignorant about alcoholism, just as most of them are woefully ignorant about first aid, but we try now to educate the doctor and, even more, the medical student by symposia, seminars, lectures, conferences and so on and also by publishing a journal which is sent free to every GP in the country. A marked and increasing interest is being shown by medical students, and that is very heartening. They now come to at least two&#x2014;and we hope soon to have three&#x2014;meetings a year in London and some provincial city and they hear eminent people talking to them in the morning and they discuss and ask questions in the afternoon. This has produced a great deal of interest. We have asked for a feedback and have got a very practical and good feedback from these students. This is not something that can happen in a
<col>414</col>
day but we hope that we are going along the right lines here.<lb/>
The MCA also wish to increase and improve the methods of treatment. I should like to say here that in my view there is an undue emphasis on psychiatry in the treatment of alcohol dependence at the moment. Obviously it is a very great and important factor but this is a multi-discipline trouble and it needs far more than the pyschiatrist and far more than medical people to treat it properly: the social worker, the psychiatric social worker and the clergy are all very important in the treatment of alcoholism.<lb/>
The third hope of the MCA is of course to stimulate a degree of research. Research is always expensive and in spite of the DHSS help we are not a wealthy organisation. But we are on the way. I might also mention that we have produced some seven or eight films which are not only educating doctors but also the public and are being shown amid great enthusiasm at many meetings all over the country and in many schools. They are very well done, and indeed three of them are done for schools. They are highly educative. So some good work is being done, in regard to this perfectly ghastly disease.<lb/>
Not only is the individual affected by this, as we heard this afternoon, physically, mentally and morally, but his family are markedly affected. Child battering and wife battering nearly always have an alcoholic background. The inability of a man to be able to support his home and his family leads to many tragedies&#x2014;broken marriages and everything that follows therefrom. The effect on an alcoholic's co-workers has also been mentioned this afternoon and is vitally important. Alcohol on the work-floor&#x2014;and may I say that I would include in the work-floor a surgical operating theatre&#x2014;can lead to very unfortunate industrial accidents and also of course to an enormous economic loss to the country. Here again, figures become rather mythical but the sum involved in working hours lost owing to alcohol troubles of one sort and another is colossal. There is no other word to describe it.<lb/>
If one wants to go further, the public in general are affected by the alcohol-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0216"/>
<col>415</col>
dependant. By far the majority of severe accidents leading to deaths on the road now have an alcoholic factor very markedly evident in them. Violence, muggings, and so on, nearly always have an alcoholic background. So the sphere of evil&#x2014;and one can only call it that&#x2014;which the poor alcoholic spreads is very large. That is why I say that this is a problem which needs all the co-operation we can get from the voluntary bodies. The more they can get together, the better. I have not mentioned AA, who do magnificent work. The more these voluntary bodies get together, the stronger force they will be in dealing with this problem&#x2014;particularly if they are supported, as they have been of late, by a sympathetic Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01086">4.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01087"><member>Lord CHESHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that I am any more qualified to follow the general tenor of this debate into the wider fields of the moral and social problems arising from the abuse of alcohol than I am to follow the noble Lord, Lord Porritt, into the medical field. As a matter of fact I could wish that I had been able to speak before him because what I am about to say might have induced him to say something more, but no doubt he will do so on another occasion.<lb/>
There is one point only which I wish to make to your Lordships and it is specific to the subject of this debate. I make it because I believe it to be of great importance&#x2014;indeed, of widespread importance&#x2014;and also it has the demerit at times of being, I venture to think, unsuspected. It is also something to which, so far as I an aware, remarkably little consideration has been given and again, so far as I am aware, not very much action, even by way of research or investigation, has been taken.<lb/>
I am speaking of the inter-relationship or inter-reaction of alcohol and drugs. The noble Lord, Lord Porritt, has just confused me by saying that alcohol is a drug anyway, so I had better explain myself. I refer to alcohol <i>qua</i> alcohol. The drugs I am speaking about are not the hard drugs, the harmful drugs, the anti-social drugs taken by addicts and people seeking for "kicks". The drugs in my mind are the beneficial drugs which are widely prescribed for us all by the
<col>416</col>
medical profession. We are all of us subject to many ills. Things advance, new drugs are created and, in short, these days we are filled with pills. Many of these pills, particularly in the antibiotic sphere, and indeed a number of injections and inoculations which many of us customarily have in connection with travelling&#x2014;much more widespread than it used to be&#x2014;have a most unfortunate inter-reaction with alcohol. Everybody knows this of course. It is widely known to the medical profession; but it is not widely known to us in relation to some of the drugs we are taking. We do not know whether, having had the drug, we should abstain from alcohol for 48 hours or three days or 24 hours. I do not believe, to be quite honest, that the warning we get and the understanding of it is sufficiently widespread to be of much use.<lb/>
As I say, the most obvious application of this is in driving. You do not necessarily have to be in excess of the 80 milligrams to be in a poor condition if you happen to have had a couple of flu pills as well as a lesser amount of alcohol; you may not be very capable. I think we should know a lot more about it. It may be that had I been able to ask for more information I would have got it. I shall get it in due course. I do not expect my noble friend who is to reply to this debate to come up with any answer on this because I had not the courtesy to tell him what I was going to talk about, but perhaps he will be able to enlighten me in due course. All I want to do is to stir this matter a little because I believe that very large numbers of the public are at risk. I am convinced that this must come under the term "abuse of alcohol", and that is why I raise the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01088">4.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01089"><member>Lady KIN LOSS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise for not having put my name down to speak. Having listened to many excellent speeches, I should like to refer to one remark made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell. Other noble Lords have mentioned this matter too. He said that in the City of Nottingham there is a supermarket which has a separated part of the store for the sale of alcohol. This is excellent. In Yorkshire some supermarkets do this, but others do not. One supermarket in York sells alcohol from open shelves,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0217"/>
<col>417</col>
and it can obviously be bought by anyone. I realise that purchasers should not be under 18, but it is hard to tell their age when there is the usual rush to get through the check-out. I read recently that one matter of some concern to these stores is the young, very often girls. They have very often left school only a short time before and are able to buy alcohol in these stores without trouble, since it is very difficult to say whether or not they are 18. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sandys, would consider this point and consider too whether it is possible for some suggestions to be made to these stores in regard to the sale of alcohol, with the possibility of a cordoned off area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01090">4.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01091"><member>Lord HAWKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think there is time for two minutes from me, though I apologise for not putting my name down in advance. I am by no means a tee-totaller, but I recognise that there exists an awful problem. We cannot fail to recognise it as we go about the countryside. We see young men with pot-bellies doing various jobs, and the odds are that they have been caused by drinking too much beer. In fact in talking with them you find that they have all got their capacity taped to the nearest pint, and they tell you they are men of seven pints or 10 pints a day. I even heard of a foreman who went up to 20 pints a day. That is absolutely intolerable. We all know of executives who have been corrupted by the occupational hazard of having to indulge in too many business lunches, where drink, being completely free, flows freely and is imbibed in larger quantities than is really wise or necessary. We know about the absenteeism that results from over-indulgence. We see the huge rows of cars outside the pubs every night, knowing that practically every one of those drivers is over the legal limit, but they never seem to be caught. And we know that almost every act of vandalism or hooliganism in the country is caused generally by young men who cannot hold their liquor. We do not know really what can be done about it. When such people get to the stage of being pronounced alcoholics a medical society or some such organisation may get to them and try to cure them, but then it is really too late.<lb/>
<col>418</col>
I think that there are one or two things that could be done. To start with, I regret to say, from the personal point of view, that drink is too cheap compared with the incomes of the young, particularly today. Then, ever since Lord Butler's Bill, off-licences have been proliferating all over the country. I do not know whether we could reverse that process. As for the drink being on separate shelves with a separate pay exit, I have never seen such a thing in all my life. Practically every village shop and all the supermarkets now have licences, and they certainly do not segregate the drink in one corner of the store&#x2014;for security reasons; they do not want it stolen. The customer passes through the check-out point with bottles of drink along with the groceries.<lb/>
I personally would like to see drink advertising banned from television. I think that that is probably impractical and will never come about, but it would be a very good thing. Much of drinking is prompted by example. In a television play which purports to portray middle class or upper middle class life the actors have one continual drink; if they are not drinking the one, they are pouring out the next one. And, incidentally, they do not drink like gentlemen; they pour out their whisky and drink it almost neat all the time. They do not know how to drink.<lb/>
Once I had the temerity to take part in a national health debate and I made two suggestions which found some favour. I am going to repeat them now because I think they would be quite apposite. The National Health Service is very short of money and always will be very short of money. I think that there should be a levy on cigarettes to pay for the lung cancer part of the National Health Service, and I think there should be a levy on drink to pay for the road accident part of it. I know that the Treasury have disliked intensely the idea of earmarking any tax for any particular spending purpose ever since Winston Churchill pinched the Road Fund; but I believe that in our present state of affairs. when the National Health Service is in a parlous condition, those two suggestions should be tried. In that way we should be killing two birds with one stone.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01093"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are a large number of social problems, and we might use the word "evil" so far as some of them are concerned, which do not attract a very wide audience or, for that matter, generate very much concern. They are often sunk without trace. This problem of alcoholism is one of them. That is why the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, is to be congratulated on reminding us again of what is in fact taking place. To understand the problem fully we need to know a great deal more about what is below and beneath the surface. Statistics by themselves do not give us much of an idea.<lb/>
I was glad to hear the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell speak, because it was the Church of England which, through the Church of England Temperance Society, introduced the forerunner of the Probation Service, which is a very successful public service in the country today; it arose directly out of the Church of England Temperance Society.<lb/>
I was glad also to hear the speech of my noble friend Lord Soper because I suppose that there is no-one in your Lordships' House who knows more about this problem than he does. Forty-three years ago when I was in my late twenties I was posted by the Home Office to the North London Magistrates' Court as the senior probation officer, and that post took in not only the whole of North London but a great part of East London. Either four days before I arrived at Islington or four days after I arrived there, someone who still bears the same name, Donald Soper, arrived in charge of the Methodist Central Hall. That marked, I think, the beginning of our work in that particular area&#x2014;he was mainly concerned with this problem and I was more concerned with delinquency. As I have said, no-one knows more about this particular problem than he does.<lb/>
I do not want to go over the statistics again other than to point out that in the past 20 years admissions into psychiatric hospitals for the treatment of alcoholism have increased twenty-five fold. Now about 14,000 persons are admitted per year to our psychiatric hospitals for the treatment of alcoholism and its effect. If one were to analyse the time and money involved at a time when we need all the
<col>420</col>
resources we can get to treat people for what I shall term "normal illnesses", it would give some idea of how large a part of the resources of our National Health Service is earmarked for this particular type of illness.<lb/>
The annual cost of road traffic accidents due to drinking is estimated to be in excess of &#x00A3;100 million a year. We do not know as much as we should know about the social, the mental and the physical disabilities that result from alcoholism. We know about the breakdown in family life, but drinking is so much more private today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. As I am sure my noble friend would agree, it was quite common in places like Islington to see policemen taking people off on a curious contraption to the police station because they were drunk and incapable.<lb/>
However, as your Lordships will know, not only does alcoholism often lead to crime, but it is estimated that upwards of 40 per cent. of people in prison at present have a drink problem. Even when they leave prison they are still outcasts. Mental disability often resulting in the person going into a psychiatric hospital, where a cure is extremely difficult, and physical disability resulting in serious internal troubles very often produce a person who is no longer fit to work.<lb/>
We are faced with a very serious social problem arising from alcoholism&#x2014;I am almost tempted to say that it is probably more serious than the problems resulting from smoking, gambling and perhaps drugs. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, when he says that the people who are benefiting should themselves make some contribution. The brewers, I believe, are making a profit of upwards of &#x00A3;400 million a year. I do not know the profits of the tobacco industry or the profits of the bookmakers and the betting shops, but one ought to ask oneself whether they should not be asked to make a contribution. As long ago as 1969 the Brewers' Society estimated that the brewing industry had a capital investment of &#x00A3;1,700 million and at that particular time it was almost equal to the total investment in the manufacture of foodstuffs. I have no reason to believe that it is any different at present.<lb/>
Over the last 10 years for which figures are available, drunkenness offences committed
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0219"/>
<col>421</col>
by young men have increased by 50 per cent., while those by young women have more than trebled. In the past 10 years, deaths from alcoholism have trebled; those from liver cirrhosis have risen by about a third, and drinking and driving offences have more than doubled. We are living in a society where more than one in three of all drivers killed in road accidents now have a blood alcohol level above the legal limit, compared with one in six in 1966, when the limit was introduced.<lb/>
Advertising alcoholic drinks costs something like &#x00A3;30 million per annum. I do not know what the Health Education Council receives at present, hut I do not imagine that it is much more than about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million. The Voluntary Code of Advertising has a special section on alcohol, but I would like some evidence that the advertisers take notice of it. I do not think that they take notice of it at all.<lb/>
As my noble friend, Lord Soper said, we need the same volume of advertising in relation to drinking as we have in respect of smoking. Somehow or other we must make the public much more aware of the problem. I can remember the time when the temperance lobby came out in reply to an enormous 16-sheet poster saying "Beer is best" with a poster similar in every detail saying "Beer is best&#x2014;left alone". I do not know why that disappeared, but it did disappear.<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Sandys, who is to reply, what the Government are doing as regards this particular matter. Let me say again that I am not unmindful of the question of expense, but I would like to know what the Government are doing. I would like the names of the voluntary organisations&#x2014;if they are not too many&#x2014;involved in helping alcoholics, and to know how much of their help is educational and how much goes in helping the alcoholic and his or her family. I would like to know&#x2014;a total sum will do&#x2014;how much is given by way of Government grants to those organisations, and whether the sum has been or is likely to be cut in view of the Government's policy. I would also like to know the Government's proposals for the future.<lb/>
<col>422</col>
I would like to see a Government initiative in this matter with the CBI, the TUC, appropriate members of the medical profession and officials of the appropriate division within the DHSS. It is probably not generally known, but I can testify from my own experience that in the DHSS there is a very competent group of people who are extraordinarily well-informed in this particular area. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Porritt, will bear that out, because he has taken a great deal of initiative in running training sessions for doctors and he was good enough to invite me to two of them. I think he will agree that that is something that ought to have been done many years ago; nevertheless, it is happening at present. I should like to feel that the Department had some plans for taking the initiative. It is not of the slightest use to leave it to voluntary organisations to try to generate some sort of interest on the part of, for instance, unions and the CBI. The approach must be an official one by the Government. The Government took the initiative in the matter of smoking, hut many of us believe that alcohol abuse is far more serious than smoking or, if not far more serious, every bit as serious. If the Government can take the initiative in that particular sphere, as they did with smoking, they will be rendering a very important service to the community.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01095"><member>Lord SANDYS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Kimberley for having initiated this afternoon's debate on the important subject of alcohol misuse, on which we have had an informative and very wide-ranging discussion. I welcome this opportunity to outline the Government's position on what is now widely recognised and (currency has been given to this in the course of the debate), both in its consequences and in its extent, as a very serious problem.<lb/>
Some consequences of alcohol misuse&#x2014;such as public drunkenness and drinking and driving, alcohol-related mental and physical illness&#x2014;are tangible and measurable. Other aspects of the misuse problem&#x2014;for example, its contribution to general crime and violence, disruption of family life, accidents at work and in the home&#x2014;are less easy to quantify but certainly no less serious. The problem is not confined to a small minority. From
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0220"/>
<col>423</col>
the speeches made this afternoon I think we all recognise that.<lb/>
Latest estimates by Government statisticians, given in a Written Answer in another place today, suggest that there were perhaps three-quarters of a million alcoholics in the United Kingdom in 1977, representing an increase of more than a third over the preceding 10 years. I think that that statistic is generally borne out by speeches from all sides of the House this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01096"><member>Lord HAWKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend explain exactly what is meant by an "alcoholic"? There must be some way of defining an alcoholic and it would be helpful to know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01097"><member>Lord SANDYS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have the dictionary in front of me, but the Department's understanding of the word "alcoholic"&#x2014;and I speak without the book here&#x2014;is that it is someone who is known to have a recognisable drink problem. I hope that that will satisfy my noble friend.<lb/>
When the families, friends, employers and workmates of these alcoholics are taken into account it is clear that a very large number of people in this country suffer the consequences of alcohol misuse directly and continuously. All measurable indices of alcohol-related harm have also risen sharply in recent years, as has the average <i>per capita</i> consumption of alcohol. Here many statistics have been showered upon us. I expect noble Lords have received information from professional bodies, as indeed we have, and from the trade itself. However, I should like to make one particular reference, which has, in fact, already been made by my noble friend Lord Kimberley. He referred to the report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists earlier this year entitled <i>Alcohol and Alcoholism.</i> That report stated that we are faced with:
<quote>"an endemic disorder of frightening magnitude".</quote>
I think that that is the measure of the problem.<lb/>
We are all greatly indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Soper, for introducing the subject to your Lordships' House a number of years ago, and to my noble friend Lord Kimberley for introducing the debate on
<col>424</col>
19th March 1975 and for the one today. Both my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Soper, from different sides of the House, have reminded us of the importance of this subject. We should do well to continue to regard the problem in some detail.<lb/>
Although the alcohol misuse problem is not perfectly understood&#x2014;and there is scope for further research into the factors which influence individuals to misuse alcohol&#x2014;this does not give cause for inaction. Nor should any section of society regard the problem as one that can be left to the politicians, the medical profession, voluntary bodies or anyone else. Alcohol misuse affects us all, if not directly then&#x2014;bearing in mind, for example, the economic cost of working days lost owing to alcohol-related sickness&#x2014;indirectly, and we all have an important part to play. This is especially so of those in a position to influence others: employers, trade unions officials and those in the caring professions.<lb/>
Measures to tackle alcohol misuse fall into two broad categories: prevention and treatment. I am glad that so many of the speeches this afternoon concentrated on the prevention aspect. In his introduction, my noble friend mentioned it and I was grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Soper, mentioned the whole aspect of treatment in its three-stage relationship, to which he gave particular emphasis in the course of the last debate.<lb/>
The resources for treatment cannot stem or keep pace with this self-inflicted problem, and the main hope for the future must lie in prevention. The Government have before them several sets of recommendations&#x2014;notably by the House of Commons Expenditure Committee in its Report on Preventive Medicine, the former Advisory Committee on Alcoholism in its Report on Prevention, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in its Report on Alcohol and Alcoholism&#x2014;on measures that they might take to limit misuse. Some of these recommendations&#x2014;for example, those on the taxation of alcohol&#x2014;are controversial. This reflects the difficulty in any free society of dealing with a commodity such as alcohol which gives harmless pleasure to most adults and which in this country generates considerable employment, export earnings and trade.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0221"/>
<col>425</col>
However, it is misused with very serious consequences by a significant minority. That significant minority has been measured by statisticians at 750,000 but, if we take into account&#x2014;as did the noble Lord, Lord Porritt&#x2014;all those affected, we have a figure vastly in excess of that number.<lb/>
A major aim of any preventive strategy must be to inform the general public of the consequences of misusing alcohol. To this end the Health Education Council has been running in the North-East of England, in conjunction with local organisations, a campaign to promote sensible drinking. The Government recognise the importance of health education and, as part of their general review of Quangos, will be reviewing the role and function of the Health Education Council to make it a more effective force for the promotion of good health. Health education which gives people the facts, so that they can take informed and responsible decisions about their own drinking, can address people as adults in a free society. Most people are interested in the facts, and the Press and broadcasters have been playing, and will play, an important part in presenting them.<lb/>
It would be a very great mistake if we did not mention the role which children have to play in the whole of this theme. For children and young people by far the most important influences are the attitudes of their parents and contemporaries. The Department of Education and Science handbook <i>Health Education in Schools</i> points out that the attitudes that do most to determine the behaviour of adults are established at a much earlier age than is often realised, even in early childhood, and the responsibility of parents is fundamental and unavoidable. But this handbook also suggests that the subject of alcoholic drinks might slip naturally into various parts of the curriculum&#x2014;for example, in home economics discussing types of drinks and their compatibility with food may well be most constructive as a safeguard against "excessive drinking" caused by ignorance and bravado. For older children discussions are suggested on the reasons why people drink, the dangers of excessive drinking and guidance on behaviour when in the company of heavily drinking friends. I commend such discussions to parents, as well as teachers,
<col>426</col>
concerned to help young people to decide their attitudes to drinking.<lb/>
The Government recognise the importance of encouraging school children to adopt a sensible attitude to alcohol. I have already referred to the advice which the Department of Education and Science has published in the handbook <i>Health Education in Schools.</i> The Health Education Council's Working Party, in its campaign in the North East on responsibility on drinking, is in close touch with the Teachers Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drug Education and has provided seminars for teachers and others concerned with young people. We hope to learn more from this campaign about the most effective ways of educating people about the dangers of misusing alcohol. The licensed trade and supermarkets, as well as the police, have been giving a good deal of attention to their by no means easy responsibility for preventing under-age drinking. The encouragement of responsible attitudes to alcohol in young people is a matter on which the Department of Health and Social Security and other organisations are concerned. But for all adults concerned, parents, teachers, and others, it is important to remember that example is better than precept.<lb/>
I have referred to recent sets of recommendations before the Government. These are being closely considered by the Health and other Ministers concerned, who will decide their response in due course. The DHSS has brought together representatives of the drinks industry and trade and the Health Education Council to discuss the common interest in promoting responsibility in drinking. The drinks industry is also currently revising its code of advertising practice for alcoholic drinks. The DHSS has commissioned the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to carry out a survey of drinking habits in England and Wales. This should give us for the first time a comprehensive picture for England and Wales of when, and how much, people are drinking&#x2014;and hence a better understanding of why some of them misuse alcohol.<lb/>
I think here I must pause to pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Soper, who said in the opening remarks of his speech that alcoholism was a subject which was underrated, undervalued, but not under-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0222"/>
<col>427</col>
stood. I think that here the Government are attempting to play a full part, through all those discussions, conferences, and work in the prevention field, in attempting to make this subject become a reality to the public at large. In prevention lies the best hope of limiting the alcohol misuse problem in future. But the Government are also very much aware of the immediate importance of promoting adequate counselling and treatment services for victims of misuse.<lb/>
The problems of alcohol misusers and their families are of course tackled every day by general practitioners, health visitors, social workers and others within the statutory health and social services. Specialist provision for treatment of alcoholics is also provided within the National Health Service, where there are now 32 specialist units in England and Wales and three in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, and also in the rest of the United Kingdom, treatment for alcoholism is provided in most psychiatric hospitals. I pause here because at the time of the last debate, when the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, referred to this in replying for the Government, he mentioned that there were 22 of these specialist units, very often associated with hospitals but not in all cases. It is a tribute to those who have worked in the Department and local authorities that the remit and the numbers of these specialist units have been greatly increased in the last five years.<lb/>
Health Ministers will be considering, in the light of comments received from the field on the Advisory Committee on Alcoholism's report on the Pattern and Range of Services for Problem Drinkers, whether health departments should issue any further guidance in this area. The report of the Federation of Alcoholic Rehabilitation Establishments on Community Services for Alcoholism was issued on 18th September 1979. My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Social Services was, with Mrs. Helene Hayman, co-chairman of the working party. While he cannot in his current capacity as a Minister be committed to its recommendations, he will certainly be able to ensure that they are considered as part of the total policy review. The Advisory Committee's final report, on the education and training of professional staff and voluntary workers
<col>428</col>
in the field, was published last month. Comments have been invited from professional and other bodies and will be considered by Health Ministers in due course.<lb/>
The training, education and above all improved confidence of members of the professions concerned may well be the key to more effective services for problem drinkers in the future, but let us not overlook the contribution which the health and personal social services are already making. I have mentioned the alcoholism treatment units. In addition an increasing number of consultant psychiatrists are taking a special interest in the misuse of alcohol, and developing services accordingly. Admissions to mental illness hospitals and units in the United Kingdom of patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of alcoholism or alcoholic psychosis totalled 22,000 in 1976. There is also a hitherto unrecognised burden in that research now suggests that between 15 and 20 per cent. of the patients in acute medical and some other wards of a district general hospital have a drinking problem. Doctors, nurses and social workers have long been treating the symptoms of problem drinking, and I am sure they will welcome additional information which may help them to do so more effectively.<lb/>
But the State cannot realistically be expected to meet the full range of health and welfare demands arising from alcohol misuse. Fortunately, voluntary organizations&#x2014;some with financial support from Government&#x2014;have long played a major role in this area and, as the Government proceed to cut income tax, public spending and bureaucratic involvement, it naturally looks to the voluntary sector to play an increasingly important part in helping the victims of alcohol misuse. On 15th June my honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Social Services announced in another place that there would be no reduction in this financial year in the total level of grants provided by his department to voluntary organisations. I emphasise that in reply to a question by the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell.<lb/>
Thus the Government will continue to offer support at as high a level as possible, having regard to its strategy on cash limits for public expenditure and to the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0223"/>
<col>429</col>
general economic circumstances. But I would repeat what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Services said last June:
<quote>"I do most emphatically urge the voluntary movement to recognise that its independence is threatened if it becomes too heavily dependent on Government finance. &#x2026; finance for the project work of voluntary bodies should wherever possible derive substantially from private funds &#x2026;".</quote>
Moreover, the Government believe that services developed to respond to a local need must look for any financial support at local level. While the difficulties facing voluntary bodies in the alcohol misuse field should not be underestimated, those organisations that demonstrate their value and effectiveness as part of the total pattern of services available should start to make it known that they are not just "asking for charity". They have something practical to offer in exchange for local support to problem drinkers themselves, to their families, their employers and to the local community, which until now did not realise that problem drinkers can be helped to help themselves.<lb/>
As I know that the noble Lord, Lord Soper, and others are particularly concerned about future funding arrangements for hostels for alcoholics, I hope your Lordships will bear with me if I explain the Government's position on this. Health Ministers are considering representations from Lord Soper and others that the department's scheme for grants to voluntary organisations providing hostels for alcoholics should be extended for two years. The clear agreement with the local authorities when the grants started was that if, after the initial five years of pump-priming by the department, these voluntary organisations needed further help they would look to the local authorities. Consequently, funds have not been set aside beyond March 1980 by the department for hostels already funded for more than five years. The amounts involved for the individual authorities concerned are not large, but there are difficulties in transferring funds intended for other priorities. We are considering how best to help these voluntary organisations, in consultation with the local authorities concerned.<lb/>
I wish now to explain the Government's position on detoxification centres. The setting up on an experimental basis of
<col>430</col>
two such centres was recommended in 1971 by the Home Office Working Party on Habitual Drunken Offenders. Subsequently, centres were opened, in May 1976, at Leeds and, in November 1977, at Manchester. The DHSS agreed to fund both centres for an experimental period of three years only. It was agreed from the outset that the appropriate health and local authorities would review the value to them of the centres and would be responsible for any funding beyond the initial three years. In fact, DHSS funding at Leeds was extended for six months to give the local authorities more time to reach a decision, and an urban aid grant for the centre has been arranged for the period December 1979 to March 1980.<lb/>
Although the Leeds and Manchester detoxification centres have been funded centrally during their initial experimental period, it would be quite contrary to the Government's policy of devolving responsibility down to the lowest effective level for this arrangement to continue once the centres have become established as part of the local range of services for alcoholics. To do this would mean that the Government was subsidising in perpetuity these services in a few privileged areas; that cannot be right. The Government's future policy on detoxification centres will be determined in the light both of the research being undertaken at Leeds and Manchester and of any further advice Ministers may receive on the best way of treating habitual drunkards.<lb/>
In the time available, I will take up some other points made by noble Lords during the debate. I wish first to stress a difficulty I am in; all spokesmen in this House answer of course for the Government as a whole and not for any particular department&#x2014;a very well recognised custom. Nevertheless, in respect of this debate a very large number of departments are concerned and perhaps I may be permitted to cite them: they are the Home Office, the Department of Health and Social Security, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Employment and Productivity and the Office of Fair Trading. But that may not be all because of course the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a special interest in the drinks industry, and there are others.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0224"/>
<col>431</col>
I will attempt to touch on some of the principal questions that have been asked and give some specific answers. My noble friend Lord Auckland wanted me to give a categorical statement about applications for licensing motorway caf&#x00E9;s. I can tell him that the granting of any licence for the sale of alcoholic drinks at a motorway service area is specifically prohibited under Section 9 of the Licensing Act 1964, and the Government have no proposals to change that provision. I hope he will be satisfied with that reply.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, was good enough to give me advance notice of a series of questions, and I will deal with them as best I may. His particular questions related to grants to voluntary organisations concerned with alcoholism in the current year, 1978&#x2013;79, and he wanted to know those voluntary organisations assisted by public funds. There are 59 hostels which are assisted on both capital and revenue account to the extent of &#x00A3;463,640 in the outturn. As for the other organisations&#x2014;and I will not give the precise grant for each one but will total the amount at the end&#x2014;we have the Alcohol Education Centre, the Alcoholics Recovery Project, Aquarius, which is a Birmingham and Midlands group specifically concerned with alcoholism, the Federation of Alcoholic Rehabilitation Establishments the Helping Hand Organisation headquarters, the Helping Hand Organisation Bedford Advice Centre at Ealing, the Medical Council on Alcoholism, of which the noble Lord, Lord Porritt, is president, the National Council on Alcoholism, of which the noble Earl who initiated the debate is an executive member, the Norfolk Council on Alcoholism, the Salvation Army Detoxification Centre at Tower Hamlets, the South East London Consortium and St. Botolph's. Taking all those organisations together with the 59 hostels to which I referred, the total funding has been &#x00A3;840,431 to date. The outturn, however, excludes coloration sums paid during that year, 1977&#x2013;78, and therefore there is a small note to be added to that figure.<lb/>
I was grateful to all noble Lords who raised the matter of the sale of alcoholic drinks, and I will reply in a general way in regard to off-licences, because I think this is at the root of so many of the selling problems. The right reverend Prelate
<col>432</col>
the Lord Bishop of Southwell introduced this matter and it was echoed by subsequent speakers on both sides of the House. Perhaps it would be more useful if, rather than to reply to individual questions, I were to say that magistrates can refuse off-licences where they are not satisfied with the arrangements to safeguard against the sale of drink to those under age. That provision exists for all magistrates and it is a matter which might be drawn to their attention; one result of this debate may be that this matter will be brought to public attention.<lb/>
The supermarket sections of the Wine and Spirit Association have been giving attention to preventing sales of alcohol to persons under age, and I am sure that they will have regard to the concern expressed in the House this afternoon. This situation involves constant vigilance. What we have been debating is in a sense part of a much greater problem which more specifically concerns the Home Office, namely, the subject of licensing as a whole, and I do not think that it would be profitable to continue in that sphere in the course of my reply.<lb/>
My Lords, having been speaking for 29 minutes, I feel I should draw my remarks to a close, but I should like to say that in introducing the debate the noble Earl has put his finger on a subject which involves one of the three great evils in our society which were referred to yesterday by my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve. She cited drugs, alcoholism and smoking. The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, said this afternoon that he considered that perhaps smoking was the least of the three evils. Nevertheless, these three matters will be the subject of constant interest by Her Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01099"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall sum up very briefly. I am most grateful to all noble Lords, from a variety of walks of life, who have participated in the debate. I consider that those who have taken part represent a very good cross-section of the community. I must agree with what the right reverend Prelate said about young people drinking what he called the "hard-stuff". As the right reverend Prelate said, drink may be more expensive now than it was before the war, but on the other hand wages have gone up
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0225"/>
<col>433</col>
<i>pro rata</i> and in comparison drink is now probably cheaper. I was very happy to hear the right reverend Prelate's speech. I thought it a speech of great feeling and one which showed great knowledge of the whole problem.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Soper, is probably the most experienced person on this subject in your Lordships' House, He has been dealing with it for many years longer than I have. He realises the size and gravity of the problem, and he has probably done an indescribable amount of good in relation to it. He realises that drink can be a monstrous evil, and it can, as he said, involve a geometric progression. But we must also remember&#x2014;as I am sure he does&#x2014;that to many alcohol is also a great boost and gives great joy and happiness, and if not abused is completely harmless.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to a point I mentioned earlier about fines and prisons, and he spoke about how some people who are fined for being drunk cannot pay the fines and so end up in prison. When I spoke earlier about the question of prison and the alcoholic I was not referring to the hooligan who gets drunk at a football match. Obviously the young hooligan at a football match, or in a games stadium, is a very different kind of person from the alcoholic, as my noble friend Lord Auckland, said, and it is not for me to judge here today how such a person should be dealt with. When I referred to prisons I was referring to the problem drinker&#x2014;or, for want of a better word, the "alcoholic". I was very happy to hear my noble friend Lord Sandys state that licences are not to be given to motorway cafes; that can be only a good thing.<lb/>
I was delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Porritt, (the President of the Medical Council on Alcoholism) took part in the debate because he has made a greet study of the illness, disease, or call it what you will. I thought that the statistics he gave of there being 10 alcoholics to one drug addict were most pertinent. It probably emphasises to a large degree how great is the problem of alcoholism and of how, if we are not careful, it may get completely out of hand. The noble Lord gave one other unhappy figure. I had said that I thought the total of alcoholics was 600,000, but he put it nearer three-quarters of a million, which means that perhaps more than
<col>434</col>
2 million people are affected directly or indirectly by the problem.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Chesham mentioned a point concerning alcohol and drugs. Of course there are such things as seasick pills and tranquilisers, and it is stated on the bottle, usually in very small print, that if one takes such a pill one should not drink. My noble friend said, quite rightly, that more should be done to try to ensure that the general public absorb this warning. The noble Lady, Lady Kinloss, was probably answered by my noble friend Lord Sandys on her point about magistrates granting licences for the sale of drink in shops and similar premises.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Hawke spoke about business and executive lunches. For many years I thought it quite impossible to do one's job and go out to business lunches in case one drank at great length and in great quantity. I believe that there are many people who think this. All I can say is that if people are prepared to persist and try hard enough they can have many executive and business lunches, yet still survive and not get drunk at them. I am not implying that the noble Lord gets drunk, but it is not necessary to do so.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, spoke of the ominous figures of admissions to psychiatric hospitals. That did not make good hearing, and I have no doubt that it will not make good reading in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow morning. The noble Lord made several pertinent statements, and one was particularly so; namely, that so often the abuse of alcohol, particularly among the younger members of our society, leads to crime. As has been said today, the only way that we can try to cope with this problem educationally is through the parents, the schools, and the various voluntary organisations, with the help of the Department of Health and Social Security, the Home Office, and other bodies.<lb/>
Most of the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, were answered by my noble friend, and this has made my summing-up much easier. I was very happy to hear from my noble friend Lord Sandys that the Government view the problem in a very serious and grave way. I did not expect my noble friend to answer every question today, nor necessarily to comment on everything that had been
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0226"/>
<col>435</col>
raised; but when the debate is read and studied by the various departments and by, hopefully, one or two other Government Ministers, we might come back to the old chestnut, that perhaps a levy should be put on drink in this country, as it is in New Zealand, so as to try to make the problem smaller.<lb/>
I hope that the debate has given the various departments food for thought, and I wish to thank all noble Lords who have taken part, the many who have listened to my perhaps too lengthy peroration, as well as to all the other speeches. I should like to end by saying that I have no desire to stop people drinking, but only to try to warn those who may be in peril of what alcohol abuse can do to them. My Lords, I beg leave to withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES: <lb/>STANDING COMMISSION REPORT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01101">5.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01102"><member>Lord MONTAGU of BEAULIEU</member> rose to call attention to the report by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries on their proposed <i>Framework for a System of Museums;</i> and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I should first declare an interest, as vice-president of the Museums Association and also chairman of the National Motor Museum. It is, I think, some time since this House, or indeed the other place, has had a debate on museums and galleries, and this important subject perhaps deserves longer discussions. Nevertheless, today the debate specifically concerns the report of the working party set up by the previous Government and chaired by Sir Arthur Drew, chairman of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries. Its purpose was to pursue certain recommendations made in the Wright Report. What, I hear your Lordships ask, was the Wright Report? It is in fact the report which the Drew Report was reporting on&#x2014;that typically British political manoeuvre, particularly when a report's recommendations are politically or financially embarrassing or inopportune.</p>
<col>436</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01103">So, for your Lordships' information, the Wright Report was produced by the Arts Committee of the Department of Education and Science, and it reported in 1973 with certain recommendations, mainly with regard to Government grants for museum buildings, the suggested Housing Museum Fund and other proposals concerning a national system of museum services. So in 1975 the Standing Commission was directed to set up a working party with the following terms of reference:
<quote>"To continue the work already begun by the Commission on the designation and the proposed centres of excellence and, with advice from the Area Councils and local authority and university and private museums, to produce a preliminary plan for a National System of Museum Services, as envisaged in the Wright Report".</quote>
The report on the report was duly published last January, after three years' work, and from the then Government there was a deafening silence; but I am delighted to see that the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, will be speaking later in the debate, so it may be that we shall have the benefit of what his Government's view would have been.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01104">So this is the first time that this important report has been debated in Parliament, and I hope the Government will welcome this opportunity to make suitable comments and point the way to the future. However, I think I speak for museum managements and their professional staffs when I say that the report was reasonably well received and met with general approval. The important exception was perhaps the concern expressed by specialist curatorial groups, who are worried about the maintenance of adequate standards for their collections in the future. But it could be hoped&#x2014;and, indeed, I believe the Standing Commission has already assumed&#x2014;that the report has been or will be agreed by Government in principle, although it is most unlikely that there will be any new money to implement some of the recommendations. I think it is agreed by all that it is most important that the working party's report should not be shelved because of lack of finance. It indeed sets guidelines for generations to come, and I believe that all planning for museums should be based on this report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01105">My Lords, there were in fact 39 separate recommendations which covered subjects
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0227"/>
<col>437</col>
ranging from direct Government grants for major capital works to house or rehouse major collections, to the setting up of county museum consultative committees, the widening of the functions of area museums councils, the need for the national museums to accept a positive responsibility towards provincial museums, the request for better training and so on. But, in my reckoning, of the 39 recommendations as many as 22 can be implemented immediately without any new money. I believe it is clearly the Government's duty to encourage the Standing Commission to seek ways to implement these no-cost recommendations and to give support to this example of self-help.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01106">Of course, two of the most important recommendations were, first, the need for designation of outstanding museums outside London. This, of course, I recognise, will cost money, but this money should come from the key-sector expenditure. The second most important recommendation was the setting up of a museums council which would advise the Standing Commission on all matters referred to it and which would also be able to initiate matters for consideration by the Standing Commission. This council would indeed represent all museums in this country, including national, provincial, private, service and university museums, as well as including members of the Museums Association representing the profession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01107">Since at the moment there is no opportunity for the profession to express their ideas collectively, I have no doubt that such a body would perform a very useful function and would remove the feeling at the moment that the Standing Commission, because of its terms of reference, is sometimes rather remote from what is going on outside the national museums. I do not in fact believe that this is true, but, on the assumption that the Government would be unwilling to create and finance a new Quango, I am glad to report that the Standing Commission has already started meetings with the directors of the national museums, the council of the Museums Association and other interested bodies in order to establish a continuing dialogue with them. These regular meetings are being organised by the Standing Commission, using its own existing, admittedly slender, resources; and I think these meetings will
<col>438</col>
in the meantime act as a national forum for all museum interests, and will help the Commission to represent its views to Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01108">My Lords, perhaps this is an appropriate moment for me to remind the House that the Standing Commission was set up in the 1930s to advise on the development of national museums and co-operation between the national and provincial museums. Nevertheless, the Standing Commission is the supreme and only body representing the rest of the museums and their interests. Today, many feel&#x2014;and I think the Standing Commission itself agrees&#x2014;that perhaps neither the composition nor the powers of the Standing Commission are absolutely right for this last part of the 20th century, and should be looked at urgently. However, I do not believe that the setting up of a museums council should in fact be considered as another Quango, for, as I have said, it could initially be the existing, democratically-elected council of the Museums Association, which has been in existence since 1890; and this council could perhaps be augmented when necessary to represent every constituent interest, not forgetting the private sector. I am asking tonight, therefore, that if the Government cannot immediately agree to the setting up of a museums council then at least they should bless the idea that the Standing Commission and the council of the Museums Association should regularise their relationship, perhaps in preparation for the day when an official marriage can be arranged, as is the case in other Commonwealth countries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01109">My Lords, many of the no-cost recommendations relate to the services provided by the area museum councils. I believe that their functions can be widened without further increasing overheads. At the moment, the most important way in which the area museum councils are helping the many smaller museums in their area is by co-ordinating and encouraging the leading local museums to provide curatorial and conservation advice to museums where such expertise is lacking. Other recommendations are, I think, uncontroversial and sensible, but I believe that area councils would operate more effectively if they operated at arm's length from local politics. There is at the moment a disturbing trend that local politicians are getting too involved and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0228"/>
<col>439</col>
the policy towards museums is becoming a political football.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01110">With regard to the general raising of standards of museums in this country, I am glad that the Museums Association is carrying out its accreditation scheme, and it should be encouraged to develop this as soon as possible. There were, of course, a lot of other recommendations in the Drew Report: that there should be county-wide museum consultative committees representing all museum interests; that university museums should form joint committees with local authorities; that the museums of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force should continue to receive support from the Ministry of Defence; and&#x2014;a particular item in the Drew Report&#x2014;that special attention should be given to the development of the exceptional possibilities offered in the Portsmouth area for a Royal Naval Museum. With the running down of Portsmouth, this once great naval base offers an ideal opportunity and an ideal site such as few nations have to display everything, from the recently-discovered Tudor warship "Mary Rose", through the "Victory", the "Foudroyant" and up to the most recently acquired "Bulwark", not forgetting the historic naval docks and workshops.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01111">One question which has been a great source of worry to museums for some years is the indemnity arrangements. I know how much the proposed new indemnity arrangements with regard to objects on loan from provincial museums have been welcomed. However, many feel very strongly that there should be a further extension of the Treasury indemnity system to cover loans from whatever source, including private to provincial, university or any museum whose security systems are judged adequate. So far as I am aware, there have been very few claims on public revenue for losses or damage over the past years, and I am certain that increased indemnity would go a long way to encourage the movement of artefacts and make them more accessible to the public outside the national museums. It is also particularly vital that indemnification will cover an object accepted in lieu of capital transfer tax but left <i>in situ</i> where it has spent many centuries and is closely associated with the site or the family who originally owned it.</p>
<col>440</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01112">So, my Lords, here we have this important report, much of which can be implemented, I think, without further cost. Nevertheless, it should be stated that the financial implications to the Treasury represent only a meagre &#x00A3;6 million a year&#x2014;a sum which would revolutionise the museum scene in this country over the next ten years and would only then bring British museums up to the level of spending of other museums in the western world. The fact that it represents the same sort of money spent annually on military bands or on the military mission in Washington is perhaps irrelevant; and I am not so naive not to realise that in the present environment and political climate asking for money is rather like being Oliver Twist.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01113">However, there are ways out of this dilemma. The Government are rightly preaching and backing a policy of self-help, and perhaps one of the brightest aspects of the museum scene in Britain has been the successful growth since the war of the independent and private museums. The Association of Independent Museums, founded only two years ago, now has about 200 members and, so far as I know, they are all viable; and, almost without exception, one of their members has been awarded the first prize in the Museum of the Year Award in recent years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01114">My Lords, perhaps one should ask why. Is it because their independence leads them not only to greater flexibility but, more important, makes them financially independent, too? Unfettered by politics or lack of rate support grants, perhaps they are more sensitive to what the public wants and what interests the tourists&#x2014;for otherwise they would fail. I am now expressing a personal opinion and not one of the Museums' Association when I say that I think an immense amount could be achieved, particularly in the non-national museums, if a sensible and universal charging system were introduced with suitable exemptions for children and old age pensioners. Local authorities already have that power and I find it strange how many councils apparently are prepared to see their museums suffer with regard to purchase grants, deteriorate with regard to maintenance and allow their museum staffs' pay to fall badly behind that of other
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0229"/>
<col>441</col>
professions&#x2014;all sacrificed on the altar of the principle of free museums. I believe that we are virtually the only country in the world now that practises such (what one might call) an archaic 19th century religion. It is certainly not practised in Eastern Europe or in the richer countries such as the United States.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01115">There is also an unfortunate trend in some local authorities of making their museum directors answerable to the authorities' directors of leisure&#x2014;whose knowledge or experience of museums is often nil. Hence, museums do not always get a voice on committees or the access to their chairmen which they deserve. It is inevitable, if a council has to choose between building a new swimming pool for the kids, an incinerator to burn the rubbish, raising their own staff salaries or voting more money to the local museum, that, unfortunately, it is always the museum that comes off worse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01116">If, however, museums can cash in on the leisure age and tourism, they can still easily stand on their own feet if allowed to keep the money they earn, and also would become much stronger and contribute much more to the preservation of the country's heritage. Unfortunately, one must accept the fact that charging at museums became such a political hot potato back in 1974 that it is natural that any government would feel reluctant to raise the subject again. I hope that the present Minister for the Arts will not take a scare from this. I am delighted that a past Minister of the Arts, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, will be speaking later and I feel that his efforts will one day be more recognised than they then were. Many of us feel that the political opportunism of that time which produced the cancellation did a great deal more harm than good.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01117">However, I have some encouraging news for the Government. It is that since 1974 there has been a major reassessment by the museum profession of this problem. I believe that the climate has changed and that museum charges, if imposed now, far from being greeted in a hostile fashion, would be welcomed by a large majority of the museum directors of this country. I am delighted that Exeter Council have given the lead and will be charging at their local museums next
<col>442</col>
year. Perhaps they see that such a policy must inevitably come; and the sooner it comes, the better. The alternative must inevitably be a general deterioration of museums, a growing inability to purchase new exhibits and save important items from leaving this country, the running down of services to the public, a failing in their conservation responsibilities and sacrificing the career prospects of their staffs. We know how unpopular is Sunday morning closing and closing one day a week. What will happen next year if this goes on? Will there be closing for the whole of Sundays and, perhaps, two days a week? Who knows?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01118">I can assure the House that, much as overseas visitors enjoy our free museums, at the same time many despise us for such a short-sighted and stupid policy which leads to so many of our national treasures being lost overseas through lack of proper finance. In America and in Canada the tax system annually enriches and encourages museum endowment. I believe that the Government have already committed themselves to review this policy and I am sure that we all look forward to hearing their decision.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01119">However, enough on that subject. There are many other distinguished speakers this evening. I will end by saying that I hope the Government will accept the Drew Report in principle. It is not a rigid or long-term comprehensive plan. The object of the report is to point ways to improve local museums and to enable them to receive the enormous number of visitors and tourists to this country as well as our own people, especially the children. My Lords, to sum up, I urge the Government to consider seriously four main points in addition to the various no-cost recommendations in the Drew Report: first, the encouragement of the Council of the Museums' Association to develop and act as a representative body of the museum world pending the setting up of the official council; secondly, to reform the tax system to that it may benefit museums and galleries of all sorts; thirdly, to extend the indemnification system so that national, provincial and private treasures can be more widely seen by the public; and, fourthly, to do all they can to encourage local government to make their museums self-supporting&#x2014;but to make it clear that that money should be used further to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0230"/>
<col>443</col>
improve the expenditure for museums in their areas. For such museums are just as much part of our heritage as are our historic houses and castles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01120">My Lords, the difficulties should not be exaggerated. The report only proposes further steps down the path which has already been trodden profitably. With regard to new finance, in most cases the recommendations say that Government should not be called upon for all but only part of the cost. In any case, expenditure will take many years. Therefore, a clear statement of policy is now required in order to make a start. For Heaven's sake! do not let us have another report on this report. The time for some action has clearly arrived. The right action will have a long-term benefit for our museums and galleries and for the nation as a whole. I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01121">6.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01122"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my first pleasant task is to thank the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, for raising this vital issue, <i>Framework for a system of museums,</i> the report of the working party of Sir Arthur Drew and his team. Having been a member of commissions and committees a number of times over the years, I know how much hard work has gone into the production of the report. I wish to join the noble Lord who has just sat down in paying tribute to the Drew working party's report, particularly for its reference to and derivation from the 1973 Wright report.<lb/>
Why have I taken part in this debate, my Lords? I have always been interested in museums. I have to declare an interest: I happen to be the president of the Chatterley Whitfield Mining Museum Trust. As this is only a two-and-a-half hour debate, and in order not to suffocate in a blizzard of verbiage, the Minister who is going to reply, I have sent him what I was going to say together with letters from some of the departments that wrote to us. Therefore I will not bore the House by reading paragraphs that may be vital to my musuem but which will be deadly boring read out at this time of
<col>444</col>
night when the entire debate has to finish in two-and-a-half hours. Having said that, may I add that any Member who would like to know about the Chatterley Whitfield Mining Museum can receive a brochure from me, with pleasure. We have as vice-presidents Sir Derek Ezra, Joe Gormley&#x2014;bless his heart!&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Norton, Sir Peter Parker, the noble Lord, Lord Sandford, and the Lord Mayor of the City of Stoke-on-Trent. Here is my opportunity to pay tribute to the citizens and the council of the city of Stoke-on-Trent, together with the county.<lb/>
Now I will begin what I want to say. The Chatterley Whitfield Mining Museum is administered by an independent charitable trust whose objective is to take advantage of the unique opportunity offered by a common or garden pit or colliery. It was made famous by Eliza Hermitage who, at the magnificent age of 101, was taken to our pit. We took the dear old lady down 700 feet to see the workings of a colliery and she got a lump of coal out for herself. Her next ambition&#x2014;and here the Government can help&#x2014;is to travel on Concorde.<lb/>
I say to the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, that this is a thrust into the industrial archaeology of the future, showing Britain, not as a nation of shopkeepers, but as the workshop of the world. We were made the workshop of the world because of the coal that we had. This site covers 18 acres and is adjacent to the city of Stoke-on-Trent. We are grateful to the Department of the Environment and to others for the recent land reclamation schemes that include also some significant buildings and plant and machinery, all of vital importance to the task of restoration.<lb/>
Every aspect of mining activity will be displayed to the public on the surface. But it is the retention of shafts and the underground workings&#x2014;and the winding of the colliery&#x2014;which allows the museum to present the story of coal in its full, realistic dimension of dynamic vitality. Coal was the basis of our prosperity and we should keep this alive and have an understanding of it. In the sphere of education particularly, this museum is unique, and it makes the museum of national rather than local importance.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0231"/>
<col>445</col>
Having opened only at the end of May 1979, the museum has already received over 20,000 visitors. Half of those visitors&#x2014;10,000&#x2014;were students and the remainder came from home and abroad. There were Dutch and Norwegian buses there the other day. The Foreign Office even sent some Russians to have a look at our pits. I have seen Russian pits and they can be proud of them. The nature of the project means that the costs are high. Work on the capital appeal is well advanced. Over &#x00A3;200,000 has so far been committed to the project by the National Coal Board, the local authority, the Department of the Environment and industry and commerce. We have not called on the Government and gone weeping; we have endeavoured to collect whatever we can. Now we are seeking further commitments and we shall ask the unions and the mining industry; and maybe we shall want to tell the Government how they can help. If the noble Lord who is to reply cannot answer all the questions&#x2014;and it would not be fair to expect him to do so&#x2014;and if his officials feel that there is something in depth that they could tell me, perhaps they would write to me, as the debate must be brief. Even if they pr&#x00E9;cis the answer in only a dozen sentences, that will be helpful.<lb/>
On 25th March 1977 Chatterley Whitfield Colliery, which was the first in Britain to mine one million tons of coal a year, closed after 140 years of production. There is nothing like this pit as a museum in the whole of Europe. It is the first museum of its kind. There are others that call themselves mining museums but they do not have a pit, a winder and a shaft with the fans going, with the different kinds of mining and the conveyor belt system. Britain's emergence as a manufacturing country was dependent on coal, which continues&#x2014;and will for more centuries than one&#x2014;to be needed to boost our economy, even if only for the ultimate derivation of valuable material from the coal itself.<lb/>
A social, historical and technical study of mining is still of importance. This museum provides a vivid picture of the industry. The younger generation who visit it and who go down the shaft some 700 feet to see the different historic ways of mining will always remember it and be glad that they visited it. The Minister
<col>446</col>
will see from the brief which I handed in for his information what this unique and excellent project offers. There he will find a long list of attributes of the museum: educational visits for schools, colleges and parties. Any child above 12 years of age can go down that mine. The noble Lord will see from the map on page 74 of the Drew Report that there are some 8 million people in the Midlands area. The mining area of Chatterley Whitfield serves the whole of that.<lb/>
Reference has been made to tourism. Does this noble House realise that last year 12&#x00BD; million people visited Britain and spent &#x00A3;3,500 million? That is more money than from the export of our motorcars, more money than from the export of our steel or even coal. Instead of "yammering" for the juggernaut industry to have acres and acres of farmland dug up so that they can run, like neurotic ants from one end of Britain to the other, let us get back on the railways, calm down and keep the delightful equanimity of the British countryside so far as we can. It is our last asset. As Bernard Shaw said in a preface to one of his cantankerous plays:
<quote>"We shall end up as a nation selling chocolate and inviting visitors."</quote>
If we are not careful that will be very near the truth. This museum is already a tourist attraction in the West Midlands area and particularly in North Staffordshire. I do not want to hammer home that point any further: this is one of the most intelligent debating Chambers in the world and the point is made.<lb/>
The other point I should like to make&#x2014;and here comes the sting in the tail of this little speech&#x2014;is that I believe we are in an anomalous position because we have to pay value added tax at 15 per cent. Over 20,000 people visited us and I told this House that 10,000 of them were students from schools and colleges, some doing degree courses, some doing geology, some vulcanology and some technology. I do not know what is more educational than for those young fellows and girls to go down that pit to see geology in reality, which is "dead chemistry" in a way. I do not know what is more educational. We are not asking for all our sins to be wiped away. All we say to the Government is: "Be fair to us. We will pay
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0232"/>
<col>447</col>
VAT on those who come 'swanning'&#x2014; and, fair play, ' swanning' is of value, especially when they come from Holland, Russia or Norway&#x2014;but what about the students who go down? For heaven's sake! let us pay the lower rate on that, or you can wipe it out altogether and we will clap our hands with glee; but, please, consider it in depth".<lb/>
Now I must pay a tribute to the local people in Newcastle-under-Lyne to whom we have written. I will not read their letters: they were courteous, but they said: "Look, we are limited by &#x2026;"and then they gave the law. Noble Lords opposite have the opportunity to look at that, and we can see, even from the Drew Report, that educational museums should be looked at in a different light.<lb/>
The rise in VAT from 8 per cent. to 15 per cent. has seriously affected museums, theatres and cinemas, and, with all due respect&#x2014;I do not want to drive it home as a bitter political point&#x2014;I think it is penny wise and pound foolish. My niece wrote to me from Los Angeles last week and said, "Uncle, I am trying to come but I find that London now is more expensive than San Francisco or Los Angeles". We are pushing up prices and killing the goose that lays the golden egg. For heaven's sake! let us go steady on VAT. I have a granddaughter who has gone on the stage. I think she has been "resting" for about 12 weeks but she has a job for Christmas, thank God! Anyone visiting a theatre, if he takes his wife and two children, will be the other side of about &#x00A3;25 or &#x00A3;30 for one little colourful, or uncolourful, night out, depending on the quality of the actors. So I hope that in regard to museums somebody will look at this point.<lb/>
I will not repeat the letters because I have tried to make them clear. I am grateful to the Minister, because I know that already&#x2014;he will be pleased to see that I am throwing my papers away&#x2014;he has had the wires moving and that somebody is taking an interest. I make an appeal because I think this mining museum, initiated by members of the Coal Board and by people locally, will be a contribution to the tourist industry and to the educational opportunities of the youngsters and it will be something worth while. I hope that the Government may see their way to do something about the problem

of VAT. Finally, may I say "Thank you" to the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, and to the producers of this working party report. It gave me the unique opportunity of trespassing on other people's speaking.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01124"><member>Lord BEAUMONT of WHITLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords I certainly would join in the gratitude extended to the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, for having produced for our debate this evening this very important topic which, thank goodness! we in this House do have time to take notice of. I think we have a particular duty at this moment to pass on a message to the Minister for the Arts that we do understand the very real problems which he faces. I do not think there is much dispute that, with Britain in its present state, a certain amount of pulling-in the belt is needed, and it is totally unrealistic to think that the arts can escape any cuts that are to be made. All we can hope and pray for is that the cuts will not be disproportionate.<lb/>
Since the job of the Minister for the Arts was started, we have been extremely lucky in our Ministers, and we are very lucky tonight to have two previous Ministers for the Arts speaking in this debate. I think neither of them will take it amiss if I say that we are doubly lucky in our present Minister, because he combines three attributes which have not been combined before. Not only is he a lover of the arts, which Ministers have been before and which the Ministers present here are, and not only is he a professional politician&#x2014;and I know some of your Lordships will agree that is an asset&#x2014;but he is also in the Cabinet. Since he has the desire to fight for the arts and possibly more ability than some of his predecessors, we hope for great things from him, while realising that his monetary schemes will be very much circumscribed.<lb/>
We may argue among ourselves about where in this country's affairs we need retrenchment. Retrenchment is needed, but when that great Liberal, John Bright, produced his famous quotation about retrenchment he combined it with reform; and it is not true that you cannot combine retrenchment with reform. As the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, has already pointed out, there are a large number of recommendations
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0233"/>
<col>449</col>
in this report which do not need any extra money at all. Certainly, in the few short things I wish to say this evening, I am going to concentrate on matters which do not need any great expenditure.<lb/>
Today I want to suggest three reforms, two of which come from the recommendations of the report and one of which does not. The one which the report actually dismisses is the recommendation which came from the previous report on which this one is a comment: that is, the establishment of regional centres as centres of excellence. This was what the Wright Report suggested. Obviously, to set up centres of excellence of that kind is going to need a certain amount of money; but what I should like to ask for now is the recognition that such a policy would be a good thing. The Drew Report actually dismisses this, mainly so far as I can discover, for the reason that it would be extremely difficult to set them up. There is absolutely no doubt that it would be very difficult to do. The regrouping in provincial centres of museums which are at the moment under different control would be very complicated, but if the Minister at present has no money to offer us he presumably has got hard work, and perhaps this point might be looked at again, even though this present report has abandoned the idea.<lb/>
It particularly appeals to us on these Benches because it builds tip the idea of regional centres of excellence, and I think that is extremely important. It is very important not just that we should push out the good things from London but that we should establish places in every region where there are the good things of life, to be regarded as centres to which people will come from all over the country, and indeed from all over the world, to see. So I should like that to be looked at again. That would have the very important effect of concentrating the attention of local government rather more on the whole question of museums and the arts.<lb/>
As has been pointed out, we have the rather unfortunate situation that in the past, with the big, new local government units, museums and the arts have often been pushed away under department of leisure activities, lumped in with sports and all kinds of things. There are dis-
<col>450</col>
graceful stories, which are substantiated, of directors of museums not even being allowed to sign letters or of letters having to be signed by their superiors, and if we follow this idea of centres of excellence we shall be able to combat that.<lb/>
If we followed what the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, recommended, which is more charging in local museums&#x2014;I do not want to go into that thorny question now, but I agree that the right place to start would be the local museums and the local areas where powers already exist&#x2014;that would have the additional advantage, whatever disadvantages it might have, of giving that museum and that department, which would be seen as a money-earner, a very great deal more standing in the whole local government situation. That is my first suggestion.<lb/>
My second suggestion, which is recommended in the Drew Report, is that museum grant aid should be removed from the rate support and administered separately. That certainly would cost no more money. It is merely a way of channelling money in a different way and, again, it would enhance the place of the local museum director in his relationship with the council, because if you cannot give the museums extra money it would at least be one way of seeing that the money that was available got to the right place, and of seeing that museums and their directors had their rightful position in the local situation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01126"><member>Lord BEAUMONT of WHITLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is the element in grant aid which is in theory for museums, but which at the moment goes into the whole block of grant aid and is spread around the country, without differentiation between where there are museums and where there are not. I am suggesting that money should be separated and separately allocated.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01128"><member>Lord BEAUMONT of WHITLEY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I am very grateful for that help. The third point which I should like to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0234"/>
<col>451</col>
raise is a step forward in dealing with the Standing Commission. I think that changes are needed, and the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, has talked about some of them. But, in spite of the fact that the Standing Commission has already made some changes to give itself greater access to the professional museum world and better consultation with the experts, as the noble Lord has pointed out, from what I understand from museum directors a certain amount more could, without much expense, be done, to strengthen the regular consultation with the professionals on all these matters.<lb/>
Times of retrenchment are not just times of misery. They are times of opportunity and times when we can turn to and undertake some of the laborious housekeeping which, in rather happier times, tends to get brushed under the carpet. In times of prosperity there are certain things which can be reformed and which should be reformed but which are neglected. I hope that the Minister for the Arts will turn his attention to this aspect, and I have every confidence that he will.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01129">6.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01130"><member>Viscount ECCLES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as other noble Lords have said, we are very grateful to my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu for drawing our attention to this working party's report. My noble friend is the most popular and outstanding champion of private museums, not only in this country but in all Europe. He has brought pleasure and some instruction to millions of people&#x2014;as the report now says at &#x00A3;1.40 per head&#x2014;and the success with which he develops the motor museum is surely a lesson for everybody.<lb/>
As has been said, the working party's report continues and adds to the report of the Wright Committee. I appointed that Committee because, in spite of the valiant work done by the late Earl of Rosse, to whom I should like to pay a tribute, the public did not know nearly enough about the financial and structural weaknesses of the non-national museums. As the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, has said, one of the key recommendations was for centres of excellence. I remember saying to Mr. Willie Wright "What we want are teaching hospitals with groups of hospitals of different sizes all around
<col>452</col>
them, and why cannot we have that in the museum world?" That idea became, I think, the centres of excellence and I still think that it is a good idea.<lb/>
What the Wright Report did was to show up the extent to which the provincial museums have been neglected in comparison with London and the nationals, and now, I am glad to say, we have the Drew Report which still further adds to our knowledge and proposes a national organisation which is to be split into two parts, one a grand advisory council and the other an executive commission with duties not unlike those of the Arts Council. I expect there will be general agreement that some such body is needed in order to put the case before the public and Parliament for local authority, university and private museums, and to encourage common services which would be of great benefit to hundreds of museums. I support this proposal, provided that care is taken not to create an organisation too similar to the Arts Council.<lb/>
There is a fundamental difference between the clients of the Arts Council and the non-national museums. Music, drama and dancing are all, so to speak, foot-loose. Their quality does not depend on the place where a play, a ballet or a concert is performed. But, by contrast, most provincial museums owe their charm to their situation and their attraction lies in local history and local culture. How their collections have been made, where they are housed and how they are cared for by the local people give them their character. They do, and they should, differ widely one from another. For example, prints and drawings of White-haven or Newcastle look very well shown there. But if you were to show them in Weymouth of Canterbury, they would not be half so interesting. It is the local character that matters. Therefore, it would be wrong to press these local museums into some kind of national mould, shaped and monitored by some Quango&#x2014;because that is what the report asks for&#x2014;domiciled in Piccadilly or at some other fashionable London address.<lb/>
Your Lordships will know that there are, scattered about the country, a few very special collections of national importance and their claims are easily recognisable. The museums that require our help are those that serve a peculiarly
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0235"/>
<col>453</col>
modern need; that is, the desire to get away from the dominance and life-style of the metropolis.<lb/>
Science and technology, those masters of our contemporary world, assume that we all want to be the same. It is good to see that a kind of revolt is growing against the attempt to make us all members of a rootless, international society. Searching for evidence that they have something special of their own, people are taking more and more interest in local history and local culture. For them, the museum in the place where they live is a signpost in the search for their identity.<lb/>
We see that such museums and hundreds of houses open to the public are growing rapidly in popularity. I think one reason why we are going, in increasing numbers, to these places is to discover more about ourselves: what our ancestors were like and why we can be proud of the place where we live. Much as non-national museums require more support, we must not allow their essentially local character to be endangered for the sake of a tidy structure created to assess nation-wide Government grants and to produce a uniform system of pay and conditions for work in the museum service.<lb/>
I should like particularly to draw the attention of the House to the last point. The museum service is one in which the volunteer, the amateur and the part-time worker have a very great contribution to make. I hope that all your Lordships wish to preserve the voluntary element, and that for two reasons.<lb/>
First, the more people who participate in the institutions which symbolise their community, past and present, the better. Such institutions bring their neighbourhood to life, and that is what a great many people desire today. If in their spare time those people are willing to do some job, under supervision, in their local museum, that is all to the good. I am thinking of part-time warding, help with conservation, showing parties round, maybe sitting at the door and taking entrance fees. We know that many museum directors and keepers very much welcome this kind of help. We must take care that such cooperation is not sacrificed to the desire for a closed shop, a desire which is certainly held by a few people.<lb/>
<col>454</col>
Secondly, the museums are short of money. They find it difficult to pay the staff they have. The volunteer helps to make whatever money is available go further. We all know that many of the curatorial staff are poorly paid and we would like to see them get more. This is not a problem that we can run away from; it is very urgent. I notice that the Drew Report backs the Museums Association in asking that the staff of the designated provincial museums&#x2014;those are the 20 or 30 best; I do not know exactly how many&#x2014;should be paid at the same rates as staff in the national museums. That means Civil Service scales. On the present unsatisfactory level of staffing, the report says that it would cost an extra &#x00A3;1 million a year, of which the Government should pay 80 per cent. in direct grant. This is asking for an open-ended commitment which I hardly think would commend itself to the Treasury. Further, if pay in the designated museums were raised in this way, obviously the staff in the other museums would have a very good claim, too. Therefore the estimate in the report might prove to be much too low.<lb/>
As I have said, we cannot brush this problem aside. We must somehow find a way to make a beginning in raising pay. Therefore we come to the question: how is the money to be found? I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, that in present circumstances there is not likely to be much more from the Government. Inflation must first be stopped. There must be a change of heart in industry and production must be put in front of restrictive practices. It is a melancholy thought that extra recruiting for the museum service and raising the pay of those who are so badly looked after today depends on whether or not inflationary wage claims are pressed.<lb/>
For the moment we must look for other sources of revenue. My noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu mentioned entrance charges. So does the working party report. In Section 5.15, it notices that where a local authority museum is charging there appears to be no deterrent effect on the number of visitors. I think all those who have looked at these cases know that. They might have drawn our attention to the now well-established fact that where a museum charges, it has more interest and more money to make the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0236"/>
<col>455</col>
collections attractive and to install the amenities which the public appreciate. Visitors have to pay, but more of them come.<lb/>
In Section 8.10, the report observes that entrance charges are actually an advantage which the lucky private museums can enjoy more easily than the local authority museums. My noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu has in his own museum illustrated how great this advantage can be to the public, and so would the National Trust and several excellent local authority museums. Parliament thinks it right to charge for medical prescriptions and school meals. Can it then be wrong to charge something for a visit to a museum, especially as we now have evidence that the results will be that the museum will be better run?<lb/>
When I see the Victoria and Albert, that great and glorious museum, shut on Mondays, I wonder whether the public would not prefer to pay an entrance charge on two or three days a week and have the museum open every day. The tourists on whom we depend so much would undoubtedly be delighted. Many of them spend only a night or a couple of nights in London; they would far prefer to pay something than make the journey to South Kensington and, when they get there, find the door shut in their faces.<lb/>
There is another source of non-Government finance, and that is the contributions made by the friends and supporters of a museum. These have been developing well. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer would only give an annual income tax relief on subscriptions up to a limited amount, I believe that many museums would benefit rapidly and substantially. They could pay their staff more and they could improve their premises. There is no reason why local authorities should not give a rate rebate to supporters of their museums. Their loss in revenue would be much less than the cost of the direct grant. That, of course, applies to the Treasury, too.<lb/>
In short, I could sum up my chief comments on the working party report as follows. We need a national body, but not at the expense of the local character of most of the museums in question. The volunteer and part-time element in running
<col>456</col>
provincial museums should be encouraged and any move towards a closed shop discouraged. Finally, in seeking more money, we should look to entrance charges and income tax or rate relief on annual subscriptions and with the new money we could make a start in paying the staff decent salaries.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01132"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join with those noble Lords who have spoken so far in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, for having introduced this matter, because in my opinion by so doing he has done an extremely valuable service to us on a subject in which many of us have had an interest from time to time. I should like to add that noble Lords who have spoken so far have certainly covered much of the ground that I had desired to cover. Therefore I am not proposing to keep the House for any great length of time.<lb/>
I shall try to tell your Lordships the position in respect of this matter from the viewpoint of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, of which I have the honour to be a vice-president. Consequently I shall be speaking on their behalf and indeed to a considerable extent, if not entirely&#x2014;because none of us is in entire agreement with everything that everybody does, even in our own organisations, as is well known to your Lordships&#x2014;I shall be endorsing their view.<lb/>
It took many years to produce the Wright Report which, although unacceptable in certain regards, led to the Drew Report. In our view this report represents the last real opportunity to preserve the international collections which are housed in some major provincial museums. The report is welcomed as a basis for a partnership between Government and local museums which will be of significance for the cultural heritage of our nation. In our view the principle of designation is central to the report and will be of ultimate benefit to all museums, not just to those designated. If the Drew Report were accepted it would mean that Government money would be used to maintain and develop such major collections as those in Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield. These are collections comparable to those in national museums and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0237"/>
<col>457</col>
they create demands and obligations on the museum authorities, such as very high standards of care, curatorship and conservation.<lb/>
The Drew Report also proposes changes in the organisation and work of area museum councils and the establishment of a central governing body. Both of these are reforms which would make the museum service stronger and would equip it to meet the challenge which increased leisure and other social changes will, we hope, bring in the last quarter of this century.<lb/>
The association therefore welcomes the Drew Report and accepts it in principle. At a time when local government finance is under pressure it could be easy, but wrong, to be negative about Drew. The association has agreed that museums and galleries represent an acceptable case for specific grant even at a time of financial difficulty, and as your Lordships are aware local government does not often accept that there is a case for any new category of specific grant. We believe that the costs suggested in the Drew Report are greater than they need to be because Drew proposes designation for the whole of the museum service and money would come from the present British Heritage Fund because these collections are of much greater significance and appeal than the local area in which they reside.<lb/>
We believe that the Drew Report has arrived at the eleventh hour. The major provincial collections are being eroded because local authorities are having to carry a very great burden in order to keep them. They must be preserved as part of the national heritage and Drew presents the opportunity to create a partnership between central and local government which should now be taken. In the interests of the coming generations, who will probably have greater leisure in which to enjoy part of Britain's heritage in a provincial setting, I believe that the report itself is of considerable value. That opinion is also held by my colleagues.<lb/>
I should like to make a comment on another matter in which, together with other Members of both sides of your Lordships' House, I happen to be interested. I believe that help could be given to a project&#x2014;for example to provide a much more suitable place for a music
<col>458</col>
museum which a Mr. Frank Holland is running at the present time. It is a museum of musical instruments. He is being impeded in his efforts to have a museum in the house which was owned and occupied by the late David Salomon. in whom your Lordships will probably understand that I have a particular interest because of the fact that he was the first Jewish Member of Parliament. He left an estate and the beneficiaries of that estate have handed the property itself to Kent. They are using a large part of this building, contrary to the wishes of the beneficiaries, for a school for training nurses, which could of course be carried out in any ordinary building. It is desired that the centre for these musical instruments should be housed in this place at Tunbridge Wells in order that they may be added to a very interesting musical instrument, namely the largest organ in the world which is there at present, and so form a valuable museum.<lb/>
I have spoken about this with colleagues and I am hoping that this and like suggestions which have been put forward will assist in expediting a knowledgeable understanding of the importance of utilising this historical house, as I have indicated the original beneficiaries themselves, who were relatives of Salomon's, are desirous and anxious that it should be used to this, the best purpose. I do not want to go into more detail as it is late at night. All I should like the House to understand is that those of us who are interested in that house, a small private project, believe that there is an opportunity now, instead of dragging on for further years, to get the matter settled as speedily as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01134"><member>The Earl of PERTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not put my name down to speak, but there is a little time available and I shall not be more than five minutes. All of us who care about these things owe our thanks to the authors of the Drew Report, and also to the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, for introducing this short debate tonight. As I read it, the main feature of this report is an organisational one. I am not very good at organisational charts. It was very important to hear that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, broadly favours the suggestion of a commission which will allocate money and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0238"/>
<col>459</col>
therefore be the top body&#x2014;because, after all, the power of the purse is the important thing&#x2014;and then you have a council for policy. The noble Viscount gave us a warning about the relationship with the Arts Council. I think there is another factor which has to be taken into account, namely, the relationship with the Heritage Fund when it is set up, because in one way or another the Heritage Fund is going to benefit the museums in many respects. So while I am all for the commission and for the council, I think we want to go a little slowly perhaps in deciding how it should actually function.<lb/>
Another matter strikes me in this report. Perhaps it is necessary since it is about museums and galleries, and it covers those very fully; but it hardly touches upon the National Trust houses or the Historic Houses Association. They are mentioned in one paragraph. No evidence was submitted by those bodies, and yet I think we all recognise today that the line between museums and galleries and the National Trust houses and historic houses is a very narrow one, if it exists at all. I would hope, therefore, that in any body that is set up the National Trust&#x2014;or the National Trust for Scotland, which did give evidence&#x2014;or the Historic Houses Association will be brought into the net, if they wish to be. I think that becomes more important because today, as your Lordships know, it is policy more and more to leave certain works of art which are owned by the nation in the private houses, or at any rate in the National Trust houses. That must be right, but it means that they are part of this story; it is not just the museums and galleries.<lb/>
What are the kind of questions that the council is going to deal with? They are listed in some detail here, and of course travelling exhibitions are a very important part. It seems to me, as several of your Lordships have said, that given the present tight money position in the country we cannot expect the sort of figures which are outlined in the report to come from the Government. I very much support the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, on the question of charges. One wants to go slowly, perhaps charging on only two or three days in the week. I remember that I advocated that policy in days long
<col>460</col>
ago and got into great trouble in your Lordships' House; but never mind, I remain undaunted on it. I think if you have travelling exhibitions and make charges for them and if you cannot get the money any other way, nobody would resent that; they would be only too glad of it.<lb/>
Another way in which the Government can help is by considering how much they can allow the various bodies which are not strictly national museums to have their insurance covered by Government insurance policy. We all know how very onerous are insurance charges in connection with any exhibition. I saw some figures the other day, although I did not write them down, about the actual cost to the Government of insurance over the last five years or so. The figures were incredible; they were either &#x00A3;2,000 in one case for the whole of the five years or not more than &#x00A3;20,000. If that is the case, I hope very much that those who are considering this question of insurance in a limited way will try to think of it in a wider way, in order to see whether they can widen it in some way. I know the Government do not charge for these insurances, but if they accepted the idea that travelling exhibitions should make charges they could say, "And, what is more, we will ask for, let us say, 5 per cent. of the total takings towards building up the special insurance fund", so that in the end the Government do not lose anything at all.</membercontribution></p>

<col>461</col>
ment's view would have been. I shall tell your Lordships what my view is, and the difference between those we shall never know. Before I begin may I take up two points which a number of noble Lords have raised. One is the question of indemnity, which is clearly most important. In my time we made two important advances here. The last was in getting indemnity for the very large insurance for the splendid exhibition which is opening next week at the Royal Academy. So far as I am concerned, every Arts Minister has to fight with the Treasury on this, because the Treasury's attitude will always be the same; they will say, "You are asking for money, and whether you call it this or that, it is still money". So I should like at this stage to wish the present Minister the best of luck in carrying on the good work in this particular direction.<lb/>
I am not going to be involved in the argument over charges. It is true that a number of museums I have seen would like to charge, and it is true that a number would be horrified at charging. I do not wish to get mixed up in that matter at this stage, but it is something which has to be considered in due course. It took a wrong turning at the beginning, and it may well be that after a certain amount of time, provided museums are allowed to settle whether they charge or not and to keep what they get without interference, there might be a case for it.<lb/>
I must join with everybody else in expressing our gratitude to Sir Arthur and his colleagues. I will here correct the noble Lord, Lord Montagu. This report was not commissioned by the Government; it was commissioned by the Standing Commission on its own basis. So it is all the more to be commended for having done so. I should like to join with the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and say how sad we are at the death of the noble Earl, Lord Rosse, who was its distinguished chairman for so many years and who made such a notable contribution to this particular area of the arts.<lb/>
What is really important about this report&#x2014;which I think everyone realises&#x2014;is that it is drawing attention for the second time in six years to the anomalous and unsatisfactory state of the thousand or so provincial museums and galleries outside the direct control and responsibility of the Government. We cannot be criticised
<col>462</col>
in this country for neglecting the national institutions: they are not neglected. We have in the national institutions some of the finest collections of pictures and of all kinds of museum objects in the world. They are well maintained, well housed, well displayed, adequately financed and extremely well managed by a learned and wholly dedicated staff. In the last two years we have enormously increased their purchase grants, and although no good museum director is ever for a moment satisfied, I do not think that the Government have anything to apologise for here.<lb/>
However, as regards the provincial museums the case is far different. They are not a Government responsibility, and responsibility for their proper maintenance varies among local authorities, dependent on the rate support grant; universities, dependent on the University Grants Committee; and private boards of trustees who raise money wherever they can, sometimes easily, but more often with painful difficulty.<lb/>
As most noble Lords who have spoken have recognised, the brutal fact is that money is the problem&#x2014;the flow of money for maintenance, conservation, development, display, education and capital, and especially proper staffing. It is not the material or the people who are at fault. The material is better and more distinguished than I had any conception of before I toured many of the museums to see for myself. But conservation lags far behind and there is a long backlog. The people running the museums, from top to bottom, seem to me of very high quality and to suffer, as the noble Viscount suggested, from many anomalies of pay and staff structure and often from frank underpayment. The difficulty is that with some hundreds of differing local authorities, 300 or so private museums and some especially high quality university museums, there is no common ground for applying for more money or for insisting on a proper nationwide staff structure. The problems are really difficult and it was essential to have a full report and recommendations from the museum world itself before those problems could possibly be tackled. However, now we have it.<lb/>
I had hoped that it would become my duty to try to unravel this tangled skein,

and I am jealous that my successor has this opportunity, fraught with difficulties though it is. But I wish him luck, and we shall do what we can from this side to help. The difficulty is that, as there is no direct Government responsibility and as the Minister already has large direct responsibilities in the museum world which take a great deal of money, it is hard to persuade any Government, gratuitously as it were, to take on further large responsibilities. That is why it is so important to try to find a route through which money can flow, and that is what the report is trying to do.<lb/>
My own experience is that once you have a recognised route, an agreed procedure, you can squeeze out something, however small, to get started, and then you can perhaps get a rise to balance inflation. Then, once in a while, comes an easier year and you can have your figures jumped up to something nearer what you really need. We did that with the purchase grants over the last two years, and if one studies the grants to the Arts Council since the war one will find that they have followed that pattern. But the fatal trouble with the provincial museums is that there is no agreed procedure.<lb/>
Let us look briefly at the actual proposals. There are, of course, a number of proposals of a secondary kind which have been referred to and which I shall not deal with. The report rejects the Wright Report's suggestion of "Centres of Excellence" and I cannot fault their argument. I think that the kind of thing they are trying to do will produce the same sort of result that Wright wanted to produce, without the very complicated local authority problems and geographical problems which the idea involves.<lb/>
Instead, they have suggested three major changes: First, the selection of the dozen or so finest provincial museums and galleries as "Designated Museums", which will be entitled to direct subsidy by way of Government grant for both maintenance and capital. They suggest that accreditation by the Museums' Association should be a necessary preliminary and that the Government should give 50 per cent. towards agreed capital development and 80 per cent. towards resulting increased maintenance charges. Secondly, they recommend that other
<col>464</col>
museums with outstanding specialised collections should be able to get a once-only direct grant, up to 50 per cent., for better housing and display, and that others who could prove a real housing need should be equally entitled to a once-and-for-all 50 per cent. grant. Thirdly, they recommend that the financial contribution to the Area Museums Councils, paid through the Standing Commission, should be doubled and made available for capital needs as well as maintenance and conservation. These are important recommendations and they all involve money. We know the problems. We have talked about this matter and I am not going to say that it should be dealt with by any Government in 10 minutes.<lb/>
If we look at page 60 of the report, we see how the authors conceive that the additional &#x00A3;6 million, which they think should be added annually to support the provincial museums, should be made up. I suppose that today the most we could hope for is that it will be possible to accept that all or most of the suggestions are not only desirable expenditure, but urgently necessary and must be fulfilled as and when finance permits. To show willing, the Government should make a start in two ways: first, by increasing the grant to the Area Museums Councils, paid through the Standing Commission. I think that both need strengthening and nothing gives strength so effectively as more money to distribute. But first, as the report says, the Councils must be given a proper legal status, and their local consultative and advisory boards much improved. Each area has one or more distinguished directors of one or more distinguished museums. Those experts must be as closely involved as possible in the administration and management of the councils. This recommendation is one which will directly affect the problem raised by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, whereas the designated museum one would not. Therefore, this is most important.<lb/>
As regards the second recommendation, I think that the Government should try to put aside something towards the crying needs of the dozen or so museums proposed to be designated. Their plights vary from fair to dreadful. I do not think that people realise how serious the needs of some of them are and how rapidly, with the savage cuts in the rate support
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0241"/>
<col>465</col>
grant, they must become worse. If I may take one example to illustrate the point&#x2014;my own university museum, the Fitzwilliam, is so under-nourished that it is open only for five and a half days a week, and only half its galleries open at that, with a grave risk of having to close on Saturdays as well as Sunday mornings. Yet its collections are without question, subject by subject, of the same order of excellence and display as anything in the national collections, and its significance far exceeds its use to the university. The university population is around 13,000, but its visitors last year amounted to 196,000. Like the other museums recommended for designation, it is an asset of the clearest and most obvious national importance. Yet its annual purchase grant is derisory. Although, admittedly, it can get money from the V. and A., the museum still has to find half, and the question is, where from?<lb/>
In my opinion the Government must admit at least a partial responsibility for these dozen or so outstanding museums and galleries and I suggest that they should make a start now. I should like to see them put aside &#x00A3;1&#x00BC; million&#x2014;about a third of what the Report on page 60 thinks is necessary&#x2014;for this purpose, and another &#x00A3; &#x00BE; million to increase the grant to the Area Councils. This total figure of &#x00A3;2 million is not large, but would be an earnest of the Government's future intentions and would transform the current gloom in the provinces to real hope.<lb/>
I spoke of the rate support grant. I, personally, am a good deal attracted&#x2014;as I think was the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley&#x2014;to the very tentative suggestions in chapter 14 about the Government rethinking its role in relation to museums and galleries. There may here be a simpler way of doing what we all want to see done, but it will need much thinking out. At the moment about &#x00A3;13&#x00BD; million out of &#x00A3;22 million is spent by local authorities on museums and galleries and comes from the rate support grant, and certainly not all this is, in fact, spent on museums and galleries. If the &#x00A3;13, &#x00BD; million could be extracted and given perhaps to the Arts and Libraries Branch to distribute, either direct or through the Standing Commission, on a 50 per cent. basis to such local authorities, universities
<col>466</col>
and private trusts as were prepared to put up plans and pay for half, this would provide the agreed route along which money could begin to flow to all provincial museums and galleries.<lb/>
The sums would need to be increased as the national finances allowed and as the beneficiaries were prepared to put up more themselves. The &#x00A3;2 million to which I have just referred could perhaps be regarded as the first increase. Whichever method may be used, the new factor on which the whole reasoning of the report hangs must be accepted by Government. This is very clearly stated in paragraph 10.6 on page 42 of the report. It says:
<quote>"we regard it as an essential element in the successful working of a central body that the Government recognises that it has itself a central role to play in the development of a national system of museum services. This is indeed fundamental to all our recommendations".</quote>
This will be a hard nut for the Minister to crack. No efficient civil servant will lightly agree to his Department shouldering a commitment in an obvious growth area when there is no vestige of legal necessity to do so. But, as several speakers have said, our country's treasures are not only to be found in the national institutions; nor only in those proposed as "designated". They are spread around the land in splendid profusion, and it is as much a Government's duty to see that they are properly looked after as to preserve the national heritage in private hands.<lb/>
At this stage I shall not say anything about the recommendation for a new central body in the form of a museums' council. If the Standing Commission is well and truly strengthened and has regular meetings with the Museums' Association and other relevant bodies&#x2014;indeed, with people like the National Trust, as was suggested by the noble Earl, Lord Perth&#x2014;there may be no need for another body. Time will tell. I should not be in favour of creating one at this stage. What we want the Minister to do is, first, to recognise that there is a Government responsibility here; and, secondly, to make a start in the two ways that I have indicated.<lb/>
I should like to conclude by begging the Minister to respond generously and constructively to this challenge. Every Minister in a change of Government finds himself inheriting much that his predecessors have prepared and initiated, and until now the present Minister has had a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0242"/>
<col>467</col>
paucity of major announcements to make beyond his confirmation, welcome as it is, of our initiatives in granting indemnity to the Royal Academy for its current most important exhibition, and in transferring &#x00A3;15 million from the moribund Land Fund to a new Heritage Fund. I cannot class as a major announcement his transference of the excellent Arts and Libraries staff, without its deputy director, from one building to another. We have always had a bipartisan policy and, for what it is worth, that transference is one of the things with which I do not agree.<lb/>
But though we may criticise the Government, we do not need to criticise the Minister. We know that his heart is in the right place and that all he can do to help the arts he will do. Now, at last, he has been able to tell us something which will cheer his supporters and quieten his critics, in making a firm promise to find &#x00A3;2 million for public lending right by 1982. I see that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is looking pleased. Whether or not the Government will still be in Office is another point, but if by then it is our turn to inherit promises, I hope and think that this is one we shall be happy to keep.<lb/>
The Minister now has this great opportunity offered by the Drew Report. Its main thrust&#x2014;more help for the provincial museums and galleries&#x2014;is supported by every thinking person in the world of the arts. If the Minister can work out an effective way of giving that help, not necessarily in the exact terms of the report, and if he can make a start in providing some extra cash, he will II have earned the gratitude of the whole artistic world and will have the fullest support we can give him from this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01140"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to begin by thanking my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu for initiating this debate. In particular, I should like to echo the remarks of my noble friend Lord Eccles about my noble friend. I have possibly known my noble friend Lord Montagu longer than any other Member of this House; I knew him as a child and have continued to be amazed at the way in which he has advanced in public esteem and at the way in which he has enhanced so much in this field which we are discussing tonight.<lb/>
<col>468</col>
I am also very grateful to all the other noble Lords who have contributed to this important debate, including as it has two former Ministers of the Arts and a chief Crown Commissioner. Like other noble Lords, I wish to pay tribute to Sir Arthur Drew for his report, which I personally found very thought-provoking and interesting, as well as being a useful contribution to the whole question of the future of our country's museums. Moreover, I am very glad to say that I understand Sir Arthur Drew is still continuing his excellent work on our museums.<lb/>
The museums of this country are, as we all know, a vital part of the rich heritage of our past, and they make a most important contribution to the educating and civilising influence to which people of all ages should be exposed. Local museums have a significant role to play in the quality of life and we cannot over-emphasise their importance. The Government are conscious of the burden on local authorities, many of which have recently made great efforts to improve their contribution to the arts. It is hoped that others will feel able to follow their example and will not single out the arts for discriminatory treatment with regard to economies.<lb/>
Local museums are a partnership between the local authorities and local interests. In a few areas, the Regional Arts Associations have contributed in various ways to the local museum provision. The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, drew attention to the need for regional centres of excellence. One thinks of how the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, helped to achieve this sort of thing at York by moving that excellent Railway Museum which is now so much a draw in that part of the North, which needed some help of this kind.<lb/>
As has been said, it is also important to attract children and young people to museums at an early stage, and there is still much to be done in this direction. But the Government welcome efforts that are being made by means of education programmes and holiday programmes. The importance which the Government attach to preserving the national heritage and to making it accessible to as many as possible can be
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0243"/>
<col>469</col>
seen from the speed with which they have brought forward proposals for the National Heritage Fund legislation. I should like to thank my noble kinsman Lord Perth for the kind remarks he made about this. The National Heritage Fund legislation has been widely acclaimed as being of great significance. But the Government cannot implement in five months a programme which is expected to span at least five years.<lb/>
Many museums testify to those who by their brilliance, self-reliance and determination added so much to the spiritual and material well-being of their fellows. Our first priority is to create the conditions under which such people can again thrive to the mutual benefit of all. Only a flourishing country can afford to support the flourishing arts and museums for which we are striving. The noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, drew attention to money being the problem. How right he is!<lb/>
A vigorous start has been made in reducing the burden of taxation on the individual, and let us hope that much of the income tax relief which has today found its way into many people's pockets will be spent in a way which helps the arts. The creation by the Government of a separate Office of Arts and Libraries is, I hope, further evidence of the importance which the Government attach to this part of their responsibilities and of their intention to do all in their power by example and encouragement to foster the interests of all museums. I think your Lordships will agree with me in that.<lb/>
But while the major task of establishing a healthy economy is taking place&#x2014;and reduction in public expenditure is a vital part of the Government's strategy&#x2014;the Government will be taking careful stock and planning for the improvements of the future. Sir Arthur Drew and his working party have therefore done a most valuable job not only in recommending a framework for a system for museums but also in providing a reasoned vehicle for the informed discussion of the many and important issues surrounding the rich variety of museums in which our country abounds. Noble Lords have not tonight criticised public expenditure cuts as such. They have merely feared what the results might be for local authority spending. We have had a very reasoned debate, and I am glad
<col>470</col>
that we have managed to keep party politics out of this debate tonight.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, talked about prices in this country compared with Los Angeles. I would agree with the noble Lord that we would be living in a dream world if we thought that public expenditure could continue to increase unchecked, as some members&#x2014;not in this House, perish that thought&#x2014;of a party different from mine do appear to think occasionally. We have to cure inflation, and nothing is going to deter us, because everything else depends on that. Not only jobs and pensions but hospitals, schools, and museums, and the arts in general.<lb/>
There have been fears that the local authority cuts will discriminate against the arts. In the present economic circumstances it would not have been right to exempt the arts, but the Government hope that all aspects of the arts, including local museums, will in due course benefit from the reduction in taxation. In the meantime, we believe that it is important to encourage increased private and industrial sponsorship, and my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is looking at ways to advance this. We are convinced that there is a good deal of support which can be raised in the regions, and it is in this direction that we hope to concentrate our efforts. I should like to thank the noble Lords, Lord Beaumont of Whitley and Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, for the kind words they have said about my right honourable friend and the way they wished him success. I am very grateful, and I shall pass on their kind words to him.<lb/>
Most major museums have received a good deal of support over the years from "Friends of the Museums", and it may be that local museums could benefit even more from help of this kind. We recognise that many local museums are facing very difficult problems indeed in caring for their collections. The Drew proposals are a serious attempt, by a body for which the Government have a great respect, to find ways in which these problems might be eased. But I think there would be a good deal of difference in their reception by the various interests concerned, and there is room for a lot of argument about their practicability and effects. Moreover, in the present economic situation,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0244"/>
<col>471</col>
they present the particular difficulty of requiring additional expenditure by central and local government. Your Lordships will not expect me to say that this is something we could easily contemplate in the near future. The Drew Report has been the subject of much discussion, and is going to go on being so.<lb/>
The Government have had a meeting with the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, who have been considering a workable adaptation of the recommendations in the Drew Report. Basically this would involve separation of designation and funding. They have been asked to submit their proposals. Meetings will also he held with the Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils to hear their views, which are awaited by us with great interest. The Chancellor may well have consultations with other interested bodies too.<lb/>
Your Lordships may well ask why we are taking so long to consider the Drew proposals. I should like to say that, on my arithmetic, we, with all the work of a new Government, have had the report very little longer than the noble Lord's late Administration. I have noted my noble friend Lord Eccles' warning about a sprouting Quango which might arrive in Belgravia. I am not sure that we wish to see this animal arrive, but who knows? The issues which the report raises have implications for the relationship between central and local government in museum matters, and these are going to require careful study in the light of the Government's policies, particularly at a time when we are trying to reduce central Government controls over local authorities. <lb/>
It is to the benefit of all concerned that there should after the publication of the report be time for all views to be aired. Sir Arthur Drew has himself commented on what he regards as gaps in the report, which have become more obvious as time has gone on. The Government will play their proper role in the discussions on the report. It should not be overlooked that the main thrust of the Drew Report is about museums controlled by local authorities. It recommends, for example, an all-round improvement in both the quality and quantity of staff to approximate to those of the national museums in the capital. Although the national
<col>472</col>
museums cannot be exempted from their share of any reductions in public expenditure, they nevertheless set a high standard in all museum matters. The establishment of out-stations by the national museums is a valuable means not only of making national collections more accessible to the public but also of displaying in the provinces the importance the Government attach to the care of the heritage. In this way, the Government set an example which should lead to a general raising of standards in museums.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu inquired why the recommendations in the Drew Report that involve no extra costs cannot be implemented. I hope noble Lords will appreciate that very few of the recommendations are totally unrelated to the main tenor of the report. Therefore, they cannot really be implemented by the Government without prejudging a wider decision on the report in its entirety.<lb/>
There are other areas of concern to the Drew Report where the Government are already making a valuable and significant contribution. In the present financial year we are making &#x00A3;1,266 million available to Area Museum Councils towards the costs of co-operative schemes for local museums and galleries, and a total of &#x00A3;1,478 million has been allocated to the Science and the Victoria and Albert Museums to aid purchases by local museums. The Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is co-operating with the Area Museum Councils in a study leading to a legally recognised status for the councils, and I welcome this initiative by the Standing Commission. Also, the National Heritage Fund legislation proposals include provisions for indemnities which should help in making the heritage more widely accessible. My noble friend Lord Montagu and my noble kinsman Lord Perth asked about this point.<lb/>
For actual details of our proposals in this field I must ask noble Lords to await the publication of the National Heritage Fund Bill, which I hope is not far distant. It is the Government's firm intention as opportunity presents itself to build on this substantial base of assistance to local museums, which is itself additional to that made available by way of the rate support grant.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0245"/>
<col>473</col>
I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, for, as he told the House, sending me his questions and most helpful points along with the interesting brochure about his delightful museum. He mentioned the Chatterley Whitfield Museum, of which he is president. I gather that my department's regional office is very much in favour of this unique mining museum, so much so that it has spent, or is proposing to spend, some &#x00A3;103,000 on works to the museum, both above and below ground. Moreover, the regional office is sending nearly &#x00A3;1 million additionally on reclamation works to the adjacent site which is currently occupied by coal spoil tips. When this land, amounting to over 300 acres, has been restored for recreational purposes, visitors to the area will have a large area of open space and the mining museum as a double attraction, and the spin-off from each one will, we hope, help the others.<lb/>
Lord Davies is a model in this House. He is a Peer of strong political views who gets his points across and gets answers. We are grateful to him for the way he always puts his points; he fights for them, and I for one am grateful to him. He talked about how we in this country might be reduced to showing people our countryside and selling chocolates. I do not think he would be very good at that. I had two young cousins aged seven or eight staying here just before Christmas, and instead of selling chocolates he bought them chocolates. He is indeed a benevolent member of the Opposition.<lb/>
Lord Davies in particular asked about the VAT situation. This is a complicated point, as he will appreciate, and all I can tell him&#x2014;I apologise for the technicality of my reply&#x2014;is that from the beginning of VAT, from April 1973, the theatre and other cultural institutions have pressed the Government for admissions to be zero rated. This request has consistently been refused because it is the essential nature of the tax that it bears on consumer expenditure generally in the domestic economy. The necessarily limited reliefs for the most part can be justified for compelling social reasons. All discretionary expenditure has from the beginning been subject to the tax and a concession in this area would present particular difficulty because it would
<col>474</col>
not be possible in practice to justify refusing similar treatment for many cultural, recreational or sporting activities, all of which in their own way are of value to the community and can be argued to be worthy of relief by reference to their particular problems and circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01141"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a pit is unique. If that is conceded, I cannot see pit museums springing up like mushrooms. This is the one and only such museum in Europe and it is educational. But I would never argue with the noble Lord, whom I consider a friend, and I will leave the matter there for further consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01142"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only quote to the noble Lord some of his noble friend's remarks: "All Ministers of Arts and their minions fight for Arts. The Treasury does not always give way". Lord Davies suggested that museums and galleries should in part count as educational establishments. There are certain educational exemptions, but it would be difficult to establish that museums and galleries are any more educational than concerts or performances of classical plays and so on. Local authorities are able to obtain relief on the running costs of local museums and of course on any tax involved in the purchase of new objects. Private museums have to pay tax on admission charges, but they too may seek relief on objects purchased.<lb/>
One useful further source of financial assistance to museums has been the progress in the preparation and printing of attractive and informative catalogues and the tremendous growth in sales through shops attached to museums. This is an area which local museums could develop with great benefit to themselves, and I have noted the points which several noble Lords made about whether they would be able to keep those profits for themselves.<lb/>
In this context, Lord Montagu and the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, mentioned museum charges. Having sat beside the noble Viscount when he was Minister and heard him argue so vigorously his views on this matter, I feel slightly anxious that he will not have any raised blood pressure or be upset at the fact that I am
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0246"/>
<col>475</col>
now perhaps taking a different view, because I have to tell the House that the Government are not in favour of general museum charges as such, but do not object to charges for special exhibitions. We believe that the national collections should be freely available for all to see. We are aware that some local museums charge an entrance fee and that local authorities have the power to implement such charges, but we would certainly not encourage them to do so.<lb/>
Lord Donaldson raised the question of points of excellence, areas of excellence and museums of excellence&#x2014;special regional places&#x2014;and he mentioned in particular the Fitzwilliam, a museum for which, with him, I share great affection; its director is a great personal friend of mine and I agree with Lord Donaldson that it is second to none in the provincial field. We hope that the University of Cambridge will do everything it possibly can to ease the museum's problems. As the noble Lord said, there is already a significant Government contribution available through the local purchase fund of the V &amp; A Museum and through the South Eastern Area Museum Council, half of whose expenditure is repaid by the Government.<lb/>
Lord Donaldson and Lord Beaumont referred to the rate support grant, gave views about it and asked if the Government would comment on the subject. I have to tell the House that we do not think it is quite true to say that there is an element in the rate support grant which in theory is for museums. The grant is a block sum which each authority is free to spend as it wishes according to its views on the needs of particular services. To remove one service from the ambit of the grant and to make separate provision for it would raise fundamental questions about the general principle that local authorities are free to allocate their grant as they see fit. I do not think this suggestion would be attractive to local authorities in general and I would not like to leave the House with any impression that there was a prospect of it being pursued at present.<lb/>
I should like, in conclusion, to do as Lord Donaldson asked me, namely to respond generously, but in times of economic hardship it is not always easy to do so. Thus, I have to say that museums, like so many of this country's
<col>476</col>
institutions, are based on a partnership between central Government, local government and private organisations and individuals. Much could be done to improve the co-operation within the existing framework and the Government propose to do all they can in this respect, but they also look to those who share this responsibility for improving the nation's museums to play their part as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01143">7.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01144"><member>Lord MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had a most interesting and perhaps important debate on a subject which must be of national importance. I have been delighted at the bipartisan atmosphere that has prevailed in all parts of the House and has been reflected in the speeches; indeed it has also been enhanced by the speeches of two ex-Ministers for the Arts. The noble Lord, Lord Mowbray and Stourton, has very fully replied to and covered the speeches made by noble Lords, but I should like to make one or two comments. I should like to say how much I agree with my noble friend Lord Eccles about the importance of local involvement, and I am sure that this is a matter in which Area Museums Councils can do much more to help co-ordinate and advise.<lb/>
I am very glad that my noble friend Lord Perth raised the question of historic houses. May I draw his attention to paragraph 8.14 in the Drew Report which looks to Area Museum Services to encourage membership which involves historic houses and their contents, whether or not they are officially museums, as a component part of the museum provision in the area. I believe that Sir Arthur Drew had that in mind when he wrote the paragraph. I am most delighted that my noble friend mentioned the National Heritage Fund. When it is set up, it will create a great burden of consultation with the Standing Commission, and I have no doubt that the Museums Association Council can play its part in giving advice. It is very important that that advice should be of high calibre. That is also applicable to the chairman and trustees of the new National Heritage Fund who must go calmly and professionally about their task when it arises.<lb/>
I listened with great interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kings-bridge, said with regard to museum
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0247"/>
<col>477</col>
charges, and I think I detected a slight change in direction from the quite adamant views that were held by his party in 1974. I hope that that is perhaps true. At least he said that he felt that times are changing, and perhaps his views will prevail against some of the more adamant views of his colleagues. But I appreciate that politically this is a hot potato and although I was disappointed to hear the noble Lord, Lord Mowbray and Stourton, say that it was not possible even to encourage local government to make charges, perhaps I should leave this point and accept it as a political, and not a practical, decision.<lb/>
However, the noble Lord, Lord Mowbray, has proved that the Government are taking the report seriously. We have had a positive, not a negative, response tonight, and I am most grateful for that. The noble Lord has certainly given great food for thought for museums and perhaps a little food for museum stomachs as well. I should certainly like to join in congratulating Sir Arthur Drew upon the report. Knowing him, I am sure that he will persist and ensure that the report is not forgotten; and so indeed will I. My Lords, with the leave of the House, I beg to withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT: <lb/>CRUISE MISSILE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01161"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01162">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01163">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they can now deny reports in the national Press that they have rejected the cruise missile as a means of modernising Britain's nuclear deterrent, and whether they are certain that the cruise missile would not be barred under SALT II.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01164"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of DEFENCE (Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are firmly committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's strategic deterrent; both cruise and ballistic missiles are among the options being considered for any possible successor system. We are satisfied that nothing in the SALT II Agreement will prevent us from maintaining the strategic capability of the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01165"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for that assurance may I ask whether he can tell me whether the Government are absolutely certain that SALT II, if signed, does not prevent the transfer of technology on the cruise missile or its atomic head to this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01166"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is not a simple
<col>480</col>
question. The short answer is, Yes, and the particular reason so far as cruise missiles are concerned is that the protocol lasts until the end of 1981 and it is not intended in any case to deploy cruise missiles prior to that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01167"><member>Lord BROCKWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not possible for Her Majesty's Government to do something to stop this madness of nuclear missile confrontation in the world, which may destroy all life? Can they not support the recommendations made by the Special Assembly of the United Nations and the Geneva Committee, the proposal of President Brezhnev for negotiations on missiles in central Europe? Has the noble Lord seen the decision of the ruling party in Holland yesterday that this matter should be postponed for two years in order that negotiations may take place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01168"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this country certainly has no desire to indulge in an arms race, he it conventional or be it nuclear. The whole thrust of our policy and our intentions is to try to limit the arms race. The fact remains that our potential adversaries are accelerating their rearmament programme&#x2014;if that is the right expression&#x2014;and they are rapidly overhauling us, and Mr. Brezhnev's offer frankly is not a very significant element in that equation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01169"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, that he could have leave of absence from this House to go to Moscow or to the United Nations if thereby he could persuade them not to deploy the SS20, with its 2,000-mile range and multi-missile head, in increasing numbers, threatening every member of the NATO organisation? And, in the meantime, as the USSR have already, by their propaganda, persuaded Western Europe that they no longer have the option of deploying the neutron bomb, can we continue to keep all our options open so that we maintain a nuclear deterrent in the face of the threats which are increasing every day, every month and every year from the USSR?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01170"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we certainly think it is necessary to keep all our options
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0249"/>
<col>481</col>
open. We all know of the eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, and if he could convince the Russians that our intentions are not dishonourable, then I am sure it would be an admirable idea for him to go to tell them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01171"><member>Baroness LLEWELYN-DAVIES of HASTOE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps while inviting the noble Lord to go to Moscow the whole House will join in congratulating him today, his 91st birthday.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01173"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has had a long time in which to learn a great deal of wisdom.</membercontribution></p>

And I am not speaking on behalf of the Soviet Union but on behalf of world disarmament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01175"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have strayed a long way from the original Question, but I would not disagree with anything that the noble Lord has said.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01178">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01179">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to ensure that supplies of paraffin are adequate during the coming winter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01180"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of EMPLOYMENT (The Earl of Gowrie)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Department of Energy has received assurances from the oil companies about the overall adequacy of supplies of premium paraffin this winter. This does not mean that local supply difficulties cannot or will
<col>482</col>
not arise, but this will not be due to any general shortage of supplies. If cases of real difficulty should arise, the Department of Energy stands ready to provide what assistance it can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01181"><member>Baroness EMMET of AMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the Minister for that reply, may I ask him whether he is satisfied that the distribution of paraffin is adequate to meet the needs of the older generation who depend upon it largely both for heating and for cooking?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01182"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my original Answer suggested, we anticipate that it is possible that there may be local supply difficulties, but I am able to arrange with officials in the Department of Energy to contact oil companies wherever these shortfalls on delivery occur and we will try to fill the gap as quickly as we can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01183"><member>Lord STRABOLGI</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government hear in mind that the ever rising price of paraffin, combined with the Government's abolition of the electricity discount scheme, will probably fall very heavily on the poorest sections of the community this winter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01184"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a generally regrettable fact that none of us, whatever section of the community we come from, as the noble Lord well knows, can escape the consequences of the price rises in energy all over the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01185"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Government give an undertaking that they will not attempt to reverse a decision taken last week in the House of Commons regarding the maximum price of paraffin?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01186"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot give that undertaking, because I think in fact the Government laid an order in the House of Commons yesterday to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01187"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask that a sincere effort will be made by the Department of Energy to ensure that at least some of the more remote rural areas, particularly in Scotland and Wales and even in other parts of England, will have supplies of paraffin taken to within easy access?</membercontribution></p>

<title>BRITISH SUMMER TIME</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01189">3.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01190"><member>Viscount MOUNTGARRET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01191">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01192">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether in the interests of energy saving they will consider extending British Summer Time by starting British Summer Time on the first Sunday in March and ending it on the last Sunday in November, and reintroducing double Summer Time from the first Sunday in May to the last Sunday in August.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01193"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the introduction of double Summer Time and the extension of Summer Time to save energy have frequently been advocated in recent years. Studies of such proposals indicate that little net saving of energy would result, and Her Majesty's Government do not consider that this would be sufficient to offset the disadvantages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01194"><member>Viscount MOUNTGARRET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. but may I ask whether he is aware that not only might the change help to save a certain amount of energy&#x2014;although I take the point made in his reply&#x2014;but it would also increase the number of hours in daylight which are available for us to work, and, as productivity is of paramount importance, would he not think it a good idea to give this matter a little further thought, particularly as at the moment we are becoming progressively more European in our outlook? With decimalisation and metrication, does it not seem illogical deliberately to alter our clocks to get out of line with the time in Europe? Would my noble friend not also agree that the majority of farmers in this country do not like having many potential hours of work in daylight taken from them just at the time of year when the sowing of winter and spring corn is of paramount importance?</membercontribution></p>
<col>484</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01195"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend and I are at one on the importance of raising productivity and saving energy. Nevertheless, he might also share with me a feeling that Government legislation or imposed changes on people's habits, are not necessarily always the most efficient way of doing things. We have calculated that the most that could conceivably be saved on the energy front would be about 150,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, which is, relatively speaking, insignificant.<lb/>
As to the issue of harmonisation of Summer Time in the EEC, the use of Summer Time is widespread in the Community. Some efforts have been made to harmonise it and we recognise the value of continuing to work in that direction, but harmonisation does not result in an increase in energy conservation in the United Kingdom as such.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01196"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRAR D</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not my noble friend agree that there are certain apsects of our agriculture that would not like double Summer Time? It would mean that the hay harvest and corn harvest would have to start later in the day, and the dew would be lying longer according to the time. Also is my noble friend aware that dairy farmers would not like it too much either, and that perhaps even the cows might object?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01197"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted to accept the authoritative views of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01198"><member>Baroness WOOTTON of ABINGER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, does know of a way of increasing the hours of daylight, might he be asked to share it with the rest of us?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01199"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister accept that the Government are to be congratulated on their consistency in rejecting the proposal for doubling Summer Time. After all, would it not be a little inconsistent to increase Summer Time while the Government go around cutting everything else?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01200"><member>The Earl of LAUDERDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0251"/>
<col>485</col>
double Summer Time was tried by the Government of the party opposite and was a disaster?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01201"><member>Lord MONSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could the Minister give an assurance that under no circumstances will the Government follow the Continental EEC countries in fixing the end of Summer Time at 28th September, given that more often than not in this country we have warm, dry Octobers during which people naturally want to be able to spend as much time as possible out of doors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01202"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government's general policy wherever possible is to leave summer to the good Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MAURITIUS EXPORTS OF<lb/>SHETLAND WOOL KNITWEAR</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01203">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01204"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01205">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01206">To ask Her Majesty's Government what representations have been made to the EEC regarding the excessive exports of Shetland wool knitwear from Mauritius to EEC countries (in particular to the United Kingdom) to an extent far in excess of that country's current capacity; and whether they will state which countries are circumventing their quota limits by exporting garments via Mauritius and what steps they are taking to protect the employment of British textile workers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01207"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have received a number of allegations that imports of Shetland knitwear arriving from Mauritius have not originated in that country. These allegations are being urgently investigated. At the Government's request, the EEC Commission has asked the Mauritian authorities to agree to voluntary limits for their exports to the United Kingdom of knitwear. We have asked that these negotiations be pressed as a matter of extreme urgency.</membercontribution></p>
<col>486</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01208"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I thank the noble Lord for that reply and say that it will be very warmly received by the industry. May I ask the noble Lord whether he is aware that so often when these representations are made there are inordinate delays before controls are instituted or the matter is dealt with? As the number of garments which Mauritius hopes to export this year is something over 6 million, it is very urgent for the industry that our representations should be dealt with quickly and the industry protected from this totally unfair competition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01209"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are at one with the noble Baroness in her wish to decide this matter urgently and very quickly. The Government are determined that it shall be decided within a matter of months rather than years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01210"><member>Lord GLENKINGLAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend explain to the House how under the Trade Descriptions Act these items are allowed to be sold as "Shetland wool" when there is not even enough Shetland wool for the tiny production of the Shetland Islands?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01211"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that is another question, but I should be happy at any time to engage in discussions with the noble Lord, outside the Chamber, on the Trade Descriptions Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01212"><member>Baroness ELLES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend reply to the second half of my noble friend's Question, which asked which countries are exceeding their quota limits by using Mauritius? As so many countries benefit from association agreements with the European Community, I think we should know which countries are behaving in this way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01213"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the information that the Government have is that no countries are exceeding their quota by exporting garments via Mauritius. I think it is important that the House should understand that. The garments coming in from Mauritius at the present time seem to be produced in that country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01214"><member>Lord HALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as Mauritius is a Commonwealth country and the Commonwealth are involved in many concessions from the EEC, would the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0252"/>
<col>487</col>
noble Lord consider drawing the attention of the Commonwealth Secretariat to this matter, to see what extra information might be derived from that source?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01215"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will convey the noble Lord's wish to the Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01216"><member>Lord DRUMALBYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend be good enough to inquire further what is the production capacity of Mauritius Shetland wool knitwear, so that we can decide whether in fact the knitwear purporting to be from Mauritius actually comes from Mauritius or not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01217"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are treating this as a matter of urgency, and there are negotiations in progress at this moment both in Mauritius and in the United Kingdom. The Customs and Excise are taking particular care to examine all the garments which are in question to see that they are indeed of the type described, and from Mauritius. It is being treated as a matter of urgency both in Mauritius and here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01218"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend tell me whether there are in fact any Shetland sheep in Mauritius?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01219"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I could attempt to find out and let the noble Viscount know, but I think that might be another question for another Minister.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INSURANCE COMPANIES<lb/>BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01233">3.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01234"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time. Your Lordships may be aware that insurance companies in Great Britain are at present authorised and supervised under the Insurance Companies Act 1974, while those in Northern Ireland are subject to separate, but virtually identical, Northern Ireland legislation. The Insurance Companies Bill, which I now commend to your Lordships, will establish a uniform regime by extending the 1974 Act and the relevant statutory instruments to Northern Ireland and repealing the Northern Ireland insurance companies legislation. I should like to stress at this stage that the Bill is basically a technical measure. It makes no material change to insurance supervision in this country.<lb/>
To set the Bill in context, your Lordships may find it helpful to be reminded of the two EEC Directives which have made the present Bill a necessary measure. First, the EEC non-life Directive, which was adopted in 1973, deals with general insurance business&#x2014;that is, non-life assurance business&#x2014;and it sets out common rules for the supervision of general insurance companies in all Member States of the Community. In Great Britain the Directive has been implemented by a series of regulations under the European Communities Act, notably those on classes of business, authorisation and the solvency of companies. The second Directive, which we shall call the EEC life Directive, was adopted earlier this year and deals in a similar fashion
<col>490</col>
with life assurance business. We hope to implement the terms of this Directive in a Bill which will be introduced early next Session.<lb/>
It is a requirement of both these Directives that an authorisation to carry on business shall be valid throughout the entire national territory. This, however, is not the present position in the United Kingdom, since insurance companies need separate authorisations to carry on business in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The main point of the Bill is to fulfill our EEC obligations. It is not an initiative that we would have taken in the absence of any Community legislation. But the Bill is useful, as it will eliminate any duplication of effort by the Department of Trade and the Department of Commerce in Belfast in supervising insurance companies.<lb/>
In theory it would have been possible to comply with the EEC requirement by extending the jurisdiction of both supervisory authorities to the whole of the United Kingdom, That, however, would only have compounded the unnecessary duplication of effort, since all companies authorised and supervised in Belfast in fact already have the separate authorisations at present needed to carry on business in Great Britain. In practice, it has been the Department of Trade that has taken the initiative in supervising all the companies concerned, with the Department of Commerce in Belfast tending to follow the lead from London. Therefore, it seems to make sense for the Department of Trade to be solely responsible for the authorisation and supervision of companies. I hope that the House will agree that the course outlined in the Bill, which avoids duplication of effort, is the right course to adopt.<lb/>
Some Members of your Lordships' House may wonder why we are not fulfilling this Community obligation by making regulations under the European Communities Act. This, however, would not be practicable in the present case. The relevant provisions of the European Communities Act can, of course, only be used to meet EEC obligations. In this case, it is necessary to go a little beyond the obligations of the Directives in question, which do not cover all insurance companies. All insurance companies are not covered because there are
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0254"/>
<col>491</col>
major exclusions&#x2014;mutuals and pure reinsurance companies. It would clearly be illogical to extend the 1974 Act to Northern Ireland for most companies but to leave the supervision of the rest with the Department of Commerce.<lb/>
The Bill itself is short and simple, though I admit that the six schedules which give detailed effect to the necessary changes are, at first sight, daunting. Your Lordships may find it helpful if I briefly run through the Bill. Clause I is the essential provision which extends the 1974 Act to Northern Ireland. Clause 2 and Schedule 1 provide for the amendments to the 1974 Act which will be necessary as a result of its extension. These range from the simple substitution of the words "United Kingdom" for "Great Britain" to amendments reflecting the continued existence of separate companies legislation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<lb/>
I should particularly like to draw the attention of noble Lords to amendments in Part II of Schedule 1 dealing with the two Industrial Assurance Commissioners for Great Britain and for Northern Ireland. Most of the Commissioners' present duties in relation to the supervision of companies and friendly societies carrying on industrial assurance business within their respective territories will be unaffected. The only change that the Bill will bring about is that, in future, regulations relating to the returns of industrial assurance companies will be made only by the Secretary of State for Trade. I am sure your Lordships will agree that this change is appropriate. It would not make sense, under a unified r&#x00E9;gime, for separate sets of regulations affecting the returns of insurance companies to be made by different authorities.<lb/>
Clause 3 extends to Northern Ireland the regulations that have been made in Great Britain under the 1974 Insurance Act and those made under the European Communities Act in fulfilment of EEC insurance obligations. The necessary technical modifications are set out at considerable length in Schedule 2. Clause 3 also deals with the one set of regulations&#x2014;namely, those requiring deposits from non-EEC companies&#x2014;that were not made in either of those ways but under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 and the Administration of Justice
<col>492</col>
Act 1965. The relevant provisions of both these Acts are also extended to Northern Ireland under the terms of this clause, but only for the purpose of the solvency regulations.<lb/>
The necessary consequential amendments to primary legislation are dealt with in Clause 4 and Schedule 3. I draw your Lordships' attention to subsection (2) of Clause 4 and above all to Schedule 4, which provide for the necessary saving and transitional provisions. The most important of these in practical terms, and the one that I should particularly like to draw to the attention of your Lordships, provides that companies operating in Great Britain will automatically be authorised to carry on business in Northern Ireland once the Bill is brought into force. As I have told your Lordships, all companies operating in Northern Ireland are in fact already authorised to carry on business in Great Britain.<lb/>
The remainder of Clause 4 and Schedules 5 and 6 deal with repeals. These relate mostly to Northern Ireland insurance companies legislation, but also include tidying-up legislation dealing with industrial assurance to reflect the change in the Commissioner's powers. Clause 5, the final clause, is conventional and I hope needs no further explanation.<lb/>
The abolition of the separate Northern Ireland supervision arrangements will have little effect on administration and there will be no increase in manpower in the Department of Trade, as that department is already supervising all the companies involved. There will be no decrease in manpower in the Department of Commerce in Belfast; the elimination of the limited amount of time it has in practice been spending on insurance companies will not be large enough to allow a reduction in manpower. In future this manpower will devote its time to general company matters. The abolition will not have any effect on public expenditure, but we hope that it will simplify slightly the reporting procedures which insurance companies operating in the United Kingdom will have to follow. The Bill is a technical and modest piece of legislation. It extends the principal insurance legislation in Great Britain, which is the 1974 Act, to Northern Ireland, and in so doing enables us to fulfil our EEC obligations. I commend the Bill to your Lordships. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE<lb/>PLANS 1980&#x2013;81</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01246">3.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01247"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it might be for the convenience of the House if at this stage I repeated a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. My right honourable friend said:
"Mr. Speaker, with permission I will make a Statement about the White Paper, published today, on the Government's expenditure plans for 1980&#x2013;81. Copies are available in the Vote Office.<lb/>
"The Government's strategy is to stabilise total public spending in volume terms. The outturn for last year, 1978&#x2013;79, is now put at &#x00A3;.69&#x00BE; billion at 1979 Survey prices. Estimates for the current year, 1979&#x2013;80, are still speculative, but the outturn is not expected significantly to exceed last year's expenditure. We plan to hold the total for next year, 1980&#x2013;81, at the same level.<lb/>
"Within the total planned for 1980&#x2013;81, provision is made for growth in some programmes, offset by reductions in others. Provision for defence increases by 3 per cent. in 1980&#x2013;81 over the expected outturn in the current year, and provision for law and order increases by 3&#x00BD;per cent. Expenditure on the National Health Service is maintained; while a rise in spending on social security partly reflects the recent pension uprating.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0256"/>
<col>495</col>
"For local authorities, the plans provide for a reduction of 3 per cent. in their capital and current expenditure over the two-year period, 1978&#x2013;79 to 1980&#x2013;81. The reduction in their current expenditure is rather less and in line with the figures on which they have been consulted. The allocation between services shown in the White Paper is tentative. It will be for the authorities themselves to decide the pattern of their current expenditure in the light of local needs and conditions.<lb/>
"The plans also provide for a further programme of public sector asset sales aimed at a figure of some &#x00A3;&#x00BD; billion in 1980&#x2013;81 compared with &#x00A3;1 billion in 1979&#x2013;80.<lb/>
"The Government consider that the plans in the White Paper take realistic account of the poor prospects for growth in the domestic and world economies, and of the need to bring government borrowing and the money supply under firm control without unacceptable consequences for taxation and interest rates. They will form the basis for setting the cash limits for 1980&#x2013;81.<lb/>
"The Government's general intention is to publish the cash limits in time for spending authorities to take account of them in making major decisions affecting their costs in 1980&#x2013;81, including the costs of pay settlements. We intend to exert a firm control on spending through the cash limits. Spending authorities must expect that, if they incur higher costs than provided for in the cash limits, it will not be possible to implement the full volume plans in this White Paper.<lb/>
"We aim to publish the cash limits on the rate support grants and the limits on the external financing requirements of the individual nationalised industries later this month. Other public service cash limits will be published nearer the start of the financial year.<lb/>
"The Government are also preparing provisional expenditure plans for the years up to 1983&#x2013;84. These will be published in a subsequent White Paper."<lb/>
My Lords, that ends my right honourable friend's Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<col>496</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01248">3.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01249"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on this side of the House wish to thank the noble Earl for having repeated this Statement. However, I am bound to say that what connection the Statement has with the Government White Paper itself, to which it is supposed to refer, I do not know. We were fortunately able, owing to the inadvertent and temporary absence of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, to obtain at 3.30 this afternoon a copy of the expenditure plan itself. It is possible, on only a cursory reading of it, to get some idea of the plan that the Government have in mind. In view of the importance of the plan itself as outlined in the White Paper, we on this side will of course request that the House has an opportunity for a full dress debate in Government time in order to discuss this most important document.<lb/>
When I listened to the Statement I found it a little odd that Sir Geoffrey Howe, on 26th October, should, in his own words, have detected that "a new spirit of adventure is alive". I think that must be the master over-statement of the year, because all the Statement contains is the same old dismal dirge to which we have become familiar in this country since the present Government took office. I warn the noble Earl when he replies not to rely too heavily on the oft-repeated assertion that all the unpleasant steps they are having to take are owing to the mistakes of their predecessors, because the steps they are taking are well in line with their election campaign.<lb/>
The assumptions underlying the Government White Paper surprise me, because one of the most important of them is that we shall not be able to reduce our budget deficit with the EEC by &#x00A3;1,000 million. Indeed, if one looks at page 10 of the White Paper one finds that it is at exactly the &#x00A3;1,000 million figure for the next year that was originally anticipated. But the Prime Minister in another place set the deadline of 29th November for this matter to be resolved. So the first indication we have&#x2014;and there has over the past few weeks been other evidence of wavering of her allegedly firm resolve&#x2014;and the first deduction we draw from the White Paper is that she will not get her &#x00A3;1,000 million or there-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0257"/>
<col>497</col>
abouts that she originally insisted upon at the Dublin Conference on 29th November. We shall have an opportunity at a later stage of commenting in greater detail on this surprising climb-down; but there it is, and &#x00A3;1,000 million is by no means "peanuts".<lb/>
The other assumption on which the White Paper is based&#x2014;I challenge the noble Earl to reply if I am wrong in my assumptions because I have not had time to read the White Paper in detail&#x2014;is that unemployment in this country will rise to roughly 2 million in the foreseeable future. It will be no good his replying to that by saying, "It all depends, of course, on what wage settlements are reached". What assumptions were made for the purpose of this White Paper? What assumptions were made of growth in the economy`? From my examination of it, there has been very little on that point and certainly nothing specific as to the rate of growth anticipated. What assumptions, then, have been made behind this planning?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01250"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has asked for a full-dress debate on this matter. There will of course be a debate on Wednesday in which a number of these points will be raised, and of course the matter will be discussed through the usual channels. I am not all that experienced in the rules of the House, but I have looked up how we should tackle these matters and I read that ministerial Statements are made for the information of the House; and although brief comments and questions for clarification are allowed, such Statements should not be made the occasion for an immediate debate unless the House so orders. I thought I would point that out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01251"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept the reproof of the noble Lord and I will be as brief as I possibly can in my remarks, although I am hound to say that the very structure of the Statement invites a certain amount of comment. The immediate consequences of the Statement are already discernible. Without doubt, the decrease in Government grants to local authorities will give rise in the forthcoming year to an increase in rates of about 40 per cent. It is also clear that the Statement anticipates cuts
<col>498</col>
in grants to the nationalised industries, in the money loaned to them, so that all improvements, or a substantial proportion of them, in the nationalised industries will have to be financed out of the consumers' pockets. There will be increases in the prices of gas, electricity and other goods supplied by the nationalised industries. All of those will lead to a rise in the RPI. So, by and large, one must, I am afraid, regard this Statement with considerable dismay.<lb/>
There will be increases, and indeed they are in the Statement itself, but I will not adumbrate on them. I observe that there is the intention at some future date, possibly next year, of giving grants to Rhodesia or to Rhodesian farm owners, on the assumption that independence goes through or under the assumption that there is a return to legality, and some millions of pounds will be going out of the public pocket in that way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01252">Several noble Lords: Order!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01253"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl indicate whether that is so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01254"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01255"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a thoroughly unsatisfactory Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01256"><member>Baroness SEEAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on these Benches would also like to thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. We take the line that we agree with the Government in the pre-eminent need to control inflation; therefore we accept that some cuts are essential and that no doubt considerable cuts will have to be made. At the same time we do not consider that the cuts that have been presented to us are sufficiently discriminating.<lb/>
The overall approach to cuts means that very little differentiation is made between cuts in one direction and another. In the pursuit of the control of inflation it is surely important to remember that there are two ways of controlling inflation: one is to cut expenditure and the other is to increase wealth. Some of these cuts are, in the middle and longer term, likely to decrease our wealth-creating capacity, and to that extent they are not anti-inflationary. For example, whereas we entirely support the refusal to pour
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0258"/>
<col>499</col>
public money into loss-creating industries, there surely remains a strong obligation for Government support to industry which will be increasingly wealth-reducing. The heavy reduction in the planned expenditure in industry suggests that it is very unlikely that such wealth-creating industry will get the kind of support it surely needs if, in the long run, we are to control inflation.<lb/>
Education, we see from the proposals in the White Paper, is to be cut. But education in the long-term is wealth-creating, and if we are to have any chance of getting the economy going again it is very poor economy to cut the services whereby we can produce the manpower which is able to be wealth-creating.<lb/>
Next, is it sufficiently discriminating in relation to different local authorities? After all, there are some local authorities which have done their utmost to see they keep their costs down. As I read this document&#x2014;and despite the welcome pause given to us by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for which we are grateful, it has inevitably been a very cursory examination of the proposals in the White Paper&#x2014;it looks as if those who have been the wise virgins will suffer along with the foolish. That is a poor reward for those local authorities which have done their utmost to cut down expenditure. Is there no way in which some discrimination can be made between local authorities which have been extremely economical and careful in the past and those which have been profligate?<lb/>
The final point I wish to make&#x2014;I shall be brief and I hasten to say that the 14 minutes' point does not apply to me&#x2014;is that there is no sign that the Government are tackling what is surely one of the major areas of the economy, and that is the whole structural apparatus of Government, which is extremely cumbersome, far too biased and extremely expensive. The noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, will recall the poem about little fleas having other fleas that on their backs do bite them. In our system of Government we have a very large number of people who are employed solely to look after other people who are employed in the bureaucracy to do other jobs, a very third and fourth-hand form of production. The need to cut down and simplify the structure of Government is surely of the first impor-
<col>500</col>
tance and one of the major areas in which economies could he made. We see no evidence in this White Paper that this is to be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01257"><member>Lord BROOKS of TREMORFA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords-&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01258"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will come back to the noble Lord in a few minutes. I am most grateful for the general philosophic support, if not detailed support, from the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, about the need to contain public expenditure. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, at least for the fact that he has to some degree revealed his hand for the subsequent debate that I am certain the usual channels will be able to arrange. I would say to both the noble Lord on the Opposition Bench and to the noble Baroness on the Liberal Bench that we must be a little discriminating in talking about cuts when the Government's whole strategy is really to try to stabilise public expenditure next year as well as this year. That, I should have thought, would be a laudable, and indeed even an adventurous, prospect, and one which is highly overdue.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, asked me about the EEC point, and I can assure him and the House that whatever can be worked out as to the timing&#x2014;and it is necessary in the context of the Community to try to cooperate with partners&#x2014;there is no waivering at all on this issue. Indeed, the White Paper itself, estimating a figure of about &#x00A3;1,000 million in 1980&#x2013;81 in net contributions to the EEC, says that this
<quote>"demonstrates the strength of the Government's case in pressing our Community partners to accept without delay a fundamental change in these arrangements".</quote>
The noble Baroness, Lady Seear, made the very wise and cogent point, in relation to local authorities, that the wise virgins (as she called them) should not suffer along with the foolish. I take that point absolutely, and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment is working on the unitary grant mechanism to see that the very anxiety that the noble Baroness rightly has does not in fact materialise. Turning to the point about our own efforts in our own backyard, I may say that, as is widely
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0259"/>
<col>501</col>
known and as has been said, my noble friend the Leader of the House is engaged in his exercise through the Civil Service Department to cut the size of bureaucracy generally. This is widely known, though I think it is outside the framework directly of this White Paper.<lb/>
The last point I would make on this matter is that, as my noble friend the Leader of the House said, we shall have an opportunity to come to some of these points at any rate&#x2014;or whichever points noble Lords may wish to take up&#x2014;in the debate about the Government's economic opportunities and challenges which my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft will be opening next Wednesday. I shall be winding up that debate, and perhaps I could take some of the points further at that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01259"><member>Baroness WOOTTON of ABINGER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Earl allow me one question? At the end of paragraph 15 of the White Paper there is a short sentence which reads:
<quote>"All expenditure figures in the following paragraphs are at constant, 1979 survey prices".</quote>
Am I not right in drawing the inference that this means that in relation to the figures shown, unless the Government are able to hold inflation at zero, there will be actual reductions in real terms?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01260"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Baroness is experiencing a very understandable confusion&#x2014;under-stantable, if I may say so, because that was the very question that I asked when I was being briefed on this issue. The point about the 1979 survey prices is that one has to have a price figure in order to calculate the volume of goods, services and transfer payments in the public sector. That is there for the calculation of the volume of the gross. When the cash limit system&#x2014;which the last Government instituted, and which we are continuing&#x2014;comes into play, those figures will of course be translated allowing for inflation. As was said in the original Statement by my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary (which I repeated), the figures relating to the local authorities will be published very shortly, and other figures will be published before the next Budget.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01261"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that it is in order to inquire at what
<col>502</col>
precise stage we shall be informed of the exact cuts that it is the intention of the Government to make in three fields in which I think many noble Lords have a particular interest; namely, the increase in students' fees, the exact amount of the cuts in the overseas programmes of the BBC, and cuts involving the British Council?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01262"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the very nature of expenditure White Papers is such that almost any issue may be raised, and that is why some of those points might be better taken up in a later debate. As I have said, we shall have an opportunity to debate this matter next week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01263"><member>Lord BROOKS of TREMORFA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington said, we have had the White Paper for only a very short time; and there is one problem that has been worrying me for some time. It is stated somewhere in the White Paper that the Government have no direct control over local government expenditure; of course we all know that to be true. But in paragraph 38 of the White Paper we are told that:
<quote>"Where reductions in standards of provision prove necessary, authorities will be relied upon to implement these in ways which protect the most vulnerable".</quote>
As the Government are not the final arbiter in these matters, do they have any plans to protect the most vulnerable in those areas of the country where local authorities do not carry out their proper responsibilities to the most vulnerable?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01264"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are of course all the time monitoring what local authorities do. That was true of the last Government, and it is certainly true of this Government. I think that the point is partly taken up by the answer I gave to the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, about the operation of the unitary grant system. However, I can assure the noble Lord that the whole thrust of the Government's policy in reducing or containing public expenditure is to concentrate aid on where it is most needed, and we have absolutely no intention of departing from that principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01265"><member>The Earl of PERTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the help of our Leader on a point. A short while ago he made
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0260"/>
<col>503</col>
a statement pointing out that it is one thing to discuss, or ask questions in relation to, the Statement and that it is quite another to debate, or ask questions about, the White Paper. It seems to me that many of the questions that have been asked subsequently have referred to the White Paper, which I think the great majority of us have not had an opportunity to see. So I would hope that the ruling that I understood&#x2014;namely, that we should discuss, or ask questions about, only the Statement and not the White Paper, and that the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, should not answer questions about the latter&#x2014;will be observed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01266"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; I understand that this is the right procedure. The House expects that when a Statement is made it should be followed by questions which relate essentially to that Statement. That was the burden of what I read out to the House. I had a feeling that questions on this particular subject were rapidly coming to an end, but we could discuss this matter through the usual channels if there is any doubt. However, generally speaking, I think the situation is appreciated by the House, and I hope that we can move on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01267"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister whether I correctly understood him to say that the Government will be notifying cash limits to local government later this month? May I ask him whether their notification to the local authorities will specify particular cuts for particular services? May I also ask him whether he will circulate this information to the local authorities as early as possible, because it is my recollection, as a former county council chairman and a former county finance committee chairman for many years, that it was sometime in November when we used to get down to the job of planning the coming year's estimates?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01268"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Leatherland, it is, I think, conventional under all Governments that information about the rate support grant is available to local authorities in November, and we are not changing that position at all.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NORTHERN IRELAND: <lb/>GOVERNMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01269">4.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01270"><member>Lord DUNLEATH</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will now design a frameworth whereby a locally elected administrative assembly providing for participation from all sections of the community can be established in Northern Ireland as a first step towards devolution of legislative powers to such an elected body in the Province. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper. I should perhaps explain that I tabled this Question early in September, well aware that Her Majesty's Government might well come out with a statement of intent before the Question was in fact asked. However, I still think it is worth debating, and I am reinforced in that view by the number of noble Lords who have honoured me by putting their names down to speak to the Question this afternoon. In particular, I should like to welcome the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, who has been good enough to come here to make his maiden speech today. In extending to him every good wish, I greatly look forward to hearing what he has to say, as he is an experienced parliamentarian, having for many years represented a constituency in another place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01271">My Lords, two reasons prompted me to ask this Question. First, I believe that a state of political uncertainty is dangerous and can be a breeding ground for terrorism, for as long as the terrorists think that the Government have nothing in mind they will be encouraged to continue their activities in the hope that they will be able to influence events. In addition to that, it denies the peaceful majority, who believe in democracy and policy-making through the ballot box rather than by the bullet, the opportunity for political expression. The second reason is that as a local councillor myself I share the frustration felt by many of my colleagues and their constituents at our lack of effectiveness. If a councillor or indeed an entire council, wants to get something done, or perhaps even prevent something being done which is against the wishes of the ratepayers, the final resort is to appeal to the Minister; and, with no disrespect to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0261"/>
<col>505</col>
Ministers, in nearly every case, after a period, you get an answer from the Minister which is almost identical to the one you received from the senior civil servant, the main difference being that it is signed by the Minister and not by the civil servant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01272">Both these factors, I think, contribute to a dangerous social climate, because citizens feel that perhaps the Government have lost interest in them and that the only people who get anything done are those who resort to violence. I am glad that the Secretary of State made an announcement in another place last week. In Northern Ireland, another thing which contributes to the danger of the situation is the high level of unemployment, the high cost of living and, therefore, the low standard of living. Indeed, to contemplate the parallels with Germany in the early 1930s is quite disturbing. When people are perplexed, dismayed and even in despair, they tend to look to anyone who has assumed for himself the mantle of a saviour, however irrational that may be or however loud-mouthed the self-appointed, aspiring saviour may be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01273">My Lords, I would emphasise that, in suggesting to Her Majesty's Government that they should consider designing a framework for the establishment of an administrative assembly, I am not for a moment thinking that this is the panacea for all our ills, or will be the ultimate solution. I merely feel that, for the reasons have stated already, it is time that something happened; and, if any noble Lord has a better idea, I shall be delighted to hear it and, if possible, support it. I venture to say that because in my experience your Lordships have alway been helpful, constructive and sympathetic in debates on Northern Ireland affairs. In today's debate I am quite happy for noble Lords to disagree with me, and will accept correction with humility; but the reason why I am taking up the time of the House today with this Question is because I think that some initiative is called for.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01274">In passing, I should say that the term "political initiative" has recently been somewhat distorted. It has almost been read as being a sop towards the terrorists. But nothing is further from my mind. What I contemplate is an initiative which
<col>506</col>
will give some hope to the vast majority of decent, peace-loving people in Northern Ireland, and which will also enhance the quality of government at all levels. It is a facet of human nature to want something to which you can be loyal, and I would hope that such an agreed administrative assembly would be something which could command the loyalty and allegiance of all the people in Northern Ireland. The only people who will not agree to it are the terrorists. In fact, it would not matter what constructive political initiative we came up with, the terrorists would not agree to it. With regard to the latter, I may say that I am not so naive as to think that a political initiative will make them go away. The terrorists can be defeated only by the security forces, whom we wholeheartedly support. In passing, I would say that the only people in Ireland who give any support to the "troops out" movement are the IRA and their fellowtravellers&#x2014;and I am talking of both North and South of the Border.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01275">If that victory over terrorists, from whatever quarter they come&#x2014;so-called loyalist or republican&#x2014;is to be achieved, there are two main weapons which can be used. One is the readiness of the population as a whole to supply information to the security forces; and the other is a sense of unity of purpose among that population, so that the terrorists can feel they have no possibility of achieving their objectives. Whereas a sense of despair in the community tends to help the destroyers, a sense of hope and of purpose helps those who build rather than those who want to cast down.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01276">My Lords, having tried to explain the thinking which lies behind my suggestion, I must now turn to practicality. What is likely to do some good; and, equally important, what is likely to work? In my opinion, there are five possible courses of action that could he taken in respect of the Northern Ireland problem&#x2014;the Irish problem as a whole, for that matter. The first would be to declare that direct rule is going to continue indefinitely, so there is no point in going on talking about devolution; and to hope that thereby things would simmer down and normality would be restored. This is quite arguable, I think, and I believe it is the view of the Northern Ireland Labour Party that this would be the right thing to do: to cut out
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0262"/>
<col>507</col>
talk about devolution and declare that direct rule will continue, with no further argument&#x2014;and I very much look forward to hearing what the noble Lord, Lord Blease, will have to say in due course. I am afraid that I personally do not adhere to that view; I think it would not provide a solution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01277">The second option would be to resuscitate the Irish dimension so as to bring Northern Ireland a move or two closer to unity with the Republic of Ireland. If that was difficult 10 years ago, I think it is 10 times as difficult today. I am afraid the communities are further polarised. But there is one thing that the majority have in common. At least two-thirds of the population in Northern Ireland, mainly Protestant but quite a few of them Roman Catholic, do not want to leave the United Kingdom; and, therefore, you get no consensus over that at all&#x2014;and, after all, it is consensus that we are talking about.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01278">The third option would be to move further towards total integration, but to give more power to local councils; and I know that this is an option which is favoured by a right honourable Member in another place. Indeed, it was an option favoured by the Unionists in 1920. But, subsequent to that, devolution worked sufficiently well for it to be hard to escape the conclusion that devolution should be the answer&#x2014;provided, and this is the cardinal point, that all sides of the community could be brought along with it and involved. Of course, the Stormont Government made mistakes, but at least Ministers were able to give closer personal attention to local problems than is perhaps the case at the-moment. One of the main difficulties about this option is perhaps the matter of increased powers for local government. The Social Democratic and Labour Party was founded against a background of objection to the abuses of local government power which had previously taken place and it would not countenance any suggestion of further powers being devolved to local government. The Alliance Party would not countenance it either. So there again, there is no consensus.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01279">Also included in the third option has been the possibility of having an upper tier of local government, maybe with a small number of regional councils.
<col>508</col>
Personally, I think that the SDLP would not agree to that either. It could mean another layer of bureaucracy that would have to be gone through, and, rather than being a step towards devolved legislative power again, I personally think that it would be unproductive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01280">My Lords, the fourth option would be for Northern Ireland to become independent. I believe that that would be an absolute disaster economically, socially, politically and on the security front. It is for that reason that I suggest the fifth option. As I have already said, if any noble Lords have a better idea, I should like to hear it&#x2014;and I am sure they will have. However, my suggestion is that we should try to get an administrative assembly into operation. This would be elected by proportional representation and have the same number of members as did the 1973 legislative assembly. The latter assembly started to go quite well, but the Irish dimension in the form of the Council of Ireland was the main stumbling block. That was the main thing which caused the Ulster workers' stoppage in 1974 and which brought down the Executive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01281">A secondary difficulty which caused the experiment to fail was the composition of the Executive. My party was broadly in favour of the power-sharing principle, but it was open to the criticism that if any one section of the Executive walked out and declined to continue in office the Executive would no longer be able to operate within its terms of reference.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01282">My Lords, to try to overcome these difficulties and to try to make some political progress, what I am now suggesting is that the Government should give consideration to designing a framework whereby an administrative assembly could be elected without any Irish dimension at all and, at least at the start, without an Executive. It has been said already and will be said again that that would be merely a talking shop. I do not necessarily regard that as being a derogatory criticism. I believe that communication by means of talking is infinitely preferable to communication by means of destruction of life and property.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01283">Perhaps the main area in which my proposal differs from the suggested upper tier of local government is that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0263"/>
<col>509</col>
there would be one assembly which would meet regularly in the Parliament Building, Stormont, and would have the services of the Clerks and also of the<i>Official Report</i> A significant factor would would be that, in the first instance at any rate, while there was no Executive, Ministers would be answerable on occasions to Members' Questions at the Dispatch Box, so that those Questions, the Answers and the supplementary questions would be open to public scrutiny. I think that that would do a lot to dispel the impression which exists at the moment that the country is being governed by civil servants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01284">Most important of all is the consideration that, if such an assembly could be got off the ground and could achieve a reasonable working arrangement, then there should be no reason why, after a while, for a start, non-controversial matters such as agriculture, the road service and the water service should not be considered as topics for legislative devolution, thus getting legislative devolution by stages. There are other more controversial issues that would take longer, but if we could get just the element of trust built up, that would be the first and most important step.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01285">In the absence of an Executive, it might be worth considering the committee system of Government, which, I believe, has in many ways worked quite well elsewhere. In order to avoid loading the assembly and its committees in any direction, I suggest that the committee members and their chairman be elected from the Floor of the House on a system of proportionality, and it might be possible to rotate chairmanships or to have joint chairman so that it would not look as though there was a Cabinet by another name. Maybe any party which had more than 10 per cent. representation in the assembly would qualify to nominate a chairman.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01286">I envisage that the committees would have two roles in the first instance. The first would be to administer the law as it presently stands. For example, the Government would set out a budget for road works and the committee dealing with the roads would decide how that budget was to be allocated and where the money was to be spent. The second role
<col>510</col>
would be consultative: the committees would advise the Minister in the light of their administrative experience how best the law could be changed to allow it to be more easily and more efficiently administered.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01287">However, I am neither a parliamentary draftsman nor a demographer. I am merely trying to float ideas in the hope of making something happen. That is important. I shall listen with great interest to what other noble Lords say. We who live in Northern Ireland are aware that the vast majority of people have no desire to be associated with violence but rather want to live in peace while seeing political progress being made. They are the people in whom our future lies; they are the people who have kept working despite adversity; they are the people in whom, provided we can give them some hope and show that a direction is being pursued and progress is being made, the salvation of our province lies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01288">In conclusion, my Lords, and in view of what I have said already, I would seriously suggest to the noble Lord on the Front Bench that Her Majesty's Government, instead of producing a consultative document, should produce a White Paper setting out firm proposals. I salute the Secretary of State for having summoned a conference of the Northern Ireland political parties. I only wish that I could be optimistic that it will produce anything. The official Unionists, the last time T heard, had indicated that they would not attend because they said they thought it would be a waste of time. I am sorry about that. But I think that it is for this reason that it is essential for Her Majesty's Government to put the onus on the Northern Ireland political parties to be constructive rather than destructive. I think it is important that they should be made to think how best Her Majesty's Government's proposals could be made to work, rather than trying to think why suggestions from Her Majesty's Government will not work. This is the sort of initiative that I believe is required.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01289">4.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01290"><member>Lord HAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for putting down this important Question,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0264"/>
<col>511</col>
following, as it has turned out, the Statement made by the Secretary of State last week in the other place and repeated here. I also look forward very much to hearing the maiden speech of the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn. I have listened with great interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, has said, and I should like to make it plain that if I make alternative suggestions I speak as one putting my Party view. I have no great experience of Northern Irish affairs. Above all, we want to be constructive and not destructive.<lb/>
May I refer back to the Liberal Assembly in September, when a resolution there was overwhelmingly accepted? It called for as follows: the setting up of an advisory council of 15 to 20 members elected by proportional representation by the single transferable vote from one province-wide constituency. It was also stated that the functions of this council would be twofold: first, to represent the views of the people of Northern Ireland to the Secretary of State and advise him accordingly; and, secondly, to discuss how a constitutional conference should be set up to consider the means by which a generally acceptable form of government for the Province should be developed. I submit that the seeming rejection already (as referred to by the noble Lord) by some of the parties concerned of the idea of a conference, as proposed by the Secretary of State, suggests that it is only possible to make haste slowly by electing an advisory council first. It is at least arguable&#x2014;and others may disagree with me on this point&#x2014;that the suggestion of the need for great haste is largely fabricated by the anti-British lobby. None the less, we have no wish ourselves to obstruct the Government in their endeavours.<lb/>
It would certainly be unwise of me to lecture noble Lords from the Province about their past history, but I believe that Lord Dunleath's Question has a distinct echo of what has already been tried and failed. It may be argued that one just has to keep on trying. I suggest that points in favour of our scheme would be, first, that it has not been tried before; secondly, that the initiative and the responsibility would be in the hands of chosen representatives of Northern Ireland voters; and thirdly, that it would not try
<col>512</col>
to do too much too quickly. By electing not more than 20 members, using the single transferable vote&#x2014;and I will spare the House further arguments about that as a method of voting&#x2014;in one overall constituency, a manageable-sized body would be set up representing all parties in the community. Following the Pope's appeal for peace, reconciliation and cooperation among politicians, it must be most sincerely hoped that reason will then prevail and steady progress be made towards a fully devolved assembly, with legislative as well as executive powers.<lb/>
May I end by referring to an article which appeared in the<i>Daily Telegraph</i>on Monday 29th October? In this Mr. Stephen Barber described a programme put out by American television which he said was heavily biased against Britain and was undisguisedly out to discredit our troops serving in the Province. Mr. Stephen Barber claimed that in fact soldiers in Ulster are safer than citizens in Washington. I should like to put the following question to the noble Lord, Lord Elton: what steps are being taken to see that the truth about Northern Ireland is broadcast to the people in the United States alongside&#x2014;alas!&#x2014;the prejudiced and misleading information that is so often put to them at present?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01291">4.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01292"><member>The Duke of ABERCORN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that your Lordships will give me the indulgence of the House during my maiden speech. I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for initiating this important and indeed opportune debate, and for putting forward such positive proposals for deliberation and consideration. Although the political situation in Northern Ireland is indeed in a state of flux and uncertainty, I believe that the Government are right in putting forward a consultative document for consideration. If a successful assembly were to emerge as a result of the proposed conference, that would certainly assist in underpinning the stability of a country which is of the utmost importance.<lb/>
Therefore, since it is obvious that a political proposal cannot succeed if imposed from outside, the local politicians in Northern Ireland owe it both to the people of Northern Ireland and to the people of Great Britain to consider
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0265"/>
<col>513</col>
seriously the contents of this document prior to premature or hasty judgment. After two genuine attempts to create a political forum in Northern Ireland, it would certainly be wise to attempt to achieve legislative devolution by stages; therefore a modest approach to this concept is essential. In principle, I am in agreement with the majority of the proposals put forward by the noble Lord, particularly that a future assembly should be elected by proportional representation, and, again, that the Northern Ireland Office Ministers would be answerable at the Dispatch Box to Members' questions.<lb/>
In putting forward a few additional brief comments for consideration, I should like to emphasise the fact that I am not affiliated to any political party in Northern Ireland&#x2014;I did not add the word "happily"&#x2014;so these thoughts are solely my own. Unfortunately, in recent years Northern Ireland has become more and more a bureaucratic Utopia, resulting in unnecessary and time-consuming problems being created particularly affecting the job creators in our society. For instance, there is excessive control over planning for industrial requirements, and many industrial enterprises are inundated by visits from officials and inspectors. These are but two examples of the direct result of the current political vacuum in the country. Again, any peripheral area of the United Kingdom has a sense of remoteness both from London and, in particular, Brussels. Remoteness, in my view, is not only a geographical problem but also a breakdown in communication. The people of Northern Ireland feel an additional sense of remoteness since the bureaucratic machine acts as an excessive buffer between them and the Northern Ireland Office.<lb/>
If one accepts the fact that communication can succeed only in a situation of a genuine two-way flow of opinion and ideas, then I strongly suggest that priority for any future assembly should be to advise the Northern Ireland Office on local problems, concerns and aspirations. In its later years, Stormont failed to be an articulate voice in the interests of industry, commerce and the trade unions. Thus these essential ingredients of our society were not adequately represented. Owing to current pressure of work and the existing political climate in Northern
<col>514</col>
Ireland, it is most unlikely that adequate representation would be forthcoming in the event of a new assembly. This is most unfortunate and restricting, since a broad spectrum of elected opinion is essential for the good of the community.<lb/>
Again since Northern Ireland faces severe economic and social problems, it is very important that those problems affecting both sides of industry should be centrally aired. Therefore I believe that representatives of industry, commerce, the Church, trade unions and the agricultural community should be<i>ex-officio</i> members of any future assembly, with full voting powers. I accept that this proposal might compromise public positions, but it should be remembered that these constructive forces in our society have a knowledge, but up to date have been denied the opportunity to articulate their thoughts in organised debate.<lb/>
Again, I think that much, if not the bulk, of the work of any future assembly should be carried out in committee sessions which could divert potential political passion from the floor of the House into far more constructive work in committee sessions. I am in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, that the chairmanship of these committees should be divided among the respective parties. Again, the function of the committees would be not only to examine legislation and departmental policy but also to take initiatives and to produce opinions on current relevant matters, such as, for instance: should the Northern Ireland Development Agency be merged with another job-creating agency, namely, the local Enterprise Development Unit? And should the Northern Ireland Development Agency become a department within the Department of Commerce?<lb/>
These committees could appoint experts who would act as advisers on the subjects under discussion but who would have no voting powers. For example, if the Health Department produced an opinion on the proposed down-grading of a certain hospital, then the representatives of the medical profession, the area hospital boards and the trade unions would act as experts to assist in the formulation of information which, if approved by the assembly with a majority vote, could be forwarded to the Northern Ireland Office for consideration and deliberation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0266"/>
<col>515</col>
Again, the staff of the European Commission could be invited to attend in order to explain Community policy, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the Social Fund and the Regional Development Fund. I understand from sources in Brussels that in fact this proposal is feasible. Thus, my Lords, these hearings would involve local elected representatives and local expertise and experience in a cross-fertilisation of ideas and view-points with the Government.<lb/>
In conclusion, I would foresee the role of any future assembly as concentrating more on economic and social matters, which are of the utmost importance for the Province, rather than being a traditional political debating forum.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01294"><member>The Lord Bishop of CHELMSFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the privilege falls to me of being the first to congratulate the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, on his maiden speech, and to thank him for it. If that is an example of the quality of his speeches, we look forward very much to hearing him again in the future and we welcome him to this House. May I also express gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for asking this Question and also for the thought-provoking speech he made in introducing it. I have also to offer apologies to him and to your Lordships' House in that I shall have to leave before the end of the debate. It is All Saints' Day and I have an engagement elsewhere. I think your Lordships may take comfort in the knowledge that "All Saints" comprises both Catholics and Protestants.<lb/>
If I may recap a little, since 1972, when Stormont was abolished, the Province of Northern Ireland has had only one period, amounting to about six months only, when it has enjoyed a measure of self-government. That was the first half of 1974, when the power-sharing Executive was in control. That Executive had limited powers, particularly as regards legislation. Its significance lay in the fact that the two communities in the Province had shown a willingness to work together on local planning matters and to accept responsibility for their decisions. That brave experiment was brought down by the Protestant workers' fight. Later
<col>516</col>
the Labour Government of the day set up a constitutional convention, but in 1976 rejected its proposals, as they did not meet the requirements for effective power-sharing which the Government had laid down.<lb/>
Since then there have been only desultory conversations between the Government and local political parties, but no new proposals for political advance. A political vacuum, as we well know, has resulted with growing frustration. There was in fact a striking contrast between this situation and the frenzy of constitution-building for Scotland and Wales which was going on at the same time&#x2014;and all to little avail.<lb/>
However, since the present Government took Office Mr. Humphrey Atkins, the Secretary of State, as we know, has held conversations with all the principal political parties in the Province, though he refuses to talk with Sinn Fein because of its link with the IRA. He has spoken of his desire to see political advance in the Province and the Government have underlined their commitment to retaining the Union, though it may be assumed that this is dependent upon the proviso, which I quote&#x2014;
<quote>"so long as this is desired by a clear majority of the people of the Province".</quote>
The last Conservative Government's constitutional proposals laid down that effective participation by both communities must be an element in any acceptable form of constitutional structure. It will be interesting to hear what the present Government's thinking is on this. Mr. Atkin's statement in another place on 25th October made no reference to specific requirements in regard to participation by both communities, though he did say that:
<quote>"There is &#x2026; awareness that such a restoration of political responsibility can be brought about in Northern Ireland only by all parts of the community recognising and respecting the interests of others".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 25/10/79; col. 425.] ;</quote>
and that the Government's own proposals on transferred power would include "reasonable and appropriate" arrangements to take account of the interests of the minority: nothing there of joint participation.<lb/>
The Secretary of State and his colleagues in the Cabinet may, I trust, be encouraged
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0267"/>
<col>517</col>
by some signs of hope&#x2014;some of them recent and some not quite so recent. There is evidence of a willingness among politicians on both sides of the border to criticise their own<i>id&#x00E9;es fixes</i> about the future of Northern Ireland and to put forward for public discussion new proposals. The Government of the Republic has recently modified its previous policy in regard to the North. Since 1975 the Fianna Fail Party, now in power, has pressed for a British commitment to withdraw from the Province in advance of an agreed constitutional settlement in the Province. However, on 17th October Mr. Lynch, the Prime Minister, said in the Dail that their immediate priority now was devolved administration with the support of both communities in Ulster. The Opposition leader, Dr. Fitzgerald, pointed out that once that is achieved pressure for a British withdrawal becomes largely irrelevant in any case.<lb/>
There is also hope in the recent signs of more effective co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic on matters of security. Further, the principal Opposition party in the Republic recently published outline proposals for an Irish Confederation consisting of two States. These proposals are based on the view that the long-term interests, economic and political, of Northern Ireland lie in some connection with the Republic. They also, however, take seriously the deep distrust of many in the North of what would be involved in union with the Republic, with its present commitment, constitution and policies. This cannot be overemphasised.<lb/>
For example, the visit of the Pope to Ireland was universally welcomed by all but a few, and his total and passionate denunciation of violence as a political instrument deeply impressed the whole world. We thank God for that and for much else arising from that visit. Yet the fact is that many in Northern Ireland dread the Catholic Gaelic ascendency, which they see across the border and which they fear, rightly or wrongly, may have been strengthened in its conservatism by the Pope's visit.<lb/>
There are also signs of this awareness in the Republic itself. In a letter to the<i>Irish Times</i> recently, Senator Mary Robinson of the<i>Dail</i>wrote thus:
<col>518</col>
<quote>"We have not examined meticulously our own Constitution and laws, our cultural attitudes and our religious practices to ensure that they would reflect upon us and show us to be a people who respect and cherish different cultural traditions, different religions and moral values in certain areas and different attitudes to historic events. It is not that we should make changes in these areas simply in order to attract Northern Protestants to like us; it is that we should want to make these changes because as a people we have changed".</quote>
In quoting that I am aware, naturally, that in 1972 the Government of Eire made a start by amending Article 44 of the constitution of that country, which had before that given particular recognition to the Roman Catholic Church, over and above other Churches and other religions.<lb/>
There are evidences of a similar movement of thought in the North. For example, proposals emerged some time ago, interestingly enough, from a political study group set up by the principal loyalist para-military body&#x2014;the UDA. They call it, significantly, "Beyond the Religious Divide", and they take their start from the judgment that without an agreed constitutional settlement Northern Ireland electors are unlikely to begin to vote for politicians who do not share their own religious beliefs, even if they sympathise with their policies. They opt for negotiated independence for the Province, backed by a 25-year financial commitment by the British Government. Economic studies appended to the document argue that in such circumstances Northern Ireland could be economically viable. Whatever the merits of these proposals, it reflects a remarkable evolution of the UDA when they are seen to be prepared not only to engage in political analysis, but also to formulate proposals so much at variance with traditional Unionist views.<lb/>
Similarly, the IRA, on their part, produced their own views in which Ulster would be one of the four provinces of a united Ireland. Much more could be said, but obviously fundamental questions must be faced in regard to all these suggestions. They may not be dismissed as the vain imaginings of unemployed politicians, still less those of mindless hooligans.<lb/>
The United Kingdom Government will publish during the next fortnight a consultative document putting forward pro-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0268"/>
<col>519</col>
posals of their own for constitutional development. This will be submitted for discussion to the conference which the Government are hoping to convene before the end of November. It is believed that the Government may wish to introduce a greater measure of local political responsibility for existing local government functions.<lb/>
At present, housing is dealt with by a single authority for the whole Province, health and social services by four area boards and schools and libraries by five area boards. Although local authorities nominate representatives to these boards, they are not accountable to the electorates. Remaining local government functions are handled by local authorities. Reforms of local government introduced in 1972 in the McCrory reforms, of which much was hoped, presupposed that the provincial legislature would be politically responsible for all local government functions. The abolition of Stormont deprived all the reformed structure of its element of political answerability.<lb/>
There would therefore seem to be a good case for democratic institutions to oversee local government functions, at least to start, and we have already heard suggestions along these lines. In addition, the local administration should have responsibility for economic policy within the overall framework of United Kingdom policies. The Province of Northern Ireland is economically the most disadvantaged part of the United Kingdom&#x2014;unemployment is as high as 40 per cent. in some places&#x2014;and it will suffer disproportionately as a result of current Government economic policies, not least because the Government have refused to treat it as a special case. Giving a devolved administration, some say, over economic policies may be a way of developing local confidence and transcending communal divides. At present, even Unionists feel that the Province is neglected by a London-based Government.<lb/>
The initial response by the Irish parties to Mr. Atkins' proposal for a conference has been disappointingly suspicious. However, we in Britain need, in our turn, to avoid impatient reactions to the Ulster politicians. Sadly, the two Unionist parties represent a fragmented and weak
<col>520</col>
shadow of the party which once represented the majority community, and the non-Paisleyite groups are paralysed by the hypnotic effect of Mr. Paisley on Protestant grass-roots opinion, not least when IRA violence seems to be on the increase. The SDLP, too, is condemned to frustration as a party of a permanent minority, and in addition is genuinely ambivalent about its long-term loyalties&#x2014;whether to the United Kingdom or to Dublin?<lb/>
To conclude, the point needs to be made that while it is necessary&#x2014;indeed, imperative&#x2014;to explore yet again expedients for political partnership between the communities at the provincial level, this can bear fruit only if it is complemented by a partnership at more local levels and in non-political contexts ; for example, in ecumenical advances, in community development and in reconciliation projects. Political solutions will not solve everything, all-important as they are. There are many other long-standing and deep wounds which must be healed before peace comes to Ireland. Here, again, there are very many signs of hope. On a recent visit to Ireland, I stayed at Corrymeela, which is known over the world for its work of reconciliation, and which draws many of its voluntary helpers from the four corners of the world. That is the most famous place of reconciliation, I suppose, but there are many others.<lb/>
If it should seem peculiar that a Londoner of rather dubious and ancient Celtic extraction should be speaking on this subject, let me say that twice a year for the last five years I have gone across with a group of senior churchmen of all Churches, chosen by the British Council of Churches, to meet the leaders of the Irish Churches, to share their problems and to hear their views. It so happens, too, that I am chairman of a fund called the Fund for Ireland, which was set up by the British Council of Churches to provide aid to those engaged in ecumenical community development activities which are taking place now all over that island. We receive numberless requests for help, very often for very small things such as getting a minibus or setting up some kind of committee or a holiday fund. Other people, of course, are engaged in similar activity: the Peace People in particular on a much larger scale, and other bodies. The important point is that these appeals
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0269"/>
<col>521</col>
and requests for help reflect the dedicated and, let it be said, often dangerous work of reconciliation which is carried on by thousands of men and women all over Ireland at this very moment. They are doing the real bridge-building, and especially are they doing it among the children and young people who are the real victims of the ghastly situation which they face. This is the building which will one day bring peace to Ireland.<lb/>
I pray that we on this side of the Irish Sea, especially in this House and in the other place, may be aware of and do our part in supporting this work by backing the political iniatives we hope for. To do this effectively, all of us need to develop our thinking, as I suggest has been done on the other side of the Irish Sea, so that we understand more deeply for ourselves the complexities of the deep, long-standing and sincere convictions which in Ireland keep good people apart and too often unjustifiably lead evil men to ruthless slaughter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01296"><member>The Earl of LONGFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we have all been encouraged by the last words of the right reverend Prelate. He has told us about the ecumenical work in which he has been involved, with many others, in recent years. I think we would agree that this would have been impossible 20 years ago. So when we are discouraged by certain developments at the ballot box, or when we read of some appalling murder like that of Lord Mountbatten, we must remember the solid work which is going on; and 20 years from now who knows what the future will hold?<lb/>
May I also join the right reverend Prelate in congratulating the noble Duke on his maiden speech. The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, forecast, whether deliberately or not I do not know, that the noble Duke would make a noble speech. He has made a noble and also a very thoughtful and constructive speech. Speaking as a member of one of the lower orders of the Peerage, I would suggest that we do not hear often enough these days from the Dukes. So I hope the noble Duke will begin to put that right. We shall all want to hear him very often, whether in that capacity or in any other.<lb/>
<col>522</col>
I should certainly like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, on initiating this debate. No doubt some people will say that the timing is not quite right. In my experience, the timing is never quite right for any controversial debate, but I think that this is the perfect timing. His speech has been delivered at a moment when Government policy is still in formation. I should have thought that if a debate was ever going to influence Government policy it would be a debate initiated about now.<lb/>
I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, has left us. He made some thoughtful remarks but he seemed to be advising us to read the<i>Daily Telegraph</i>if we want to get a fair and objective view of Irish affairs. That, I should have thought, was somewhat fantastic. I do not want to make too much of the issue in the noble Lord's absence, but may I recall a passage in the<i>Daily Telegraph.</i> I read the<i>Daily Telegraph</i>at the moment because of the absence of its rival<i>The Times,</i>but perhaps not for much longer. Not so very long ago the<i>Daily Telegraph</i>returned to the often-told story that the Duke of Wellington, when accused of being Irish, said, "Because you are born in this stable, it does not make you a horse". A lady with whom I have been associated for many years and who has studied the Duke of Wellington for reasons best known to herself, assures me that it is extremely doubtful whether he said any such thing. However, the<i>Daily Telegraph</i>improved on that and said that the Duke of Wellington, when taxed with being an Irishman, said, "Because you are born in this stable, it does not make you a donkey". That is, roughly speaking, the degree to which the<i>Daily Telegraph</i>distorts in these latter days the news about Ireland.<lb/>
I am so pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, is to reply to the debate. I owe my conversion to Socialism to the noble Lord's father who wrote a wonderful book called<i>England Arise!</i> Just about the time he was converting me to Socialism he himself was moving in the opposite direction, but I shall never cease to be grateful for that early inspiration supplied by the noble Lord's father.<lb/>
Since I am bestowing so many bouquets, I should like to congratulate a gentleman who cannot be with us, the Secretary of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0270"/>
<col>523</col>
State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Atkins. He has had what one might call a rather critical press. However, some others of us have had that in our time and have survived, so I am sure that the Secretary of State will come through. He is to be heartily congratulated on this initiative; I do not think there should be any doubt about that. I would view with suspicion anybody who criticised the initiative. I think it was Mr. Duff Cooper when he was Minister of Information during the war who, when anybody said anything which he did not like, asked "Are you a paid or unpaid agent of Hitler?" Anybody who criticises Mr. Atkins might be asked that same question: Are you a paid or an unpaid agent of the IRA or the UVF?" It is so obvious that some initiative of this kind ought to be taken.<lb/>
Reference was made to the Pope. I imagine that the right reverend Prelate was not present when the Pope was speaking in Ireland. If he had been present among those vast crowds, I assume that he would not have come away with the feeling that the Pope was making things more difficult and that in some way he was increasing the divide between North and South. I honestly do not think that anybody who was there could possibly have thought that. I was not at Drogheda when the Pope made a speech which came nearest to the political question, but I was at Phoenix Park and at Knock.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01297"><member>The Lord BISHOP of CHELMSFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that it was felt by some in Northern Ireland that the Pope had this effect. It was not my opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01298"><member>The Earl of LONGFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was no doubt thought by Mr. Paisley, but he might have been a little biased to start with. My impression was that the Pope's speech was very well received in Northern Ireland. We shall hear from the speakers who have come here today from Northern Ireland who will be able to tell us whether or not that is so. Taking the Pope's speech at Drogheda, I should like to read one passage from it which I think can fairly be used in support of the argument advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, that now is the time for an initiative to be taken. This is the passage from what the Pope said at Drogheda:
<col>524</col>
<quote>"Those who resort to violence always claim that only violence brings about change. They claim that political action cannot achieve justice. You politicians must prove them to be wrong. You must show that there is a peaceful, political way to justice. You must show that peace achieves the works of justice and violence does not &#x2026; If politicians do not decide and act for just change, then the field is left open to the men of violence. Violence thrives best when there is a political vacuum and a refusal of political movement".</quote>
I take it that that puts in papal language the thoughts, or some of the thoughts, laid before us by the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath.<lb/>
Nobody can surely deny at the present time that there is a political vacuum in Northern Ireland. Whether or not that continues is the direct responsibility of Her Majesty's Government. However, it is the responsibility of all of us in public life, in particular the leaders of Opposition parties, in our various ways to back up the attempt to find a solution. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland seems to understand this very well. I have high hopes of him. I hesitate to congratulate him too much because it might damage him with the powers-that-be in the Conservative Party. But without embarrassing him I can go so far as to adapt words used by Lord Butler about Sir Anthony Eden, as he then was: that Mr. Atkins is the best Northern Ireland Secretary that we have got. I would go further and describe him as the best Northern Ireland Secretary we are likely to get. I hope that I have not embarrassed him, while showing my approval of what he is trying to do. I heard him speak at an important conference during the summer and I gained the impression that in his conviction direct rule could not go on for ever. There was no reason to believe that it would be any easier to produce a constructive solution by waiting. In other words, that time was on no one's side except that of the terrorists, and that anyone in the position of the Chief Secretary of Northern Ireland had a duty to take the initiative in the immediate future; and he has now made the preliminary move towards it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, went in some detail, naturally enough, into the administrative assembly which he recommended as the best solution available. I will not try to follow him there. I will venture to say dogmatically&#x2014;if one can venture to say something dogmatically&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0271"/>
<col>525</col>
that any proposals which represented only a form of expanded local government are bound to fail, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, recognised. Many noble Lords will recall that the discrimination against the minority in the area of local government produced the most burning resentments of all in the years of Stormont. At the beginning of 1972 I opened a debate on Northern Ireland in this House and argued, not for the first time, that the whole problem of Northern Ireland could be solved, and could only be solved, through a system of partnership between the two communities, whether it was to be called power-sharing, which I think was the later name, or "community government", which was the phrase in vogue at that time. That belief in partnership I hold ever more firmly, whether or not it is fashionable at this precise moment.<lb/>
Soon after I spoke (although not as a result of anything I said), Stormont was suspended by a brave action of the Conservative Government of Mr. Heath, which I shall always salute for that reason, if for no other. At the end of the following year, 1973, came the Sunningdale Agreement which I applauded at the time with unqualified enthusiasm. I still believe that Sunningdale could have been a triumphant success, though it can be argued that even from the point of view of the Irish Republic it went ahead too quickly. It was destroyed, as we all remember, by the Ulster workers' strike. On that subject, the least said, the soonest mended.<lb/>
Older Members of this House will remember the accusation before the war that the League of Nations had failed; it came usually from those who had never wanted the League of Nations to succeed. We who supported the League, irrespective of party, retorted that the League of Nations did not fail; the great Powers failed the League. I am quite sure that is the right way to put it. Power-sharing did not fail in Northern Ireland; it was destroyed by unconstitutional action which involved a lot of lamentable violence. During those few months of the power-sharing Executive the lie was given for all time to those who said that Protestants and Catholics could not work together in government. That was an obvious absurdity in face of the fact that they do work together without religious self-
<col>526</col>
consciousness all over the world, not least in England, Scotland, Wales and the Irish Republic.<lb/>
It was further said that those who wished to maintain the Union could not work intimately with those who wished to achieve by peaceful means a united Ireland. That nonsense also was disposed of for ever by the cordiality and mutual helpfulness of the various parties in the 1974 Executive. I remember having a long talk with Mr. Brian Faulkner at a conference in the summer of 1974, and also with some of his Catholic colleagues. There was no doubt whatever that a spirit of complete mutual confidence had grown up between them. There and there only, in that sort of partnership, lies the hope of Northern Ireland for the future.<lb/>
I am not going to deal with the attitude of the Government of the Irish Republic. No one who has taken the trouble to study with care the utterances of Mr. Lynch can doubt his desire to see peace throughout Ireland treated as the first priority. He said recently in a notable speech:
<quote>"We must continue in every way within the rule of law to combat terrorism. We must seek to co-operate economically and socially with the people of the North. We must seek above all reconciliation and understanding with them."</quote>
He has said the same kind of thing on other occasions. I am under the impression, having made such inquiries as are open to me, that in the recent conference on security, particularly cross-border security, there was much practical agreement between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Republic.<lb/>
But let me leave the last word elsewhere. Until near the end of his life I cannot pretend that I was always in sympathy with what appeared to be the policies and personal attitudes of the late Lord Faulkner, as he became. To put it bluntly, I did not feel that he was as helpful as he might have been to our much esteemed fellow Member, Lord O'Neill, who stood so gallantly for light among the darkness. But as I have said earlier, Lord Faulkner developed dramatically towards the end of his life. It was a tragedy that he died when he did, although it was pleasant to hear that he had been reconciled to the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, in the corridors of this very
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0272"/>
<col>527</col>
building. The last chapters of Lord Faulkner's autobiography are very poignant. He says:
<quote>"We too easily allowed sectarian traditions to hem us in and dictate what was politically possible. We allowed provincialism and small-mindedness to go unchallenged for too long, so that people became almost incapable of looking ahead when it was vital that they should do so".</quote>
In view of that generous acknowledgment this conclusion of Lord Faulkner comes with all the more force:
<quote>"The conditions for a constitutional settlement on a basis of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence have improved in recent years".</quote>
My Lords, that is surely what we are talking about this afternoon. Not (for many years at any rate) the united Ireland, which remains the highest vision for many of us; not the ascendancy of one religion, which has been repudiated long since by all those who are best qualified to speak for the members of that community. He is speaking about a new basis of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence. I am sure that that is what the Secretary of State is working towards in face of immense difficulty, and all of us in this House with all our hearts must wish him well.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01300"><member>Lord MONSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join with other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Duke on his maiden speech. It was short, moderate and packed with constructive ideas. I hope we shall hear him often again, on this and other topics. I should like also to congratulate my noble friend Lord Dunleath for introducing this debate. He has a profound knowledge of Northern Ireland and its day-to-day problems, and he has clearly given tremendous thought to formulating his proposals. I wish I could believe that the implementation of these proposals would have the results he believes and hopes, but in the present circumstances I am afraid that I have my doubts.<lb/>
To explain why, it may be useful to go hack to last Thursday's Statement in this House on Northern Ireland. The noble Lord, Lord Plant, asked the Minister if he would agree that it was only the people of Northern Ireland who could put their own house in order, and I was rather taken aback to hear the noble Lord, Lord Elto, agree that it was only the citizens of the
<col>528</col>
Province who could put their own house in order. He went on to imply that British public opinion would start to get nasty if they did not agree to some sort of constitutional proposal.<lb/>
The whole implication of this, intended or unintended, is that the people of Northern Ireland got themselves into this mess on their own, and it is up to them to get themselves out of it. It may be understandable that the man in the street thinks this, brainwashed as he has been over the years by thinly veiled Republican or defeatist propaganda, but it is really inexcusable for people in high places to take this line. The whole point is that the people of the Province do not hold, and never have held, all or even most of the cards, and those who do&#x2014;outside powers, outside agencies&#x2014;have dealt them a pretty rotten series of hands over the last few decades.<lb/>
To start with, there is Britain herself, or rather the then British Government back in the 1920s. Sentimentality is probably one of the numerous British vices, and it can only have been sentimentality that was responsible for the British refusal to take the hard line Republicans seriously. Instead, the Republicans seem to have been regarded as fractious, rebellious adolescents indulging in a tantrum; once they had let off steam, once they had thumbed their nose and even spat at Mother Britain, they would return in a contrite and possibly slightly shame-faced fashion to her bosom, or at any rate halfway to her bosom. That was one error.<lb/>
Furthermore, the Government of the day seem not to have realised that as part of the normal democratic process, for purely economic reasons and quite apart from any appeal that Republicanism may have had to the public in Southern Ireland, the Republicans were bound to replace the Free Staters at a general election sooner or later, at which point they were certain to put their long cherished ideals into practice and thereby make any compromise with Unionism impossible.<lb/>
Only this lack of foresight can explain the forcing of Stormont on a reluctant Ulster, instead of allowing it to integrate fully with the rest of the Kingdom, as it wished at the time. Full economic and administrative integration might have led
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0273"/>
<col>529</col>
to a mental and psychological integration, which would only have been to the immense benefit of all communities and all individuals in the Province. But Stormont came into being after all and then it happened that Devlin, I think it was, spurned the hand of friendship and cooperation that had been proferred by Craig. Perhaps he had valid reasons for doing so, but anyway the consequences were most unfortunate. The Unionists drew the appropriate conclusions, which admittedly they needed little prompting to do, and reacted accordingly, by digging their toes in.<lb/>
A far worse error was the slavish adherence to the anachronistic county boundaries. Of course, both Stormont and the Southern Government were in disagreement with the Border Commission's proposals in 1925/26 for redrawing the border to accord so far as possible with the actual facts of population distribution. But nevertheless I believe that, had Westminster shown enough willpower, the resistance could have been overcome. The consequences was that far too many dissatisfied people were left on either side of a border that was in any case far from easy to police. Those in the South were proportionately not very numerous, so they had to like it or lump it, to accept it or to get out. Many chose the latter course. We know that the minority population in the South fell from just over 8 per cent. to just under 4 per cent. over 60 years. The dissatisfied minority in the North was very much larger, proportionately and absolutely, and so could not be shifted in this way. However, a high proportion of them remained unreconciled, and this, apart from being unsatisfactory for the individuals concerned, naturally stimulated Unionist fears and hence Unionist stubbornness. And last but by no means least, we are left with such ghastly anomalies as the South Armagh salient, a territory which is 90 per cent. ultra-Republican and where so many of our soldiers have needlessly lost their lives. I still do not myself think it too late to rectify this particular problem but I know that I am alone in this.<lb/>
The next culprits were southern Governments and opinion formers from the early 1930s onwards. It has to be said that de Valera and Fianna Fail were only being consistent in their sincere and long
<col>530</col>
held beliefs, but the desire to deprive the majority in the North of their right to self-determination, which I call fanaticism, is not made any the less unattractive by virtue of being consistent and sincere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01301"><member>The Earl of LONGFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Lord. The noble Lord is, of course, aware that from the early days, from 1920, de Valera made it plain that, to use his own expression, Ulster must not be coerced. Is the noble Lord aware of that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01302"><member>Lord MONSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what he said in the 1920s and his practical policies do not seem to me, at any rate, to have accorded. I am thinking of the 1937 constitution, for example. Nothing could have been more calculated to frighten the northern majority than the clause in the 1937 constitution which claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland, or to make life more difficult, from the point of view of job prospects and so on, for the minority in the Province. It was not just a question of legislation but of attitudes and the inculcation of attitudes. Yesterday evening I read in <i>The Times,</i> from a correspondent in Dublin, that every Irish schoolchild learns to revere Padraig Pearse. It was Padraig Pearse, if I remember rightly, who once said: "Ireland is Gaelic and Catholic or it is nothing". The correspondent went on to say:
<quote>"The Republican youth of this generation have been reared in an atmosphere of uninhibited nationalism, and it is not to be wondered at that at least a few among them should be attracted by a call to violence".</quote>
It so happens that this was<i>The Times</i> of 4th October, 1955. I came across the piece quite by accident; I happened to be looking for an article on Cyprus and it was purely fortuitous that I came across this. But<i>plus ca change, plus c'est la m&#x00EA;me chose.</i><lb/>
It is interesting and heartening, of course, that Mr. Liam Cosgrave was reported in the same article as being deeply unhappy by the inculcation of this philosophy, as he is today. And such statesmanlike figures as Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien have made the same point in trying to dispel the almost semi-Fascist romantic nationalism, but they have suffered electorally for their pains. So now we have a state of affairs where, according
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0274"/>
<col>531</col>
to a Government-commissioned opinion poll, fully 20 per cent. of the population of the South vaguely support the IRA and 19 per cent. have mixed feelings or are indifferent towards it. These, I must say, are rather horrifying figures. Of course, the Republican-orientated community in the North support the IRA to a very much lesser extent&#x2014;but then they have had to live with them!<lb/>
The malign role played by some Irish-Americans and non-Irish Americans who wish to attract Irish-American votes is indeed well-known. After all, one individual who is almost certain to be a prospective candidate for the Presidency, one extremely well-known individual, once said a few years ago that he was in favour in certain circumstances of the compulsory repatriation of ethnic majorities&#x2014;not minorities, but majorities&#x2014;from Northern Ireland, a majority which has been there incidentally for between three and four hundred years, very much longer than most white Americans have been in the United States. Then, of course, we know from an IRA defector giving evidence in California the other day that a certain North African State is supplying the Provisional IRA with arms and money.<lb/>
Then I come to the question of border security, and back to the British Government. I do not want to stir up a hornet's nest, but it is a fact that any number of individuals, not merely soldiers and policemen, but milkmen, postmen, farmers and so on, are murdered by people who then escape across the border. There is a lot I could say on this point, but all I wish to leave your Lordships with is the thought that the Israeli Government would not allow its citizens to be murdered in such a way with such impunity.<lb/>
On top of this chapter of misjudgment, and hostility in some cases, it is true that in the past 50 years Northern Ireland has had sheer bad luck in the unforeseeable decline, relative to other parts of the United Kingdom, of her former basic industries of linen and shipbuilding. So although it is certainly reasonable, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, asserted, to make the point that the Northern Ireland people have a part to play in solving, or at any rate ameliorating, the problem, it is vital to recognise that they have been
<col>532</col>
bequeathed an appalling framework within which to try to do so&#x2014;a framework which is rusty; the foundations of which are continually being undermined; and which is constantly being literally riddled with bullets.<lb/>
It may be argued that the past is the past and that it is no use crying over spilt milk and so on; and that although integration, or "harmonisation" as I prefer to call it&#x2014;because after all Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom as any number of Acts of Parliament make clear&#x2014;might have been the best course in 1920, the fact is that it did not happen and the Ulster people have now become used to a devolved form of government. I am rather dubious about that argument. I believe that the manner in which Stormont was dissolved was shameful, and a great many others, including many Conservatives take that view. The fact remains that it is a<i>fait accompli,</i> and has been so for many years. It would appear from public opinion polls that most people in the Province now find some form of integration/direct rule the least unattractive option. They do not positively favour it, but they find it the least unattractive option. Furthermore, our close and detailed scrutiny in this House of the Scotland Bill in Committee has brought home to us as never before the contradictions and anomalies inherent in any system of legislative devolution.<lb/>
I still believe that the long-term answer is closer harmonisation of the Province with the rest of the United Kingdom&#x2014;closer harmonisation in every sense of the word. That would, among other things, involve the restoration of local government, but with the retention of such idiosyncracies as the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which should give confidence to the minority on that score. Moreover, the Ombudsman should be retained. The Ombudsman has not had a great deal of work to do in the past few years: he has, generally speaking, given Northern Ireland a clean bill of health, which may be a surprise to those who swallow some of the propaganda that is put out.<lb/>
I take entirely the point made by my noble friend Lord Dunleath about the frustration that arises from the present quasi-colonial rule and the lack of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0275"/>
<col>533</col>
machinery for getting grievances aired and rectified. But surely part of that stems from the suspension of local government, apart from the disgraceful under-representation of the Province at Westminster, which will not be recitifed alas! for approximately another four years. It occurred to me in the middle of the night&#x2014;a time when matters often occur to one&#x2014;that it might help very slightly if, pending the eventual election of the full quota of 17 Northern Ireland Members of Parliament, the existing 12 Members were allocated substantial extra secretarial assistance with which to deal with their constituents' complaints and grievances. However, I realise that all this is a matter of fine judgment and I am not perhaps the person best qualified to judge.<lb/>
If it should turn out to be the wish of the Ulster people&#x2014;a wish ideally underwritten by a referendum with a 40 per cent. rule, as was the case with the Scotland Act&#x2014;to return to some sort of devolved govenment, then so be it. But if such a Government are to have any chance of permanency, then I believe that not only must British Governments and opinion-formers become more clear-sighted and bold in their enthusiasm and support for the union and their ackknowledgement of the part that Northern Ireland has played in two World Wars, but Governments and opinion-formers elsewhere must mend their ways and show a much greater sense of responsibility.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01304"><member>The Duke of NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too would like to congratulate the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn (who unfortunately has left the Chamber for the moment, so our strength of Dukes is reduced again to one) on his maiden speech. I thought that he spoke most sensibly and it is clear to me that he will add considerably to our debates. I hope that perhaps he will read what I have said later in<i>Hansard.</i><lb/>
I have been urged to address your Lordships in this debate as one of the five million committed Catholics of England, Scotland and Wales&#x2014;the mainland of the United Kingdom. It is important that I should let your Lordships reflect how we have emerged in our long history to become part of the main-
<col>534</col>
stream of English life. I would like to go back possibly to where we started to be excluded from English life. It was in the unfortunate 16th and 17th centuries, as your Lordships know, that we suffered penal persecution under Elizabeth I and were excluded from England and English life. I hasten to add quickly that Mary I inflicted exactly the same on the Anglican Protestant way of life. Indeed, one is told how the numbers persecuted by Elizabeth I were about balanced by those persecuted by Bloody Mary in Fox's<i>Book of Martyrs.</i><lb/>
Those were terrible times, but the Catholics gradually emerged through the successive relief Acts that were passed. An important one was caused by the French Revolution in 1789&#x2013;90, and then, of course, there was the great 1829 Catholic emancipation Act, which was largely due to the efforts of an Irishman, Daniel O'Connell. Ireland was at that time part of the United Kingdom and sent its representatives to this Parliament. With the Catholic emancipation Act we were again able to play our part in English life.<lb/>
I am proud to say that my ancestor, the twelfth Duke, was the first to take his seat as a Catholic in the House of Lords, and his son, who became the thirteenth Duke, also my ancestor and the ancestor of my cousin the noble Earl, Lord Perth, who is present, was the first Catholic commoner to take his seat after emancipation. From then on we gradually became part of the life of this country. I think we contribute a great deal to it. We are loyal; we are trusted; we are respected; and we are welcomed as part of the English way of life. I cannot quite say that everything is as we would like it to be, and two points come to mind in particular. The first is that I personally, and most of the Catholics of the mainland of the United Kingdom, would like to see Catholic bishops added to the Bench of Bishops. From what I have often heard, they would be welcomed by the Bench of Bishops and it is a tragedy that we do not have representatives of Cardinal Hume, Cardinal Gray and I suppose Cardinal O'Fiaich on the Bench of Bishops in this House. I would also like to suggest&#x2014;this is perhaps enlarging the subject, but it completes the story&#x2014;that we have some Jewish representation
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0276"/>
<col>535</col>
of an ecclesiastical nature and even perhaps representatives of other religions in this House. It would certainly assist me very much when subjects like euthanasia are discussed or when the noble Earl, Lord Longford, tells me that I must learn more about pornography so that I can assist him in those debates.<lb/>
The other matter that I think the Catholics of this country would like to see dealt with to complete our emancipation concerns the extraordinary situation whereby the embassy at the Vatican is only a legation. When the noble Lord, Lord Peart, represented the Government, and I represented Her Majesty the Queen at the enthronement of the Pope, we were staying at the legation and the only two legations attached to the Vatican City are those of this country and the Republic of San Marino. There are 250 embassies and two legations, and I think that that is discourteous to the Catholics of this country. In these ecumenical times I hope that someone may see his way to raising our status in the Vatican. Events have moved so quickly that perhaps that matter should be tackled.<lb/>
Not only are Catholics free to practice their religion and to take part in the life of the country, but in this ecumenical situation matters have developed to an amazing degree: Mass is often now said in the churches of the Anglican Communion; last July the Queen visited Westminster Cathedral for a flower festival and Prince Charles has read the Lesson in Westminster Cathedral. All this shows how our lives are now part of your way of life. At the sad funeral of Lord Mountbatten in Westminster Abbey Cardinal Hume attended as a priest and read prayers for peace in front of the whole Royal Family. That contrasts greatly with what is happening in Northern Ireland where there is still antagonism.<lb/>
It is only fair for me to agree with noble Lords that the history of Ireland is much more complicated. That country remained Roman Catholic. Of course, we know that settlers&#x2014;I choose my words carefully and I hope not offensively&#x2014;were planted there in the reign of James I and in Cromwell's time. Thus the terrible problem was created whereby we had the native Celtic Irish remaining
<col>536</col>
Catholic and the Protestant settlers having sway in that country. We well know that those two communities find it extremely hard to get on together. The settlers, many of whom are represented in this House, have been there for 300 years. It is absurd to suggest that there should be any movement if people have been in a country for 300 years. The only solution can be that of a peaceful way of life.<lb/>
I can assure the Catholics in Northern Ireland that if we could only achieve in their country the peaceful way of life of Catholics in England, their lives could be utterly constructive and sensible. At the same time, I hope that these remarks are read by the Catholics in Southern Ireland. They must realise that their relations with the Protestants can be perfectly peaceful. I go further. It is important that the Irish beyond the seas should also realise that the life of Catholics in this country is perfectly happy. A large number of Americans who are Catholics date from the time of that terrible potato famine, when they emigrated to America and the Protestant Irish emigrated to Canada. Those Catholic Irish Americans very reasonably have a great interest in Ireland in the same way as Poles living outside Poland have a great interest in Poland. But those Catholics in America whom I saw only last May when I went round America for a purpose, have the extraordinary idea that it is impossible to live in England or in Ireland without being persecuted and mistreated. That idea is totally out of date.<lb/>
The emancipation Act 1829 has made it perfectly possible to lead a full Catholic life and to enter into the mainstream of Irish life in Northern Ireland without any difficulty. I deplore the remarks that are made, and which were made to me, about how the British Army in Northern Ireland is holding down the six counties. The British Army was sent to Northern Ireland to reinforce law and order and, at that time, regrettably, to protect the Catholic minorities who were in danger of being mistreated. We all know that they are in no way there to perpetuate a rule that is not wanted.<lb/>
I hope that those remarks will bear out the solution that the two communities in Northern Ireland should grow together. I hope the Catholics will realise that if
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0277"/>
<col>537</col>
they can work with the Protestants and if the Southern Irish Catholics have a constructive attitude towards the Protestants of Northern Ireland which will lead to peaceful relations, as the Pope urged so strongly, that will help and be conducive to some settlement to this dreary problem that has gone on and on. One finds it almost inexplicable that it can go on for so long. One finds it very hard to see the solutions without time passing on quietly. The fact of the matter is that the scars of the Reformation have long since been healed in this and many other countries, but they are still not healed there. I have always believed that if only the Council of Trent had met in 1445 and not in 1545, there would have been no Reformation. I know that those things are a long time past, but I still believe that to be so.<lb/>
I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for having occasioned this debate. I greatly welcome what I call the "Atkins initiative" towards doing something that is progressive and aimed at the ending of this direct rule in Northern Ireland. As the noble Earl, Lord Longford, has just said, the Sunningdale Conference achieved great things. It brought up the idea of partnership or power-sharing. Unfortunately, it also spoke about a council of Ireland and it went too far too quickly, and people took fright. That was a great pity, because that was a start that, if it had not gone wrong, might have achieved great things. We are now faced with having to start again. The Secretary of State is very wise in starting at the grass roots and saying to the parties of Northern Ireland, "I want you to agree on the minimum things you can; work with me and we will hand over some power to you. We will start there with the minimum". This "Atkins initiative" is one which the whole House should support.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01306"><member>Lord KILBRACKEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope to be brief, partly because a number of my points have already been made and partly because I intend to confine my remarks as far as possible to the Question itself. I join other noble Lords in welcoming the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, and I congratulate him on a speech which managed to be non-controversial despite the controversial nature of
<col>538</col>
the Question. I am also grateful to my noble friend Lord Dunleath as I hope I may call him, for putting down this Question today.<lb/>
I believe passionately that a united Ireland, whether on a federal or a unitarian basis, is the ultimate solution to the Irish question. That is the final goal, as my noble friend Lord Longford indicated, that should always be kept in view. I still pray that I may live to see it, however distant it may be at present seem.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, has already put before your Lordships the only possible courses in the meantime. They are direct rule&#x2014;and every day it continues is merely an admission of failure&#x2014;a move towards greater integration with Great Britain, or, on the other hand, an independent Northern Ireland, both of which I reject; or the steady devolution of an increasing degree of delegated power to an elected assembly at some unknown future date, which is the Government's stated objective. I believe that the earliest possible transfer of such power to the people of Northern Ireland through their elected representatives is desirable, with adequate safeguards for the minority community. Last week's Government statement agreed, as the right reverend Prelate said, that reasonable and appropriate arrangements should take account of their interests. These should certainly include power sharing, or call it what you will, in one form or another, as was again eloquently argued by my noble friend Lord Longford.<lb/>
Since this Question was put down we have the Government's decision to convene an all-party conference to discuss the precise manner in which power should be devolved. I suppose we should be grateful for seeing an initiative of any kind after so many years of doing nothing, but I regret that I must regard this proposal as a time-wasting, window-dressing manoeuvre doomed to failure before it starts. I know that in doing so I lay myself open to the suspicion, as he put it, of my noble friend Lord Longford, but I shall have to put up with that as well as the Official Unionists who have announced their intention to boycott it altogether.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0402P0I0278"/>
<col>539</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01308"><member>Lord KILBRACKEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope so. I am disagreeing with the policy of the Government in setting up a conference, but I think that devolution can be achieved by a more direct means. The Official Unionists are not the only ones who have shown their disagreement with Government policy, as it has been received with very qualified enthusiasm by the other parties in the North. They know only too well that it will lead to weeks or months of wrangling and recrimination, of attempting&#x2014;or not even attempting&#x2014;to reconcile the irreconcilable.<lb/>
It is seldom indeed that I agree with the Leader of the Official Unionist Party, but I think he was correct when he said that the proposed conference:
<quote>"far from bringing the parties together will simply force them into entrenched positions from which they cannot move".</quote>
Surely the time has come for action, not words; for decisions, not discussions. The Government's plan to fiddle while Belfast burns will only succeed in prolonging even further the present political vacuum on which terrorism feeds. However, I acknowledge that they can hardly be expected to change their announced policy as a result of anything said here today, or anything that may be said in another place, before the conference takes place.<lb/>
Accepting that, I should like to make two points. First, I hope that the Government will accept the advice given last week by my noble friend Lord Blease that a conference should not be confined to politicians but should include representatives of the business community, the trade unions, and other professional bodies Secondly, if the Press are to be excluded I hope that the Government will issue an official statement after each session, rather than allowing the media no account of the day's proceedings beyond the usually biased statements of individuals taking part.<lb/>
When it is all over, the Government will have to come up with their own proposals for devolution which must then, after receiving parliamentary consent, be imposed upon Northern Ireland. I believe&#x2014;and here I answer my noble friend&#x2014;that it would be better by far that they should take this step now without wasting these precious months
<col>540</col>
on profitless discussion from which nothing new can emerge, for the views of all the parties are, or should be, already well known.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01309">5.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01310"><member>The Earl of PERTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, when he says he thinks that the initiative which the Secretary of State is taking is a waste of time. I shall return to that point a little later in my speech. We all owe a great debt to the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for introducing this debate, and particularly for the various concrete suggestions that he made of what might be a future rule, or future arrangements, for Northern Ireland. This was backed up by the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, in his excellent maiden speech, when he gave us most valuable first-hand ideas of what might be done.<lb/>
I am somewhat nervously speaking at all on Northern Ireland because I am not very sure of my qualifications. Certainly they are not as great as those of many of your Lordships who have first-hand experience and who live there among all the problems, but, like my noble kinsman, the Duke of Norfolk, I also am a Catholic, and instinctively one must feel sympathy for one's co-religionists. I know that this is not a religious question, but they are, and have been, in a minority for so long. They have been ill-treated&#x2014;yes, "ill-treated" is the right word&#x2014;for over 50 years or more, and it is essential that one is quite certain that today that no longer is the state of affairs.<lb/>
My other qualification perhaps is that in the last week, once I decided I would take part in this debate, I have read <i>Hansard</i> both of this House and the other place, and other related papers, covering the last 10 years. I really was surprised at the number of initiatives that have been taken to try and solve the problem. Of course they culminated in Sunningdale. You have heard from many other noble Lords that its failure was not only a tragedy, but a tragedy of circumstance and timing. I wonder how many people outside of the politicians who are concerned with this question really know what has been tried over the last years. I shall come back to that point a little later.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0279"/>
<col>541</col>
I was particularly glad that the Secretary of State said that he was going to call this meeting to try and arrive at a first step for some degree of self-government despite the fact that violence is going on. I was worried that the Government might take the stance&#x2014;there have been one or two statements which have seemed to indicate it&#x2014;that law and order came first. Of course law and order in a sense must be ensured so far as that is practical, but at the same time there must be a political initiative. If you do not do anything but just sit back until you have law and order, then nothing happens and violence is given a great chance to go further forward. We all know that. Look at the Governments over the years, how they dealt, say, with Cyprus while violence was going on; how they dealt with Palestine while violence was going on; and indeed how they dealt with the Irish question as a whole in the 'twenties when violence was going on. While I am sure that law and order are of the first importance, concurrently every attempt must be made to find a solution to the conditions which are the cause of the violence.<lb/>
I wish to make three points and they are not in a sense constructive in that they are not related to the sort of form of local government that should take place; that is for others who are more experienced to do and that is for decision after evidence has been taken from the people who are to be consulted. First, are we quite sure that the minority people, the Catholics, in Northern Ireland today are being fairly treated? There was once set up the Community Relations Board; now I think it is an Ombudsman who handles these things. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, said the Ombudsman had very few complaints at the present time, but are we really quite sure?<lb/>
When it comes to the question of security, we have sent out a top official to try to ensure that security is going along in the best possible way. I wonder whether it would not be a good idea to send out one or two people, who are recognised in every way as being impartial and eminent, to make quite sure that if there are complaints they should be heard and put right&#x2014;on the parallel that while one has to ensure law and order and try to make a political move, one must be quite sure that the conditions are right for the conference that is to come.</membercontribution></p>
<col>542</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01311"><member>Lord DUNLEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Earl not agree that, in the effort to ensure as far as possible that there is no discrimination in Northern Ireland, we have sprouted almost more Quangos than in any other part of the United Kingdom, what with the Fair Employment Agency and the Equal Opportunities Board as well as the Commissioner for Complaints?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01312"><member>The Earl of PERTH</member><membercontribution>: I am not necessarily in favour of Quangos, my Lords. They have been operating for some time. As I say, if you have a new initiative in the form of a top security official, so there might be, if you like, some publicity value&#x2014;I am not suggesting anything permanent&#x2014;in what I am suggesting, there might be a once only inquiry on the point.<lb/>
My second point is that the Secretary of State in another place said, in effect, that the question of future arrangements for governing Northern Ireland was our concern, and our concern only, and was not the responsibility of the Dublin Government or indeed&#x2014;though he did not actually say this&#x2014;of anybody else. In a sense that is true, if you take it in the literal sense, but when we come to any lasting settlement we cannot ignore outside people, outside countries, and above all we cannot ignore Southern Ireland. I would go further and say that we should welcome, if we could obtain it, help from anybody who genuinely wants to play a part in solving the problems of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
At the present time when we have the Zimbabwe or Southern Rhodesia Conference in progress&#x2014;and I hope and pray it will succeed&#x2014;one of the reasons for its success will have been that we called the Commonwealth to help us. Therefore, we should not ignore the possibility of others of goodwill helping us. Clearly, sooner or later the Irish have got to come in, and I would not refuse proper support or help from the United States, although I recognise that at present it is a political issue there and therefore it would be inappropriate until after the elections are over. I am not meaning by that that they should take an active part in the negotiations, but that they should be well-informed, and, just as the Commonwealth has helped us&#x2014;perhaps we could rule out others and leave it to the Commonwealth&#x2014;I believe we should realise that there are many people of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0280"/>
<col>543</col>
goodwill all over the world who want to help us in this matter.<lb/>
Lastly of my three points I come to the question of what in shorthand I might call propaganda. All your Lordships know of the tremendous job the IRA and their supporters have done in this connection, particularly in the United States. We have heard in this debate how time and again there are mis-statements and ill-founded beliefs about what we are trying to do in Northern Ireland. I believe we should consider very carefully how we can best counter this impression. Have we really set our minds and thoughts to this? Have we, for example, asked responsible commentators, be they from the Press or TV, from the United States to come and have a look for themselves and to come and discuss with responsible politicians and others here just what we are trying to do? Or have we thought of sending out representatives of the Churches on both sides or representatives from other bodies who are all anxious to see this problem solved, particularly if we could get representatives of all sides from Northern Ireland? I am sure that this sort of effort is a necessary part of any attempts that are being made to achieve a solution to the Ulster question.<lb/>
I feel very much that the steps taken by the Secretary of State are right. The noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, said&#x2014;I absolutely disagree with him&#x2014;that it was a recipe for time-wasting and giving further opportunity for violence. I believe it is far worse to impose on a people a solution about which they can all say, "But we were not consulted" than the other way round, and I feel sure that others will agree that this particular method of procedure is an essential one. We should know what we are going to try to do in the last analysis, but we must see whether we cannot get common ground on many points rather than impose them, because when something is imposed we often find people saying, "If only you had asked us and done this and that differently, all would have been well". I therefore welcome the initiative of the Secretary of State. I hope that in taking it the Government will not forget the value of propaganda and I hope they will not shut the door to the ultimate need of others besides those in Northern Ireland to take part in any final settlement.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01314"><member>Lord LEONARD</member><membercontribution>: I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, upon bringing forward this Question. I have listened most attentively to the debate this evening and I have made a few notes. The noble Earl, Lord Longford, raised quite a number of points which I considered most relevant. The noble Duke mentioned many matters regarding religion, and he even mentioned planters. Planters were the people who were sent to Northern Ireland in years gone by and their descendants are speaking here tonight. I have nothing against them. I feel that now they are Irishmen. A planter is as good an Irishman as I am, and I am a planter in reverse. I came to this country a poor man and I was treated excellently. This emotive business of Ireland is frightening&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01315"><member>The Duke of NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I please interrupt the noble Lord in order to say that in no sense was I being derogatory in using the word "planters". I am looking at two of my noble friends and thinking of many others with whom I have served in the Army. The term is simply a way in which in England we describe the history of the plantations of Ireland. In no sense was I being derogatory. I see my noble friends are smiling&#x2014;that is all I require.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01316"><member>Lord LEONARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me assure the noble Duke that in no sense was I being derogatory. I do not know where the heck he got that from. I approach this matter quite sanely, quite realistically. To me, planters are nonexistent today, as similarly I would trust that I am not looked upon as someone who merely arrived here.<lb/>
Thinking about Irish politicians in general brings me to a story. A very well-known Irish politician, who shall be nameless, went to a meeting recently and someone asked, "Why does he have two bodyguards with him?" The reply was, "They are not bodyguards; they are his psychiatrists". It is obvious to me that psychiatry is playing a part in Irish politics today, and people have very wrong impressions.<lb/>
Be under no illusions, my Lords. My ultimate goal, like that of the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, would be a unified
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0281"/>
<col>545</col>
Ireland. I did not rise this evening in order to expound any theories as to how this is to come about. All I wish to say is that the English have been in Ireland, off and on, for 800 years. They have not made a good job of it. There are characters with whom in no circumstances would I wish to be associated. They have been killing, maiming&#x2014;all supposedly in the interests of getting the invader out. Eight hundred years is a long time in which to attempt, or to arrive at, a solution regarding Ireland. A solution has not been arrived at. Therefore, do your Lordships not think it is time we went off on another tack? As I see it what has happened so far has been a disaster. Surely it is not beyond the bounds of both the Irish and the English to get together, to stop all the bigotry and fighting.<lb/>
Why do you not allow the Irish to have a word on this, my Lords? Make no bones about it, Southern Ireland is not going to disappear off the map. Whether you like it or not, Ireland is a geographical entity, a country with its own culture. You are not going to make it anything else. You have tried and you have failed. For heaven's sake! let us try something else. It is imperative that in this modern day and age we should not have man killing his fellow man; and what we have seen in the past six months, and particularly in the past three months, is to be abhorred by every civilised person in the world. I would be the first to deal with those people&#x2014;and in no uncertain manner.<lb/>
Having said that, I wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, because I believe that the time has come when a new initiative must be made. I also wish to thank Mr. Atkins for raising the possibility of a new initiative. The people who refused to accept this initiative are not friends of Britain, they are not friends of Ireland, they are not friends of anyone. They require psychiatrists. The ordinary people of Ireland hate what is going on. They do not want shooting; they want to go about their everyday, normal life. But they are not being allowed to do that.<lb/>
I am not going to belabour what we have heard about troops out and troops in, 13,000 soldiers and so forth. That is
<col>546</col>
not the answer. The answer does not lie in troops in, or in troops out. The answer lies in getting round a table. In my opinion, the answer lay in the possibility of power-sharing which I am sorry to say did not come about. People must give and take. There will be sacrifices by the people and by the rulers, or the former rulers, of Northern Ireland. Sacrifices will have to be made by Mr. Lynch and his Government. There is no question but that sacrifices will be necessary if the problem is to be solved.<lb/>
It is no good talking about Westminster imposing anything. I can assure your Lordships that you will be fighting for another 800 years if you do not get round to the problem and settle down. It is not purely a matter of religion. I know that religion comes into it up to a point. No, it is not only religion; it involves people who are entrenched&#x2014;on both sides, I may say&#x2014;and who have no wish to see the matter cleared up. It is these entrenched people who are dragging Ireland&#x2014;North and South&#x2014;into the mire. These are the people who should be made to give their loyalty to one side or the other. I say, do not sit on the fence making the bullets for others to fire. That is what they are doing&#x2014;and, again I say it, on both sides.<lb/>
I appeal to the Government to get on with the initiative; to press on, and to consult everybody. I am not asking them to consult murderers; I do not accept that. I am asking them to consult politicians, of whatever shade of opinion they may be. I am asking them to get round a table and discuss this matter, because if it is not settled thousands more will die and we shall not have moved one inch further. So I appeal to the Government to pay heed to this Question which Lord Dunleath has asked this evening. Work on it and attempt to bring about a settlement. A settlement can be brought about&#x2014;there is not a shadow of doubt about that in my mind&#x2014;by sacrifices on both sides, and, please God, one day we shall see the matter settled.<lb/>
My Lords, if it comes to a united Ireland, which I trust it will, I do not necessarily want that united Ireland to be an enemy of Britain. I do not even want it to be outside the orbit of Britain. We simply have to work together. I know some people in Southern Ireland would think
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0282"/>
<col>547</col>
it an enormous tragedy if they had to take an oath of allegiance again, after having had it for 700 years and after getting rid of it for 74 years, or whatever it is; but if it means that, then I do not feel it to be a stumbling block to the British Isles being once more the British and the Irish Isles. Let us get together, for heaven's sake! We are the same people; we talk the same language. For God's sake, Britain, go to work! Get this thing sorted out, for I feel that this country and Ireland will then be better places in which to live.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01317">6.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01318"><member>Lord MOYOLA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must begin by apologising to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, who is due to reply to this debate, for the fact that it is very unlikely that I shall be here to hear what he says because I am afraid there is an aeroplane which I must attempt to catch tonight, and the debate had already gone on for longer than certainly I expected. I should also like to congratulate the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, on his excellent maiden speech, which I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed and thought was of great value.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, that there is a crying need for the restoration of some sort of devolved government in Northern Ireland. I say that, not because I find fault with the present system. It is perhaps slower than we were used to in the days when Stormont existed, but that is the only fault that I have to find. I say it simply because at the moment there is a vacuum, and there is no place in politics for normal, sensible, level-headed people to take any part. There is nothing for them to do; there is no governing body which they can attempt to influence. The result, of course, is that a vacuum pertains, such a vacuum leads to political activism, and political activism inevitably leads to extremism and polarisation on both sides. Therefore, the sooner something is provided in which normal, sensible people can play a part, the better it will be for everyone in Norther Ireland.<lb/>
I am not going to expand on what form I think that restoration might take, except to say that I do not believe that the answer lies in tinkering with local government. The answer lies in the
<col>548</col>
bigger picture; and my view is that a start should be made by handing back to some sort of elected body the control of the non-contentious matters, such as agriculture, health, water and all things of that kind. A start should be made, at any rate, in that way; but beyond that I can only hope that the Secretary of State's initiative is going to prosper. I know it is not going to be easy. Indeed, it is going to be desperately difficult to get any form of agreement. But if we want to get some form of devolved government back to Northern Ireland&#x2014;and most of us do&#x2014;I cannot for the life of me see what possible good it does for any of the parties to refuse to attend the conference which the Secretary of State has proposed. To me, this is both childish and silly. As I see it, attendance cannot conceivably do any harm; and certainly it seems to me that, if the Secretary of State were to be successful in his efforts, any party which stayed away would certainly not be in a position to claim much of the rewards.<lb/>
Having said that, I think one must not lose sight of the fact that, certainly to the people of Northern Ireland, devolved government is not priority one. Priority one is to defeat terrorism. A solution, if it comes to pass, can help in this; but, frankly, my feeling is that it is very difficult, when incidents are going on, to get all sides of the political divides round a table to debate calmly and sensibly something for their own good. One cannot debate in an atmosphere of what is sometimes hate and is very often mistrust, and that is sparked off by constant acts of terrorism.<lb/>
However, I must at this moment say very plainly that the climate is not a very happy one in which to start this approach. There is a massive feeling of lack of confidence in Northern Ireland. There is a feeling that, certainly on the political side, ideas have run out, and some reassurance that this is not so is very badly needed. If that reassurance does not come, and does not come soon, then, as I see it&#x2014;and no one would deplore it more than I do&#x2014;inevitably somebody will start to take the law into his own hands, and we shall get back to the situation we were in only a few years ago. So I would say to my noble friend who is to reply that we urgently need some reassurance, be it what he may be able to tell us about what may or may not have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0283"/>
<col>549</col>
been agreed between the British and Dublin Governments, or be it some new development that he can offer us. Something needs to be seen to be done in order to give some sort of reassurance. I would say quite straightforwardly that the mood of the country at the moment is extremely bad, and no one should think otherwise.<lb/>
On that subject, those of us who are not involved in the politics of the country and who are sitting on the outside sometimes feel that the Secretary of State and his office lack the sort of advice which can in fact come only from those of us who live in the country. No disrespect is intended to English civil servants who come to Northern Ireland. They cannot know, they cannot find out, the sort of things that I and people like me, who live there, know and can find out by our daily contacts&#x2014;by contacts in the markets, by contacts in the hardware shops, by talking to people in the streets, or wherever it may be. They cannot find out about that sort of thing and, even if they do, it is probable that they will not get the right nuance or interpretation.<lb/>
The trouble is that Northern Ireland is terribly politically conscious. At the same time, nothing undermines confidence more than the feeling that what is going on is perhaps not really being understood. I hope that I do not sound as though I am talking gibberish. What I am trying to say is that in my view, and in the view of quite a number of others, the Secretary of State needs to get and to take a lot more Northern Ireland advice&#x2014;and from all sides of the divide. He needs to get the views of local people there and not necessarily the people who are engaged in politics.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not think you will get a solution while terrorism goes on. One of the matters which obviously one must touch on in a debate like this is the all too frequent murders which have been taking place of late, murders of soldiers, of policemen and of people in the Ulster Defence Regiment; and the ease with which the perpetrators of these acts always seem to manage to escape is shattering. Personally, I think that the process of sealing off an area and closing roads, or whatever action there may be, always takes place far too long after an incident has occurred. The Army is
<col>550</col>
probably too thin on the ground in many areas to be able to do this effectively. I believe that there are many areas where the Ulster Defence Regiment, the local force, could do this themselves if they had a little more discretion.<lb/>
The Ulster grapevine is pretty good, and news of incidents travels fast. I believe that if it could be so arranged that small groups of the Ulster Defence Regiment were able to come together the minute that an incident occurs and to seal areas, close roads and so on, it would make incidents much more difficult to perpetrate, and I think that the terrorists would be much less anxious to carry them out. In my view only the local force is geared to do this. It lives in the area and it knows the area. I know, equally, that this will not work everywhere, but I believe that in certain areas&#x2014;and they represent quite a large part of the country&#x2014;if more discretion were given to the UDR one would see the murderous activities of the terrorists begin to fall off.<lb/>
My Lords, I know that many people will advance a great number of arguments as to why this should not be done. All that I can say is that we shall never win anything if we spend our time taking counsel of our fears. If we could increase the drive against terrorism and make it obvious to people that more and more is being done, then, I think, the Secretary of State's initiative will have a chance of success.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01320"><member>Lord GREY of NAUNTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I join in proffering respectful congratulations to the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, on his maiden speech He has long been carrying on the tradition of public service of his family in Northern Ireland and he has worked effectively in the stimulation of small industries which is a very valuable effort in improving the economic circumstances of this unhappy land. I am sure that if his contributions to this House are of the level of his contributions in his own country we shall all have cause to be grateful for his attendance here.<lb/>
It might seem that the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, in putting down his Unstarred Question is pushing at an open door. According to the Statement made in another place (and repeated here on 25th October) Her Majesty's Government
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0284"/>
<col>551</col>
have designed a number of frameworks within which powers transferred to elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland might be exercised. But we must all be grateful to the noble Lord who has given the House the opportunity to consider this matter; because, even in advance of the publication of the consultative document, there are other questions to which an answer is needed, even if the terms of the noble Lord's Unstarred Question, on a narrow construction of them, can be answered in the affirmative. Her Majesty's Government have constantly been urged at home and abroad to take some political initiative. Now that they have done it, they are getting more criticism than thanks for having done so. Ministers might well feel a little aggrieved.<lb/>
If I may say so without offending my Irish friends, the Irish have a delightful facility for winding themselves into one's heart and then, with a complete lack of consistency, setting about breaking it. There is great need (as, no doubt, the Secretary of State has learned) to be resilient as well as patient and sympathetic in trying to solve Ireland's problem. Some of the people and some of the organs of public opinion that have been urging the need for an initiative and blaming the Government for not taking it, now assert that the time is not ripe for it and that there is no need for anything except continuance of direct rule.<lb/>
Direct rule has been a satisfactory palliative, a satisfactory temporary measure, but neither it nor integration with the United Kingdom can possibly provide a lasting answer to the problems that have caused such tragedy and distress over the past 10 years. Northern Ireland is constitutionally part of the United Kingdom and there have been assurances&#x2014;relied on by some and greatly blamed by others&#x2014;that it will so remain until a majority of people in Northern Ireland no longer wish it. In this present debate there is no point in considering the question of whether that assurance should be continued, whether or not it is a comfort or an obstacle. There is less point, I suspect, having regard to the controversy aroused by the alleged results of a recent survey of public feeling, in arguing whether a majority of people North or South of the border want this or that.<lb/>
<col>552</col>
The sea that divides Northern Ireland from England, Scotland and Wales is narrow but it is very deep. It is deep with the differing traditions inherited by the people who live in Ireland; and unhappily it is deepened by the misunderstandings, the false allegations, the miseries of recent years. There is no doubt whatever that Northern Ireland must have some local framework&#x2014;to use the word adopted by the noble Lord&#x2014;for dealing with local affairs by local people given a wide measure of responsibility for those affairs. The noble Lord, Lord Moyola, put it very politely in saying that the Secretary of State must have the advice of local people. It is a cardinal article of faith across the water that no Englishman understands the Ulsterman&#x2014;and of course none does! I sometimes venture to wonder whether the Ulsterman always understands himself, but that is another matter.<lb/>
Although I have no doubt about the need for some local framework for the exercise of responsibility by local people, I have no concluded view as to what that framework should be, nor do any of those who have so constantly in recent months and years said that Britain must take some initiative. They content themselves with saying that there must be some initiative. They do not then say in most cases what it ought to be, nor do they discuss how to remedy whatever faults there were in the initiatives that were taken in recent years.<lb/>
I gather from the Government Statement that when the consultative document is published we are to be offered a wide choice of frameworks, and one can but pray that among them there will be some ingenious construction by the Government's advisers that will have a wide measure of appeal to people in Northern Ireland on which they can settle. I understood the noble Lord, Lord Monson, to say that he deplored the enunciation by people in high places of views on which I am about to venture. Your Lordships' House is of course a high place, otherwise I would not have any hesitation in uttering these views because I hold them very deeply.<lb/>
The duty&#x2014;the obligation&#x2014;of working out a settlement of the details of the system under which a wide measure of responsibility may be passed to local people for
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0285"/>
<col>553</col>
local affairs is that of the Northern Irish. They must settle it themselves. It is no use whatever them saying "Britain got us into this trouble; Britain must get us out." It is no good harking back over the centuries to the wrongs of Ireland; it is no good being content to shelter behind the belief that it is for the other chap to work out one's own salvation.<lb/>
It is creditable that so many people in Northern Ireland go bravely on with business as usual despite the troubles. But the difference between being brave and disregarding the troubles and being apathetic, the difference between being brave and opting out of any political initiative of one's own, is small indeed. It would be sad if the fate of Northern Ireland suffered because enough men and women of quality did not bestir themselves to do something about the fate of their own country.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Moyola, said that in the present circumstances there was nothing people could do. With great respect, I would disagree with him. What every man and woman in Northern Ireland can and should do is concern himself or herself about the tragic state into which the Province has got and, in particular, should exercise himself or herself to try to see the other man's point of view, to realise that, whatever the ultimate fate of the country, those who live there now must live with reasonable regard for one another regardless of their inherited beliefs and traditions. They must so conduct themselves that there is generally at atmosphere in which such initiatives as the Secretary of State has taken can flourish.<lb/>
That may sound dull and unadventurous, but it is essential. One hopes that men and women of quality will take up again political activity, not necessarily of the violent kind&#x2014;I do not mean physical violence but intellectual violence, debate and argument. There is too much of the former already, but if people will concern themselves and not just be content with "business as usual", then there will be an atmosphere in which such initiatives as the Secretary of State has taken can prosper.<lb/>
I very much hope that the resounding "Noes" that have already been given to what the Secretary of State has said will
<col>554</col>
not in the end represent the attitude of those who consider themselves to be the leaders of the community at present. One would suppose that 10 years of tragedy and terror would have brought about some compulsion in people to do what I am saying they ought to do: to devote themselves to a better atmosphere and better things. Tragically, it seems not to be so. One comes back again to this: the difference between commendable bravery and deplorable apathy is not very great.<lb/>
I hope that the good people there&#x2014;and, as the noble Lord, Lord Leonard, said, so many are, most are; and so few really want violence and to work their will by undemocratic means&#x2014;will achieve a growth of responsibility. Everybody is going to have to yield a little of his treasured beliefs. "Not an inch" is the only political doctrine that, so far as I know, has ever been converted into a piece of metal upon which my wandering gaze rested long ago in Stormont. I do not know what has happened to that. If it still exists, I hope that it is looked on as a warning to wantons, a death's head at the feast, if you like, my Lords, and there will be no more of it. Everybody is going to have to give a little if they are going to get anywhere at all.<lb/>
These are the doors at which we all must push, even if the door at which the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, was pushing was already open. I hope that those who have talked about rejecting the initiative that has been taken will think again and will work together for their country's good. It is on Ulster men and women that really the duty&#x2014;the obligation&#x2014;rests, and with whom the only possibility of success rests.</membercontribution></p>

Whatever anybody may think about the timing being right or wrong, surely it is vindicated by the number of very able speakers who have spoken here today. I congratulate him on that. I should also like to congratulate my noble friend the Duke of Abercorn on his maiden speech. He spoke with great clarity, as one would expect. The noble
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0286"/>
<col>555</col>
Lord, Lord Grey of Naunton, spoke of his past efforts on behalf of Northern Ireland. I speak with great feeling about his experiences as Member of Parliament for County Fermanagh, where even today, some 10 years after, he is remembered with great affection as being one of the best Members of Parliament we have ever had. I, for one, look forward very much to his regular attendance in this House. Indeed, I think we have been remarkably strengthened in this House of late. We have the noble Lord, Lord Blease, with us&#x2014;a great addition to any company at all. Sitting below me we have the noble Earl, Lord Erne, whom I am hoping we can stimulate into taking a regular part in our proceedings. I am not sure that we shall not give Scotland a bit of a run for its money!<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Grey, said he thought that no Englishman understood Northern Ireland and that no Northern Irish person understood himself. So far as he is concerned&#x2014;and it is a great pleasure to follow him&#x2014;he has broken one rule in that, as a New Zealander, he has not only understood the English but has understood the Northern Irish in a way they certainly do not understand themselves. I was, as always, greatly impressed by his speech.<lb/>
I should like to start by saying that I very much agree with what the noble Duke said about the problems of the Northern Ireland Office. I think it is as well to say once more what I have said many times; namely, that the job of Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office is a very arduous one, and if we complain and say that they live in an ivory tower and do not get enough native Northern Ireland advice, or what I would call "proper reaction", then that is largely the result of a system which has been going on for far too long. So I support the noble Duke and I also welcome the initiative. I support also what the noble Lord, Lord Moyola, said about the necessity for providing for some vacuum, because we cannot go on for ever having a political vacuum.<lb/>
I want to welcome the initiative of the Secretary of State for another reason altogether. In the last year&#x2014;this has been mentioned before&#x2014;it seems to me there has been an attempt to drag Northern
<col>556</col>
Ireland into the international arena and to obscure the truth that the solution of the problems of governing Northern Ireland lies within the United Kingdom and is the responsibility of Her Majesty's Government. It has been mentioned already that great pressure has in fact been put on Her Majesty's Government, and in public, by the Irish-American lobby; and so much of that has been done really with no knowledge at all of Northern Ireland. So much of it also has been done for electoral purposes. I consider that a great deal of this has been irresponsible because, if you live in Northern Ireland and hear these American politicians talking in this nonsensical way about Northern Ireland, it creates a tremendous tension and encourages the men of violence. I am absolutely certain that what are called "the four horsemen" and their statements in the last 12 months have done immense damage to the cause of peace, which they have said publicly they support.<lb/>
My worry about the situation in America has been growing over the last year, when I kept on getting reports that the Irish-American lobby was in fact increasing. Further to that, it appeared that our own embassy was really doing nothing to counter this very evil propaganda. I was very upset to hear the former Ambassador express his private view as being that the British should withdraw, I find it difficult to believe that he could give publicly the view of the policy of Her Majesty's Government and at the same time, not in private, convey an opposite view. But I am glad to say that, from the same people who reported to me the inactivity of Her Majesty's embassy in Washington before this, I hear that a lot of the lost ground is now being retrieved. I should like to believe that the initiative taken by the Secretary of State will have an effect on that particular lobby, because we are going into what I would consider to be quite a dangerous time, if Senator Kennedy is going to be the Democratic candidate.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Moyola, raised the question of security. It really is impossible, or at least very difficult, to think in what I would call progressive and malleable terms of political moves to form institutions, when the security situation is at your door. It is of paramount
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0287"/>
<col>557</col>
importance that the people of Northern Ireland should feel that the Government's view is that their security must come first. This is all relative to the success or failure of the Secretary of State's initiative, and so I should like to say that the appointment of Sir Maurice Oldfield has created a certain amount of confidence. It has shown that Her Majesty's Government realise they will have to use more than just conventional methods to beat the terrorism.<lb/>
Also I welcome the new secret agreement with Dublin regarding the fight against terrorism. I must make it clear that those of us who live in Ulster are almost daily affected personally&#x2014;it has affected me personally in our area. Almost daily we hear of the murder of a police officer, a soldier, a UDR soldier or a prison officer. So many times it has been either the son or brother of a friend of mine. Security is our first consideration. Sitting here in this wonderful Chamber, it is probably difficult to imagine the emotions and the problems caused by the murder of someone in a village, in a town or in a street; and so I do ask for the sympathy of the House when we are seen to be intransigent, when we are seen to feel that we want more security for our lives. It is so easy for somebody&#x2014;say, a dustman&#x2014;to be murdered on his way to work or for someone like a friend of mine, to be murdered while delivering fruit and vegetables to the local school.<lb/>
I feel that the Government should be slightly more ready than they have been in the past to understand the ebb and flow of these emotions&#x2014;and they do ebb and flow irrationally. At this present moment, as my noble friend Lord Moyola said, the position is extremely tricky and very dangerous. We are all very much afraid of sectarian murders returning to the streets. If I might give an example of where I feel the emphasis might possibly have been different, the other day&#x2014;your Lordships may have seen this&#x2014;the councils in Northern Ireland passed a resolution asking for stricter security. That resolution asked for measures which were not in fact practical or wise, but the reaction from the Government was that this represented extreme sectarianism. That may or may not have been true about the individual values, but what
<col>558</col>
cannot be ignored is that you do not get the mass of people in Northern Ireland expressing that view unless underlying it there is a very strong fear such as that which exists at this moment. It is for that reason that my noble friend Lord Moyola and I believe that the Government have somehow or other to find a new public initiative for the problem of security. This really surrounds the problems of this secret agreement with Dublin, because nothing can be said.<lb/>
If your Lordships look back at the record of visits by various Secretaries of State and Ministers to Dublin Ministers, on every single occasion they have come back and said they were satisfied with the co-operation that existed. In point of fact, very little is done and a whole lot more could be done. To ordinary people, and especially to those living on the Border, the reality will only appear when something is actually seen to be a success. The problem for the Secretary of State is an agreement that something is secret This is an initiative that really does not satisfy the need for confidence and reassurance.<lb/>
The Government have said that they recognise the pitfalls of the course they have set themselves. I myself deplore the decision of the Official Unionists not to attend this conference. I do so because in the long and very great tradition of Unionism, abstention plays no part. It is totally contrary to it, and I am absolutely sure that if they do not attend they will lose out. Nevertheless, I think it is right that we should understand their reasons, because the EEC election, when we had a progressive form of election&#x2014;proportional representation&#x2014;enabled Dr. Paisley to demonstrate a support which he should never have been entitled to do. He now stands on the threshold, and has been called the leader of Ulster Unionist opinion. In no way will I recognise that he is the leader of Ulster Unionist opinion.</membercontribution></p>

<col>559</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01324"><member>Viscount BROOKEBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord slightly misunderstands me. I was talking on this issue. I believe it was wrong to give proportional representation to Northern Ireland, without having it for the rest of the United Kingdom. The net result, as on so many occasions when to have had intelligent reforms applied to Northern Ireland, is that it has backfired on us. This one has backfired like nobody's business and has produced a very difficult situation for the official Unionists. They are certain&#x2014;and I, too, am certain of it&#x2014;that if an assembly or a conference fails to reach a proper agreement it will reopen the bitterness, which to some extent has died down, and the only gainer from that will be Dr. Paisley and his party. I am certain that if we fail on this conference, then a lasting settlement will be that much harder to achieve, because every time that we have tried to do something to arrive at a settlement it has made the problem much more difficult for the next time.<lb/>
The present Secretary of State and his Government have a more difficult problem than either my right honourable friend William Whitelaw or the right honourable gentleman Merlyn Rees. I speak with considerable experience. I was elected twice as a Member of Parliament for Stormont, I was elected to the Assembly, with the Executive, and I was elected finally to the talking shop which was the Convention. During that time, I did my best to improve the situation, to such an extent that I extinguished my elected career in Northern Ireland by my support of Brian Faulkner.<lb/>
May I say this, because I think that there has been a lot of misunderstanding about the Executive and the fall of the Executive I supported Brian Faulkner. I refused to go into his Government, because I did not consider that we were a legitimate Government entitled to have a council of Ireland. In fact, the Executive was already finished, because it was not considered by the people of Northern Ireland to be legitimate, long before the strike chopped off its head. That is my view about the situation. There were so many people, right across the North of Ireland, who considered that it was not legitimate in terms of that kind.<lb/>
If in this present round too much is attempted, polarisation will definitely
<col>560</col>
worsen, and believe that the aim should be very modest, such as that outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Moyola. But it follows that whatever is created will have to operate within the limits of direct rule. Therefore it is of the greatest importance that the Secretary of State examines the working of direct rule, to see where it can be made more responsive and more efficient; and it should be made easier to operate whatever solution he can arrive at.<lb/>
In the <i>Observer</i> last Sunday, the leader put its finger on the problem when it said that to move away from direct rule is to try to move from something which is acceptable in both communities, to something which is acceptable in only one. That is the dilemma. At the moment, direct rule is the most acceptable; but it is not really acceptable. For this reason, I believe that if we fail to get an assembly this time we shall be in very great difficulty indeed. When we discuss this initiative, we must remember that there is only one initiative which will stop the IRA, the men of violence&#x2014;because this is against the background of security&#x2014;and this they make absolutely clear. They have said from the very beginning that the British must withdraw. That we should not consider. I wish success to the Secretary of State, but he must keep the security situation under control.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01326"><member>Lord MELCHETT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I add my congratulations to those of all the other noble Lords who have spoken, to the noble Duke on his maiden speech. The difficulty with speaking so late in the debate is that there is really nothing left to say in congratulating a maiden speaker, so I shall not attempt to do so. Something that he said struck a chord in my own mind when he talked about downgrading local hospitals, which, as he may know, is something with which I had some concern when I was a Minister in Northern Ireland. He suggested that it would be a good idea to get the opinion of local medical experts, to get a consensus from them, on the desirability or otherwise of taking certain action at a particular hospital. All I can suggest to him is that if he can find two medical experts anywhere in Northern Ireland who are prepared to agree on any medical
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0289"/>
<col>561</col>
issue, let alone one as controversial as the future of a local hospital, he has my good wishes.<lb/>
I particularly wanted, this late in the debate, not to speak very widely and not to follow some of my noble friends on this side of the House&#x2014;in particular, my noble friend Lord Kilbracken&#x2014;on the longer-term future for Northern Ireland, but to stick very firmly to the possible contents of the Government's consultative document. If I may, I should like to start&#x2014;which I know is the easy thing&#x2014;by saying what I hope the Government will not put in the consultative document as a possible option.<lb/>
First, on the basis of my own experience, do not believe that direct rule is a satisfactory medium, and certainly not a satisfactory long-term solution or constitutional arrangement for Northern Ireland to be governed under. My own feeling&#x2014;and I remember saying this many times as a Minister myself&#x2014;is that although it may be everybody's favourite second choice, that is not enough to commend it. It seems to me to rely much too heavily on the abilities and personalities of a very small number of people. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, is lucky in having one more colleague than I did. Nevertheless, it is only five or six people. If you get two or three who are not as able as I know the noble Lord, Lord Elton, is, then it is quite possible that half of the departments in Northern Ireland will be extremely badly run. To that is added the enormous disadvantage of having no democratic mandate from a local party for those involved in running the departments. Nobody in Northern Ireland voted either for me when I was a Minister there, or for the noble Lord, Lord Elton, now as Minister and his colleagues. Therefore, under direct rule there is no democratic check on the activities of Ministers.<lb/>
I am sure that the noble Lord is finding, as I did, that in the direct rule position one rapidly moves as a Minister from total ignorance of what one is meant to be doing, and ignorance of life in Northern Ireland, through a very brief period&#x2014;which I cannot remember particularly noticing&#x2014;of actually knowing something about what is going on and enjoying the job, to a period when the strain of travelling, the strain of the problems in
<col>562</col>
Northern Ireland and the many other strains associated with the job are almost overwhelming. It is for all those reasons that I do not think direct rule is an option which should be considered seriously for the long run.<lb/>
Even more strongly, I would rule out the option of giving more power to the existing district councils in Northern Ireland. My own experience, with responsibility for education which included sport&#x2014;which is one of the responsibilities of the existing local councils&#x2014;was that a very small minority of councils, but nevertheless a significant minority, was prepared to use the power of the majority on the council to take decisions which, in the public view, were clearly discriminatory against, on the whole, the Catholic population, but not exclusively so; occasionally decisions were taken which had the opposite effect because another group was in the majority on the council. Enough councils were prepared to act in that way and to take decisions which were seen to be biased, with the object of discriminating against one bit of the community or another, for me not to have confidence in those fora: to feel that they would not administer greater powers in a way which could possibly be satisfactory.<lb/>
The real problems arises in councils where one community or another is in a very small minority. In Londonderry there is an almost even balance and a great deal of sharing of chairmanships, so what I have just said could not possibly apply to them. Unfortunately, however, there are enough councils where there is a very large majority and a very small minority&#x2014;representing the minority community, for example&#x2014;to make one feel that it would not be at all satisfactory to give local authorities greater powers. I could see them very quickly returning to some of the things which were alleged and which certainly happened before Stormont was abolished.<lb/>
The other point I should like to suggest to the Government regarding their consultative document&#x2014;this is not a point which is very often made&#x2014;is that they should avoid, if they possibly can, proposing solutions which involve major administrative upheavals at the same time as they are introducing new political mechanisms of one kind or another. The area boards which administer health
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0290"/>
<col>563</col>
and education and the housing executive which administers housing are not particularly popular in Northern Ireland. I cannot say that I always agreed with some of the education boards when they disagreed with the policies on education which the last Government were trying to introduce. Nevertheless, it seems to me that everybody always underestimates the upheaval which administrative changes cause. If some new democratic institutions are to be introduced as a result of the Government's initiative, it seems to me that we shall greatly reduce the chance of their success if at the same time the administrative machinery in Northern Ireland is being turned upside down and if for another four years&#x2014;which is what it took to settle the last administrative upheaval&#x2014;everybody is uncertain about what they are meant to be doing, who is meant to be doing it and where they are meant to be doing it.<lb/>
My fourth and final suggestion about what should not be put into the consultative document relates to any proposals for what I think the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, called the "talking shop" of one of the previous initiatives. It seems to me to be very dangerous and counterproductive for local politicians in Northern Ireland to be given the opportunity of public debate about issues for which they have no responsibility. To my mind, the inevitable result of that will always be competition to see who can be rudest about the Ministers in the direct rule team. I hope that that alone will mean that this particular proposal will not commend itself to the noble Lord and his colleagues. If there is to be any political change of control in Northern Ireland, I am sure it must involve the devolution of real powers.<lb/>
Having ruled out a number of things, one is clearly left with the option of giving power over the Government departments in Northern Ireland to a local, democratically elected assembly. If there has been a common theme in the debate it is that what a number of people are hoping for is an assembly democratically elected by proportional representation of some form: a system where the chairmanships of committees which are responsible for different departments are given out in proportion to the members elected to the assembly, with the departments covering
<col>564</col>
agriculture, health and social services, education, commerce, manpower services and a number of those fields which have already been mentioned.<lb/>
I have a great deal of sympathy with those noble Lords who have advocated that kind of solution, but one of the problems they have not mentioned is what powers are to be retained by Westminster politicians, in particular financial control: Who decides to share out the money between the different departments? If this is the route to be followed, it seems to me in the first place that this control has to be retained by Northern Ireland Office Ministers. Control of the security forces, the administration of justice and a number of other matters, I take it from those noble Lords who have advocated this proposal, would also be retained at Westminster. One of the difficulties I can foresee is deciding where&#x2014;either in the assembly, if it is elected in Northern Ireland, or at Westminster&#x2014;Northern Ireland Office Ministers should be questioned about the powers which they retain. It may be that to keep everybody happy about that they would have to face questioning both in your Lordships' House and in another place and also in an assembly in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Perhaps I may finish on two slightly negative notes. I apologise to some extent about them, but it is important to make these points. First, it would be a mistake if anybody in your Lordships' House thought that the political initiative which the Government have taken to start discussions, hopefully to lead to some positive outcome, is likely to have any effect on the level of violence in Northern Ireland, which many noble Lords have mentioned. Judging by past experience, and I suppose by experience over the last month or two, the effect is likely to lead to a considerable increase in the number of people who are killed and injured in Northern Ireland. That is what has happened in the past when political initiatives have been taken and I can see no reason, unless the noble Lord can encourage us about this, why anything different is likely to happen this time. I hope all those who advocate some political changes will realise that the two things are connected, if they are, in a negative sense&#x2014;in the sense that violence is likely to get worse, not better.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0291"/>
<col>565</col>
The other point I should like to make, which echoes a remark which has already been made in the debate, is that the politicians in Northern Ireland under direct rule both by the last Administration and by this have been urged to take some political initiative&#x2014;to take some step. But no sooner do they do so than they are all criticised for whatever they have done. It seems to me that in particular those outside Northern Ireland have elevated the importance of tinkering with the way that direct rule or the existing political system is controlled. They have elevated it to rather greater importance than it really has.<lb/>
To end on a slightly controversial note, it seems to me that the cuts in Government expenditure in Northern Ireland which have already taken place and which no doubt today's White Paper, when we have a chance to study it, will disclose for the future&#x2014;cuts in the level of public services in Northern Ireland, given the background of poverty and the appalling conditions in which so many people live&#x2014;are likely to have a far greater negative effect on the position in Northern Ireland than any positive effect which can be achieved through this sort of political initiative.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01328"><member>Lord HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for the way in which he introduced this debate. I hope it may be fitting if I say from these Back-Benches to him or about him that nobody would describe him as a career politician. Nevertheless, he has been democratically elected in Northern Ireland on several occasions and he plays an important part in the debates on Northern Ireland in your Lordships' House. I believe that he does this from a sense of responsibility and from a real love of his fellow-countrymen. I share with him his vision of an Ireland that may become deeply religious but distinctly non-sectarian.<lb/>
I am encouraged to join in this debate by the fact that in September I spent nearly three weeks visiting Northern Ireland, and I would just like to mention three things that I noticed during the course of that visit. I accept many of the things which my noble friend Lord Brookeborough said about security, but what really struck me was the very great
<col>566</col>
normality of so much of daily life as it goes on all the time. Another matter that impressed me was that some people, some of the time, may be intimidated; a great many have not been intimidated and were definitely not going to be intimidated.<lb/>
The third point that impressed me was the very great amount of creativity which has come out of that country over the last 10 years. Whether one looks at community work or housing associations or the arts or youth work, in many different fields a great flow of creativity has come out. People may be politically frustrated but I suggest that they have a deep urge to "do their own thing" and to do it in the most creative way. That is encouraging.<lb/>
To return to the Question on the Order Paper, I should like to start from a pamphlet entitled <i>Ulster Today and Tomorrow</i> by Dr. John Oliver which was published by PEP in March 1978. It sets out just about all the known options for Northern Ireland and also the points to be taken into consideration in Anglo-Irish dialogue. I feel that the existence of this pamphlet almost excuses Her Majesty's Government from producing yet another consultative paper.<lb/>
Dr. Oliver is particularly good when he describes the means for expanding political consent. He gives many examples of what has been called the "politics of accommodation" in other divided countries in other parts of Europe and elsewhere. Perhaps equally important, he gives many instances of the existing degree of inter-sectarian co-operation at present working and functioning in Northern Ireland. Dr. Oliver goes on to quote Professor Richard Rose, who has written:
<quote>"Many talk about a solution to Ulster's political problem but few are prepared to say what the problem is. The reason is simple. The problem is that there is no solution".</quote>
Does that, I wonder, sound a little cynical or defeatist? I think there is a great deal of truth in it, and the truth lies in an insufficient amount of political consent at the present time. Perhaps this comes out fairly clearly when one thinks that in a country with little over 1 million voters there are no less than five Unionist parties, five Republican groups, two Labour Parties and at least one Centre Party&#x2014;and I may have missed a few.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0292"/>
<col>567</col>
Despite this division of opinion and despite the fact that no clear solutions are apparent, nevertheless I believe that a process of reconciliation has been going on for quite a long time. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford mentioned two very constructive pamphlets, both published this year; one from the New Ulster Political Research Group and the other from the Southern Dublin Party Fine Gael. I also mentioned these in your Lordships' House in a debate in May. It is encouraging that both pamphlets were presented by their authors in person at a conference this summer on the Antrim coast. They were then openly discussed in a gathering of practising politicians. So there was a personal, direct, face-to-face encounter between two widely conflicting views.<lb/>
I believe and hope that the Government's proposals will carry forward this process of reconciliation by at least one or two small steps. I suggest that there is now a need to create an elected assembly rather soon and perhaps to work out the details of its fine print at a later point. I do not want to give the impression that one just goes into things blindfold, and I should like to indicate some minimum functions for an elected assembly. I suggest that we need something a good deal more elevated than a county council but definitely less than a parliament. The initial functions of such a body might well include the supervision of direct rule and the power to question Ministers and others; to act as a channel for grievances. as the noble Earl, Lord Perth, mentioned in the course of his speech. I think the assembly should discuss draft Orders in Council before they are laid at Westminster. It should be capable of examining the affairs of State boards (the numerous Quangos which were mentioned earlier) and it should be able to debate their reports and to help these boards to become more responsive to public opinion. The assembly should be able to debate the reports of Northern Ireland committees of inquiry, such as, for instance, Professor Astin's report on the question of school management. In the course of his maiden speech the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, just touched on the possibility of getting to the assembly representatives of the EEC and, perhaps particularly, the Commission.<lb/>
<col>568</col>
These are important functions. One has only to think of the state of relationships between the general public in Northern Ireland and the Housing Executive. They are functions which are little performed or not performed at all at the present time, and even in 1984 the situation will be only a little better when the elected Members in another place are slightly more in number. I believe that we need an elected assembly, and once a good start has been made on minimum functions, further powers could be added later. I believe that the people of Northern Ireland would welcome such an assembly, whatever may be the mental reservations at the present moment of some of their leaders. With that, I wish Her Majesty's Government Godspeed with their plans.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01329">7.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01330"><member>Lord BLEASE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from these Benches I should like to join in expressing sincere appreciation to the noble Lord from Ulster, Lord Dunleath, for having initiated this important and indeed vital issue for debate in this House. I also wish to applaud the reasoned, thoughtful and generally fair way in which he presented the difficult, emotional and tortuous political issues which inevitably arise in any discussion about the way forward for government in Northern Ireland. I should of course have been disappointed had he done otherwise. It has been my privilege to be associated with the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, over some 20 years in matters and projects concerned with employment and industrial development and the problems of young people in Northern Ireland. These matters have already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Grey of Naunton. So I know something of his high standard of public service, his commitment to cultural and economic progress in Ireland and his approach to upholding human dignity in all aspects of living, all of which are reflected in the objective way he had put forward proposals in this initiative.<lb/>
I hope it will not be considered presumptuous of me if I express a view. We have had a long and useful and informed debate. I should like to say how pleased I am to have seen and to have heard so many noble Lords from Northern Ireland present during, and taking part in, this particular debate. I should like to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0293"/>
<col>569</col>
join in congratulating the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, and to say that I look forward to hearing from him from time to time in this House. Were it not for the fact that the terminology of this House in referring to "friends" might perhaps embarrass him if I were to use the term "friend", nevertheless I know that outside I would use that term in a very warm way.<lb/>
When I saw the Whip I looked forward to hearing the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Elton. I personally have been encouraged by the thoughtful concern voiced by all sides of the House about the awfully sad and tragic plight confronting the men, women and children of all classes and creeds and political allegiance in Northern Ireland. Over the past 10 years of the Northern Ireland conflict there has emerged an ever growing mountain of reports, documents, papers, pamphlets and books about the issues and about their solutions. One is almost persuaded, if not tempted, to conclude with the question at this Box at this time, "What more can one usefully say?". Indeed it is a very pertinent question to pose at this particular hour after such a lengthy debate.<lb/>
Professor Rose has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. He was a very keen observer of the Irish political scene. If I might quote more extensively from the point already referred to, in chapter 7 of his book, published in 1976, <i>Northern Ireland: A Time of Choice,</i> he states:
<quote>"Many talk about a solution to Ulster's political problem but few are prepared to say what the problem is. The reason is simple. The problem is that there is no solution".</quote>
I agree with Lord Hylton that that is a very pessimistic outlook. But, while I accept the intractability of the problem, I must say that there are many situations in life where there are no human solutions. Many other countries have found that the human solution lies in learning ways to co-exist.<lb/>
The solution is certainly not to be found in paramilitary terrorism, fear and hatred, nor by suppression through excessive military security measures. This may be a little out of context; I have had to readjust what I wanted to say because of the time and what others have said, but as I have mentioned the question of security I think I must say this. I am convinced
<col>570</col>
that one of the major elements in the achievement of peace and confidence among the Northern Ireland community is the establishment of the primacy of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. More and more the fairness and the impartiality of the RUC is being accepted by all sections of the Northern Ireland community who do uphold a sense of justice and law and order. I believe these matters of the police can best be dealt with by the United Kingdom Government because of the necessity to work closely with the Republic on security matters and because of questions of complaints against the police.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, in his speech outlined five possible courses of action to solve the Irish problem&#x2014;and these are his words, "the Irish problem". I emphasise that because the matter we have been speaking about and to which Lord Dunleath gives attention is not really the Northern Ireland problem. The five courses he gave as being possible to pursue include, first, to do nothing&#x2014;not that the noble Lord said one should do nothing, but this course has been put forward and I believe it is a policy of despair. The next possible course is to decide on a united Ireland, which again is something far removed from the present situation. The next course is to take further measures to integrate fully Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Lord Dunleath referred to the Northern Ireland Labour Party's position in respect of this; I do not share the emphasis with the Northern Ireland Labour Party on this aspect of their policy, and they of course know that. The fourth course is to declare or negotiate an independent Ulster State. Of course his proposal is to proceed to an elected administrative assembly as a first step towards the devolution of legislative powers to such an elected body. There are elements in that which I feel I ought to repeat: "a first step towards the devolution of legislative powers to such an elected body."<lb/>
As the noble Lord has indicated, none of these five courses is new. Indeed, as has already been mentioned, Dr. Oliver, who spent a lifetime in the Northern Ireland Civil Service and had a very distinguished career in the service, and was also Secretary to the abortive constitutional conference of 1975&#x2013;76, says
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0294"/>
<col>571</col>
in his book, <i>Ulster Today and Tomorrow,</i> published in March 1978 by the Policy Studies Institute:
<quote>"In the fundamental matter of the constitutional status which Northern Ireland might adopt there are therefore some 20 options worthy of examination."</quote>
The option proposed by Lord Dunleath is one of those options which is dealt with in the book in some detail.<lb/>
However well intentioned or politically expedient it may be at the present time, I am convinced that there are serious dangers in looking for a constitutional blueprint to solve Northern Ireland's political problems. I do not accept that the solution (and here I quote) "lies with the restoration of more control over their own affairs". That is a quote from the Queen's Speech. I believe that the proposal to transfer back to locally elected representatives some, at least, of the powers of government at present exercised from Westminster, again to quote from Mr. Atkins' speech on 25th October 1979, is open to serious and dangerous misinterpretation. The statement requires careful explanation in political and constitutional and in non-ambiguous terms of the prior place of rights of citizens in Northern Ireland. For over 50 years we had a legislative devolution of functions affecting the rights and obligations of citizens of Northern Ireland which gave rise to many anomalies and grievances. Few, I believe, in Northern Ireland would wish to go back to that position. When I say that, I am not aware of any laws requiring to be enacted at the present time in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland which cannot be undertaken under the present direct rule arrangements. The Northern Ireland problem lies far beyond the matter of devolved powers. The question is much deeper. There are other fundamental issues that require attention if the solution we are seeking is to be found, the solution of a lasting peace, ustice and prosperity for these islands.<lb/>
In my view there are at least five dimensions to any realistic approach to the achievement of political settlement of the Northern Ireland problem. At this stage in the debate I think it would be wrong of me to go into a lot of detail; I will pose the questions and leave it to others to go into more detail. The first
<col>572</col>
question concerns relationships within Northern Ireland, relationships between the majority and the minority. The second dimension is the relationships between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. How can something like one and a half million people seek to overthrow decisions of a majority of something like 50 million? And that relationship must be clearly understood by the Northern Ireland people. Then there is the question of relationships between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There must be a positive approach to the border issue. It cannot be ignored. Then there is the question of relationships between the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic of Ireland concerning Northern Ireland matters; the question of security, the question of economic development and questions of cross-Border co-operation.<lb/>
The fifth dimension is the relationships and the role of Northern Ireland in the European Economic Community and in other supranational bodies, including NATO. The question of Northern Ireland has continued to be raised at Brussels, at Strasbourg, Geneva and the United Nations, and indeed in American politics. Therefore, the Northern Ireland question is much wider and much deeper and requires more direct attention than simply to deal with it as an issue of devolved powers leading to a permanent solution. So I must qualify my support for the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, for a locally elected administrative assembly as an interim position, pending a much deeper and closer examination of more fundamental issues upon which a satisfactory solution depends. The proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, is very real and concerns the problems of administrative access and accountability of civil servants in Northern Ireland. However, we must not accept that as an answer to the Irish Question.<lb/>
There is no doubt that the immediate need is to democratise direct rule by enabling more ready access and redress by the public. Ministers and Government Departments should be available to answer questions about matters concerning health, education, planning, roads, housing employment, industrial training, transport and many other local public services, whoever runs them, be it central Govern-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0295"/>
<col>573</col>
ment, local government or government agencies. It is that aspect of public administration in Northern Ireland, that has sadly deteriorated. People in all walks of life miss the right to be able to question public servants and to be kept effectively informed about matters concerning their day-to-day living. This is exemplified by the fact that in the five months of the Northern Ireland Assembly over 400 Questions were tabled for answer, and those Questions related to day-to-day matters concerning living in Northern Ireland. They did not deal with high-powered matters such as devolved government.<lb/>
It may be that a regional advisory council could restore that basic element to our Northern Ireland administrative arrangements. It can be fairly claimed that our administration and public services have for many years prided themselves on being a model of promptitude, courtesy and efficiency, which is a situation that many who worked in the public service would like to get back to. I suggest that a regional advisory council of 26 persons might be adequate. The noble Lord, Lord Hampton, and the noble Duke, the Duke of Abercorn, mentioned something along those lines when they were speaking. It would strengthen the role and standing of such a body if, in addition to having 18 persons elected on a provincial-wide proportional representation system, there could be 8 seats for persons appointed by the United Kingdom Government from a panel of nominees consisting of management, trade unions, educational and church representatives, following, of course, appropriate consultative procedures. At this stage all that I would wish to put forward, which in my view could be borne in Northern Ireland as a form of an Assembly, would be a regional advisory council. Anything else, from my experience and from what I have heard, would not only lead to serious disruption of the services but involve conflict during election periods. Frankly, while I support the general proposals raised in the Question, I would not wish them to take precedence over the Government's decision for consultation with Northern Ireland political parties.<lb/>
In that connection, I should like to close with a few words which I believe summarise my feelings at this time: dynamic reconciliation. The word
<col>574</col>
"reconciliation" has been used by a number of speakers. I consider that reconciliation must not be something bland, which moves on in a smooth way, but must be put forward in a dynamic way. Mr. Jack Lynch, speaking as the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic to a number of European and American persons on Saturday, 22nd September, closed by saying:
<quote>"This message is clear and sharp. Terrorism anywhere in our community is a threat everywhere. Violence breeds instability and instability violence. It is in the interest of all of us that the long torment of the Northern Ireland people should end. The whole history of this island shows that peace can come only in one way. It must be based on consent and reconciliation and it is for that we are striving".</quote>
I would change only two words in that particular paragraph; I would say, "The whole history of these islands". It is not only confined to the island of Ireland. The strife, the violence and the instability concern "these islands" in which the United Kingdom Government must play a very effective part.<lb/>
I should like to quote the words of Mr. Brynmor John on 25th October, at column 626, of the <i>Official Report</i> of the other place. The Secretary of State Mr. Humphrey Atkins made a Statement about the initiative and Mr. Brynmor John said:
<quote>"we &#x2026; feel that it is time for decisions rather than discussions".</quote>
Certainly Mr. Atkins has every sympathy from this side of the House in his efforts to promote some form of discussion that might lead to a permanent settlement of the Northern Ireland problem. It must not be seen in some sort of major blueprint exercise; it must be seen in a series of events over a number of years. Only in that way will confidence and reconciliation be brought about for the sadly divided people within Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01331">7.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01332"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, has done a service to the House in tabling this Question at this time, not least I should say by providing an opportunity for your Lorsdhips to welcome the noble Duke, Lord Abercorn, who has a very distinguished background of service in the Province and in another place, and whose family
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0296"/>
<col>575</col>
also has contributed a great deal of worth to the Province. He made an admirable embarcation upon the perilous waters of this House and I hope that he will sail often upon them.<lb/>
It is also an opportune time, as the noble Earl, Lord Longford, and other noble Lords have pointed out, because of the initiative which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has taken to get things moving again in the Province. It is appropriate also that the initiative in this House should have been taken by the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath. I say that in part, of course, because he speaks for the Alliance Party in this House and because that Party's policy has, since its foundation, been one of seeking conciliation between the different factions in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
But there is another and rather more unusual way in which the noble Lord and his family are symbolically linked with the tangled skein of the history of the Province which he drew to our attention quite recently and inadvertently. He has recently and generously completed the renovation of a magnificent organ in the Ulster Hall in Belfast. It was fitting as well as generous of him to do so, since the organ was itself the gift of his grandfather. But the link is that the Ulster Hall has a central place in the unfolding of Ulster's history, for it was there in February 1886 that Randolph Churchill "played the Orange card". So closely knit are the affairs we deal with.<lb/>
I do not propose this evening to rehearse before your Lordships the whole history from that day that has led us to our present predicament and&#x2014;let it be added&#x2014;opened to us our present opportunity. But it is inevitable that even in a short debate on Northern Ireland reference should be made to attitudes of very long standing and to events which are already history. Anyone seriously concerned about Northern Ireland's future must be aware of its past. He should also be aware of living in it, even though he may be surprised to find there quite a large number of his contemporaries dwelling in the tents of their ancestors. Therefore, I shall try not to go too far back in my own remarks, but I must at least begin by giving some account of what the
<col>576</col>
Government have been doing since the General Election in May, with particular reference to the issues raised in the noble Lord's Question.<lb/>
On 15th May the Gracious Speech declared the new Government's political aim for the Province. It was&#x2014;
<quote>"to seek an acceptable way of restoring to the people of Northern Ireland more control over their own affairs".</quote>
In the subsequent debate my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said, as reported at column 85 of the<i>Official Report: </i>
<quote>"We shall maintain the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland for as long as that is the wish of the majority of the people in the Province".</quote>
Those are the parameters within which we are operating. In our view both of them are inescapable. First: direct rule, however strenuously we strive to apply it with sensitivity and flexibility, is no substitute for local democracy because it cannot respond directly to democratic pressures. The noble Lord, Lord Moyola, put that very clearly in his speech, and so indeed did many noble Lords when talking about bureaucracy, because bureaucracy for a Government from, shall I say, across the water must act in some sense as an insulation between that Government and public opinion. On the other hand, it is absolutely essential to the function of government and provides its principal means of contact. I must say in this context that although I recognise what has been said about the difficulties of bureaucracy and its impact upon life in general, I have been greatly impressed, as have my colleagues, by the dedication and expertise that we have found within the departments which have been entrusted to us.<lb/>
As there is this difficulty, it means that in the long term direct government must be less efficient than democratic local government. Our task is to find an acceptable way in which responsibility for important functions of government within the Province can be returned to local democratic control, and a form in which it can be exercised with the confident support of all sections of the community there. The burden borne by central Government and by the people of Great
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0297"/>
<col>577</col>
Britain in maintaining direct rule is neither light nor welcome. We do not wish it to continue any longer than is necessary. To those who suggest the contrary and who feel that we maintain it by choice and are holding on to the Province in order to achieve some sort of benefit for the rest of the United Kingdom&#x2014;and there are such people&#x2014;I may say, "Look at the facts and look at the figures".<lb/>
The facts are that in order to protect the civil population from factional terrorism on a very large scale we have had to maintain a military presence at a net cost to the Exchequer of &#x00A3;81.5 million in the last financial year and &#x00A3;404.3 million since the onset of the present emergency. But it has not just cost us money to keep the peace; it has cost lives as well. Thirtyone regular soldiers have been killed since 1st January this year; since the onset of the emergency the total is 321, and very many more have been seriously injured. Those are not statistics; they are people&#x2014;mostly young people, boys, who are sent there as peacekeepers. Nobody who knows these people and who has to write letters of condolence to their parents or their wives can ever be unaware of the terrible cost. Nor, indeed, must we count their lives alone. There have been 98 fatalities in the UDR and 90 in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. These men have been no less gallant; nor have the 1,427 civilians who have died in these troubles been less unfortunate.<lb/>
There are very real pressures on us all to bring all this dying to an end, but I must emphasise that security must stay with Her Majesty's Government as their responsibility until the problem is resolved. Those are the facts. But it may be that those who do not understand the British suppose that we are hardened to this cost and that we willingly send our young men in to face surreptitious and deadly assault in order to protect some great financial interest. If the facts did not speak for themselves, to them I say, "Look at the figures". In the last year the subvention from central funds to Northern Ireland has amounted to &#x00A3;859 million, and the net cost to the Exchequer since 1969 has been &#x00A3;3,931 million. We recognise the difficult circumstances of life in the Province. It is not being
<col>578</col>
exploited by the rest of the United Kingdom; it is being sustained by it, as I hope the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford will acknowledge when he comes to read <i>Hansard.</i><lb/>
Northern Ireland has had three systems of government since it came into existence: the Stormont Parliament and Goverment established by the 1920 Act, the Assembly and Executive of 1973&#x2013;74, and the arrangement which is known colloquially as direct rule in which, in the absence of a local legislature and executive, Northern Ireland's administration is directly supervised by Ministers of the United Kingdom Government accountable to Parliament here at Westminster. In passing, let me point out that Northern Ireland has never at any time in its history had representative institutions exactly like those in any other part of the United Kingdom. It has never been administered in precisely the same way. Furthermore, neither Her Majesty's Government nor any of the major parties at Westminster or in Northern Ireland believe that it should be so administered.<lb/>
In their election manifestoes, all the main Northern Ireland parties called for the transfer or devolution of responsibilities away from Ministers such as myself, accountable only to Westminster, and back into the hands of locally-elected representatives, brought together in new political institutions which would meet the particular needs of Northern Ireland. That is an aim common to all parties, including Her Majesty's Government. All the manifestoes of the main Northern Ireland parties were generally critical of the effects of direct rule, which was variously perceived to be unrepresentative, unsatisfactory and even colonial. We would by no means accept that last adjective, but we are determined to see that so long as it lasts direct rule shall provide effective and impartial government. It is not anything more than a temporary expedient. I am nothing more than a temporary expedient. The most happy outcome of our present deliberations would be if my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and my other honourable friends and colleagues could succeed in working ourselves out of our jobs, and that is exactly what we are trying to do.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0298"/>
<col>579</col>
Earlier this year the Secretary of State had a number of meetings with a wide range of persons and organisations in Northern Ireland who had an interest in seeing political progress there. Thereafter he embarked upon a series of private and informal talks with the leaders of the four main parties. These private discussions continued after the Summer Recess. My right honourable friend did not expect that talks of this kind would lead straight on to inter-party agreement. That would have been a most unlikely outcome. Indeed, the talks illustrated, if further illustration were needed, the major differences that still exist between the positions of the major parties on central issues. However, the talks did not only establish differences; they also established some points on which there is general agreement. All the parties want to see some constructive, political life restored to Northern Ireland. For this purpose they all want to see an elected forum of some kind from which could be drawn an administration with real powers.<lb/>
There is a general desire to go beyond the body with a purely advisory or consultative role, in spite of some of the words of caution that we have heard this evening from noble Lords opposite. All the parties want to see some real responsibilities exercised by a representative body; also&#x2014;and this is crucial&#x2014;they all agree that it is a<i>sine qua non</i> of a successful new political structure that it should attract widespread support in Northern Ireland. That means from both communities. But we all know very well that different parties have quite different interpretations of how this essential requirement is to be met.<lb/>
For his part the Secretary of State has asked all the party leaders to recognise certain realities. First, even though the system operated for 50 years, there can be no question now of simply going back to the arrangements for the Stormont Government and Parliament. That system did not meet Northern Ireland's special circumstances and it would be wholly unacceptable to a substantial section of the Northern Ireland people.<lb/>
Secondly, there can be no question of integrating Northern Ireland completely with the rest of the United Kingdom.
<col>580</col>
Such a policy would run counter to major aspirations, not only in both parts of the Northern Ireland community but also in Great Britain and further afield. Thirdly, the Government have no intention of letting long-term aspirations about the constitutional position of Northern Ireland dictate their political policy, no matter what their source or direction.<lb/>
But it is the duty of the Goverment and, indeed, of all the responsible politicians engaged in discussion about Northern Ireland's future, to do more than state negatives, no matter how compelling they may be. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State therefore made a Statement last week inviting leaders of the four main political parties, who between them attract the allegiance of four out of five Northern Ireland voters, to join with us in seeking the highest possible level of agreement on new political structures for Northern Ireland. The conference will be given a working paper. My right honourable friend has described this as a consultative document in recognition of the fact that comments from others not invited to the conference will also be welcome. This may, in part, meet the strictures of the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, about the composition of the conference itself.<lb/>
That document, which will be laid before Parliament shortly, will contain a range of suggestions for the possible systems of government which might meet Northern Ireland's special needs. They will all be capable of adaptation, and they will all be options and not firm proposals. In other words, the document is not exclusive of any proposals contained within it except two. The first of these is any proposal to change the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. That is not the problem to which we are addressing ourselves. If anybody wishes to attempt this, they must recognise that even the beginning of that road lies on the other side of a bridge, and that that bridge constitutes the establishment of a stable, peaceable, effective and agreed administration of the Province within the United Kingdom as at present constituted. The bridge has to be crossed by everybody, whatever their distant vision of the future, before they can set foot on any road at all, whether it leads to change or
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0299"/>
<col>581</col>
to stability. For until we cross that bridge there is no road forward; there is only the trackless and unstable bog on which we are now standing and struggling.<lb/>
The models within the document will provide the raw material for the deliberations of the conference. It is to this document that today's debate, and Lord Dunleath's timely Question, are particularly relevant, for what we have heard this afternoon has, I hope, been a forerunner of what is to come. Your Lordships' various words of counsel will be available to those who will come to discuss the document, and they are available also to my right honourable friend and his advisers who have the consultative document under consideration. I shall be conveying much to my right honourable friend very shortly.<lb/>
I am therefore in the unusual position of having heard and understood the noble Lord's Question, and having heard and understood the views attached to it by noble Lords on all sides of the House without, as yet, being in a position to reply. But before I get to that point I must thank him for his valuable contribution, and other noble Lords as well. I shall attempt to pick up the points that were given, but the night is late and if some of the references are only in passing I hope that it will not be thought to be a discourtesy.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, himself referred to his proposals as what he called the fifth option, without Irish dimensions and with provision for progress to legislative functions, especially as a means of avoiding government by bureaucrats&#x2014;and there we have it again. That is certainly within the range of options that will be open to the conference to discuss. He suggested&#x2014;and I was not quite clear, but perhaps in reading<i>Hansard</i> I shall be clearer what the advantage will be&#x2014;that what should have been produced was not a consultative document but a White Paper. But the consultative document will itself be available to Parliament, as would a White Paper. It will itself be widely available outside the conference, and will be, I trust, used as the basis upon which a very wide range of public opinion will form itself and make itself known to the Secretary of State. It can hardly be otherwise.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01333"><member>Lord DUNLEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to intervene? The point I was trying to make was that I think it is Her Majesty's Government's duty, and I think it would be in all our interests, to put the onus on the Northern Ireland political parties to be constructive rather than destructive so that they will think, "How best can we make this work?", rather than to say, "That won't work. That won't work. That won't work" because of so-and-so. That is the point I was trying to make. At the end of the day I would say that probably Her Majesty's Government will have to come out with their own proposals. But I would hope that this will be before too long. That was the burden of my speech, that I wanted to see something happen soon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01334"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take the point absolutely, and I am in sympathy with its motives entirely. I do not think that it would be right in fact to deny the discussion that could be based on alternative proposals, and we would not wish to be in a position to impose a solution, because our experience would lead us to suppose that if we were to say, "This is what you will do before you have discussed it. Now go away and see how you will make it work", not many people would in fact be prepared to go and see how it would work. If that became the situation later after the alternatives had been discovered, of course we are in a different position. I understand the point.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hampton, was in fact proved to be in company of many of your Lordships, including the noble Earl, Lord Perth, and the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, on a disquiet about the means by which Her Majesty's Government communicate the true state of the facts in this problem to people abroad. Several noble Lords mentioned in particular the United States. Of course the embassy there is active, and one of my noble friends noticed a change in the tempo of that activity. We also of course have the vehicle of ministerial visits. We have had one official visit already; there is to be another one shortly. Three of my honourable friends have made private
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0300"/>
<col>583</col>
tours in the United States, missing no opportunity of describing what is in fact going on.<lb/>
None the less, we are aware of the gap between reality and perception not only in the United States but sometimes in other parts of the world. Much has been said&#x2014;and I do not want to dwell too much upon the face of terrorism as it is seen abroad&#x2014;of the murder of the late Lord Mountbatten, which was a very public atrocity and attracted therefore a great deal of public notice. But we in the Province are intensely aware of many other estimable people who also suffer at the hands of the terrorists. I myself wondered, when I received news of the murder of a delivery man in one of the schools for which I am responsible, after some of the children had arrived and while the staff were kept locked up in the kitchen, whether this was the sort of thing that the friends of terrorism abroad really want to see perpetrated. We are aware of the need for an increased effort in showing people abroad what is really happening, and that awareness has been sharpened by what your Lordships have said tonight. You need not think that nothing will arise therefrom.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford mentioned Corrymeela as one of the lights in the darkness. I visited it very recently, and I entirely subscribe to his view. The noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, suggested that it might be helpful if we extended the episcopal Bench, so enabling some of his co-religionists to sit upon it. I do not think it is for me to indulge in constitutional reforms on this side of the water. I noted that he had other religious leaders to join that distinguished and lawn sleeved throng, and I wondered whether it might include the leader of the Free Presbyterian Church! He referred to people who are dedicated to the often dangerous work of reconciliation. All of us must share that admiration.<lb/>
I wish to acknowledge the acknowledgment by the noble Earl, Lord Longford, of the fact that he had achieved his conversion to socialism by reading a book by my father called<i>England Arise.</i> By the time, as he rightly said, that the noble
<col>584</col>
Earl had got around to reading it my father was heading smartly for this side of the House. I only wish to say that I hope that the noble Earl will continue to follow, if tardily, in my father's footsteps. None the less, in that context I would welcome his kind remarks about my right honourable friend the Secretary of State, who is indeed both a very courageous and a very patient man. Courage and patience are both required in abundance in the job which he had taken on. The noble Earl also referred, very properly, to the effects of the Papal visit, and the hopes that that has given to many of us that reason will break through.<lb/>
To the noble Lord, Lord Monson, I must repeat, despite his strictures, that no solution will work if it does not have the support of the majorities of both sides of the community. They indeed have a very difficult framework, as he put it, within which to move towards such a solution. I agree there. They will indeed need the support and leadership of Her Majesty's Government and Westminster in their search; and the legislation to construct the solution must indeed be brought in by the Government of the United Kingdom when it is required. That is precisely why my right honourable friend has called upon their leaders to meet each other and discuss what that solution might be.<lb/>
I must thank the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, on his perceptive analysis of evolution of Catholic participation in the United Kingdom, and of the growth of ecumenism, and for his valuable demonstration of the possibility of peace and his vindication of the efforts and integrity of our security forces. For all those contributions I am greatly grateful. To the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, I can scarcely forbear to say that he ably demonstrated the deadweight of pessimism against which the Province is struggling, the conclusion of which was that a solution must be imposed, not agreed; I cannot follow him there.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Perth, asked whether Roman Catholics were fairly treated. We are doing our utmost to see that everybody in the Province is fairly treated. While I will of course conduct his suggestions to my right
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0301"/>
<col>585</col>
honourable friend, I cannot honestly think that a touring inquisition&#x2014;perhaps that was an unfortunate choice of words&#x2014;or a touring inspectorate, however distinguished, would add a great deal to what is already being done in this field. He said it was the Secretary of State's duty to keep people of goodwill informed of what was going on at the conference. I do not know what form this communication will take, but certainly we are concerned to engage the goodwill of our friends and indeed to persuade others to become such. I have mentioned already the concern he raised over propaganda.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Moyola, told us, and he was supported in this by the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, that the defeat of terrorism must have a higher priority than the achievement of devolved government. I wish to telescope what I have to say on many things. On this I would only say that a number of noble Lords have raised this matter, as have a number of people outside the House, and it is my view that security and reform do not fall in in single file and follow each other down the road but go hand in hand. If we are to allow violence to prohibit conversation and reconciliation, then that is a surrender to terrorism. If we are to seek reconciliation and conversation and to abandon the pursuit of the terrorist, that is an abandonment of any hope of success in the long run. The two things must become together and I can assure your Lordships that there is no lack of enthusiasm or determination in this direction.<lb/>
I regret that the recent cross-Border conversations led to agreements that cannot be discussed in detail. I understand that noble Lords may find this gives rise to some doubt, but I hope that they will accept from me that there really has been agreement, that it really is effective and that it really does work, and will work better, but that it might well be rendered ineffective if it started being discussed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, spoke with feeling about the position which I now occupy. Perhaps your Lordships felt a degree of sympathy for me, which I had not expected. As a result, I should say that he on his broad shoulders carried
<col>586</col>
two departments whereas I am carrying only one, so my admiration for his efforts is at least as great as his for mine.<lb/>
He said the quality of government must depend on the quality of the individuals who are my colleagues. I can tell him that he may rest assured that he need have no fear in that respect. But I heard his warning against another organisation of local government, I listened carefully to the model which he described of an elected body with subject committees&#x2014;and I do not doubt that that will be within the parameters that are discussed&#x2014;and he asked about the effects on the level of violence we might expect. I can only agree with him and with those who think like him, that those who deal out blood and bullets in the Province fear any political advance and will seek to prevent it by the only means they have to hand, and that, regrettably, is blood and bullets. That is the sterile land in which we are.<lb/>
From there it was a pleasure to be recalled by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, to the world of normality and creativity which we tend to forget, to the very beautiful and in large part the very peaceable country the Province of Ulster is. When I first spoke from this Dispatch Box on the subject I spoke with great sorrow of what seemed to me to be a war in paradise, and it still seems to me to be that.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Blease, then rose to wind up the debate from his side and spoke with an authentic and very cautious voice indeed. I was glad to hear his reference to the increasing respect for the RUC and his support for the retention of responsibility for internal security by Her Majesty's Government. He says there is nothing new in the proposals, but there are new things in the times; there is a new position and a new Government, and I believe there is a new realism. I hope we may not be entirely pessimistic in our approach.<lb/>
To all those who have spoken I have to say that the Question that is being asked must properly be addressed not to Her Majesty's Government but to those attending the forthcoming conference, for it is they into whose hands the future has quite properly been put. Our hope is that the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0302"/>
<col>587</col>
conference will draw on suggestions in the consultative document to produce a workable and acceptable scheme that will attract the highest possible level of agreement from the participants, a scheme containing guarantees not for one sector of the community only but for all, for we believe that the creation of a viable Administration in the North, based on partnership and particiption at every level, which would command the active support of all sections of the Northern community is feasible, and some noble Lords may recognise the source I have quoted with interest.<lb/>
I have now held office for approximately six months, a short time in which to come to grips with the Northern Ireland question. Indeed, if I were to follow the noble Lord, Lord Grey of Naunton, I might think that eternity itself would be too short for an Englishman to understand the problem, though he has the antipodean advantage in discovering the source of the problem that I lack, but I have begun to come to some conclusions. One is this: the question is immensely complex and within it are contained viewpoints and interpretations of history held with a passionate intensity of which visiting Englishmen and foreigners can catch only disconcerting glimpses. To unravel them requires a depth of historical knowledge and analysis that would leave most ordinary people baffled and confused.<lb/>
But within all that complexity lie a number of propositions which are quite simple and easily discerned. Most of them, sadly enough, are only illusions or half-truths. To classify the whole confrontation as a religious divide, for instance, is true in the sense that my noble friend the Duke of Norfolk used it, but in other senses those who read events as if it were the sole motivation are in fact looking at the past. If you say that religion provides the rationale rather than the motives you will be nearer the half-truth in another sense, for there are many outside religion altogether who exploit loyalties to different creeds in order to pursue their own Godless and destructive ends. Those who make acts of violence their excuse for not pursuing reconciliation are only their unwitting allies.<lb/>
But beneath all the misleading simplifications there is one very obvious and
<col>588</col>
inescapable fact of history. Since these many years in Northern Ireland there have been two great groups of people who have stopped talking to each other. They speak, yes&#x2014;indeed they shout&#x2014;but they do not talk and they do not listen, and the result of this is an increasing depth of ignorance of each other, increasingly enlivened by myths. Silence has begotten ignorance, ignorance has begotten falsehood, ignorance coupled with falsehood produces fear, and fear breeds hate and justifies itself in violence. Every community sees itself as a minority; every community feels itself threatened; every community is afraid; and every community takes refuge in the possibility of defending itself by means of force.<lb/>
There are exceptions. I speak in generalities, but what I say is true and it is this: only if men will sit down together and speak to one another and listen to each other openly, not in fear but with courage, only then can we ever hope to see peace in Northern Ireland, and it is for peace that our people are crying out. But that peace can come only from within the Province; it cannot be imposed and it cannot be forced. It must be agreed not by the terrorists but between the communities, and that agreement can come only out of discussion, not out of embattled tirades, not out of a sulking, timorous or pessimistic silence but out of talks.<lb/>
Given that, given the overwhelming wish of all the people for a confident, lasting and honourable peace, I cannot believe that their leaders will ever consider not coming to the conference table. Whatever excuses they could then present to those whom they lead, whatever bargains they had sought and failed to exact as the price of their presence, surely they would have denied to their people the very thing which they have all been put forward to obtain&#x2014;a future in which all of their children can live and grow old in confidence. What a cold and empty gesture, and what a dreadful responsibility, that would be!<lb/>
My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, has proposed one solution, at rather too great length. May I thank him for so doing and tell him that his Question will be answered not here, but at the conference table&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01336"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord has got me very slightly wrong.

I think that I was talking about England, Wales and Scotland. I sought to make clear in my overlong speech&#x2014;and if I have not done so, I am grateful to the noble Lord for pointing this out&#x2014;that I regard it as essential at present that we concentrate on the bridge that I spoke of. The roads towards integration, separation, independence, or anything else do not begin where we are now. We all want to get on a road. For God's sake! let us get over the bridge, and then start arguing about where we go afterwards.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01375">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to prevent foreign trawlers fishing within United Kingdom fishing limits in the English Channel and by using smaller mesh nets ignoring United Kingdom regulations essential for the conservation of our fishing stocks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01376"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES and FOOD (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all waters, including the English Channel, lying within British fishery limits are regularly patrolled by our fishery protection fleet in order to ensure that all fishing vessels comply with United Kingdom laws on mesh sizes and related fishery conservation measures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01377"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that reply. But is he satisfied, particularly in relation to the West Country ports, that the fishing patrol vessels are adequate in numbers and speed to cope with the poaching that has been occurring in the last few weeks? Secondly, in view of the speed with which this country implemented the recommendations regarding the mesh measurements of nets&#x2014;rightly, I believe, in view of the need to conserve fishing stocks&#x2014;will Her Majesty's Government press for similar action by other maritime powers, in order to conserve fishing stocks, and to give our fishermen a fair deal and prevent the poaching of immature fishing stocks?</membercontribution></p>
<col>596</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01378"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to my noble friend's first question is that we are satisfied that the number of vessels and the capability of the vessels is adequate for the task. With regard to the second part of her question, we are, of course, actively pursuing a common fishing policy within the EEC. We are anxious that this should be concluded as quickly as possible. We have taken action on conservation ourselves because we feel this to be very important; otherwise there will be no fish to fish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01379"><member>Lord BOOTHBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Earl whether Her Majesty's Government are satisfied that the Navy has enough ships of the particular kind required to ensure the effective protection of our inshore fishing industry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01380"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are satisfied that there are adequate vessels. The noble Lord, Lord Boothby, might like to know that there are five Royal Navy Island Class vessels and three vessels operated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland which are deployed on fishery protection duties in offshore waters. They are supported by RAF Nimrod aircraft, which fly about 180 hours a month on surveillance duties, and eight to 10 Royal Navy Ton Class vessels. A further three vessels operated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland are deployed in coastal waters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01381"><member>Lord BOOTHBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that satisfactory answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01382"><member>Lord HARMAR-NICHOLLS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that, on matters such as this, it is vital that we remain firmly within the law? Is he aware that in terms of our relationship with our partners in Europe we may be passing through a critical stage? Some of them are wanting to ignore the rule of law in certain matters, which could well bring about a breakdown in that very essential partnership. Would he agree that we must give a lead by seeing to it when a law or a regulation is in existence it is adhered to, and if we are disquieted about anything we get our remedies through the courts and do not take unilateral action which undermines the very rule of law itself?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01383"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think there is nothing which my noble friend has asked
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0307"/>
<col>597</col>
me in that question with which I would disagree. We are concerned to see that any action we take is within the law. We have taken certain action with regard to fishery conservation which we believe to be within the law, although there are others who have taken the case to the European Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01384"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say what is the Government's policy towards the Russian factory ships which are at present sitting in Falmouth harbour, thereby doing the local fishermen, the number of whose boats has been reduced from approximately 100 to 30, out of their livelihood?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01385"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is our duty to police and patrol the waters which are under our jurisdiction. If my noble friend has any particular point that he would wish me to look at I would be quite willing to do so, if he would be kind enough to let me know the details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01386"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not my noble friend agree that it is very difficult for the crew of a Nimrod aircraft to decide if a boat is using an illegal mesh? Therefore, would it not be wise to have helicopters carrying rubber dinghies with outboard engines which could be launched into the sea in order to inspect the nets?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01387"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is an ingenious suggestion. I am aware that it would be very difficult for any pilot to check the size of a 70 millimetre net from a fair height at a fair speed. That is, of course, why we have ships. It is up to the ships to board the vessels when there is any matter for concern. As regards helicopters, I think the initial reply to that suggestion is bound to be that this would be a matter of very considerable expense.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NORTH SEA OIL WELLS: <lb/>CONTROL OF BLOW-OUTS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01388">2.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01389"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<col>598</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01390">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01391">To ask Her Majesty's Government what safety measures they have in mind in the event of an oil blow-out in the North Sea.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01392"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of EMPLOYMENT (The Earl of Gowrie)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, each operator of an offshore oil/gas installation on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf has by regulation to prepare contingency plans for a number of emergency situations, including blow-outs. The contingency plans of fixed oil installations have been called in by the Department of Energy and are scrutinised&#x2014;albeit the ultimate responsibility must rest with the operator. Annual exercises are held by Government to test contingency planning procedures. In the event of a blow-out, the normal search and rescue facilities co-ordinated by H.M. Coastguard can be called upon and operators can also call upon the resources of other North Sea operators through the "Sector Club" arrangements. The Department of Energy has also made arrangements to monitor the operators' responses to blowouts and to inform and co-ordinate the various departmental interests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01393"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his somewhat comforting reply. However, is he aware that in my Question I was not concerned with the safety of the crew on the oil-rigs&#x2014;because the oil companies are so efficient that they would obviously have ample safety precautions in that respect&#x2014;but that my real thoughts were turning on the virtually complete destruction of marine life in such a restricted area as the North Sea? I was hoping that Her Majesty's Government might have some task force at hand composed of people like Red Adair. I understand that there is a man called Red Adair who appears to be able to control these blow-outs. I wonder whether Her Majesty's Government have a reserve of Red Adairs to try to control such a blow-out, which could be disastrous?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01394"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure my noble friend that no political considerations will come into the provision of safety in the event of a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0308"/>
<col>599</col>
blow-out. In fact, as he said, the Government do have a task force&#x2014;the Blow-Out Emergency Team&#x2014;which can, in the last resort, take over control of operations from the operator.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01395"><member>Lord STRABOLGI</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, arising out of what the noble Viscount said, may I ask the Government whether they are aware of the very great work that Mr. Red Adair and his team from Texas did in capping the Ekofisk blow-out&#x2014;work for which we are all indebted? What are Her Majesty's Government doing to ensure that a British team is trained for this very important work should a similar emergency arise in our waters? I am sure that the Government would agree that this is too important a matter to be left to individual companies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01396"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will be so kind as to study my last answer, he will realise that I have in fact said that the Government do have such a task force&#x2014;the Blow-Out Emergency Team. But, I am delighted to add my tribute to the work of Mr. Adair.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RENT ACTS: TENANT<lb/>PROTECTION</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01397">2.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01398"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01399">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01400">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps are being taken to protect tenants from being evicted from residences occupied by them for over 20 years by speculators who are exploiting loopholes in the Rent Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01401"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, DEPARTMENT of the ENVIRONMENT (Lord Bellwin)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of a loophole which would enable such longstanding tenants to be evicted from their homes. We have made it clear that we do not intend to reduce the security of existing protected tenants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01402"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not farcical that although the Rent Acts are
<col>600</col>
supposed to protect people with moderate incomes, many are living in properties which are being purchased, and the rent tribunals are not taking the slightest notice of scarcity value in assessing rents, which are being increased every time there is speculation? Does he realise that a large number of people are being deprived of their homes at present because they cannot afford the exorbitant rents which, in consequence of the speculation, are being claimed from them, with tribunals' assessments?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01403"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Rent Acts make it quite clear that, in fact, the scarcity aspect should not be taken into account when assessing the levels of rents; so there is very little that the Government can do about that, even if it were desirable to do so. As regards the noble Lord's Question, I have read with much interest his earlier Questions on the same subject over the past 18 months or so. From the extensive nature of those Questions, and indeed from the equally extensive replies that he has been given, I doubt that I could add anything to what must by now be the noble Lord's already extensive knowledge of this most complex subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01404"><member>Lord BOOTHBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it a fact that under the law as it at present stands tenants who have been occupying their residences for over 20 years cannot be evicted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01405"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. The regulations regarding eviction are now, under the Acts, such that there is the same security as has existed ever since the Rent Acts came into force. The noble Lord will probably know that in fact the first of these Acts was dated 1965, and that was followed by the 1968 Act and a series of Acts thereafter. The answer to the noble Lord's question is, Yes, that is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01406"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord think again about this matter? Does he realise that people who have lived in their homes for 20 or 30 years &#x2014;and I have in mind in particular pensioners who rely entirely upon a fixed pension&#x2014;are being driven from their homes? The result is terrifying and the Acts do not protect them. Will the noble Lord go into the matter carefully and ensure that something like the Leasehold Reform Act or a proper Rent Act
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0309"/>
<col>601</col>
is introduced in order to protect such people and ensure that scarcity value is not taken into consideration when fixing rentals?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01407"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this raises a very complex area. There can be few areas that are more complex than the Rent Acts and their workings. It would not be for me to say at this moment in time that the Government will seek yet another review of such Acts. One must, of course, sympathise with the point the noble Lord makes, but there is no evidence as such to show that with the rent allowances and the other protection which is available tenants are being evicted, as the noble Lord suggests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01408"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if an appellant to a tribunal had some reason to believe that scarcity value was not being disregarded, would he not have grounds for appeal to the High Court for a prerogative writ?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01409"><member>Lord WIGODER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, he would.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01410"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could such a person obtain legal aid for that purpose?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01411"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the aside which would seem to indicate that there is such a right. Whether or not legal aid would be available in those circumstances is something I should certainly want to look into.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01412"><member>Lord STRABOLGI</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Government do something in the leasehold sector? Bearing in mind that it was largely due to them that security of tenure was put on in the early 1970s, would they look into the leasehold sector? &#x2014;where people who have had houses on long leases, sometimes for 30 or 40 years, and who would be entitled to leasehold enfranchisement, cannot take it up because of the enormous sums, sometimes over &#x00A3;100,000, that they are being asked to pay for a new lease. That is causing great distress.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01413"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I assume that the noble Lord raised the point with the previous Administration during the last five years, no doubt at regular intervals. I can do no better than make
<col>602</col>
the point I made to the noble Lord, Lord Janner, about the whole workings of these Acts. Yes, the Government are, in fact, looking at certain aspects of the workings of the Acts and I assure the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, that the point he has made will be included in those considerations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01414"><member>Lord ROBERTHALL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that a very large number of people who would be prepared to let their houses, or part of their houses, are afraid to do so because of the restrictions of the Rent Acts? If those Acts could be modified in such a way that at least some of this property could come on to the market, it would very much reduce the speculation to which the noble Lord, Lord Janner, referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01415"><member>Lord BELLWIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware of that fact and, as has previously been declared, that is precisely why it is the Government's intention to introduce a form of shorthold lettings.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01417"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper. Perhaps I might draw attention to the fact that there are two obvious printing errors, which I am glad to say on this occasion cannot be attributed to my bad handwriting because the Question was put in typewritten form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01418">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01419">To ask Her Majesty's Government what are the statutory responsibilities of the Gaming Board and its relationship with the horsefacing industry in view of the Statement by the Under-Secretary for the Environment in the House of Commons on 29th October 1979 (<i>Hansard,</i> col. 946) that as from 1st January 1980 there will be a partnership between the Jockey Club, the Levy Board and the Gaming Board for the bennefit of the horseracing industry operating within a scheme which the Home Secretary intends to approve under Section 25 of the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0310"/>
<col>603</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01420"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Gaming Board is responsible for keeping under review the extent and character of gaming in Great Britain. The Board also has certain functions in relation to lotteries. It has no responsibility for horseracing and will not be involved in any way in the proposed Horseracing Advisory Council. My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, in referring to the proposal that this new body should be set up by 1st January 1980, inadvertently mentioned the Gaming Board, but this was an error and he has asked me to apologise to anyone who was misled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01421"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly accept the regrets of the Minister for Sport. However, is the noble Lord aware that the speech of the Home Secretary is filled with similar errors, and that on Thursday I hope to take advantage of the Third Reading of the Gaming (Amendment) Bill to draw attention to some of them? Perhaps the noble Lord will put himself in a position to make a similar retraction on the part of the Home Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01422"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry but I am only aware that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary made a perfectly splendid speech on 29th October, with every word of which I agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01423"><member>Lord DERWENT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a pity that the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, spotted the misprints, as we were all looking forward to finding out about "horsefacing"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01424"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in that case, if the noble Lord wants to find out anything about horseracing, or any other aspect of gambling, he should take no notice of the debate in another place which, for the most part, was fatuous rubbish.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>PROTECTION OF OFFICIAL<lb/>INFORMATION BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01488">3.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01489"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move the Second Reading of the Protection of Official Information Bill. The object of this Bill is to get rid of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 and to substitute a code which is more liberal, more intelligible, and even capable of enforcement. There is no intention to deal with Section 1 of the principal Act which deals with spying in the general sense of the word. Nor is there any intention to couple this Bill with the totally different and potentially more controversial question whether or to what extent we should attempt to imitate the Americans in giving the citizen a general right, legally enforceable through the courts, of access to Government files. What is beyond controversy is that such an attempt raises totally separate issues outside the scope of the present measure, and any attempt, however well intentioned, to take it on would, I think, wreck the chances of the present measure getting through this Session. At any rate, it forms no part at all of the legislation for which I now seek the approval of the House.<lb/>
Unless I am mistaken it is now nine years since a judge said, I think at the Old Bailey, that it was time that Section 2 was pensioned off, and it is more than eight years since the Franks Committee, which was set up to achieve this object, made its report. It is no criticism that successive Governments, sailing under different political colours, have failed so far to achieve this purpose. All have concurred in the proposed objective. But this is the first time that one has given birth to actual proposed legislation. The Bill, I must explain, is not mine but that of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0313"/>
<col>609</col>
my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. He asked me to introduce it into your Lordships' House because it is highly technical. I will strive to make it intelligible. But I hope the House will forgive me in any shortcomings or possibly in any inaccuracies and be patient with what must be a long and necessarily dry as dust exposition of its contents.<lb/>
The crucial question for consideration on Second Reading of the Bill is what information in the hands of the Government deserves the protection of the criminal law. I stress the word "criminal" law, because it does not affect either in one way or another the civil legal responsibilities or indeed the moral obligations of Government servants or contractors, or individual newspapers, or others. The laws of contract, the law of tort, the law affecting confidentiality, defamation, the disciplinary rules of the Civil Service, all remain unaltered by the Bill. This is not intended as a charter for people to act in a dishonourable or disloyal fashion, to give away Cabinet secrets, to break their Privy Councillor's oath, to leak unauthorised information or to spread false stories to other people's detriment. No doubt this will all go on as before, and no doubt from time to time it will give rise to civil litigation or even to criticism, but it will not as such be criminal. This is a law to limit the extent of criminal liability.<lb/>
This being so, I must make one more boring general point. Except in the deplorable field of absolute offences which we must all desire to restrict to the minimum, all criminal law consists of three main components. The first is the prohibited act, sometimes referred to in somewhat illiterate Latin as the <i>actus reus.</i> The second is the guilty state of mind, less illiterately known as <i>menus rea.</i> The third, to which I shall refer only briefly in one connection but which is contained in Clauses 8 to 11 inclusive, is the classification of offences, the mode of trial and the penalties available for infringement. But with all criminal laws, always excepting absolute offences, no offence is committed unless both of the first two elements are present and, subject to certain defined exceptions, unless both are proved beyond reasonable doubt.<lb/>
In the light of these generalities I can now begin to survey the field of battle.
<col>610</col>
After the judge suggested that Section 2 should be pensioned off, two broad schools emerged. One advocated the continuance of a sort of catch-all section protected by the Attorney General's or Director of Public Prosecution's <i>fiat.</i> The other recommended a precise definition of the prohibited act. The House will see from Clause 8 that there are two restrictions on prosecution for various of the offences. Both apply in one type of offence which requires both a ministerial certificate and a <i>fiat,</i> and in all other cases a <i>fiat</i> either from the Director of Public Prosecutions, in one class of offence, or the Attorney General in all the others is required before proceedings can be brought.<lb/>
This, however, in the view of the Government and, I hope, in the view of other people as well, is totally inadequate as a protection for the subject, except of course against private prosecutions or ill-founded or oppressive conduct by bureaucratic authority. This is where the second side of thought comes in; the subject is entitled to know with as much precision as possible what conduct he has to avoid in order not to incur liability to prosecution. It is this with which the major part of the Bill is concerned.<lb/>
Before I come to that, however, I must deal with the rather narrower concept of <i>mens rea</i> or guilty intent. This is of very great importance because even if the conduct concerned amounts to the prohibited act, a defendant is not guilty unless he also has a guilty mind. In the case of the ordinary citizen&#x2014;dealt with under Clause 4, and this, of course, includes members of the Press&#x2014;the subject must actually have known or actually had reasonable cause to believe, that the information in question was protected; and this must be proved to the maximum degree of certainty, which is that demanded by the criminal law: beyond reasonable doubt. In the case of a Crown servant or Government contractor as defined in the Bill&#x2014;the definition of each can be found in Clause 14&#x2014;the test is different. Before he can commit an offence at all, he must have dealt with protected information contrary to his official duty or an equivalent in the case of a contractor, dealt with under Clause 2. That is part of the prohibited act. But if he does deal with protected information contrary to his official duty, it will be for him to show that he did not believe and had
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0314"/>
<col>611</col>
no reasonable cause to believe that he was dealing with protected material. In that case, however, that standard will be proof on the balance of probabilities and not beyond reasonable doubt.<lb/>
I now come to what may turn out to be the real meat of the question. The Franks Report did not have a draft Bill attached to it, but it did have recommendations. Everything that has taken place since Franks has used Franks as a starting point, and this Bill is no exception. But there have been a number of successive attempts by successive Governments to define or classify what is meant by protected material. None has been absolutely identical with Franks, nor has any been exactly identical with any of the others. Again, this Bill is no exception. I do not believe there is any party politics in this&#x2014;at least there ought not to be.<lb/>
What is in the Bill is the product of continuing discussion in public and private. We have made use of the speech of my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley in another place on 29th June 1973; we have made use of the White Paper of the last Government (Cmnd. 7285) published in July 1978; we have also profited from the experience gained by discussion of Mr. Clement Freud's Private Member's Bill ; and we have made use of continuing discussions both inside and outside the Government. What we have produced is the best we can think of, and we now present it to Parliament. The Franks Report (para. 14) condemned the existing law in the following terms:
<quote>"The present law, contained in section 2, is notable for its extreme width and for the considerable uncertainty attaching to its interpretation and enforcement. It does not carry public confidence. We propose its replacement by provisions reduced in scope and less uncertain in operation".</quote>
This exactly expresses our own intention in this Bill. The Franks Committee recommended confining the protected material to a few specific areas, and this is what we have done. Clause 1(1) deals with protected information. Clause 1(2) deals with articles; that is articles in the sense of physical objects and not articles in the Press.<lb/>
The Franks Committee chose as its criteria information the disclosure of which would cause serious injury to the interest of the nation. It identified information in the fields of defence and internal
<col>612</col>
security, foreign relations, currency and the reserves, Cabinet papers, certain information relating to the maintenance of law and order, and private confidences. In some respects we have been more liberal than the Franks Report. Like the previous Government; for instance, in their White Paper, we have not protected Cabinet papers as such, and we have not protected currency or the reserves as such.<lb/>
There are however features in which we differ, not so much from the Franks definitions or objectives as the methods by which we seek to achieve them. We all recognise, for instance, that defence and intelligence should be protected. Franks, however, thought that this field should be confined to the most sensitive information only. The Bill recognises&#x2014;and I think the last Government did&#x2014;that intelligence often consists in the gradual accumulation of small items of information, each apparently trivial in itself. As an ex-intelligence officer, I am sure that this is right, and I hope that the House will agree with it. For one phrase we are indebted to Mr. Clement Freud. He protected information, the disclosure of which would endanger the safety of a British subject (as I still prefer to call it, although now, I fear, inaccurately). This is what we agree with, and it will be seen embodied in Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>).<lb/>
There is also a difference from Franks&#x2014;in my judgment also an improvement&#x2014;in the question of the formal classification of documents; for instance, when a document is classified secret, confidential, restricted, and so on. This has its manifest advantages, but it is an over-simplification and in our view leaves too much to the Government official who does the classifying. We have concentrated instead in Clause (1) in identification of the substance of the information, rather than its technical classification marked on the top of the document. But in Clause 12 we have dealt with classification. Its effect under Clause 12 is not conclusive. It simply puts the recipient of a document on notice of its probable character. In other words, it goes to guilty intent, rather than the prohibited act.<lb/>
On the question of "serious injury", however, we have made the ministerial certificate conclusive. There are, we believe, cogent reasons for this, and we
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0315"/>
<col>613</col>
agree with the Franks Report that it is a Government function, the test being political and subject to control by Parliament, rather than justiciable and subject to control by the judges; but even more so, because if we left it to the judges, it would, if they were to do their duty, be necessary to pass on semi-publicly a great deal more secret information, potentially, if not actually, damaging in order to substantiate our point. As noble Lords will see from Clause 8(1), however, this is limited to cases under Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>).<lb/>
I do not think that I need say much more about Clause 1(1)(<i>b</i>). Clause 1(1)(<i>c</i>) relates to the criminal law and prison security. It follows the Franks Report, and so far there has been little public dispute about it. I should perhaps have mentioned already, but it is particularly valuable here, that Clause 7&#x2014;not only for Clause 1(1)(<i>c</i>), but for Clause 1(1)(<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) as well&#x2014;provides the individual with a useful defence. Notwithstanding that the information is protected, no offence is committed if the defendant shows that it was in any case available to the public. This, I hope, deals at least in part with a point attributed, I do not know whether justly or unjustly, in today's <i>Guardian,</i> to the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder. Clause 1(1)(<i>d</i>) deals with intercepts, and I do not intend to elaborate on this. It is essential to any intelligence system to protect this class of information and article.<lb/>
When I come to Clause 1(1)(<i>e</i>) and 1(1)(<i>f</i>) I enter a different area of policy. There are confidences reposed in Her Majesty's Government in the foreign field by other Governments in confidence. These we consider should be protected by the criminal law. Our credibility as a repository of confidential information would obviously be undermined if it were not so. Paragraph (<i>f</i>) is wider than envisaged by the Franks Report, but in our estimation rightly so. Individuals are on occasion compelled by law and under a moral obligation to confide their uttermost secrets to the Government in confidence, and of course these are other occasions on which the Government acquire such secrets. In such cases the Government hold the information as a trust, and we think that it should be protected. So far the Franks Report agreed. Subsequent criticism, including
<col>614</col>
that by my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley, in the speech to which I have referred, pointed out that this was technically too narrow. Not only individuals, but trading concerns, have secrets that they have to impart to Her Majesty's Government. These ought equally to be protected, and we see no reason why the public sector trading concerns should be in any worse position.<lb/>
I do not think I need deal separately with Clause 2 which deals in general with "articles". The categories protected follow broadly the lines of Clause 1, which deals with information. The definition of "official information" is information (or for that matter an article) held by a Crown servant or Government contractor by virtue of his position as such. Both Crown servants and Government contractors are defined in Clause 14.<lb/>
Clauses 2, 3 and 4 define the offences committed by wrongful disclosure, differentiating on the lines that I have described between Crown servants and Government contractors, on the one hand, and the ordinary individual subject, on the other. Clause 5 broadly follows the Franks Report in defining the case where officials and Government contractors fail to safeguard documents or articles. Clause 6 creates a separate offence on the lines outlined in the previous Government's White Paper protecting information. Noble Lords will note the special defence accorded to persons charged under Clause 6 by Clause 7(2).<lb/>
Clause 7 therefore contains two separate and valuable defences, one fairly generally available on the lines I have indicated, and one applicable only to offences under Clause 6. I have already dealt with Clauses 8 and 12. Clauses 9, 10, 11, and 13 are technical and ancillary. Clause 14 is the definition clause, and Clause 15 applies the Bill to actions done abroad, or in the Channel Isles, or Isle of Man, or any colony, and generally to Northern Ireland. Clause 16 is the usual clause dealing with Short Title amendments and repeals, which are set out at length in the schedule. Clause 16(4) brings the Bill into operation by Statutory Instrument of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
I think that I have left out one point that I should mention to the House.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0316"/>
<col>615</col>
The provisions in the Bill requiring the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions do not of course apply to Scotland, although they apply to Northern Ireland. The reason for this is that all prosecutions in Scotland are under the aegis of the Lord Advocate, and therefore it is not usual in Scotland, I understand&#x2014;my Scottish friends will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;to include such an express provision.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01490"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble and learned Lord has completed his explanation of the clauses, I wonder whether I may ask a question about Clause 1(1)(<i>c</i>), relating to information likely to be useful in the commission of offences. If in future a journalist discloses instructions which have been given by Government departments to civil servants&#x2014;for example, the social security A code or instructions to immigration officers&#x2014;which have been kept under wraps because the Government say that the disclosure of the information in them would be useful to fraudulent social security claimants, or to persons trying to evade the immigration law, would the journalist publishing that information be committing an offence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01491"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that instant law is almost always bad law, but the answer would be certainly not, unless he knew that what he was doing was likely to come under the relevant clause, because that would be caught by the absence of <i>mens rea.</i> However, I shall ask my noble friend Lord Belstead, who is to reply to the debate, to take special note of what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has asked me, and give, not instant law, which I hesitate to do, but a considered reply coming from a reputable source.<lb/>
My Lords, I noticed one rather violent leading article in one of the Sunday newspapers yesterday about the Bill. It proceeded by asking a number of rhetorical questions, preceded by the phrase, "What would happen if &#x2026;?" Since the questions themselves were framed without reference to the criteria of the Bill, they are not capable in themselves of precise answer. Perhaps that is why they were framed in that way. But the short
<col>616</col>
answer is that nothing which is legal now is rendered illegal by the Bill, and a great deal which is illegal now is put outside the criminal law by the Bill. On the other hand, if the Bill is passed through the House in its present form there is nothing which remains against the criminal law which is not protected by safeguards, such as the special defences under Sections 2 and 7, the requirement of strict proof of knowledge in other cases, the <i>fiat</i> of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General, and, where the ministerial certificate is required, the ministerial certificate, which can be challenged in Parliament. I have referred to all of these in the course of my remarks.<lb/>
The only question we have to settle today is whether to give the Bill a Second Reading. In answer to that question&#x2014;which is, after all, a simple one&#x2014;I would ask the House to take the following view. Are we to leave on the Statute Book a section which is really manifestly intolerable because it is unjust and anachronistic; and, if tolerable at all, is tolerable only because it is unenforceable and unenforced, and therefore brings the law into disrepute? Or are we to give a Second Reading to a Bill which is the fruit of discussion, public and private, in Government circles and outside them over nine years; which corresponds broadly to, and in some ways is more liberal than, the report of the Franks Committee; and which, where it does not correspond with that report, almost always corresponds with the last Government's White Paper? I would suggest that there could be only one answer to this question this afternoon, and that a negative reply would simply be a form of legislative Luddism. Other points can surely be left, either to discussion this afternoon or to the Committee and Report stages. My last appeal to the House is not to allow imagined perfectionism, either now or hereafter, to become the enemy of the good ; and in that spirit, and subject to criticisms which may be made either now or at a later opportunity, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<col>617</col>
technical, and that became manifest from his own speech, which endeavoured to clarify the technicality; and we are very grateful to him for doing so. But I think it is very important that the technicalities of the Bill should not obscure the fact that it concerns a vital aspect of our democracy. Indeed, it touches its very heart. It is the balance that has to be sought and, if possible, achieved between, on the one hand, enabling people to be adequately informed about the working of government, so that they can make informed use of their rights as citizens and electors, and have a voice in determining their own fate; and, on the other hand, enabling the Government of the day to preserve secrecy where, in the national interest, it is necessary to keep some information secret. It is not an easy balance to strike.<lb/>
Of course, totalitarian Governments maintain secrecy, although brave individuals sometimes break through the veil. The dictators pronounce their decisions and force them on their subjects. But a democracy like ours relies on the trust of the people, on a broad consensus between Government and governed. If that consensus were to break down, we should be in deep trouble. But all democratic Governments have found it necessary to keep some information secret. The question is: How should that secrecy be maintained, and in what aspects of government should secrecy necessarily be protected?&#x2014;and I have emphasised the word "necessarily".<lb/>
Since 1889 we have used the criminal law as one important means of preserving essential secrecy; and so, indeed, have most Western countries. With us, as the noble and learned Lord has pointed out, the main criminal sanctions are to be found in Sections 1 and 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. Section 1 deals with disclosure for a purpose prejudicial to the safety and interests of the State&#x2014;the spy cases. This Bill does not touch that. Section 2, with which we are concerned, covers the unauthorised disclosure of protected information, irrespective of the discloser's purpose. It catches people who may indeed have no thought of harming their country. I agree with the view, which is inherent in the bringing forward of this separate Bill to deal with Section 2, that those provisions should
<col>618</col>
not appear side by side with the spy sections, the rest of the Official Secrets Act.<lb/>
It is now common ground that the catch-all effect of Section 2 is no longer right, if indeed it ever was. The curious thing is that Clause 2 was not discussed at all in the parliamentary debates of 1911, and the Bill passed through the House of Commons on one August afternoon with very little discussion. If I may say so, one knows what goes on in another place on an August afternoon! The first parliamentary attack on Section 2 indeed came 28 years later, in 1939, when the Bill of that year was considered. On that occasion, the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, the father of my noble friend, criticised Section 2 in this House as,
<quote>"capable of indefinite expansion to cover &#x2026; all manner of communications and information which may have been received from any one who holds or has held office under His Majesty".&#x2014; [<i>Official Report,</i> 7/3/39; col. 31.]</quote>
It is therefore perhaps fitting that this Bill should be discussed today in the presence of my noble friend the son of Lord Strabolgi who made that early protest so long ago.<lb/>
My Lords, the purpose of this Bill, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has indicated, is to repeal Section 2. Some have taken the view that that is all that ought to have been done. The Government do not take that view; nor do I. But whether what the Government propose in this Bill to take the place of Section 2 is acceptable is another question, which we shall have to consider. It restricts criminal sanctions for unauthorised disclosure or communication, as the Lord Chancellor has pointed out, to a specified and identified range of information. The catch-all provision has gone; but the question we have to face is whether or not the Bill as it stands may still catch too much, may still unduly restrict information and withhold it from the public. Will the Bill harmfully impede the Press (as it seems to think), the media and others who supply the lifeblood of public information and knowledge? These are questions which we shall no doubt consider with care as the Bill goes through the House. It would indeed he deplorable if, in giving precision to the categories to be protected, there were produced the harder, harsher certainty of new, specific provisions, instead of the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0318"/>
<col>619</col>
old generality. It would be regrettable if new presbyter were but old priest writ large.<lb/>
The previous Labour Administration considered this issue and these questions at length, and their ideas, as the noble and learned Lord has pointed out, were set out in the White Paper of July 1978 and then, in March of this year, in a Green Paper entitled <i>Open Government.</i> In the Green Paper one sees the following:
<quote>"The Government recognises that the ' catchall ' effect of Section 2 is no longer right and intends that it should be replaced by provisions which would restrict criminal sanctions for unauthorised disclosure or communication to a strictly limited range of information. This reform will not of itself increase the flow of information from Government, since the criminal law is concerned only with what should not be disclosed, and open government is concerned with what should be disclosed. And matters whose unauthorised disclosure would attract criminal sanctions would be among matters exempted from disclosure under any open government system. But the Government sees reform of Section 2 as an essential step in creating a climate in which greater openness can prevail".</quote>
The White Paper proposals were, as the noble and learned Lord has said, based on the recommendations of the Franks Committee. That was a distinguished committee under distinguished chairmanship and membership&#x2014;Members of Parliament, lawyers, former civil servants and strong representation from Fleet Street and broadcasting. The report was unanimous and, so far as I can recollect, was well received in 1972 in Fleet Street as elsewhere.<lb/>
The White Paper proposals that I have referred to now (and as the passage I have quoted indicated) admitted that reform of Section 2 would not of itself increase the flow of information from the Government. But, as I have read, we did see reform as an essential step, a precursor to greater openness in government. That reform was to be linked with provisions for greater public access to official documents; and the relevant portion of the Green Paper makes that clear. It explains the major argument for a public right of access; namely, that those seeking information have the right to obtain what they want, when they want it, subject to clear exceptions, rather than having to wait on Government initiative or discretion to release material. And the broad approach
<col>620</col>
to the matter which was to be undertaken by the Government in legislation is set out in paragraph 59 of the Green Paper:
<quote>"In the Government's view the essential requirements of any scheme of access to official information is that it should satisfy public demand so far as is reasonable and practicable; that it should be fully compatible with constitutional and Parliamentary systems of this country; and that the costs should be commensurate with the public benefit".</quote>
Then, in the Labour Manifesto of 1979, an undertaking was given that the Government would:
<quote>"Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill to provide a system of open government, and enact the proposals made by the Government in its White Paper to reform Section Two &#x2026;".</quote>
The noble and learned Lord has not lifted the veil in any respect on what the Government contemplate by way of follow-up to the limited purposes of the present Bill. He has said&#x2014;and no doubt it may well be the case&#x2014;that to attach to this Bill wider provisions on freedom of information would be time-consuming. But I think that we on this side of the House would be grateful if that "reputable source", as he has been so engagingly described the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, would lift the veil and tell us what ideas the Government have in mind in this field because we deem it to be quite crucial. Merely at this stage to deal with Section 2 without coping with and providing for the clamant demand from the public for greater access to official information will not do. I look forward with enthusiasm to hearing him at the conclusion of this debate unveil what the Government have in mind.<lb/>
Coming to Section 2 of the Act itself, the noble and learned Lord has read some appropriate passages from the report. It said for instance:
<quote>"We found section 2 a mess. Its scope is enormously wide. Any law which impinges on the freedom of information in a democracy should be much more tightly drawn".</quote>
And it adds:
<quote>"A catch-all provision is saved from absurdity in operation only by the sparing exercise of the Attorney General's discretion to prosecute".</quote>
My Lords, in my six years in office as Attorney General there were only nine such prosecutions. Indeed, some serious commentators&#x2014;and I think that one of my successors, a Conservative Attorney General, expressed this view &#x2014;have said that because of the great
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0319"/>
<col>621</col>
difficulties in the way of identifying and defining with certainty those kinds of official information which should be covered, it would be preferable, on balance, to retain a catch-all section, together with the Attorney General's control over prosecution, as the lesser of two evils. I am bound to admit that one of the prosecutions which I authorised brought me into very bad trouble; but perhaps it is not desirable to retraverse that particular ground, although if it is traversed I should be happy to deal with it.<lb/>
That is one view that was taken. But the Franks Report found that the very width of the Attorney General's discretion and the inevitably selective way in which it is exercised&#x2014;that is the way the report put it&#x2014;gives rise to considerable unease.<lb/>
I have referred to the tension between openness and secrecy and I think that the House will be disposed to agree with the conclusion of Franks that the catch-all provision clearly goes too far towards the protection of secrecy. But to repeal it without replacement would work the opposite way, as I have said. The proper balance between openness and secrecy, I believe, requires a reformed law. The question that we face in considering this Bill is this. Do its provisions achieve that balance satisfactorily? The almost universal reaction of the Press has been an emphatic "No" to that question. The Bill has had a bad Press without exception, I believe, on both Right and Left of the political spectrum. It has been called a threat to freedom. There have been great headlines:
<quote>"How they plan to keep us in the dark"</quote>
and others such.<lb/>
Of course, a misunderstanding, even outright conflict, between Press and Government and, indeed, even between Parliament and Government, has arisen before from time to time and may not necessarily be bad. But the relationships between these great institutions in our democracy are very delicate and should not be damaged. The balance between them is not capable of legalistic refinement but I believe that mutual trust between Government, the Press and the media is something for which each side should strive. I think that a considerable responsibility now lies on this House&#x2014;a responsibility which it is well able to
<col>622</col>
undertake&#x2014;to examine carefully how justified are the fears of the Press and responsible bodies of opinion about the provisions of the Bill, and this we shall do during the various stages of the Bill.<lb/>
It may be fitting within the time which is available to me if I indicate at this stage some of the main areas, as I see it, of legitimate concern. Clause 1 as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has explained, describes the information to which the Act applies, the protected information, disclosure of which attracts the criminal sanctions which are set out in the Bill. It falls, as the noble and learned Lord has told us, and as noble Lords will see from the Bill, into six categories. Category (<i>a</i>) is the first and refers to information relating to defence or international relations, the unauthorised disclosure of which would be likely to cause serious injury to the interests of the nation or endanger the safety of a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies. Your Lordships will see the test of that matter is the likelihood to cause serious injury to the interests of the nation or endanger the safety of its citizens. But that test is conclusively decided not by evidence to that effect to be given in court, but simply by ministerial certification under the provisions of Clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill.<lb/>
Clause 8 provides:
<quote>"A prosecution for an offence under this Act in respect of information to which section 1(1)(<i>a</i>) above or an article to which section 1(2)(<i>a</i>) above applies shall not be instituted unless it has been certified by a Minister of the Crown that at the time of the alleged offence unauthorised disclosure of the information or article would have been likely to cause serious injury to the interests of the nation"&#x2014;</quote>
<i>et cetera.</i> Clause 9 provides:
<quote>"On a prosecution relating to any information or article, a certificate under section 8(1) above that, at the time of the alleged offence, unauthorised disclosure of the information or article would have been likely to cause serious injury to the interests of the nation or endanger the safety of a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, or both, shall be conclusive evidence of that fact".</quote>
So the main issue in a trial in a certain sense is decided before the trial begins by the Minister's certificate.<lb/>
The second category, (<i>b</i>), is information relating to security or intelligence. That is a broad category. I do not think that it is expressly provided for in that way in Franks, and it is provided for separately
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0320"/>
<col>623</col>
from defence and international relations. It is subject in Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>) to no statutory test either as to seriousness or damage, and it would seem that any information about security and intelligence is protected whether or not it is already common knowledge.<lb/>
A defence in respect of disclosure of information in Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>d</i>)&#x2014;that is to say, defence, security or intelligence and interceptions&#x2014;that before the time of the alleged offence the information had been available or had become available on request to the public or a section of the public, is apparently excluded for those categories of information. The other categories, (<i>c</i>), (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) are also covered.<lb/>
The provisions of Clause 7 are an important part of the Bill. It reads as follows:
<quote>"It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under section 2, 3, 4 or 5 above in relation to information specified in section 1(1)(<i>c</i>), (<i>e</i>) or (<i>f</i>)"&#x2014;</quote>
not, as your Lordships' will see, (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>d</i>)&#x2014;
<quote>"to prove that before the time of the alleged offence the information had been made available, or had become available on request, to the public or a section of the public".</quote>
We shall want to examine carefully why that defence should be excluded from those in many respects graver aspects of the information provisions. Clause 7 itself is far from clear even to the categories to which it refers. It refers to "made available One wonders: made available by whom? Made available where? Does it cover Press publications, Press information, or does it only cover information officially made available within the United Kingdom? Perhaps the noble Lord at some convenient time &#x2014;not necessarily today&#x2014;will enlighten the House about those matters.<lb/>
An important departure from Franks has been made in respect of the three important categories of defence, international relations, security and intelligence information. The Franks report proposed that appropriate classification should be the test of serious injury. I quote:
<quote>"The prosecution should have to satisfy the court that the information fell within a category and that it was so classified, but the court should not be concerned with the effect of the disclosure on the interests of the nation".</quote>
<col>624</col>
But the classification was the basis and the key to the identification of what ought to be protected.<lb/>
However, so far as I can understand in this Bill in relation to the categories (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>d</i>) that are found in Clause 1 protection is quite separate and divorced from classification, and classification is no more than an indication of serious injury and not necessary for the protection of the information. It would seem that a Minister could give a certificate for prosecution under Clauses 8 and 9 for the disclosure of information regarding defence, <i>et cetera,</i> which was not originally classified.<lb/>
If that is so&#x2014;and I believe it to be so from the language of the Bill&#x2014;it would seem to undermine the approach of Franks, which was to create certainty as to what was covered by the process of classification to enable a civil servant, a journalist or a member of the public to know where he is in regard to these documents. Provision for classification of documents is made in Clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill. The system of classification is to be the overall responsibility of the Minister for the Civil Service, the Prime Minister&#x2014;a small addition to her already enormously onerous duties.<lb/>
The actual classification is to be done by what is described as the responsible authority. That means, according to Clause 12, any person designated as a responsible authority by a person prescribed in the regulations the Minister for the Civil Service may make. We are not told who that person would be and I would ask whether the responsible authorities must necessarily be within Government Departments proper or whether public corporations or Government contractors have classification powers. If that were so, it would mean there would be no control over the classification function either by Parliament or by the courts.<lb/>
As to Clause 1(<i>e</i>) and 1(<i>f</i>), neither the Franks Report nor the White Paper proposed a category of official matter obtained from foreign governments or international governmental organisations or bodies carrying on nationalised industries. At the proper time we will examine the reasons which the Government may give for the inclusion of those categories.<lb/>
I should have mentioned in the earlier context that, in regard to certification,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0321"/>
<col>625</col>
I think I am right in saying it was proposed that it was not only the Minister who should be involved in examining the appropriateness of the conclusive certificate but that the Attorney-General should also be involved. I also recollect that in the discussion of the Freedom of Information Bill in the House of Commons it was proposed by the then Conservative Front-Bench spokesman that a security commission should be involved in the crucial process of certification.<lb/>
My Lords, I have taken already more time than I should have done, but these are important considerations. It is a crucially important Bill. I am bound to say we think that before it passes on its way to another place it ought to undergo considerable improvements if the protection of the individual, of the Press and of the public is to be adequately looked after.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01495">4.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01496"><member>Lord WIGODER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friends on these Benches will also want to express gratitude to the noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack for the careful way in which he explained the terms of this Bill to your Lordships' House. It appears only fitting that, after the barrage of criticism this Bill has received since its publication a fortnight ago, there should at last have been one voice raised in its favour.<lb/>
Of course, this Bill makes no attempt to deal with Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act. It is perhaps a pity that the opportunity has not been taken to amend some of the more objectionable provisions of that section. This Bill deals solely with Section 2. I think that the first observation it is perhaps worth making is this: so far as I know&#x2014;and if I am wrong on the facts I will be corrected&#x2014;during the last five years of the Labour Government one person was prosecuted under Section 2 of the Act and three people, who happened to have algebraical surnames which will be familiar to your Lordships, were prosecuted under both Sections 1 and 2. That was the only use made of Section 2 of the Act throughout the last five years.<lb/>
The reasons were two-fold. First, as has been pointed out by the noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack, Section 2 was discredited as being a
<col>626</col>
catch-all section under which it was an offence for the Press to publish, for example, details of the time at which the head of MI5 had his morning cup of coffee. There was no defence if that information was given in the Press; and when the Act clearly became so broadly based as that, it lost a great deal of its point and of its credibility.<lb/>
Secondly, there was a further difficulty, which was that the construction of Section 2 became of considerable doubt. It became of doubt in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> case, where the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, and I had the pleasure of "slugging it out" side by side as to what was the proper construction of that section. It became clear that, so far as the receivers of information and the subsequent transmitters of that information were concerned, the law was in a state of considerable doubt. In the result, for those two reasons, Section 2 fell into disrepute and into disuse for those five years.<lb/>
The first observation I really want to make is this: the country survived. Scandals were exposed, investigative journalism took place, Governments were embarrassed&#x2014;and quite right too: that is what Governments are for&#x2014;and all that happened without the fabric of our society in any way collapsing. Indeed, this perhaps gives weight to the contention put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, in an earlier debate on this topic, when he suggested that perhaps the simplest course in relation to Section 2 of the Act was to repeal it altogether and to leave it. That course is not being taken. The course that is being taken is that a reform of the Act should be effected in the way set out in this Bill. It must, therefore, be made as clear as can be that the inevitable effect of this reform, however liberal it may be, will be that once the law in Section 2 is clarified there are going to be more and not less prosecutions for the type of offence which is covered by this section. There are going to be not merely more, but a great many more, prosecutions of civil servants and of the Press, however liberal the Government may proclaim their intentions to be.<lb/>
It was for that reason that we on these Benches always made it clear when the White Paper of the previous Government, which is largely responsible for this Bill,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0322"/>
<col>627</col>
was being debated in your Lordships' House, that we could summon up no enthusiasm for reforms of this nature unless they were coupled with a commitment to more open government and freedom of information, so that the inevitably repressive effect that this legislation is bound to have could at least be counter-balanced by helping to ensure that we would have in this country a society of citizens who would be encouraged to participate in the formation of policy, because they had in their possession sensible and well-informed documentation and could take part in meaningful discussions about it. We note to our great regret that the Government have decided not to couple what we regard as an essential combination, namely, the reform of Section 2 and a move towards freedom of information.<lb/>
I should like, if I may, to second the call of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and to ask the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, when he replies to indicate whether, in the Conservative Government's oft-stated commitment to freedom, they include freedom of information. If they do, I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, whether he will be good enough to state precisely what steps the Government are taking in order to bring about that situation.<lb/>
This Bill, as I have said, ostensibly relaxes the existing controls, although it will inevitably have the effect of causing more prosecutions. It endeavours to do that by covering not the whole of official information but only the six categories set out in Clause 1 of this Bill. I would, if I may respectfully do so, applaud the Government for not including categories such as Cabinet papers <i>per se</i> or budgetary and monetary information, which might perhaps have been included. Nevertheless, although this Bill restricts the categories of information to the six set out in Clause 1, it does so in what I believe on examination turns out to be a most disturbingly repressive manner. I do not want to make Committee points at this stage, but I must give some indications of what I mean by that observation in order to justify it.<lb/>
It is clear under Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>), combined of course with Clause 4, that both civil servants and journalists, and indeed
<col>628</col>
private citizens, are at risk of prosecution on the mere say so of the Minister. If the House, that we could summon up no Minister certifies that information related to defence or international relations would be likely to cause serious injury by the unauthorised disclosure of it, then that is that and the civil servant, the journalist and the citizen has, for practical purposes no defence whatsoever. He cannot challenge the Minister's certificate. It is not even a defence to be able to show that the Minister's certificate is absurd.
If a journalist publishes an item about our defence in a newspaper, and the Minister chooses to certify in accordance with Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>), it would be no defence for that journalist to demonstrate that he lifted the whole of the article from the <i>Herald Tribune</i> of the previous week, because, ludicrous though it may sound, Clause 7 which deals with that issue does not provide any defence under Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>) or 1(1)(<i>b</i>) to the effect that the information is already commonly known. Although this may sound a slightly fanciful issue or a fanciful defence it is not really, because both in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> case and in the ABC case precisely that issue was raised.<lb/>
Furthermore,&#x2014;and I agree again with the noble Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones&#x2014;if the object of this legislation is, as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said, that a person, such as a journalist, should know with precision the risks he was running, how can that be said of a situation in which the Minister is entitled to certify under Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>) information which has never been classified under Clause 12, or, conversely entitled to say of information which has been classified under Clause 12, "I do not regard this as information coming within Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>)"?<lb/>
So far as Clause 1(1)(<i>b</i>) is concerned&#x2014;that is, information relating to security or intelligence&#x2014;the situation is, if anything, worse. There is not even the safeguard, for what it is worth, that the Minister has to certify that the disclosure might cause serious injury. It is any information relating to security or intelligence, and "security or intelligence" is defined in Clause 14 in the widest possible way. It follows that if a journalist publishes any matter at all which he knows relates to security or intelligence, he must be guilty of an offence, even if he publishes the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0323"/>
<col>629</col>
time at which the head of MI5 has his morning coffee. That would be clearly covered by this legislation. That is the advance which the Government claim is being made in the course of their clarification and their relaxation of the existing law.<lb/>
So far as Clause 1(1)(<i>c</i>) is concerned, which includes information that would be likely to impede the apprehension of suspected offenders, I am again perturbed that that might be used against journalists who were carrying out perfectly genuine, serious responsible investigative work into the commission of possible criminal offences. Much of value has been done by journalists in recent years and I can see that clause being used, if a Government chose to, against them.<lb/>
Clause 1(1)(<i>d</i>) deserves just a look in passing. That includes not only,
<quote>"information obtained by reason of the interception of postal packets or telecommunication conversations"</quote>
but also,
<quote>"information relating to the obtaining of information by reason of any such interception".</quote>
As I understand that paragraph&#x2014;and I do not want to put forward too many hypothetical cases and to ask the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, to deal with them when he comes to reply&#x2014;if my telephone is being tapped because I am such a dangerous radical, and I disclose to the Press that my telephone is being tapped, then I am committing an offence under this Bill because I am giving information that is relating to the obtaining of information. There we are.<lb/>
I would add only one other comment about one of these six categories, and that is the one relating to Clause 1(1)(<i>f</i>) which is information obtained from any persons mentioned in subsection (4), held by a Crown servant or Government contractor on terms or in circumstances requiring it to be held in confidence. Again, as I read that paragraph combined with subsection (4), and also combined with Clause 4, the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper would have clearly committed a criminal offence when it recently disclosed the communication on jury vetting that had come into its possession; and I believe that that newspaper performed an invaluable service in so doing. I raise these matters simply as an indication that this legislation is a great deal more
<col>630</col>
repressive than was perhaps thought when this Bill was first put forward.<lb/>
I add only two other observations about this Bill at this stage, and about certain clauses of it. Clause 2(2)(<i>a</i>) places the onus of proof on the defence. That of course happens from time to time in the 1911 Official Secrets Act and is not, in itself, entirely surprising. But it places a burden of proof on a defendant to show not simply that he did not believe that the information was information to which the Act applied, but also that he had no reasonable cause to believe it. I believe that that is putting on a defendant a very high burden of a rather unusual nature.<lb/>
Finally, as to the specific clauses of this Bill, may I mention Clause 12, which deals with classification, "Where in the opinion of the responsible authority &#x2026;"Who is the responsible authority is completely unclear. So far as I can see from this Bill, it can be somebody so junior as to be in no way responsible and to have no authority. But if he is designated a responsible authority by the Minister, he has the duty and the burden of declaring what information or documents would be likely to cause serious injury if disclosed. I suggest that that, again, is an impossible burden to put on a civil servant. It would inevitably lead to the classification of far more documents than if it were done by somebody in a position of real authority, and even, dare I say it, of responsibility to Parliament. Surely the responsibility for the classifying of documents, where these consequences may follow, must be that of the Minister. There must be some review process by which the Minister's decision can be considered, and I hasten to say that I do not read the words in Clause 13(2)(<i>c</i>) as providing for any such review process.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships will not think that those are simply Committee points that I raise in looking broadly at the terms of this Bill. Inevitably, they lead me to have serious reservations about it. I say at once that I give the Government the benefit of the doubt. I always give Governments the benefit of the doubt, although experience repeatedly proves me wrong. But I do give them the benefit of the doubt of assuming that they set out on this exercise with a genuine desire to tidy up and to liberalise the law. I
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0324"/>
<col>631</col>
doubt whether they realised the repressive consequences that will flow from the way in which this Bill is drafted.<lb/>
In making these observations I am, of course, very much aware that there will come into being, in the course of the next few months, a bandwagon of opposition to this Bill, upon which many people will leap who have no concern whatever for the security of this country or for the defence of the realm. I hope that those of us who wish to put forward constructive suggestions for the improvement of this Bill will not be tarred with that brush.<lb/>
I hope it will be accepted that there are many of us who recognise that the problem posed by the Bill is one of balance. It is a problem of trying to reconcile the measures that should be taken to protect the safety of the nation and our security with the vital necessity of having a free Press and with the right of ordinary citizens to know as much as possible of what is going on in the quarters of Government. I have to suggest that this balance is not right in the Bill as it is now drafted. I am encouraged by the concluding words of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack: that his mind is by no means closed on this matter and that when we come to a later stage of the Bill he will be willing and anxious, on behalf of the Government, to listen to all constructive suggestions that can be put to improve the Bill and eventually to get the balance right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01497">4.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01498"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for introducing this Bill and for his explanation of its purposes. I agree with my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor that we need to replace Section 2 of the 1911 Act. I propose to make some brief comments and to put two questions to the Government. In doing this, I am very conscious that I am following in the debate three leading lawyers and three of the most brilliant legal minds in the land. I shall accordingly concentrate strictly on the administrative side of this question. On prosecutions, though, my noble and learned friend invited someone with experience of Scottish administration to confirm the
<col>632</col>
position in Scotland. If I may do so modestly, so far as I know the position still is that prosecutions in Scotland are initiated only by the Lord Advocate and pursued through the procurator fiscal service. The authority of the Director of Public Prosecutions does not extend North of the Border.<lb/>
I should like to add some views on what I feel are the undesirable effects of Section 2 as it has existed since 1911. Section 2, in its envelopment of virtually every matter dealt with within departments unless and until officially made public, was the lazy way of protecting secret information. I can understand the frustration of the Press and broadcasting organisations about it. It is ridiculous in its precise technical effect. For example, it could envelop disclosure of the method by which morning tea"elevenses"&#x2014;is dispensed in a department. More seriously, it could envelop the disclosure of consideration of whether British Summer-Time should be chanced to British Standard Time, a matter of concern to the population at large and one that was decided nine years ago by a free vote in another place. I mention that example because I think it may strike a chord with my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, as he had been Shadow Home Secretary and I had been Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland concerned with home affairs in Scotland, dealing together with that subject.<lb/>
Section 2 has been suffocating in its totally enveloping effect. It has been described as an omnibus provision. It has also been described as a blunderbuss. It has been more. I would describe it as a sawn-off punt gun, scattering shot with a spread far wider than required, peppering not only all feathered life but also every inoffensive object in its wide are&#x2014;harmless bees and butterflies, for example &#x2014;and being quite indiscriminate in its impact.<lb/>
I hope that the House will allow me to draw upon some administrative experience from the past. I signed the Official Secrets Act as an official, a professional diplomatist. In addition, during that period, in the mid-1950s, I was assigned for two years from the Foreign Office to be Private Secretary to the Secretary to the Cabinet, then Sir Norman Brook, later Lord Normanbrook. For a short
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0325"/>
<col>633</col>
period I worked also for Sir Edward Bridges, as he then was. For both, who later joined your Lordships' House, I have the greatest admiration and I do not presume to reflect in any way their views. This was a long time ago but it enabled me to have a worm's eye view of the Whitehall system and the papers involved.<lb/>
During that work, and in the Diplomatic Service, as it is now again called, I felt that the whole method of protecting papers on confidential matters was unsatisfactory. It attempted complete prohibition on disclosure and yet leaks of confidential information from time to time occurred. I have no doubt that embarrassing disclosures will continue to be made from time to time. They may be embarrassing to individuals, to the Government of the day or to the Opposition, but what is really important, what surely matters most, is that they should not endanger the safety of the country or of individuals, or undermine the system of Government. It is on that second point that I wish to put my questions.<lb/>
First let me deal with the position of civil servants, on the collective responsibility of the Cabinet and the advice given to Ministers. This also applies to members of the Armed Forces, particularly when they are serving in the Ministry of Defence. I know that the principle of collective responsibility of the Cabinet has been said to have been somewhat eroded of late&#x2014;indeed, some would say dented. There can be cases where the Minister responsible for a particular subject is in a minority in the Cabinet. The majority decision is adopted and of course, following our principle of Cabinet government, the whole Cabinet publicly supports what has been decided. This means that the Minister who was opposing the decision is the one who has to announce it and defend it. Of course it will undermine the authority of Government if information is deliberately leaked that that Minister was opposed to the decision. That is one example.<lb/>
On the question of advice given to Ministers, civil servants offer advice and it can be rejected. Ministers, or the Government as a whole, can decide to do something quite different. The nature of that advice has always been confidential, because, again, civil servants have to support the decision that has been taken&#x2014;
<col>634</col>
and they always have, loyally. This is a matter which should be dealt with by code or by discipline. In my personal experience, the traditions of our public service and its practice have probably been the ruling factors. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor mentioned Civil Service discipline in this respect.<lb/>
There is certainly nothing that I can see in the Bill to deal with these matters. I should therefore be grateful if, when my noble friend Lord Belstead winds up the debate, he could tell us how these matters are to be covered in the future, unless our whole system of Cabinet government is to be changed, and I cannot believe that that is to be part of the Bill's intention. I believe this is important because deliberate leaks that have occurred in the past are usually slanted or are only part of the story. Very often they have been leaked in order to give credence to one side of an argument or to tilt the balance. The public may then be misinformed or indeed misled by such leaks. The only remedy that is available to a Government or a department in that situation is to release the whole of the story. As I have indicated, that may undermine our whole system of government&#x2014;the system of collective responsibility for decisions and the loyalty of civil servants who may have recommended against those decisions at earlier stages.<lb/>
My second question is on classification and is particularly related to Clause 13 Under that clause, regulations are to be passed by both Houses of Parliament. Will that be the occasion, after those regulations have been passed, for a complete overhaul of the system of classification of documents throughout the Government in all the departments? I think this question is related to the one just put by the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, about classification. I believe that for the new classification system to work successfully it must be integrated with the Government system and that in turn has to have the authority of the Ministers concerned. So I ask whether it is the intention to have an overhaul of the classification system as a whole once Parliament has accepted the proposed regulations.<lb/>
Before concluding, I suggest that if this Bill is passed it should have a trial period to see how it works in practice and that the Government should not close its
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0326"/>
<col>635</col>
mind to changes or additions being made after a reasonable period. For example, a point has been raised&#x2014;I heard it being put by Mr. Harold Evans of the <i>Sunday Times</i> on the radio today after the one o'clock news&#x2014;about the description of information received from foreign Governments or international organisations. I think he has a point that that particular category of information could be abused in the future if it is not very carefully watched. A Government could simply ban any information from certain sources even though there was really no secrecy or confidentiality about it. With those reservations, I welcome the proposed disappearance of Section 2 of the 1911 Act.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01500"><member>Lord ARDWICK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since I have recently become the chairman of the Press Freedom Committee of the Commonwealth Press Union perhaps I had better explain straight away that what I am saying today is entirely a personal view. It is 40 years since I and fellow members of the National Union of Journalists demonstrated in the streets against the Official Secrets Act. What we had against Mr. Neville Chamberlain's Government at that particular moment on official secrets, I cannot well remember but I do remember that we were extremely upset about the situation; and ever since then the Act has been under intermittent attack from journalists, from trade unionists and from lawyers with a deep concern for civil liberties. In recent years the criticism has grown and grown as Government have come to have a greater impact upon our daily lives&#x2014;often a beneficial impact although sometimes a restrictive one&#x2014;so that people have felt an increasing need to find out what the Government are really doing, what they are thinking, and how their agents are acting when they are out of the public view. So the arrogant secretiveness of the old Establishment is no longer tolerable and, perhaps rather reluctantly, Governments have come to accept this.<lb/>
The question of what should be open to the public, and what in the public interest should not be revealed, is not really in conflict between the two major parties that have held power in turn since the war. Nor is it a Left versus a Right issue;
<col>636</col>
it is a conflict between the governors of our society and the rest of us, the governed. The champions of the governed are to be found on the Back Benches of Parliament and in a vigilant newspaper Press. In recent years the newspapers have recovered and intensified their old zest for investigation, for probing into dark corners and asking the kind of questions which Governments hate to hear and sometimes are loath to answer. In recent years newspapers have devoted increased resources and developed new techniques to perform this role, which is essential to any democracy, more effectively than ever.<lb/>
The difficulties in the way of the Press in Britain are formidable. A more severe view of libel is taken in Britain than in any other country I know. The law of contempt is still confusing, and in the Official Secrets Act there is still the absurd and notorious Section 2. This Section 2 was, I think, described by the late Richard Crossman as "a mangy old sheep". It has not been administered repressively ; it is however a useful weapon to deter, if not to smite, or it is a wall behind which officialdom can shelter when under assault. Perhaps its most profound effect has been to reflect and to fortify the tradition of secrecy among British officials and British Governments.<lb/>
When we newspaper men compare our situation with that in America we are told, "You must take into account the British Parliamentary system: the presence of Ministers in Parliament who can be questioned by Members of Parliament enjoying the widest privilege". This, rather than the Press, is the palladium of our British liberties, so we are told. It is a strong argument but it is not an overwhelming one. Members of Parliament depend heavily for their effectiveness in probing and challenging Ministers of the Crown on the reports and investigations of newspapers. An Opposition deprived of newspapers would be in a sad way indeed. An Opposition stimulated and informed by a Press with sufficient freedom to probe and disclose would gain in democratic effectiveness.<lb/>
It is in accord with the current climate that after much debate and long inquiry the Government should produce a Bill to sweep away Section 2. It has been said that it replaces a blunderbuss with an
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0327"/>
<col>637</col>
Armalite rifle. That is exactly what newspapers, who will be on the receiving end, now fear. It is much easier to face a blunderbuss than to face an Armalite rifle. To change the metaphor, the Government are replacing a wide and unwieldy net with a fine mesh for a handier net which will let the small fry get away but which will catch the bigger fish at need. That is what is upsetting the newspapers. There is little gratitude in Fleet Street for what the Government propose. Within a few days of the publication of the Bill it has been critically assessed not only by the Sunday newspaper which the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor mentioned, but by the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>Economist</i> and by newspapers which the Government may look upon as friends, such as the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Sunday Telegraph.</i> The <i>Guardian</i> even goes so far as to say that the Bill is&#x2014;
<quote>"in certain essential provisions a far clearer assault on the freedom of the press than anything contrived by Mr. Michael Foot or intended by the National Union of Journalists three years ago".</quote>
Perhaps this argument is not so compelling as it might be since I think that the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, and I, and others, must now admit that our fears of three years ago, happily, have not been borne out.<lb/>
Mr. Stewart Patrick in the <i>Daily Mail</i> last Friday was even more scathing. He said:
<quote>"It might seem difficult to imagine a replacement which is worse than Section 2, but this Government has managed it".</quote>
With tongue in cheek he commends the Government on the Bill's honesty:
<quote>"It is honestly and unashamedly devoted to the belief that Government is a secret process and that the Press and the public should be told only what Whitehall considers good for them".</quote>
There is, I fear, a danger of the public becoming confused by the row about this Bill. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor did his best to set it straight earlier on.<lb/>
Two demands are being made by the Press and by others. The first is that the infinitely wide provisions of Section 2 should be swept away and in their place protection should be given to the narrow range of subjects on which there is universal agreement that protection is vital to the nation and to its citizens. But items of information which would cease, under these provisions to be protected by the
<col>638</col>
criminal law, would not necessarily be available to the public. So what is needed is further legislation, an official freedom of information Bill which would establish a general right of access to official documents for members of the public and indeed provide facilities for such access. Mr. Freud's Private Member's Bill attempted both to do this and drastically to reform or replace Section 2 at one and the same time. So now the Government are being reproached for failing to follow the Freudian path. Meanwhile Mr. Meacher in another place is following in Mr. Freud's footsteps.<lb/>
It is obvious that the Government are going to have a hard time in Parliament and in the Press, and they would smooth their own path, I think, if they were to promise that they would follow this Bill with a freedom of information Bill and find time for it in the next Session. I do not think it would be nearly so difficult as the noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack has suggested. The exemptions will have been fairly clearly defined in the Bill now before us. But a promise of this kind, even if given, would not allay the fears that there are about the Bill which is before us, and it would not dissipate the bitter antagonism which is being built up.<lb/>
There is one provision in the Bill which excites universal scorn among journalists. It is not just that the Minister in a prosecution for disclosure concerning defence or international relations may present a certificate to the court saying that disclosure is likely to cause serious injury to the interests of the nation <i>et cetera;</i> it is not only that the Minister is given such a right, subject to the approval of the Attorney-General, but that the certificate will be conclusive evidence of that fact. The last five words, "conclusive evidence of that fact", are a quotation from the Bill. But we are not dealing with a fact; we are dealing with what the Minister considers to be likely to happen, we are dealing with a Minister's educated guess or his hunch, and all the court can then decide is whether the accused did it. If he did, that seems to be the end of it; if he did it, if he knew what he was doing, he has no defence.<lb/>
I hope that noble Lords who are also learned Lords will say what they think about this. Is there any good reason
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0328"/>
<col>639</col>
why the court should not decide whether the likelihood of serious injury to the national interest as conceived by the Minister is a reality? No doubt in most cases the Minister and the Attorney-General would have acted correctly and would be able to show that the certificate was valid. But we all know that there are times when the nerves of Governments are frayed and there are times when Ministers have a defective sense of judgment. It is on subjects such as defence and security that Governments can most easily lose their perspective, indeed sometimes make asses of themselves.<lb/>
There are other worrying aspects of the Bill, especially the very wide provisions about security and intelligence and wiretapping and so forth, about which noble Lords have spoken. I hope that this Bill will get deep and unhurried examination in Committee in this House. It is not a Bill that should arouse the Party passions. It does not need really to command the loyalty of supporters of the Government nor the antagonism of supporters of the Opposition. There is a real problem of balancing the need for secrecy and the need for disclosure, and it is one which the knowledge and the experience of this House is singularly fitted to tackle. I hope that the Government, who have, I believe, commitments to open government, will show some flexibility on this Bill before it goes to another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01501">4.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01502"><member>Lord GOODMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say that I am very pleased indeed that the noble Lord, Lord Ardwick, made such a notable contribution, I think I am right in saying that he is the first speaker who can claim to speak with great authority on behalf of the Press. He disowned any official mandate in that behalf, and I must do the same. I was for some seven years the chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association. I have ceased to be, but I still have a nostalgic and sentimental regard for my previous associates, and I must confess to a slight disappointment that they are so ill-represented here this afternoon. I see the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, who I have no doubt will make a valiant and worthwhile contribution, but when I think of the number of Members of this House
<col>640</col>
who ought to be available to speak on this matter, which is of such signal concern to the Press, it is a slight disappointment that they have found pressing engagements elsewhere.<lb/>
I should like to say a word of congratulation, which I think comes rather rarely, to the draftsmen of this Bill. I have on previous occasions spoken rather harshly about them. I think this is a skilfully drafted Bill in a situation of quite exceptional difficulty, because, as several noble Lords have said, it is a question of maintaining the balance between what you can freely allow and what must be suppressed on behalf of the nation. I very much associate myself with what the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, said. I do not think anyone speaking critically of this Bill will be suspected of believing that access to all our information should be given to potential enemies and potential rivals, to the detriment of the country. It would, I think, be a disservice indeed if any word spoken here were likely to create an impression that we in this House do not regard sufficiently seriously the need to maintain those secrets which are really secret and which are crucial to the welfare of the nation.<lb/>
Having said that, perhaps I may be permitted a recollection of what created the original Official Secrets Act, which may be of some value in enabling us to recognise the exceptional difficulty of maintaining the balance. I do not think any of us was alive at the time, but my vague recollection of the situation from reading is that the first Act came into existence because of a disclosure by the <i>Globe</i> newspaper of a secret annexure to the Treaty of Berlin. An inquiry had been made about that matter, I think in this House, to the Foreign Minister, Lord Salisbury, and my recollection is that he flatly denied that there was such an annexure.<lb/>
It has been thought that that was a discreditable thing to do. I do not share that view. There must obviously be times when it may be necessary for a Government Minister to tell an untruth if it is a white untruth. But what then happened was that a Foreign Office clerk, known as a Foreign Office "tenpenny" because he was paid 10d. an hour, having copied that particular annexure, copied it again and took it to the <i>Globe</i> newspaper, and is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0329"/>
<col>641</col>
believed, although there was some suspicion to the contrary, to have received no payment. He was prosecuted, but he could be prosecuted only for theft of the paper. He had had the providence to supply his own paper, so that he was acquitted. This poses a splendid example of the problem that exists.<lb/>
Clearly Government must be protected from disclosures of this kind. Is the public entitled to know whether a Minister has told a blatant untruth and informed the world at large that no such annexure existed? My own view would be that the bias is on the side of the Government. But it is a difficult question, and I give this example because it demonstrates to the House the precise nature of the difficulty. I do not believe that any Act could be drafted that would sufficiently ensure that delinquents are caught by its net that did not extend more widely than its precise need. I think one must accept that if the Act is to be adequate it must be perhaps more than adequate. This I am perfectly prepared to accept.<lb/>
Having accepted that, may I be permitted to say this. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor invited us to consider whether it would be appropriate to give a Second Reading to this Bill. I am in the happy position, having been taught long ago never to answer a question that one did not need to answer, as a humble Cross-Bencher in this House, of knowing that my decision on that matter is unimportant. But I would venture to say that in my view this Bill will require a great deal of work in Committee. Obviously, it cannot reach Committee unless it has a Second Reading. Having said that I shall refer no more to the question raised by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. However, I think that there are a number of matters of principle&#x2014;and it would be wrong to enter into the detail at this stage&#x2014;that one might safely mention.<lb/>
First, there is the question of the Freedom of Information Bill which has been much mooted abroad. I would not wish to encourage the complacency of the Opposition in this matter, by belief that anyone regards them as totally virtuous in their behaviour. They had many years in which to introduce an amended Official Secrets Bill, a Freedom of Information Bill or any type of Bill they liked in order to increase the liberties of the subject.
<col>642</col>
They never did so while in office, but they satisfied themselves by a faint reference in their election Manifesto and said that next time they were in they were certainly going to do it. I can only say that I still would have some doubts about the nature and extent to which that promise will be fulfilled. I think that the problem that arises in this connection is that people out of government regard this as obviously something that needs to be done. However, when they come into Government they come into line with the realities of the situation&#x2014;that it can be done only in circumstances of exceptional difficulty and by a very bold advance.<lb/>
As regards the present Bill, what is most distressing is the unanimous hostility of the Press to it. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, referred to this matter, and so did the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder. I would venture to make a suggestion. I believe that it is of desperate importance that in a free democracy a proper relationship should exist between Press and Government. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, rightly said, it should not be a relationship of excessive affection: it should be a relationship at arm's length, but it must be a relationship where the Press has confidence in the honesty of the Government and confidence in the certainty that the Government will not use this legislation for ulterior or disreputable motives. It needs to be satisfied that they will not use it to conceal errors. It needs to be satisfied that they will not use it to prevent embarrassment.<lb/>
I venture to suggest that if that has not already happened, it would be very appropriate for the Government to confer with the senior organs of the Press about how the Bill might be amended in a way that would restore its confidence. There is a splendid institution for doing that. I am referring to the Press Council. At present, the chairman of the Press Council is an extremely distinguished lawyer, as indeed were his two predecessors extremely distinguished lawyers. He is perhaps in some ways the most suitable person. So far as I know he has had no political affiliations. He is chairman of the Bar Council, and in my view his view on this matter&#x2014;if consultation has not already taken place&#x2014;would be of very great value.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0330"/>
<col>643</col>
Another matter that would greatly restore confidence, and which has already been raised, is the question of who should institute proceedings and in what circumstances. There is bound to be great hostility to the suggestion that a Minister of the Crown can, as an unchallengeable act, certify that an offence has been committed. I know that the noble Lord said that it could be left neither to the courts, nor to the institution of prosecution, because it might mean providing information in excess of what was safe at that stage. I must remind him that if a prosecution is in fact instituted all that information has to be provided. It is provided at the hearing, and the courts have found methods of hearing <i>in camera</i> those parts that are regarded as confidential and as possibly dangerous to the security of the State. They have found ways of hearing those matters without the necessity of bestowing the power on a Minister. Your Lordships will never persuade the Press that an unfettered discretion vested in a Minister is a safe thing to give in respect of almost anything&#x2014;certainly not in a matter which affects the liberty of the subject. I ask the Government to reconsider the matter very carefully.<lb/>
It is slightly ironic that the self same Lord Chancellor who has expressed such cogent and persuasive reasons why we should have a Bill of Rights which assigns every matter of significance to the courts should regard it as inappropriate that this particular matter should be assigned to the courts. That is also a reason why we should think again about bestowing unfettered discretion on a Minister without any right of appeal. If I may say so, I think that rather than vesting this power with the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has already had some very invidious decisions to make, and putting the Attorney-General in the same situation, it would be far better to adopt the rule that applies, if I am not mistaken, in relation to criminal livelihood&#x2014;that no prosecution can be instituted without the consent of the court. If that can apply in a matter as important as that I cannot see why it should not apply in these cases. I invite the Government to reflect on whether that change might not do a great deal to render the Bill less unacceptable to the Press at large and, if I may say so, to the public at large.<lb/>
<col>644</col>
I should like to hark back to the question of the Freedom of Information Bill. Much has been said about this and it is prated about as though it were a solution to problems. The lawyers present, and some who are not lawyers, may, a hundred years ago, as I did, have read Dicey's <i>Constitutional Law</i> and remember that he told us that liberties in this country were not prescribed by Act of Parliament. What one was entitled to do was what one was not prevented from doing. I take exactly the same view about information. I would rather see the area of prevention restricted than an attempt to enunciate what it is we are entitled to do. I do not believe that it is possible to do that. The result would be total confusion. I think too that Mr. Freud was much more consistent and logical in embodying in one Bill&#x2014;if he had wanted to have a Freedom of Information Bill&#x2014;provisions both for the freedom of information and for their restriction. My own view is that we shall have much greater safeguards and benefits by limiting the restrictions than by intending to state what it is we are allowed to do. These are general observations, and I conclude only by saying&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01503"><member>Lord HARMAR-NICHOLLS</member><membercontribution>: apologise for interrupting the noble Lord, but I wonder whether he would assist me on a very important point? He suggested that there could be some legitimate doubt as regards the impartiality of a Minister and whether he would initiate proceedings. He seemed to suggest that the chairman of the Press Council, who is impartial and objective, could perhaps be consulted because he is impartial and objective. However, he cannot speak with the authority of the rest of the Press, whereas a Minister, when he makes a statement, involves the whole of the Government. Therefore, if one questions the impartiality of a Minister, one is questioning the impartiality of the whole of the Government. However, the recognition that the chairman of the Press Council cannot, with authority and certainty, speak for the whole of the Press in his reaction, is, I believe, a possible weakness in the type of suggestion that the noble Lord is putting to the Government in asking them to give thought to amending the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01504"><member>Lord GOODMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I grow older it becomes increasingly depressing to see how difficult it is for me to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0331"/>
<col>645</col>
make myself clear. I did not at any time suggest that the institution of proceedings should be at the discretion of the chairman of the Press Council. I suggested that it might be desirable to consult the Press Council and other relatively impartial authorities in relation to the Press, as to the terms of the Bill. Clearly it would be quite inappropriate to seek to vest the Press, who are most likely to be the people accused, with the authority of launching the proceedings. That was never my intention and I apologise to the noble Lord if I gave him a misleading impression.<lb/>
In conclusion, I do not believe that freedom of information Bills are likely to achieve much in the way of making us freer people. The number of restrictions on the expression of opinion and the expression of view are, indeed, likely to affect whether we are free or not free people. I would hope that the Bill will be most strenuously considered in Committee. I hope, too, that we shall achieve a situation with an Official Secrets Act, where the prevention of the dissemination of information cannot in any circumstances be operated as a censorship. I hope that we shall attain a situation where the Government will demonstrate&#x2014;as I am sure is their intention&#x2014;in the written word (and the written word will speak for that demonstration), that it is their intention only to restrict these matters to the extent that they are a danger to society and a danger to Government and likely to impede good government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01505">4.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01506"><member>Lord DERWENT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some of your Lordships may be somewhat surprised to find me making a speech because they may know that many moons ago I decided never to make another speech&#x2014; I merely interrupt if I think I can be tiresome. It was not out of consideration for your Lordships that I gave up making speeches, but on the various occasions when I sat on the Front Bench I became extremely tired of the sound of my own voice! However, this is a Home Office Bill and, although I never dealt with the matter as such when at the Home Office, it is a matter that has always interested me and I realise the complications.<lb/>
May I say without any impertinence that for the first time I think that I agree
<col>646</col>
with every word that has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Goodman. There have been occasions when I have disagreed with him and I have not said so. But today I undoubtedly agree with him.<lb/>
Merely from looking at the history of the matter it must be quite clear that noble Lords opposite will not divide on Second Reading against the Bill.<lb/>
Looking at the history of the matter, it started, of course, with the Franks Committee, and, it was found in the end that some of that Committee's recommendations did not work. After a long time and two manifestoes, the previous Labour Government issued a White Paper which differed to some extent from the recommendations of the Franks Committee. This Bill very much follows that White Paper, though there are certain additions to it. Obviously noble Lords opposite are not in a position to divide on Second Reading, but the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, indicated at some length that he intends to oppose quite a few of the details in the Bill during the Committee stage. He indicated that he would not oppose the Bill now.<lb/>
There have been three additions to the White Paper which are of some importance and which I do not think have been mentioned. I may be wrong in saying that they are additions, but I think I am right. The first, to use shorthand, is the protection of foreign Governments. I believe that to be important; it is a question of our credibility as a country. There is power in the Bill to stop information which is given to us in confidence by a foreign Government from being spread about. The clause that deals with postal interception is also new and important. The third addition arises in Clause 1(4)<i>(b),</i> which brings the nationalised industries into the picture and advocates treating them the same as any other business or body corporate. That is all I want to say about the Bill.<lb/>
I should like briefly to make some comments on the Press. Seldom have I had any opportunity to give advice to the Press, though they have given me lots of advice. I believe that they are ruining their own case. I have read various Press comments on the Bill. They may be right about some of the things they dislike about the Bill, which may be
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0332"/>
<col>647</col>
altered in Committee, but in some of their articles they have given the impression that they object, first, to the fact that in the Bill they are treated exactly the same as any other ordinary citizen, though differently from the civil servant. I do not see why they should not be. I do not think that that is what they mean, but that is the impression given to other members of the public. In that way I believe that the Press are spoiling their case.<lb/>
Secondly, in some articles they seem to suggest&#x2014; I do not think they mean to&#x2014;that the Government are not the proper people to decide what is secret and what should not be divulged. One article in one of the papers goes further and, reading between the lines, the suggestion is that the Press should decide. I am sure that that is not what is meant. By overstating their case in that way they are doing themselves a great deal of harm.<lb/>
I should like to follow up what the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, has just said. I do not believe that the suggestion in the Labour Party's Green Paper about divulging information&#x2014;I shall not say ad <i>lib</i>&#x2014;and putting it into legislation would work. It was tried in the United States and as soon as the laws were passed they had to start hedging around and stopping what they had already agreed to. I am convinced that the proper way to deal with this question of information is to put pressure on the Government, but that should be done by administrative means. If Governments wish to give out more information, they ought to make quite certain that their civil servants give out more information and that they can do so, but to do it by means of the law would be a failure. That is my swan song.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01508"><member>Lord HUTCHINSON of LULLING-TON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess that, eight and a half years since the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> case, seven years since the Franks Report was published, 10 years since the Fulton Report was published, 16 years since the publication of the Radcliffe Report and only a mere year since the ABC trial, to be presented with a Protection of Official Information Bill rather than a freedom of information Bill is something of a disappointment. I
<col>648</col>
confess that I find the Bill itself depressing. Some of it is so unsatisfactory that I wonder whether it can be cured by amendment. The icing on this indigestible and, in some parts, poisonous cake is, of course, the final burial of Section 2. But that is a mere formality, as it expired years ago.<lb/>
However, there are some good points in the Bill and, of course, I welcome them. Above all, I welcome that it is the disclosure, and not the receipt, of information which is made subject to the criminal law. I welcome the defence which is provided under Clause 2(2)<i>(a)</i> and <i>(b),</i> the classification of documents to be governed by regulations and the attempt to limit the ambit of the information which is to be protected. Those points are good and are perhaps worth supporting in the spirit of the opening remarks of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor.<lb/>
I turn now to the bad aspects of the Bill. Those most directly affected by the Bill are, first, of course, the huge number of Crown servants; secondly, the Press and the media and, if one believes in the freedom of the Press, onwards to the informed public; thirdly, the lawyers&#x2014;for it is the advocate who will advise on whether or not to prosecute and it is he who must explain the offence to the jury which is to try the case and, indeed, argue the law; it is the advocate who must ultimately be the champion of the freedom of the individual when the matter comes to trial. It so happens that, as an advocate, I have been involved in a large number of Official Secrets Act cases, the two most relevant&#x2014;and this has been mentioned by my noble friend Lord Wigoder&#x2014;being the <i>Sunday Telegraph </i> case and, more recently, the <i>ABC</i> case. Many days were spent in those trials discussing and seeking to disentangle the idiocies, of Section 2. In my opinion this Bill has not resolved the problems which have exacerbated the relations between the Press and Government and which have brought so many trials under the Official Secrets Act into disrepute. Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Wigoder has already said, by replacing a discredited and therefore unused section by a new and in many ways more rigid control, the Bill may turn out to be a backward step.<lb/>
In my opinion, this Bill is once again befogged by the official obsession with
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0333"/>
<col>649</col>
secrecy and suspends once more&#x2014;and I regret taking this view&#x2014;above the journalist's head a sword which may fall unpredictably and oppressively and propel him once again into the dock. Franks came to two clear conclusions, did it not? One was only to use the criminal law when there is a specific reason. The reason there is to protect the security of the nation and the safety of the people, as it was put. Secondly&#x2014;and this was essential to the Franks Report&#x2014;the only way to bring certainty and clarity is to have a clear system of classification governed by regulation with a built-in safeguard against over-classification, because one of the greatest dangers in this area is to launch a prosecution against an individual on an outdated classification.<lb/>
But the very basis of the Franks Report was that in a trial the prosecution must satisfy the court that the information falls within the necessary classification, and that that information was at the time so classified. Classification was the test of the serious injury to the interests of the nation. The safeguard against over- classification was a review of the classification by the Minister; a review of the classification by the Minister before proceedings were instituted. Of course, here in this Bill, as we have heard, the certificate of the Minister is not a review of a previous classification in order to see that it is up to date and a prosecution is properly launched. It is apparently a review in the sense of looking at the information which has been disclosed and then certifying that in fact it enters the category suggested, which is a very different thing.<lb/>
What do we find here in this Bill? I wish not to go too much into detail, but I would submit that it is important for the House to appreciate what are the implications. Clause 1(1)<i>(a)</i> and Clause 2 have been referred to. What would happen, under this Bill, in court under a prosecution? The Crown servant would be found guilty of an offence if he disclosed any
<quote>"information relating to defence or international relations"</quote>
which has been certified by the Minister as likely to cause serious injury to the interests of the nation. In other words, as my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones pointed out, the main issue in the trial will have been decided before
<col>650</col>
anybody comes into court at all; that is, the certificate of the Minister is all that would be required. If prosecuting, one's job would be exceedingly simple. It would be to prove that the person in the dock was indeed a Crown servant and, secondly, that the information was disclosed. That would be the end of that, and there would be no defence for the defendant in relation to that certificate. But the certificate, as I have already pointed out, is given <i>ex post facto,</i> and there is no requirement as to prior classification.<lb/>
What course would be open to the defence? This is the other point in this Bill which I submit needs the most careful examination. On a balance of probabilities, that he had no reasonable cause to believe that the information, was information to which this Act applied. Well, what is that information? It is that described in Clause 1(1)<i>(a)</i>:
<quote>"Information relating to defence or international relations the&#x2026;disclosure of which would be likely to cause serious injury &#x2026;".</quote>
So on this defence which is given to the defendant, the defendant would want to prove that he had no reasonable cause to believe that the information would be likely to cause serious injury because, for instance, it had been published in many other places already.<lb/>
But then the certificate is produced, and the certificate is conclusive that that is not the case. What is the result of that? Is the defence which is provided here rendered inoperable by the production of the certificate, or does the Minister visualise that a jury is to be told, "You must find this disclosure of information is likely to cause serious injury because you have got the certificate in front of you, and that cannot be disputed in this court. But, if the defendant proves the information to have been published widely before he disclosed it, then you can acquit him because he genuinely believed the prior publication would mean that any further publication could not cause serious injury to the nation, although the Minister certified that it does"?<lb/>
A defence of reasonable cause to believe no injury must involve an inquiry into whether in fact there was injury, must it not? For if you can prove that there was not any injury, then of course your belief must be a reasonable one. I hope
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0334"/>
<col>651</col>
that this is not a lawyer's complexity of thought, but it does seem to me that if you have here a certificate which cannot be in any way rebutted, and at the same time you provide a defence to a defendant to prove that he had no reasonable cause to think that this publication would cause injury to the nation, then the very foundation of that defendant's defence must be that, because it was known beforehand it could not cause any injury to anybody, and therefore he must be in a position to prove that. Yet the situation will be completely farcical if, at the same time, the jury going out to consider that matter had in their hands a copy of a certificate from a Minister which said that that cannot be so.<lb/>
Can your Lordships accept the power in the Minister to certify? In nine cases out of 10 would you not agree that he will do what his security advisers advise? Perhaps I may tell your Lordships what happens in those circumstances. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Derwent, will not be upset by what I am going to say. In the <i>ABC</i> case the matter concerned the disclosing of information about Signals intelligence, and the Signals intelligence professionally is known as "SigInt". In court were several rows of security officers, and on the first day of the trial we were told, "The word 'SigInt' is secret."We were told that the whereabouts of SigInt stations in this country were secret and their names must not be mentioned; that the SigInt units serving there were secret and their names must not be mentioned; that the United States had SigInt stations in this country, but they were secret and must not be mentioned; that the headquarters of SigInt was in a place which must not be mentioned because it was secret; that the aerials used in those stations were secret; and that the physical layout of SigInt stations was secret and must not be mentioned.<lb/>
On the first day of the trial and in cross-examining witnesses one was told that one must not mention SigInt but only intelligence. Having a client who had, as a journalist, collected a large library of information on his own particular subject, we were able within three days to produce 20 or 30 articles from around the world discussing SigInt; we were able to produce photographs of
<col>652</col>
boards up outside SigInt stations with the names of the units written on them, and the court was in a state of hilarious laughter when witnesses appeared in the witness box and I asked, "Is it right that this"&#x2014;passing up on a piece of paper&#x2014;"is the name of your unit?" and the reply was, "I cannot answer that question; that is a secret." I then passed a photograph of the board to the witness and asked, "Is that the board that is up outside the door of your unit?" The answer was, "Yes", but when I asked, "Read it out to the jury", the answer was, "I cannot do that; that is a secret". There is no question at all but that these matters, if there had been provision for a certificate, would have been certified by the Minister on the advice of his officers as being secret matters which, if mentioned at the Central Criminal Court, would bring the whole of the stucture of society to the ground. That is the situation, and I ask noble Lords to consider very carefully whether this system of certification is one they are prepared to accept.<lb/>
I turn to the international relations part of Clause 1. It refers to:
<quote>"serious injury to the interests of the nation".</quote>
I remind the House of the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> case, in which publication involved a confidential assessment of the defence situation in Nigeria, the supply of arms to the Nigerian Government and the attitude of the British Government to Biafra showing, as it appeared, a very different situation from that stated officially by the Government in Parliament. There was a serious deterioration in our relations with Nigeria when this matter was published. There is no doubt about that at all. What would have been the Minister's certification in that situation? What would the Minister's certification have been at the time of Suez? These are matters of serious import.<lb/>
Again, how in terms of international relations would the defendant raise the defence that is given to him&#x2014;that he had no reasonable cause to believe the disclosure would cause serious injury? Would the Minister agree to him calling a series of experts to say that the interests of the nation required the disclosure? If not, the defence is a myth. My personal view, for what it is worth, is that the phrase "interests of the nation" is an impossible definition, that the words are
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0335"/>
<col>653</col>
far too broad and could be argued forever. The words should in my view be much more akin to "the defence or security of the Realm" and that nothing less will do. The test must be one of evidence of classification, I suggest, and a certificate should be given only on a review of the classification by the Minister at the moment of proceedings, and that the defence of previous publication surely should be provided throughout the Bill, of no reasonable cause to believe that the information was protected because it had become available to the public or a section of the public. Surely Clause 7 must be rephrased, extended and strengthened from the miserable creature it now is.<lb/>
Under Clause 1(1)<i>(b),</i> as the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, pointed out, the disclosure of any information relating to security or intelligence would become an offence, and we are back again to the old cups of tea situation of Section 2 of the old Act, and once again the defence provided&#x2014;of no reasonable cause to believe that it was information to which the Act applied&#x2014;is vacuous, is it not? because all the defence would mean was that it did not relate to security or intelligence. That is no defence that would be of any use to anybody and, in all these cases, the matter would clearly relate to security or intelligence and the defence that is needed is the defence to which I have referred.<lb/>
On Clause 4 and the offence of wrongful disclosure by the ordinary person or journalist, if a person discloses any protected information&#x2014;anything which he might reasonably believe related to security or intelligence which had once been in the possession of a civil servant or a clerk in a military establishment&#x2014;it would be an offence. The fact, as the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper disclosed that immigration officers helped MI5 with information would immediately fall within that category, and so would all the matters I referred to in the <i>ABC</i> case. I submit that the whole question of the propriety, safety and expense of the intelligence services is one surely which must be debated in Parliament.<lb/>
Clause 5 has not really been referred to, but I submit that it is the worst of all if we are looking at the objectionable parts of the Bill. Here indeed the journalist should be alarmed, for this is indeed Big Brother himself. It provides that if:
<col>654</col>
<quote>"any person has in his possession &#x2026; any document containing information &#x2026; which is protected"&#x2014;</quote>
and again let us not forget the certificates&#x2014;and has reasonable cause to believe that it is so protected and,
<quote>"fails to comply with an official direction for its &#x2026; disposal",</quote>
he commits an offence for which he may receive three months imprisonment or a &#x00A3;1,000 fine. Your Lordships will appreciate that that refers to any document relating to anything to do with security or intelligence&#x2014;that is in regard to the intelligence services.<lb/>
I should like to summarise the situation as I see it on reading the clause. I may be wrong, but consider the position of a journalist who in a sensible way amasses a file of information &#x2014;much of it of course confidential, some of it leaked to him no doubt by politicians, police officers and others, much of it from very different sources&#x2014;which he keeps himself and discloses or uses only after consultation with his editor, no doubt. Such a journalist will find the police or the security services, with a search warrant, coming and rummaging through his files, hitting upon documents which fall within the words that I have quoted, containing information which is protected and certified to be so of course when the search has been completed. He will then be ordered to dispose of the documents in the way that the official requires him to dispose of them, and if he does not do so, he commits an offence. Is that what your Lordships feel should be an appropriate course of action in the light of the provisions of the Bill?<lb/>
My Lords, I have said enough, and I have taken a long time, in order to give some indication of my own personal grave doubts as to the desirability of the Bill in its present form. I should like to second the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, that the chairman of the Press Council might well be consulted in relation to any possible amendments to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01509">5.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01510"><member>Lord GIBSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be brief because I think your Lordships will agree that enough has been said already this afternoon to convince all of us that the Bill will need a great deal of work in Committee if it is to achieve what surely
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0336"/>
<col>655</col>
we all want to achieve; namely, the proper balance between freedom and security&#x2014;a point that has been made by a number of your Lordships this afternoon. This is the essence of the matter, and the question is whether the Bill achieves it, and I believe that it does not do so in its present form. Indeed, I do not believe that it represents a net improvement over the old Section 2 in its present form. I believe that it is preferable to live under an unworkable blunderbuss or a sawn-off shotgun which is very seldom invoked than under this Bill, which I believe would have a very repressive effect.<lb/>
Of course the Bill contains some improvements. It narrows the area of secrecy, but within the newly defined area, which necessarily is very wide, it effectively allows the Government to determine what is a secret and what is not; and I do not believe that by their nature Governments are the best instruments for deciding where the balance between freedom and security lies, particularly at moments when they are liable to be embarrassed. Let us therefore examine the Bill in Committee to see whether it protects official information and also whether it achieves the necessary balance. I believe that it gives the Government too much power, and I hope that we can do something about that. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, I should like to support the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, that the Press Council chairman might help.<lb/>
I accept that in order to give the authorities the power to catch all those who really are endangering our national security or interest the definitions of protected information have to be wide, and they certainly are wide in the Bill. Clause 1(1)<i>(e),</i> for instance, refers to
<quote>"information which is obtained from a government of another State &#x2026; on terms requiring it to be held in confidence".</quote>
It is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which there would be room for two perfectly legitimate opinions as to whether the national interest really required that such information should be protected. Yet, if any person discloses information of that nature he may be committing an offence under the Bill, which goes on to say that a prosecution under this clause
<col>656</col>
requires the consent of the Attorney-General. A prosecution under the clause relating to defence or international affairs requires a certificate from a Minister of the Crown to the effect that disclosure damages the national interest. This point has been constantly referred to this afternoon.<lb/>
Surely the whole point is that if the definitions are to be drawn widely enough to be effective when they are needed, it must be wrong to allow Ministers&#x2014;the Executive authority&#x2014;the sole power to interpret where the national interest lies. I urge that we examine the Bill in Committee and draw the definitions widely enough for their purpose, but withhold from the Government the power to prosecute until they have satisfied an independent authority. We have been told by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to make the distinction between a political decision, which is why it has been decided to give this power to a Minister, and a judicial decision, which is felt to be inappropriate in cases of this kind. I take that point completely, but at the same time it seems to me vital that we find a way of assigning the power to make the decision to an independent authority, and I must say that I can think of no better independent authority than a High Court judge, hearing the appeal in camera if necessary.<lb/>
The Government could have allowed it to be a defence in a prosecution to be able to say that the disclosure was in the public interest and was not likely to harm that interest. They have not done so. They have preferred to let prosecutions go forward simply on the say-so of Ministers without any such defence being allowed, and I feel sure that this cannot be right. I hope that the House will insist that prosecutions for the disclosure of protected information shall go forward only on a certificate from an independent authority. That would do something to reconcile the conflicting requirements of security, on the one hand, and of freedom of information, on the other.<lb/>
Because I think that the Bill, if enacted as it stands, would make legitimate, indeed vital, journalistic inquiry harder in practice&#x2014;not in theory, but in practice&#x2014;than it is today, I ought to declare an interest. I am chairman of a group of companies, which includes two newspaper publishing
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0337"/>
<col>657</col>
companies one of which publishes the <i>Financial Times.</i> Incidentally, I would refer your Lordships to a leader on this subject which the paper published this morning. I felt that it was extremely well balanced, and the newspaper perhaps could not be charged&#x2014;as one noble Lord was&#x2014;with ruining its case. It was a very measured comment on the Bill, but none the less an indictment of it. In declaring my interest let me say that I seek no privilege for journalists. I seek only the right of all citizens to freedom of information, whether or not under a freedom of information Bill, limited only by what is vital to security, and I submit that an independent judiciary would be better judges of the national interest in this respect than would Ministers of the Crown.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01512"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with considerable trepidation that I follow the bevy of legal minds who have spoken this afternoon, but perhaps it is not a bad thing for an inquisitive layman to transgress into what looks as if it is going to be a lawyers' paradise. First, may I thank the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for his most comprehensive explanation of the provisions of the Bill and say that overall I certainly support it. I am as committed to liberty and democratic rights as, indeed, any Member of this Parliament must be; but, equally, I am firmly security-minded where the interests of this nation are concerned: not just in defence, to which the last two speakers would almost entirely have limited it, but in international relations and also in regard to something vitally important to Government interests and contracts in inventions, industrial processes and brilliant research, the disclosure of which could do irreparable damage to the future economic progress of this country.<lb/>
Having worked with four Ministries, one in war-time and three in peace-time, I know how dribs and drabs of information can be built up into a dramatically important whole, and how what may be insignificant to a junior can provide the missing link to an expert. Ironically, of course, alongside the intelligence services no one is better at putting bits and pieces together and making a whole cake out of them than are the Press. They can be
<col>658</col>
quite expert at it. The suggested demise of the tight net of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act has been generally welcomed, and indeed I welcome it also. In fact, the Bill implements, though it has been given little credit for it today, many of the recommendations of the Franks Committee, which, with the White Paper published by the last Government, still emphasised, both of them, the essential importance of national security and international relations.<lb/>
The Bill also refers to Government contractors. Thousands of these are in private enterprise industry, and are susceptible in this day and age to the tremendous post-war growth in industrial espionage. In this Bill we seem to have fully protected the nationalised industries, firms under Royal Charter, British Leyland and the BBC&#x2014;ironically, not ITV&#x2014;hut it is less effective in the case of companies vital to this country, not merely in defence but in new inventions that could win us enormous exports abroad if we are first in the field, and in their development and research before they receive their Government contract. How, too, in this computer age, does the individual fare in safeguarding, under this Bill, his justifiable privacy? The Government have obviously sought to find a fair and rational balance between the zeal of certain sections of the public and the Press to "publish and be damned" and the legitimate protection of our national interests and individual rights; and I must say that I gain no heart from the last two speakers, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, when he seeks to separate national security from international affairs. One of the Press staff may go to jail for six months, but the damage done if confidential exchanges between two heads of State are disclosed could be far more damaging to this country, and could completely destroy the goodwill and the faith that may have taken years to build up.<lb/>
The Bill&#x2014;and if I am wrong in this I am sure my noble friend who is to reply will correct me&#x2014;seems to shift the weight of the offence from the recipient of information leaked to the party leaking such information. What happens when the Press refuse to disclose their sources of information? Are we to have endless Government inquiries, at the taxpayers' expense, to find the culprit? There has
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0338"/>
<col>659</col>
been some criticism of the clauses covering defence and international affairs, but I would firmly agree that such issues are essentially political and that only the Government of the day, with all the information at their command, have the confidential know ledge and, above all, the overriding responsibility to the country to assess the extent of the injury inflicted on our nation and on our overseas relations; or, indeed, defencewise, on our military allies.<lb/>
Let us not forget that in this battle for information between nations we do not compete on equal terms. Less than a quarter of the world has a free Press to probe and pry and analyse. In three-quarters of the world, radio and television are equally controlled and restricted by rigid censorship, as is open debate. In many lands, to criticise any action of the Government is treasonable, as is critical analysis of any Government project. The availability of information from such countries is minimal, and, being Government-controlled, can even be deliberately misleading "black" information in comparison with the wide availability of information in another country in a free Press, radio, television, in research articles and in industrial journals. The information which can be gleaned from open sources in such countries far exceeds that which we can obtain from the censored countries.<lb/>
It has been suggested that quite a number of people seek to transfer the decision on "injury to the nation" to the courts. How, without disclosing the value of the most secret defence processes or the most delicate international negotiations, could you impose upon a judge and jury, with all the court officials&#x2014;the police, the lawyers, the witnesses, the Press&#x2014;the responsibility of assessing that which it is rightly the absolute duty and responsibility of the Government to assess, that duty and responsibility having been put on their shoulders by the elected Parliament? And what effect would this greatly widened disclosure have on relations with our NATO allies or our foreign neighbours and allies? Without security, such international exchanges of information would simply dry up.<lb/>
I should now like to say a word about Government contractors. From being
<col>660</col>
the greatest industrial nation in the 19th century we are now overtaken by the financial and economic strength of several of our industrial rivals. We are still, however, an inventive nation, and the need to protect such specialised knowledge during its development and until it is patented or is sufficiently commercially viable to be negotiated and bring a Government contract is, I think, of vital importance&#x2014;because industrial espionage is now big business. Some of our rivals give the most cursory scientific data of their equipment, but when they inquire about ours, frequently with no intention of buying but merely to pick our brains, they submit questionnaires demanding the greatest possible scientific detail. It would appear that in so far as such equipment is under Government contract, and only when it is under Government contract, will it be protected; but research and development of a prototype may take years before the Government contract to buy comes in. So whether it be in this Bill or in another&#x2014;and possibly it has to be in another&#x2014;I think our national inventiveness should be supported and protected.<lb/>
Finally, may I raise a few queries which could perhaps be considered before we reach the Committee stage? The Bill restricts disclosure but does not restrict misuse by the person restricted. What I mean is this: A Government contractor cannot disclose technology given to him to fulfil a Government contract, nor can he disclose an article he makes with it; but he can use that information for his own purposes, be they never so nefarious, possibly for the purpose of industrial espionage, possibly for the purpose of making similar goods with that information for sale to unfriendly powers. Secondly, it defines official authorisation as authorisation duly given by a Crown servant or by a Government contractor, but it does not make it an offence, as I am given to believe, for the Crown servant or the Government contractor to give an official authorisation unduly, when he has no right to do so.<lb/>
Strangely, the Bill causes an act done by a foreigner outside the United Kingdom to be an offence even if it is an act done in their own country by a foreign corporation which may have a contract to supply even minor goods to a United Kingdom embassy abroad. It also appears that the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0339"/>
<col>661</col>
Bill does not protect a person who discloses information under an order of court, including the European Court of Justice, or an order of the EEC Commission. My Lords, I do not expect the noble Lord who is to reply to answer these queries tonight, but I think that they may be points which can be considered before we reach Committee stage. I have spoken for longer than I expected, but overall I think&#x2014;even without perhaps all the Amendments sought this afternoon&#x2014;we have what will eventually become a good and necessary Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01514"><member>Lord HALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise first to the noble Baroness because I have been having electro-magnetic trouble with my hearing aid and have only just got it right in time to hear what was certainly, I hope, the theme on which I shall be reading her words with very great interest tomorrow morning. I have held for a long time that the most potent force in the world today is accident, and it is a subject which seems quite beyond the power of man to control. I went by chance into the Whips' Office on Thursday afternoon to put down my name to speak on the following Thursday. Recollecting what has recently happened in relation to Order Papers, I inquired about this Bill.<lb/>
My Lords, I regard this Government with extreme suspicion. Some events which have happened, even with the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, and his colleagues, I found very disquieting. I asked whether there were many hoping to speak on the Franks Report and the Bill. The lady replied, "Only one." I became almost terrified at the thought that this Bill&#x2014;which had appeared quite suddenly on the Order Paper, had been put down for a day when we were not due to sit, and when we were summoned for that day at only two days' notice&#x2014;somehow or other was going to have very poor support or give rise to a very poor debate. Regardless of the fact that my presence could easily make it worse, I put down my name to speak provisionally and waited for Monday morning.<lb/>
The motivating force in my case undoubtedly was the gentleman called Dreyfus; for there I saw world history changed in a single case. There were others, undoubtedly; but I doubt whether
<col>662</col>
many now can recall that, unless one's physical history is shaped just as much by that chance. I was born in that era when we saw France destroy herself again on this semi-religious, semi-racial, and semi-Left/Right struggle which witnessed the long agony of an undoubtedly, unquestionably, innocent man. He had no connection with the matter whatsoever. He was a Jew&#x2014;which suited the Right Wing in France at the time. We started something then which led on to the gas chamber. It seems that there came from that a genuine distaste, a genuine bitterness, a genuine horror of the whole procedure of the enforcement of secrecy by interrogation, by the use of spies, by the trapping of people.<lb/>
There was one thing that was said which came rather outside the range of the debate, and which was welcome to my way of thinking, from the noble Lord opposite. He said that he had been talking to two very distinguished officers of State about these matters. I was a little shocked at the sort of official attitude which came from very distinguished men&#x2014;men I would classify as more than civil servants &#x2014;in their attitude to the concerns of a very large proportion of human society. Anyone who wants a classic example should consult the diary of Harold Nicolson, a gifted, charming, delightful writer but one who had no idea of any kind about the lives of his constituents in Leicester where he was elected largely by change and where he held his seat, as a very knowledgeable man about foreign affairs, for years. But he never made any mental contact at all with the <i>petit bourgeoisie,</i>or the working-class.<lb/>
This was the attitude that recalled one of the events in the long toil of this Act. The Labour Party had rather a rough time at that time. They were, strangely enough, worried about the leadership and quarrelled about who should lead them. Mr. Raymond Postgate is writing the Life of George Lansbury. As I say, in the Labour Party Snowden had less chance of contact even than Frank Hodges would have after he had left the Party; and he had a genuine working-class background. The Labour Party at that time went through a period of constant reviling, as did most of its supporters. We had an Attorney General of great talent, who would rather have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0340"/>
<col>663</col>
volunteered to serve with any party, who brought a prosecution of a communist and then withdrew it. He took every wrong step that is possible to take without any corruption or evil motive. There was a complete lack of understanding of the principles and duties upon which a prosecution should be founded. He withdrew it for reasons which were very convenient for the Labour Party but of no particular merit, and they were certainly in contrast to the spirit of the Act.<lb/>
I wish to refer particularly today to one case, those of us who know the Labour Party, and the background of the illustrious career of my noble and learned friend Lord Gardiner, know who would get "pinched" for a prosecution. There was of course the Zinoviev letter&#x2014;I think about the 15th refutation of the validity of the Zinoviev letter&#x2014;which was undoubtedly concocted by Right Wing elements in this country. Then there was George Lansbury. Raymond Postgate, his son-in-law, in writing his biography wrote under some difficulty because they had had a demand for George's Cabinet papers to be returned. He was in the Cabinet for a few months as First Commissioner of Works. He was a man of admirable probity, of a strict integrity. But capable of course of indiscretion. He went over to try to settle Hitler. I think that was rather a sensible thing to do; I can see no possible harm in that. He tried to make peace with many people &#x2014;not, so far as I know, with Ramsay Macdonald. From two of the names mentioned by Raymond Postgate, he received constant demands for the return of his Cabinet papers. Raymond Post-gate was finally told that he would be prosecuted under this Act unless he returned the papers forthwith. The war was on and George Lansbury was dead. When Raymond Postgate asked for the return of the papers, which he had surrendered&#x2014;including many he need not have surrendered, but he said "Take the lot, I cannot start working over the man's papers at this moment with the war on; I am in the Home Guard"&#x2014;Mr. Attlee said: "No, they are Crown property". We now know they were not Crown property. In a way we are passing an Act to define ownership a little more clearly.<lb/>
As I say, I put my name down to speak with no very sure intent, but this is
<col>664</col>
a matter which so touches the heart and conception of justice and brings all of us into touch with the problems we were taught to face and principles in which we were taught to believe. I thought that the Franks Committee Report was a very cheery one, on the whole, from a distinguished committee which sometimes erred on the side of caution. Sometimes they seemed to have been almost reckless.<lb/>
I cannot say that there is anything in detail that I wish to say on this Second Reading. I hope to be able to attend throughout the Committee stage. I cannot argue because one cannot comprehend the magnitude of today's problems. I do not know how many of us today know what are the methods of finding and checking. I do not know how far we have progressed&#x2014;if it be progress&#x2014;in the interpretation of documents, the magnification of documents, the circulation of documents, and in the transmission of papers. I know that we have at the world's disposal, and being controlled by many more people, the hydrogen bomb which is of a destructive potential which brings us nearer to the end of all things. I think that we have got to take risks one way or the other, and we do take a risk if we do not have official secrets Acts and secrets retrictions.<lb/>
The time has come when we ought to take one or two decisions. We have to make peace; we have to take the chance. An immense task is to organise world understanding and world co-operation, which means of course not thinking that democracy is necessarily precisely the way in which the Russians should regulate their affairs. They have done pretty well but they have deprived the world of a lot of freedom; but their enemies have deprived the world of a lot of human beings, too. The world is facing problems of a tremendous magnitude.<lb/>
I know I have abused my position; I came here hardly prepared to go into details. I have listened to almost every word, including the brilliant speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, which was a pleasure to hear. In a strange way, I doubt whether there has been any dissent, any acrimony, about objectives. I hope that in that spirit we may be able to improve this Bill while thinking of the wider aspects in which time is beginning to pass irrevocably and finally to the end.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01516"><member>Lord GARDINER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow my noble friend Lord Hale. I shall be short. We are in an unusual situation this evening because usually of course we are concerned with differences of view between the major political parties. This is a subject in which the division of opinion has usually been between the Executive on one side and Parliament, the Press and others on the other. It is a difficult field because we must obviously nave an Official Secrets Act. The general difficulties have been felt. I cannot of course claim to speak with the experience of my noble friend Lord Hutchinson of Lullington. I can only remember one Section 2 case, perhaps illustrating the reason why for so long now it has been virtually a dead letter. This was a prosecution of a loyal, conservative, public school, conscientious civil servant who was in the Ministry of Information, a Ministry that existed not to conceal anything but all the time to give out information. She had been given, with other members of the staff, policy documents showing what British Government policy was in relation to various European countries and if anybody asked her what the Government policy was towards such and such a country she could then tell them. She could quote from the document, but she was not supposed to give anybody a copy of the document. She was particularly anxious to persuade a Yugoslav friend that our policy as to Yugoslavia was right and she actually gave him a copy of the document, which of course she should not have done. She was prosecuted under Section 2 and on the first count of the indictment she was not only dismissed the service but given the maximum punishment of two years in prison. I thought that was an absurd example of prosecution and an absurd sentence. The Court of Appeal upheld it; but it is not surprising, when one gets that sort of sentence and that sort of case, that the legislation is virtually a dead letter.<lb/>
I agree that we must have an Official Secrets Act and in particular a Section 1. With regard to Section 2, what has impressed me most in the recent history of that section has been that, although for a good many years now it has virtually become a dead letter, I have not heard anybody say&#x2014;and nobody has said in the
<col>666</col>
debate tonight&#x2014;that anything awful has happened because we have got a dead letter. There are all sorts of prosecutions which ought to have taken place and have not taken place, so it seems to show that we should take some care before we do something in the legislative field which might make things worse.<lb/>
My first difficulty concerns the completely unlimited powers of the Executive to decide the question of public interest. As the leading article in the <i>Financial Times</i> said this morning:
<quote>"What is secret will be anything which the Government chooses to call secret"</quote>
I cannot myself see why there should not be an appeal. It is quite true that in not providing for an appeal, the Bill follows the Franks Committee; but I myself believe that if the Franks Committee had sat eight years later in a very different climate they might well have taken a different view. The judges are not wholly inexperienced in this field. After all, ever since the Cammell Laird case some years ago now, it has been the law in this country that if only two people litigate the Crown is entitled to arrive and say, if a document is being called for, "You must not produce that document because it would be contrary to the public interest". The judge can then look at the document, if he is not satisfied, before making up his own mind: so they are not strangers to all this. But here there is no appeal to a court, to a tribunal, not even to a "three wise men" committee&#x2014;nor, to refer to another suggestion which I think found some favour with the last Administration and which had been suggested by Justice, is it proposed that the Parliamentary Commissioner, the Ombudsman, might play a useful part in this field.<lb/>
The second matter concerns the difficulties which my noble friend Lord Hutchinson and others have talked of over interpretation. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said it was a merit of the Bill that there has been as great a precision as possible. However, if one takes a word like "security" or "intelligence", what do the words mean? At face value they might mean anything or nothing, and I should have thought that they required a fairly precise definition. There is a definition in the definition clause, but it is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0342"/>
<col>667</col>
an explanation rather than a definition and it says:
<quote>"' security or intelligence' means the work and activities of, and in support of, the security and intelligence services or any part of them, and references to information relating to security or intelligence includes references to information held or transmitted by those services or persons in support of them or any part of them".</quote>
I do not know whether others feel much wiser after I have read that. Take security, for example: does it include atomic nuclear security'? In relation to Winscale, I think the fuels company in question would like to give some information on the grounds of security, and it ought I suppose to be a matter of security. We know that if a container of irradiated fuel&#x2014;that is to say, containing plutonium, uranium and waste matter&#x2014;is damaged, that part of London where it happened might, if it happened in London, be uninhabitable for the next 125 years.<lb/>
I do not know how many of your Lordships yesterday saw a photograph in the paper obtained by three men. They had had no difficulty in finding out by telephoning a workmen's hut that a container of nuclear waste was due to arrive at Stratford Station at a particular time from nuclear reactors in Essex and Suffolk. So they went there with a rocket launcher and duly arrived on time. They then approached with the rocket launcher to within a few inches of the container. Fortunately it was not a real rocket launcher but a dummy. It looked exactly like it; but nobody stopped them and there is a photograph in the <i>Observer</i> of yesterday of the trigger being pressed. The railway company said: "well, it has nothing to do with us. They had platform tickets and we could not stop them coming on to the platform. If we had seen a gun or something we would have told the police. It is not a matter for us". Nobody would doubt that a public service may have been done by these three men taking this course and exposing the scandalous lack of security precautions; but does that come into this question of security or intelligence? No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, could tell us.<lb/>
Also, I am very unhappy about the classification, which is to be done entirely by a civil servant, to be nominated, I think, by the Prime Minister. Classification will be particularly important to the Press. I
<col>668</col>
am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, here because I hope he might agree with me if I proposed that before this Bill proceeds very far some Committee might be set up, on which the Press could be represented, to consider what the best method of classification would be. This, you see, would be following the Franks Report, because Franks said in paragraph 163:
<quote>"The Government and the representatives of the news media and of any other interest directly affected should enter into discussions with a view to the establishment of an informal committee on classification of the kind outlined in paragraphs 165 and 166".</quote>
I think it might be a wise course to take if a committee were set up and the Press were consulted before the classification scheme is finally decided.<lb/>
Lastly, may I just say this. It is clear, is it not?, from what so many of us have said tonight that, while it may be doubtful whether a poor Bill would be better than the present situation, if we are to get the right Bill, a great deal of discussion and consideration has to take place. I want to ask this question of the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, if I may. Is the rumour&#x2014;I hope it is not an official secret&#x2014;that the Government have decided that this Bill must be rushed through this House and be out of this House by Christmas correct? If it is, I should very much regret that, because, if ever there was a Bill which would repay a very full and careful Committee stage, I should have thought it was this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01519"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there has been a wide range of views expressed tonight on this matter&#x2014;the Protection of Official Information Bill. I suppose the one thing on which there
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0343"/>
<col>669</col>
may be unanimity of view is that tonight is perhaps the most appropriate night of the year to be talking about protection in the Palace of Westminster. It is, after all, Guy Fawkes night.<lb/>
As might have been expected, this debate has revealed that there are great differences of opinion on this whole problem and pretty well every shade of opinion, if not every one, has been represented. My noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, in his customarily thorough way, has spelled out in some detail the arguments as we see them on this Bench, so I do not feel that I need to detain your Lordships for long now. What is clear from this debate is that we all&#x2014;or nearly all, at any rate&#x2014;start from the same point, in that we share the view that there needs to be a move towards as much more open government as is possible. and that there needs to be protection for certain categories of official information and information held in official quarters; that is, including private information. Where people differ is as to how far those aims should go.<lb/>
As has been mentioned by a number of noble Lords tonight, there is of course the question of balance&#x2014;on the one hand, the need to preserve the security of the State and to safeguard its citizens and, on the other hand, to make available as much information as possible. Differences have emerged within the parties, not least in the discussions that took place on earlier occasions in another place. So perhaps the Government can take some comfort, at any rate, from the fact that whatever Bill is produced will not satisfy everyone; there will have to be a compromise of some kind.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones has already indicated that the Bill before us contains elements that were in the White Paper of July, 1978, and, as he has also shown, that document itself contained some of the main proposals of the Franks Committee. Two of the principal matters proposed by the Franks Committee for inclusion as protected classes, which were not accepted as part of the White Paper plans, were Cabinet and Cabinet committee papers, except in so far as they were covered by other categories, such as defence and material about the currency and reserves; and, of course, as we have heard from the
<col>670</col>
noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, these are not in the present Bill either. So it is true to say that, to that extent at any rate, this Bill is more liberal than some aspects of the Franks Committee's proposals.<lb/>
A number of detailed objections have been raised to this Bill and there are some which may well be dealt with as Committee points, if your Lordships allow this Second Reading tonight. But it has already emerged&#x2014;and I would underline what has been said&#x2014;that there are a number of matters of importance on which the Bill is open to objection. One of the principal points&#x2014;and this is something to which my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones and others, including my noble and learned friend Lord Gardiner, have referred&#x2014;on which there is cause for concern as expressed in some other quarters, too, is that the Bill separates protection of information concerning defence and international relations from the classification of documents and articles, contrary to the recommendations of the Franks Committee itself. Here I would refer to the last Government's White Paper, at paragraph 23 on page 13, where it states:
<quote>"The system of classification markings would be embedded in the Bill, as the Franks Committee recommended, by including the definitions of each security marking in the Bill and providing an enabling power for regulations about classification to be made".</quote>
That more detailed provision is, of course, not in the Bill.<lb/>
But the major point here, about which concern has been expressed on the Bill, is that classification, which Franks recommended should be the test of serious injury to the interests of the nation and a condition for prosecution, is in this Bill only an indication that information may be protected. The problem that some people have posed is that no one can be certain, as a result of these provisions in the Bill, that a document which is not classified does not contain information which a Minister may decide is protected by criminal sanctions; in other words, that a document can be declared <i>ex post facto</i> to be protected.<lb/>
There is also some additional matter of concern in some quarters, which is put in this way: that the system of classification is not to be the responsibility of individual
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0344"/>
<col>671</col>
Ministers, but of the Minister for the Civil Service, the Prime Minister. He may delegate the job of classification to responsible authorities, which may not be within Government Departments proper&#x2014;a matter which is referred to in Clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill ; and the definitions of "Crown servant" and "government contractor" are very wide and may be extended by statutory instrument&#x2014;a matter which is dealt with in Clause 14. These provisions suggest the possibility of an almost unlimited extension of official status over bodies and persons having some relation to Government. So that there is, and has been expressed, some unease there. I suggest, and agree, that this is something on which further discussion and clarification are needed.<lb/>
A further point to which reference has been made tonight by my noble friend Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, my noble friend Lord Ardwick, the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, and my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, clearly disturbs some people and it concerns the proposed Minister's certificate. The Minister's certificate, that unauthorised disclosure may cause serious injury and so on, is under the Bill conclusive, as has been pointed out tonight, and is not open to challenge in the courts. It is not subject to any check either by the Attorney-General, as was proposed by the last Government, or by the Security Commission.<lb/>
This is something which was referred to specifically by my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, and was proposed by the then Opposition; that is to say, by a Conservative Front Bench spokesman in Standing Committee C in the other place on 8th February this year, on Mr. Clement Freud's Official Information Bill. The Minister would thus be judge in his own cause and some would therefore see him as not genuinely responsible to Parliament, as he may decline to answer questions on such matters. In making reference to this point I referred to the Attorney-General, and it is of course the case, too, that the Attorney-General's role under the Bill is limited only to consenting to prosecutions&#x2014;a role that he would have had under the White Paper as well.<lb/>
Again&#x2014;a further matter which has been causing some concern, not only to Mem-
<col>672</col>
bers of your Lordships' House but to some outside as well, and which was referred to tonight by my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones and by the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder&#x2014;is that the Bill creates a separate category of information relating to security or intelligence, which is not subject to any test of serious injury or otherwise. So this means that any information about security or intelligence is protected, whether or not it is already common knowledge. As I understand it, there is no defence under Clause 7 except in connection with the offence&#x2014;which is an additional offence&#x2014;of disclosing information about protective security measures. Here the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that disclosure could not lead to unauthorised access to other protected information, and the objection which some have put forward is that this practically precludes altogether any public discussion of security matters.<lb/>
I mention this as another example of matters about which people have expressed doubts and where further discussion might therefore be appropriate, if not very necessary. There are, of course, others. Among those mentioned tonight was the matter of telephone communications, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder. This relates to a highly sensitive field, not dealt with either in the Franks Report or in the last Government's White Paper of July 1978. I think that we shall need to look carefully at those matters.<lb/>
One of the most unfortunate features&#x2014;not so much about the Bill itself but about the way in which this measure has been brought forward, if I may say so with great respect&#x2014;is that there seems to have been a singular and sad lack of communication and consultation by the Government with other bodies on a matter which has, by its very definition alone, to do with communication. The question of consultation has been referred to tonight by, among others, the noble Lord, Lord Goodman. In the Labour Government's White Paper, for example, of July 1978 there was a relevant and, if I may say so&#x2014;I was not responsible because I was not in the Government at that time so perhaps I can mention it without immodesty&#x2014;very pertinent point at paragraph 25 on page 14. This was something which I believe was alluded to by my noble and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0345"/>
<col>673</col>
learned friend Lord Gardiner. The paragraph says that it was suggested in the Franks Report that the Government should enter into discussions with representatives of the news media and with any other interests directly affected with a view to the establishment of an informal committee on classification, and that the Home Secretary would be ready to initiate the discussions as recommended nearer the time that it seemed likely that a Bill was to be introduced.<lb/>
Then, in March 1979, there was published another document, the Green Paper, to which some reference has been made tonight by certain noble Lords. This was intended to lead to discussions and, indeed, to consultations&#x2014;and I stress that word&#x2014;on those topics. I refer in this connection, too, to a point which was made by the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder. He made it clear that he will not be able to support the reform which is before us tonight unless it is coupled with a move towards freedom of information. He endorsed, as I do now, a request which was made by my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones for information from the Government&#x2014;if not tonight, then certainly very soon indeed&#x2014;about the moves which they propose to make in the direction of freedom of information.<lb/>
It cannot have been often that there has been a measure so early in the life of a Government or a Parliament of which in the Press, irrespective of political view or colour, there has been such widespread condemnation or at least such widespread scepticism, a point referred to by my noble friend Lord Ardwick. This is especially sad when what we are united upon is the need for reform in this whole sphere. If there have been consultations it would seem that they have not been very fruitful. But whether or not they have been, and whether or not they have been adequate, there is now clearly a need, in my submission, for the widest possible examination and for a dialogue, so far as that is now open to us as the debate proceeds in your Lordships' House. For what is clear is that there need to be substantial improvements made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01521"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, has just referred to scepticism about the
<col>674</col>
drafting of the Bill whose Second Reading my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has introduced today. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, will not think that I am being discourteous if I turn from his speech, which I found very interesting&#x2014;indeed, we shall certainly look extremely carefully at many points in it&#x2014;to my noble and learned friend's speech and say that I think that the first significant point in the debate has been the one made by him; namely, that there is a broad measure of agreement that we need to do something about Section 2.<lb/>
Certainly I realise that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gardiner, made the point&#x2014;and I would not venture to disagree with him, speaking from his experience&#x2014;that nothing very undesirable seems to have occurred in recent years because of the existence of Section 2. However, I was surprised that the noble and learned Lord could say that, when one remembers the pretty trenchant criticism in the Franks Report about having legislation which was so wide and uncertain as to be almost unintelligible and unworkable. In saying that there is a broad measure of agreement, I realise also that the noble Lord, Lord Ardwick, expressed the fear that the "punt gun", as my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy described Section 2, would be replaced by a Bill which would be an Armalite riffle. That apprehension is misplaced. I say that because I believe that the case which was argued both in the Franks Report and in the previous Government's White Paper refutes many of the doubts which have been expressed today&#x2014;a report and a White Paper, incidentally, upon which this Bill is mainly based. Your Lordships' speeches will undoubtedly provide fuel for a very great deal of discussion, if this Bill is given a Second Reading.<lb/>
The debate today undoubtedly provides us with a very useful background to consider urgently the points which noble Lords have made. In doing this, we shall of course be bearing in mind that we are according to the death of Section 2 a good deal more attention than accompanied its birth. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, reminded us of this. That Bill was brought forward at a time of some national tension to deal primarily with other matters, and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0346"/>
<col>675</col>
Section 2 was barely discussed in the parliamentary debates of the time. All I can say, having sat through a lengthy as well as an interesting debate, is that your Lordships have already shown today that this House is not going to be so remiss on this occasion.<lb/>
If the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor describes the Bill as highly technical, your Lordships can guess my state of mind in attempting to make my own way through the provisions of each clause. I suspect that in some cases there has been an expectation that the replacement of Section 2 would involve the substitution of a provision not substantially more complex. But that simply cannot be. I appreciate that the Bill is complex but this is, I think, the inevitable result of seeking to do what many of us are agreed must be done; namely, to define precisely the circumstances in which the disclosure of official information should be penalised. The brevity of Section 2 is in some respects the consequence of the breadth of its scope, and because we are not being so sweeping in this Bill the fact of the matter is that we cannot be so brief.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, both at the beginning and at the end of this debate have, I think it is fair to say, made clear their unease with Section 2 but have linked their expressions of concern with a wish to know more about what are the present Government's views on, if I may use shorthand, open government.<lb/>
This Bill is not, as my noble and learned friend made clear, about freedom of information or open government. The Government's view is that legislation is not the only way to achieve greater openness in Government, and in saying that I am encouraged by the speeches which were made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, and my noble friend Lord Derwent. As a Government we have made clear our policy in another place&#x2014;to make as much information as possible available, including background papers and analytical studies relevant to major policy decisions. This policy amounts to a reaffirmation of the directive promulgated to Departments in July of 1977 by the then head of the Home Civil
<col>676</col>
Service. I will not go on about that because we are at the end of a long debate, but I will add one other point on this subject. In addition to that the Government believe that the reforms of the Select Committee system which the House of Commons has recently decided will provide a very important contribution to greater openness in government of a kind which accords with our parliamentary and constitutional arrangements.<lb/>
Starting with the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, several noble Lords have, I admit, criticised the Bill as being more restrictive in the sense that it will create&#x2014;so noble Lords have asserted&#x2014;a situation which is more restrictive than the present situation under Section 2. I should like to reply by looking at Clause 4, the offence of the ordinary citizen. After all, this clause gives the citizen a degree of protection that Clauses 2 and 3 do not afford to the Crown servant or Government contractor. The essential point is that in the case of the citizen the prosecution have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused appreciated that the information he disclosed was protected under the Act, and that of course is a stiffer test than what is proposed for Crown servants and Government contractors.<lb/>
So what we are talking about in this Bill is the case of a citizen, and I realise that in talking about the citizen many of your Lordships have been speaking of representatives of the Press. But we are talking about a citizen who discloses information otherwise than in accordance with an official authorisation and fully appreciating that it is both in a protected category and is official information. I really do not think that that can fall into the category of having an axe falling unpredictably on the head of somebody, as the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, described the effect of the Bill.<lb/>
I realise also from speeches which your Lordships have made that some of your Lordships feel that it is oppressive to cast the definition of security or intelligence so wide that a citizen who discloses even trivial information about these matters is liable to conviction and a sentence of two years' imprisonment. The fact is that there are certain areas where the safeguarding of the nation's interests is essential. The previous Administration
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0347"/>
<col>677</col>
recognised in its White Paper of July of last year, at paragraph 31, that despite the view of the Franks Committee of this particular point, information relating to security and intelligence was deserving of the highest protection, whether or not it met the test that its unauthorised disclosure would be likely to cause serious injury to our national interests. I trust that noble Lords opposite remain of the same view. I might add that I do not sense that those who criticise this overall coverage of security or intelligence matters are likely to complain at the similar protection that we propose to extend to the confidences of the citizen.<lb/>
I now move on to Clause 7 which, again from the Opposition Front Bench, was raised, I think, in both the opening and the closing speeches. It provides the defence in the case of material in the law and order, foreign, commercial and personal confidences, that the information was previously available to the public. Noble Lords have raised the possibility of extending this defence to other categories of information: defence and international relations, security and intelligence and intercepts. Clearly there are arguments both ways on this and I realise that different views are held. For what it is worth my own view is that the difference in kind between these types of information justifies the selective approach that we propose. But if your Lordships give the Bill a Second Reading then in Committee we shall be able to examine the matter more deeply. In the meantime we shall certainly consider the points which have been made.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, raised a specific point on this clause which confers a defence in relation to information protected by Clause 1(1) sub-paragraphs (<i>c</i>), (<i>e</i>) or (<i>f</i>), the noble and learned Lord asking that the information having already been made available to the public, or to a section of it, should mean that it had been made officially available. The answer to the noble and learned Lord's question is, No. So long as information is available it does not matter how it became so&#x2014;whether officially or not. That is, as the Bill is drafted.<lb/>
I turn for a moment to the question of classification, which several of your Lordships have raised. The Bill provides, in
<col>678</col>
Clauses 12 and 13, for the classification of material in the defence and international relations categories and I realise that I am speaking to noble Lords&#x2014;and to the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, in particular&#x2014;who have immense experience in this field. But I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I say that the point made by the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, bears repeating&#x2014;the fact that new material is classified and marked as such, under this Bill has no direct bearing on the offences. However, classification markings will have the dual purpose of warning those handling the material that it is protected and, in consequence, of providing evidence in a subsequent prosecution bearing on the issue, whether the accused appreciated that the material was protected or not.<lb/>
Many of your Lordships referred to the regulation&#x2014;making power to be found in this part of the Bill. The regulations provided for here will set out the general system and provide for the appropriate delegation of levels of decision-making on classification. These are supposed to be enabling powers and will clearly take into account any views which your Lordships have been expressing and will express, and particularly the views of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy, who expressed particular interest in the future classification. Clearly a Minister must remain the final arbiter in these matters, but he cannot himself classify all the papers in his department and this regulation-making power is supposed to take care of that.<lb/>
I now move from that to the certificate issuing power of a Minister. There were many points made on this and I will go to the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson. The noble Lord made many points and, if he will forgive me, I am not going to try to answer them, but on this one I should like to take issue with the noble Lord when he implied that the Minister will issue a certificate without reviewing the whole circumstances of a case. On this point our proposals in Clause 8 are exactly in line with Franks. Of course the Minister will review the circumstances of a case before issuing a certificate, just as Franks intended. We are not proposing to protect information by reference to its classification, so it is the nature of the information, rather than its classification, that the Minister must
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0348"/>
<col>679</col>
consider. This technical point apart, what we propose is actually what Franks recommended and it is precisely, of course, what was recommended in the previous Government's White Paper.<lb/>
Many of your Lordships, not least my noble friend Lady Hornsby-Smith, have put points to me which should be replied to, but I really think it might he your Lordships' wish that we should draw the debate to a close, provided I give a genuine undertaking that the points will be looked at most carefully. However, there are two points which I think I must reply to. First, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gardiner, asked me a direct question about the definition of the expression "security or intelligence" which is to be found printed in Clause 1 (1) (<i>b</i>). As the noble and learned Lord will have noticed, of course this is defined in Clause 14 under the definition of "security or intelligence". If the noble and learned Lord wishes me to add anything to that definition which is to be found in Clause 14, the only words I can give him are that the definition means Her Majesty's foreign and other secret services and Government communications headquarters.<lb/>
Finally, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy summarised succinctly the Franks argument that Cabinet papers should be protected because of the Cabinet's special role in Government. All I can say on this is that we and the previous Government concluded that this would be drawing the field too wide. Of course, Cabinet papers will be protected if their subject matter justifies this&#x2014;for instance, defence&#x2014;but, for the rest, as I think my noble and learned friend said far better than I can, it seems best to rely on the judgment of Ministers and on disciplinary sanctions. I sense that the House would feel any other approach to be unnecessarily restrictive, and I hope I shall be allowed some credit for one point on which, quite clearly, we are taking a rather more liberal line.</membercontribution></p>

papers. My point was protecting the information that a Minister or Ministers had been in a minority against an important decision announced by the Government, but I was not concerned to protect Cabinet papers as a whole.</membercontribution></p>

My Lords, this debate has, I think, underlined a large measure of agreement that certainly Section 2 really has got to go. I must confess that I had expected to hear views expressed in rather more ringing tones that the proposals of the Franks Committee provided a sure basis for the making of new law. I believe, speaking on behalf of the Government, that if this Bill receives a Second Reading, in Committee your Lordships will find that it in fact provides improvements on some of the Franks proposals; and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Boston, was good enough to suggest this in certain respects. I am sure it should replace Section 2, for which the case for abolition is I think absolutely overwhelming. On those grounds, I ask your Lordships to agree that the Bill should now be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE STEEL INDUSTRY IN<lb/>SCOTLAND</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01527">6.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01528"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make a Statement about the serious situation facing the steel industry in Scotland which has arisen because of inability to use the iron ore terminal opened at Hunterston five months ago. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. I am asking the Government whether they will comment on the serious situation which has arisen in the main steel-making area in Scotland, that is Ravenscraig, at Motherwell. As part of modernisation and improving efficiency the iron ore terminal on the coast at Hunterston has been constructed. It was completed and formally opened five months ago, but it is still not in use. Iron ore has had to be brought up the Clyde in small vessels to general terminus quay, and it is estimated that about &#x00A3;1 million a week has been lost by the British Steel Corporation as a result. Fortuitously, the subject now being raised in this House is reaching a stage of positive progress, judging from the news over the weekend. The Minister who is replying this evening, my noble friend Lord Trenchard, may be able to inform us on the very latest developments. I do not press the Government to make a Statement this evening on this matter. I do recognise that there are still decisions to be taken. In particular, it seems the Government are being asked to designate Hunterston for the purposes of a dock labour scheme. So that large progress appears to have been made but a settlement has not yet been completed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01529">At the outset, my Lords, I must make it clear that it is my intention to avoid any interference in the dispute between the two large unions representing the transport and steel workers respectively which has unfortunately prevented the manning of the terminal, involving about 60 jobs, and so caused the delay. I am well aware of the case which each union has been defending; I am well aware of the principles they each seek to protect and the importance which they attach to them. I respect the purpose of both unions. I shall not be taking sides;
<col>682</col>
indeed, I would find it very difficult to choose if I was compelled to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01530">What I aim to do tonight is to draw attention to the disproportionate amount of damage that can be done to our country's economy and to employment prospects by situations of this kind. We must surely find ways of solving these problems without severely wounding ourselves in the process, because with modernisation and technology, similar situations are likely to arise in the future, and in other industries besides the steel industry. Through one pair of eyes the circumstances at Hunterston can be seen simply as an extension of a salt water jetty to a steelworks. Through other eyes they may be seen as the beginnings of a port. The weekend news indicated that the TUC and the unions concerned worked for many hours on Saturday, the day before yesterday, and for all I know into the early hours of Sunday, to reach the basis of an agreement. These efforts are to be warmly applauded. It is in that spirit, I suggest, that such problems should be tackled in future, and I hope at an earlier stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01531">In the present case, although the apparent deadlock has been reported from time to time during the last five months, too few members of the public seemed to be aware of how much was at risk; too few, certainly in Scotland, realised that the industrial projects at stake were ones which most of Scotland heard about at the times in the past when they were first considered. They were projects being pressed by the bodies representing industry in Scotland, by the trade unions in Scotland and by other bodies concerned with Scotland's economic wellbeing. Those projects had been in the headlines at those times.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01532">My Lords, let us first consider Ravenscraig. In 1958, after weeks of controversy, campaigning and canvassing for competing sites in different parts of the United Kingdom, it was decided that a strip mill should be built at Motherwell. Many Scots had felt that this was important because industry in Scotland had during the controversy expressed strong views publicly on the need to retain substantial steel-making capacity in Scotland. The Scottish Trades Union Congress along with many other Scottish organisations, as I recall those days, were
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0350"/>
<col>683</col>
wholly in favour. There was a general welcome, therefore, in Scotland, in the headlines as much as anywhere else, for the decision when it was announced in 1958. I know that some people with special knowledge of the steel industry were less than enthusiastic with that decision and thought it was political. None the less Scotland was given the benefit of any doubts in that decision and there was much rejoicing North of the Border as a result.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01533">Later, in 1972, when the reorganisation of the British steel industry had to be carried out, the special position of Ravenscraig was underlined publicly with great emphasis, and as a result it became one of the few centres selected for the concentrated modernisation of steel-making in the United Kingdom. Millions of pounds were allocated to its further development, again to the acclamation of the Press and public in Scotland. This is the same Ravenscraig, the very same steelworks, now dependent on the new ore terminal, and the same steelworks that has consequently been threatened by months of delay. Indeed, the British Steel Corporation announced a few weeks ago that it would soon have to suspend operations there if a settlement could not be reached. That would have meant 9,000 jobs directly threatened, and I am sure many too indirectly threatened in that area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01534">I turn to Hunterston. It became clear in the late 1960s that a terminal in the deep sheltered water there would improve Ravenscraig's efficiency. In particular it would make use of the trend to large ships, to ore carriers; and that trend has indeed continued since. Because it is in an area of considerable beauty and amenity in the Firth of Clyde, a public inquiry was held which included other proposals also for Hunterston.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01535">The Reporter&#x2014;and I should explain that that is the name given North of the Border to the official who is an Inspector in England and Wales&#x2014;submitted his recommendation in 1970. In December of that year the Secretary of State, acting within the strict requirements of the Planning Acts, accepted the Reporter's recommendation that the ore terminal could go ahead. There were, as I have mentioned, local objections to any indus-
<col>684</col>
trial development at that location, which were understandable. But the decision received a wide welcome in Scotland as again providing another opportunity for the modernisation of a flourishing Scottish steel industry with the good effects expected for the users of steel and other industries in Scotland. The Reporter had recommended that the ore terminal go ahead, although he did recommend against certain other proposals at the inquiry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01536">There is in Scotland a particular organisation which works to achieve the best economic conditions; I refer to the Scottish Council for Industry and Development. Membership includes industrialists, businessmen, trade unionists and university staff. The Scottish Council had been advocating use of this deep water resource and was understandably pleased with the decisions being taken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01537">Earlier in 1970 a report had been published, which the Scottish Council had commissioned, under the supervision of Sir William Lithgow, of the shipbuilding firm Scott, Lithgow, and Professor Nicoll of Strathclyde University. That report was called <i>Oceanspan</i> and it presented a development strategy for increasing the maritime resources of Scotland, especially where deep-water berthing was possible. It rightly caught the imagination of many in Scotland nine years ago, in addition to those concerned with trade and industry in their daily lives. The Hunterston ore terminal project fitted neatly into that strategy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01538">I am very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Newton, with all his experience, is to speak after me. I know that at least two noble Lords on the Labour Benches would have been here and would probably have contributed from their participation and interest in these matters in the past. Unfortunately, they cannot be available in London today. I hope that the five months' delay really is now at an end and that it has not mortally wounded the Ravenscraig steelworks. I applaud again the special efforts made in the last few days by the TUC, and I should like to give encouragement to all who are still engaged in getting the ore terminal manned and in action as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01539">I have reminded the House that the projects at Ravenscraig and Hunterston have been regarded in the past as important
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0351"/>
<col>685</col>
at the times when they were being decided upon. It should accordingly be appreciated how much has been at risk during these last five months. If anything is to be gained from this sad experience, let it be a determination to settle these matters in good time before new plant or new methods come into operation in similar circumstances, when they occur in other places in our country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01540">7.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01541"><member>Lord LEE of NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that we all join the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, in hoping that this long delay is now coming to an end. I do not disagree with most of what the noble Lord has said to us. He has concentrated on Scottish steel, but it is true to say that throughout the world steel industries are in dire trouble. Indeed, if that which the economists tell us comes about and we are going into an even deeper recession, those steel industries will be among the first to feel the effects of such a recession.<lb/>
Indeed, when one looks at the situation in Scotland, there are very few industries that are not in trouble and that is most disappointing when one thinks of the huge sums which have been invested in Scotland as a result of development area policy. One wonders what would have happened there if those sums had not been invested in years gone by.<lb/>
The noble Lord reminded us that this is essentially a demarcation dispute. They are always an extremely difficult type of dispute for us to cope with. In recent years we have managed to eliminate a great many of them. The noble Lord knows as well as I the situation of the shipbuilding industry&#x2014;an industry which at one time used to have a great number of "who drills the hole?" type of disputes. The reason we very rarely hear of any demarcation disputes now in that industry, is that the two principal unions managed to amalgamate and we do not find demarcation disputes existing within one union&#x2014;at least, not as a rule. That was a great advance in eliminating demarcation disputes in the shipbuilding industry.<lb/>
I am glad that the noble Lord did not blame altogether the two unions concerned in the Hunterston dispute. I think he said that if he had to take a decision as to where to lay the blame he would not know which
<col>686</col>
to choose&#x2014;and nor would I. That is common ground. The last thing that I hope any of us would charge them with is either having a type of Luddite mentality or simply being bloody-minded.<lb/>
It is the case that the steel industry has a very good record indeed as regards the solution to the problems of that industry. The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation can be very proud of its record, especially when we look at the problems that it has had in the last few years, and the problems which face it now.<lb/>
The trouble is that there is no way in which we can solve this problem by amalgamation. We have here one union which is concerned specifically with the steel industry.<lb/>
The other union is a general workers' union which spreads over a great many of our industries. There is no basis upon which we can solve that. Indeed, I think I have said a few times in this House that we suffer from the fact that we pioneered trade unionism in Britain. The modern concept of how to solve many of these problems is by industrial unionism in which we have one union for one industry. It is ironic when we think of the fact that the most strike-free industries in Europe are to be found in Germany and that it was the TUC which did the groundwork to put that country on its feet as regards trade unionism. If we could start from scratch, we would do precisely the same as they do.<lb/>
It is also the case that if we look at the problems of these two unions, we find that both the steelworkers and the dockers have lost a vast number of jobs in the last few years. That is quite inevitable with the march of progress. But when one looks at why they are so keen about this kind of issue, one must look first at the fact that both of them have seen their numbers diminish rapidly and that in Scotland as a whole, and certainly in the Clyde area, there is precious little alternative if one loses one's job in one's industry. It is a very great problem for people who see their jobs in danger of disappearing and who know perfectly well that, if they are one of the unlucky ones, there is not much hope of getting another.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, mentioned the activities of the TUC Steel Committee. I join with the noble
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0352"/>
<col>687</col>
Lord in congratulating that committee upon the work it has done. I shall not go into all the details, because it is fairly well known that it wants to allocate certain types of jobs to the dockers and certain types of jobs at Hunterston to the steelworkers. I know that this will present the Government with certain problems, including the problem of scheduling and those connected with the Dock Work Regulation Act.<lb/>
As I understand it, there are fears that if the Government agree to the kind of thing which the TUC are suggesting, other ports may well ask for the same facilities. I hope that the Government will not allow that to prevent a settlement being reached at Hunterston. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, gave a graphic description of what will happen if we do not reach a settlement now. Ravenscraig itself is in danger; 9,000 jobs could go. I do not want to go into the history of Ravenscraig and whether or not it should ever have been built; as the noble Lord knows, the experts in steel differed on that. That is water under the bridge. Nine thousand jobs are in danger there. Because of the problems in the steel industry, particularly at Corby, where some 6,000 people are threatened with redundancy, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation is thinking in terms of taking industrial action. If that industrial action comes about&#x2014;and I hope it will not&#x2014;it will certainly affect the future of Ravenscraig.<lb/>
I have a feeling that the British Steel Corporation is trying to progress too rapidly. I had a great deal to do with the creation of that British steel agency and I know perfectly well how keen it is to become viable. But to believe that, at a time of world recession, when orders are not available, you can have a huge industry and that you can say, "Next year we must break even on profitability", is the wrong approach by the BSC. Indeed, if the Government are saying to the BSC that they must break even next year, the Government are also wrong.<lb/>
The alternatives to the kind of settlement which we are discussing at Hunterston, and therefore at Ravenscraig, are too shocking to allow us to play about with small issues. The people of Scotland are entitled to feel that, now that the TUC have found some means of a solution to the
<col>688</col>
Hunterston issue, the Government must not stand on ceremony and must not argue about whether or not the dockers will be registered. To me that would be very wrong indeed.<lb/>
I, therefore, join the noble Lord in hoping that we are at the end of what has been a very difficult issue indeed. The noble Lord told us that we must find a way to solve these disputes before they hurt us so badly, and I join with him in that. I have suggested that where there is this kind of dispute and there is a possibility of amalgamation of the unions, that is the answer. I have tried to point out that that solution is not available at Hunterston. Therefore, we must consider that the solutions which have been successful in other areas and industries are not available there. I hope that the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, will inform his right honourable friend that we in this House are extremely concerned about the future of Hunterston, that we want the unions concerned to reach agreement, and that we do not want to see a huge capital investment wasted as it has been wasted so far. We cannot see any future in using the old methods of bringing in ores, with the huge on-cost that that means when it is handled. That is no good. If we are to live in this world, we must use modern methods. As I have tried to point out, the trade unions concerned have in many respects met that position. I appeal to the noble Viscount to ask the Government not to stand on what I consider to be comparatively minor issues as against the huge problem which faces the people of Scotland. If his right honourable friend has not yet taken a decision on this, I hope he will tell him that this House is of the opinion that he should agree to the settlement proposed by the TUC.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01542">7.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01543"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of INDUSTRY (Viscount Trenchard)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the opportunity provided by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy to say a few words on the very difficult position of the Scottish steel industry. I am afraid that I shall not satisfy either him or the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Newton, in the amount that I am able to say at the moment in relation to the proposed settlement which the TUC negotiated. I appreciate all
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0353"/>
<col>689</col>
that they have both said about the appalling consequences of the current situation and the hope that they have both expressed that the current situation may be nearly at an end.<lb/>
All I can say at this stage is that I welcome the agreement reached between the TGWU and the ISTC on Saturday under TUC auspices about manning arrangements at the terminal. This is, of course, the issue which has so far stood in the way of bringing the terminal into operation. As has been said, the General Secretary of the TUC has written to the Secretary of State for Employment setting out that agreement and asking him to confirm that it is his intention to initiate the appropriate procedures for Hunterston to be designated a steel port. I understand that Mr. Prior started a meeting with the trade unions concerned at 6 p.m. tonight, so the noble Lord will appreciate that my right honourable friend has not delayed in any way in trying to settle this issue. I have to point out, as indeed the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Newton, recognised, that this designation, or proposed designation, of Hunterston as a scheme port raises some wider issues, and I believe that he recognised that. I have to say to him that I feel he may have swept them slightly on one side. I do not in any way want to intimate by saying that that my right honourable friend may not be able to reach a method of accepting, or accepting in some form, the TUC agreement; but I do not think you can totally sweep issues which affect another major troubled area in our economy on one side and say, "Don't let this issue be affected by detail". I hope that we will now see a settlement of this vexed issue, but do not let us underestimate some of the wider issues that the settlement now proposed involves.<lb/>
I understand only too well the feelings of all those who have worked long and hard to try to design a new future for a major Scottish steel industry. My noble friend has outlined very clearly the steps, starting in 1958 which led to the creation of the over &#x00A3;200 million Ravenscraig investment which doubles their capacity for steelmaking, or the nearly &#x00A3;100 million investment in the Hunterston terminal, which is essential to its use. I think perhaps he has not mentioned his own important part in those many negotiations and discussions in the past.<lb/>
<col>690</col>
He drew my attention to the Clyde Port Authority Bill in 1973. I became aware on reading it of the enormous strength of the environmental case. As a boy I used to collect mussels and unsuspecting limpets off the rocks at Fairlie, so I well understand the feelings of the environmental lobby about the development of Hunterston. However, all that was overcome with the support of all the parties, which my noble friend has mentioned. Or we hope it has been overcome, because for six months, as has been said, the whole of this grand design has been held up. As has also been said, and as was said by British Steel Corporation in a Press notice recently, the cause does not lie in any dispute between BSC and its employees; it lies in an inter-union dispute between the members of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the Transport and General Workers concerning the arrangements for manning some 60 jobs at the terminal.<lb/>
I am informed that British Steel explored all possible ways of preventing this dispute affecting the Ravenscraig situation, but they came to a conclusion&#x2014;and nobody has been able to suggest any other adequate conclusion&#x2014;that neither in cost nor in quality, nor in quantity, because Ravenscraig was designed to double production in Scotland, was there any way that they could keep Ravenscraig going past the end of November if the Hunterston situation is not solved. So we hope very much tonight that all is not still at risk.<lb/>
Like my noble friend, and like the noble Lord, Lord Lee, I do not wish to go into the rights or wrongs of the dispute of the two parties. Furthermore, I think I understand from my industrial background the important humane points that the noble Lord, Lord Lee, made, particularly about the problems of declining industries. But I have to ask him and the House: can we, in our present economic situation, afford these kinds of demarcation disputes affecting 60 people and lasting for so long? One has to say to him that whatever the difficulties of organisation, this surely had to be solved earlier.<lb/>
He has mentioned the crisis facing the steel industry. I recently returned from Germany, and while he is of course right that there are major problems for steel
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0354"/>
<col>691</col>
production the world over, the situation, due now to the fast adoption of new methods in Germany, is picking up faster there than in this country. How can we strengthen the appeal not only to those involved in this dispute, which may, we hope, be over very soon, that in the country's present condition we really cannot afford losses which the Scottish division of British Steel had in 1978&#x2013;79 of &#x00A3;83 million, and &#x00A3;20&#x00B7;8 million in the first quarter of this year? What the figure will prove to be&#x2014;my noble friend has suggested &#x00A3;1 million a week as being lost&#x2014;in the second and third quarters we have yet to see, with some degree of horror.<lb/>
My Lords, I hope you will not feel that I am being controversial in an area where we need to appeal to people's better nature about the overriding needs to face up to the economic facts of life, but I think I have to take the opportunity to say that the Government have been accused of excessive cuts, which, as we have sought to point out, are not really cuts but an effort to stabilise as a whole the public sector until the retracting wealth-creating sector stops retracting and starts to increase again. We have been criticised for undermining a compassionate and caring society with these cuts, and with other measures, to try to stabilise the total expenditure in the public sector. How much compassion and care could have been provided with the extra public money that has had to be found in these last six months! A policy of caring and compassion exercised by a bankrupt State, which is what we were heading for, is I believe about as useful for those in need of compassion and care as&#x2014;and with the need to observe the decorum of this House I must use a Latin term&#x2014;a sparrow's passing <i>flatus;</i> I understand that is the medical description for the noisy puff of wind that a sparrow which has eaten too much might emit.<lb/>
In terms of whatever is necessary to prevent this kind of thing either continuing or occurring at any other time, can we ask people really to understand the basic connection between the adopting of new and efficient techniques in industry, whatever the problems of a human nature, and our ability to improve what have become very inadequate social services generally?<lb/>
<col>692</col>
Again, I wish to thank the two noble Lords who have contributed to this discussion and echo with them the hope that very soon we shall see Hunterston and Ravenscraig in full and more economic production.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01552">Whether their review into the desirability and practicality of ceasing the authentication of negative certificates of origin has been completed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01553"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member>: The Government have now consulted the organisations directly concerned with the authentication of negative certificates of origin.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01554">None of those consulted approve of the boycott or of the requirement for negative certificates of origin which is one aspect of it. However there was a consensus of opinion among those organisations in-
<col>694</col>
volved with trade to the Arab countries that if the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ceased authentication of signatures on negative certificates of origin there would be an unacceptable risk to British exports. The Government agree with this view. We have therefore concluded that in these circumstances it would be against British interests to discontinue the practice of authentication.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01555">The main reason advanced by the Select Committee of the House of Lords for discontinuing this practice was that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office thereby gave the impression of condoning the content of the negative certificate. The Government do not condone the boycott. As has been stated on a number of occasions, it is the attesting signature on the document not the document itself which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is authenticating. We accept that there is a case for making this absolutely clear, and an explanation to this effect is now being attached to each FCO authentication certificate. We believe that this explanation meets the main objection raised by the Select Committee to the process of authentication, without incurring unacceptable damage to British trading interests.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01561">To ask Her Majesty's Government what savings in energy consumption and expenditure they would expect to arise from a programme of insulation of factories equivalent to the incentives relating to private sector housing under the Homes Insulation Act 1978.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01562"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of DEFENCE (Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Homes Insulation Scheme provides for the payment of percentage grants subject to a maximum related to the cost of installing basic insulation in an average dwelling. An equivalent scheme for factories is therefore not a real option, in view of the great diversity of both size and construction among industrial buildings. As I am sure the noble Baroness knows, grants for insulating industrial and commercial premises are already available under the Energy Conservation Scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01563"><member>Baroness VICKERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I thank my noble friend for that reply, I should like to ask how the factories are progressing and whether they are taking advantage of this scheme.

<title>BAIL ETC. (SCOTLAND) BILL</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01593">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01594"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, SCOTTISH OFFICE (The Earl of Mansfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bail etc. (Scotland) Bill forms an essential part of the major reform of Scottish criminal justice which the Government propose for this Session. The Government intend before the end of the year to introduce the substantial measure on Scottish criminal justice which was promised in Her Majesty's gracious Speech. However, we have brought forward as a matter of urgency this short but much-needed measure&#x2014;the Bail etc. (Scotland) Bill&#x2014;to deal with the acute staffing problems associated with Saturday courts and to reform the bail system.<lb/>
The association of these two items may not be immediately obvious. The abolition of mandatory court sittings on Saturdays will lead to substantial savings in money and other resources but, as it could by itself lead to more people spending time in custody over the weekend if arrested on a Friday, it is clearly desirable to legislate at the same time on the system of release on bail in Scotland which the Government had in any case intended to reform substantially and in a way which should greatly reduce the numbers of those held unnecessarily in custody awaiting trial on a first appearance in court. I should stress that while the need to abolish mandatory Saturday courts was the reason for our promoting this Bill in advance of the more comprehensive criminal justice package, it is the reform of the bail system in Scotland which is significant.<lb/>
This Bill therefore is modest in scope, but we believe that it will greatly improve the working of the criminal justice system in Scotland, making it more efficient and humane. Although some misgivings have been expressed about how some provisions in the Bill might operate in practice, it has generally been welcomed and,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0359"/>
<col>701</col>
indeed, when the previous Government addressed themselves to the same problems in their own Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, very similar provisions were proposed.<lb/>
The very full and thorough reports of the Committee on Criminal Procedure in Scotland under the chairmanship of the late Lord Thomson provide the basis for the reform of criminal justice in Scotland, and this Bill draws very heavily on the recommendations of that committee, although we have taken the opportunity to reflect on and, I believe, even improve on its recommendations.<lb/>
The Government believe that our present system of bail in Scotland is most unsatisfactory, in that it does not fully achieve its principal aim of avoiding unnecessary pre-trial imprisonment. Clauses 1 to 9 of the Bill therefore provide for the abolition of money bail and the institution of a new system of release on conditions. Only in exceptional circumstances&#x2014;where the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to the special circumstances of the case in question&#x2014;can a deposit of money be required as a condition of hail. I should stress the significance of this to those who are more expert in the criminal law of England. Indeed, in parenthesis to those noble Lords who may be accustomed to sitting on the benches of the magistrates' courts in England, may I say that this Bill is a fascinating little cameo of the different conditions and indeed philosophy of the Scottish legal system compared to that which obtains in England.<lb/>
In Scotland the only way of obtaining release on bail at present (assuming that the court has granted bail in principle) has been to pay over the sum of money fixed by the court. It is not possible to obtain release on the promise to pay if the accused fails to appear, nor on a surety being offered by a third party. This Bill will change all that and a system of conditions&#x2014;but not recognizances&#x2014;will become the basis of release on bail in Scotland. Failure to appear at any diet of which the accused is given due notice and breach of any conditions are to be statutory offences. At present in Scotland the only penalty for failure to appear is the loss of the comparatively small sum paid into court to secure release. The new Bill is therefore intended to make
<col>702</col>
the bail system more humane by making bail more accessible to those who are granted it. It is also intended to make it more effective by providing more severe punishments for those who do breach bail.<lb/>
The Thomson Committee's conclusion was that the accused's need to find money bail prevents his being released in many cases, at least in the first instance; and has no significant effect on the likelihood of his appearing at subsequent proceedings. Moreover, a very great deal of work is involved for the courts in collecting and accounting for the money involved. The conclusions reached by the committee were underlined by a Scottish Office Social Research Study on Pre-Trial Bail and Custody, which was published in 1976. That study drew on information about bail which was granted between February 1972 and January 1973 but there is nothing to suggest that the passage of time has cast doubt on its general conclusions. In that period the most common amount set for bail was &#x00A3;10 although there was a range extending from 50p to &#x00A3;1,000. The average amount fixed as bail was only about &#x00A3;14. Even in the period of the study these sums were relatively small, but more than a quarter (that is, 27 per cent.) of those granted bail were unable to deposit the money required immediately and were held in custody for at least part of the time between the grant of bail and the eventual trial. Nearly 2 per cent. of those granted bail could not find the money at all and spent the full time before the trial in custody.<lb/>
This extension of imprisonment might arguably be justified if the money deposited was a guarantee that the accused would turn up in court, but the study also found that the amount of bail fixed appeared to have no significant effect in deterring those granted bail from absconding. I would remind the House that loss of bail money is the only penalty at present for breach of bail. The most common amount fixed for those who subsequently absconded&#x2014;that is &#x00A3;10&#x2014;was exactly the same as that for those who did not. Moreover, there was no more than a marginal and statistically insignificant difference between the average amount of bail fixed for those who subsequently absconded and the average amount fixed for those who neither absconded nor re-offended while on bail.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0360"/>
<col>703</col>
A court is concerned with protecting the public and safeguarding the interests of justice from any undesirable consequences of an accused person being at large, and not merely with preventing the accused absconding before trial or avoiding his unnecessary detention. Under the present system of bail in Scotland, the fairly small amounts of bail set are designed only to ensure that the accused presents himself for trial when required. This Bill provides however that the conditions which may be imposed should be such as to seek to ensure not only that the accused appears at diets of which he is given due notice but also that he does not commit an offence while on bail; that he does not interfere with witnesses or obstruct the course of justice in his own case or anyone else's; and that he makes himself available for any necessary inquiries. It is therefore a much more subtle and effective instrument for securing the aims of justice while the accused is at liberty pending trial. The Bill itself does not lay down the conditions which the court may impose to achieve these ends; nor is it the practice in Scotland for the Crown or the Government to attempt to give guidance of this sort to judges. We might however reasonably imagine that a court might require an accused to hand over his passport or stay away from a particular area, place or person.<lb/>
As I have said the only penalty for breach of bail at present is the loss of the relatively trivial sum paid into court. This Bill will make much more severe penalties available for the relatively serious offence of failure to turn up or breach of bail conditions. Thus an accused who absconds or breaches the conditions imposed on bail will be liable to a fine of up to &#x00A3;200; and to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 60 days where he is tried in a district court, or up to three months when he appears before a sheriff or in the High Court. In view of the considerable expense and inconvenience arising from the failure of an accused to turn up for trial under solemn proceedings, the penalties in such a case are even more severe. An accused granted bail in relation to solemn proceedings who fails without reasonable excuse to appear at any solemn diet of which he has been given due notice will be liable on con
<col>704</col>
viction on indictment to a fine of unlimited amount and a period of imprisonment of up to two years, in addition to any penalty he may have incurred for his original offence.<lb/>
The more extensive and yet specific aims of bail set out in the Bill and the power to impose conditions with enhanced penalties for breach of the law should give courts much more confidence that bail will not be abused. The Bill will, we hope, therefore lead to courts using bail more readily to release the accused before trial. Similar arguments apply also to police liberation and this should reduce the number of people who, though later acquitted or given non-custodial sentences, nevertheless at present spend some time in custody before they are tried. In any event, and we attach the greatest importance to this, the abolition of money bail is likely to lead to a reduction of over 2,000 a year in the number of needless committals to custody from the sheriff courts alone. I would emphasise that this minimal figure only includes those held in custody after bail has been granted until they deposit the sum of money required, and only from sheriff courts.<lb/>
Our only significant departure from the Thomson Committee recommendations is that we are leaving open the possibility of the courts' requiring a deposit of money as a condition of bail in very special circumstances. Even the committee did not go so far as to suggest that there were no circumstances in which a requirement to deposit money would be useful and we believe there are cases where such a requirement might be appropriate. We have therefore included that option for the courts, although not for police liberation. The sort of cases we have in mind are, for example, major frauds, offences against fishing regulations by foreign skippers where large amounts of money are at issue and offences by people with substantial financial assets who lack strong roots in this country.<lb/>
As I have said, only the courts will have the power to impose a requirement for a deposit of money, and only then if they are satisfied that the imposition of that condition is appropriate to the special circumstances of the case. I should also stress that any requirement to deposit money will be imposed as one of the conditions of release and will thus fit
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0361"/>
<col>705</col>
into the framework of the new system. In particular, such a requirement, like any other condition of bail, would be subject to appeal by both Crown and accused. We do not expect, therefore, that this power will be used often and never, we would hope, for small amounts of money. I can understand the fears of those who argue that the essential conservatism of the legal system will lead to continuation of money bail under a new name but I am sure that these fears are unfounded. This Bill simply leaves open the option of requiring a deposit of money where this is peculiarly appropriate, and we are confident that it will not be abused.<lb/>
Another important aspect of the bail package is that the power of the police to release on interim liberation is being extended. At present the police may only liberate on the deposit of money and that is being abolished in parallel with the abolition of bail money itself. Moreover, the police are being given power to liberate those charged with any offence triable in the summary courts where at present they are only entitled to liberate those charged with offences triable in the district court, a much more restricted category.<lb/>
Noble Lords might find it helpful if I were to outline the purpose served by the various clauses in the Bill. However, bearing in mind that the only noble and learned Lord down to speak is the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, I feel that I can shorten my remarks to that extent, because he will appreciate perfectly well, I have no doubt, what the clauses mean.<lb/>
In conclusion, I should say a little about the provision on court sittings. Clause 10 provides that courts are no longer under a statutory obligation to sit on Saturdays. There are now acute difficulties in persuading court and fiscal support staff to work the unsocial hours which are necessary if Saturday court sittings are held. There are also problems over recruitment, given that most comparable clerical and typing jobs enjoy a five-day week. It is for these very practical reasons that the Government have concluded that Saturday courts should not in future be mandatory.<lb/>
It will however be possible for courts to sit on a Saturday or, as is not the case
<col>706</col>
at present, on a Sunday if this is deemed necessary, for example, after a riot at a football match. This introduces a desirable element of flexibility. It is, however, not expected that courts will sit on these days other than very infrequently. As I said earlier, the Government believe that the measures being adopted in Clauses 1 to 9 on the reform of bail and in particular the widening of the discretion of the police to grant interim liberation should obviate the risk that the abolition of mandatory Saturday courts might cause an increase in the number of those held in custody before trial.<lb/>
I believe the Bill is a well thought out and useful contribution to the continuing improvement of criminal justice and procedure in Scotland. I hope it will enjoy the support of noble Lords on all sides of the House. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01595">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;<i>(The Earl of Mansfield.)</i></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01597"><member>Lord McCLUSKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since time immemorial noble Ministers of State at the Scottish Office have risen to their feet at the Government Dispatch Box here to move the Second Reading of a Scottish Bill only to be dismayed and disheartened to see noble Lords rise in their hundreds from all parts of the House and pour out of the Chamber as if they had suddenly remembered that they had some pressing engagement elsewhere, and I fear something similar happened today. This phenomenon is not produced by any lack of eloquence or lucidity in the Ministers concerned. They have all been lucid and eloquent, none more so than the noble Earl. It derives, rather, from the comparative lack of interest here in domestic Scottish legal matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01598"><member>Lord DERWENT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I interrupt the noble and learned Lord to tell him that it is simply because of the fright we have of the Scots?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01599"><member>Lord McCLUSKEY</member><membercontribution>: There must be more than one reason for everything, my Lords. I believe the irony of the whole situation is that the apathy of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0362"/>
<col>707</col>
noble Lords about such matters has been matched only by their passion in opposing proposals we introduced in the last Parliament to ensure that such questions were debated not here but by Scots assemblymen in Scotland. None the less, the House will wish me to thank the noble Earl for his careful and helpful exposition of the principles and content of the Bill.<lb/>
Indeed, my pleasure in hearing the noble Earl introducing the Bill is tempered only by my regret that the Government did not give his noble and learned colleague, the Lord Advocate, this excellent opportunity to break his long silence, but we must curb our impatience and hope he will soon have an opportunity to give the House the benefit of his wise advice. Perhaps I should also add that I regret to see from the list of speakers that no one will speak from the Liberal Benches. Now the Liberals are an important party in Scotland and care about these matters, and perhaps the remedy there lies in having a Scottish Liberal lawyer on the Liberal Benches in this House.<lb/>
The Bill itself deserves, I believe, a modest welcome. It has respectable antecedents because it was largely conceived by my colleagues and myself in the last Government. We did a lot of work over a period of years in selecting and drafting a set of proposals for the reform and improvement of criminal justice and procedure in Scotland. But owing to the necessary pressures of the Parliamentary timetable, we had to cannibalise our proposals two Sessions ago and bring forward a small part of them only in the shape of the Community Service by Offenders (Scotland) Bill; that was regarded as urgent. Then our own Criminal Justice Bill, which itself was formed as the result of selecting from several hundred different proposals, fell victim last Session to the General Election. Now the Government have cannibalised another small part of that same Bill and incorporated that in this modest little Bill. One of these days we shall no doubt see the Government's own Criminal Justice Bill for Scotland and I eagerly await some authoritative announcement as to its contents. Indeed, I have put down a Question for Written Answer in the hope of discovering what is proposed.
<col>708</col>
Perhaps I may be allowed to say that I am told that the BBC and the Scottish Press announced in the last few days that. I was an opponent of the Government's. Criminal Justice Bill and would lead, jointly with someone else, a campaign against it. That is not true. I have said no such thing and given no authority for any such statement. In so far as the Government's proposed Bill borrows from the measure which we introduced, I shall support it and invite my colleagues to do the same. In so far as the Government's proposals differ from what we decided upon, I shall examine the new proposals and form my view on their merits. If, for example, the Government should propose to give the police much greater powers than we proposed they should have, then we shall scrutinise these powers carefully, trying to balance the interests of the criminal authorities and the legitimate interests of the citizen. If the Government should propose to reduce the size of the criminal jury in Scotland from 15 to 12, I shall certainly oppose that piece of nonsense, as I did when I was in office. If the Government seek to reintroduce corporal punishment as the present Solicitor-General for Scotland did with the assistance of the present Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Rifkind, earlier this year, I shall certainly oppose that barbarous proposal. But I will not turn coat and oppose proposals of the kind which I myself would have supported had it been my privilege and responsibility to introduce a Criminal Justice Bill in this House.<lb/>
Let me say by way of comfort to the Government in relation to this Bill that one of the problems of preparing a comprehensive Bill is the problem of striking the right balance between measures designed to ensure the easier conviction of the truly guilty and measures designed to protect the legitimate interests of the accused and of those who fall to be punished for their guilt. One result of this process of cannibalisation of which I have spoken is that by the time we come to consider the Criminal Justice Bill which the Government will introduce we shall already have enacted I believe&#x2014;in this Bill and in the Community Service by Offenders Bill&#x2014;some of the measures which were conceived in the interests of accused persons. And it would be quite wrong for me or for anyone else to leave
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0363"/>
<col>709</col>
that out of account in assessing the overall balance of the forthcoming Bill. All three measures must be looked at together as part of one package in order to see whether or not the proper balance has been achieved.<lb/>
This Bill has our general support. Money bail in Scotland without conditions has, we believe, outlived its usefulness. My colleagues in another place opposed the retention in this Bill of a form of money bail&#x2014;your Lordships will find it in Clause 1(3). I will not ask the Government to abandon this provision altogether; it has the support of Her Majesty's judges in Scotland and of a majority in the other place, and I acknowledge that there is a reasoned argument in favour of it. But I will ask the noble Earl, as I do now, to think again about the wording of the last four lines of Clause 1(3). I think this wording will make it too easy for the old-fashioned money bail to survive in cases where it is not now intended to survive.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to the three situations where he envisaged that money bail might continue to be used, and I do not dispute that it would make quite a useful contribution to the courts' techniques in relation to such cases, but I think there is a danger that if the words are not sufficiently tight, other cases may be drawn in. I shall ask the Government to consider adding other words or altering the existing words so that in that subsection something of this sort might appear:
<quote>"but only where the court, or as the case may be, the Lord Advocate, is satisfied that the imposition of such condition is the only course appropriate to the special circumstances of the case, and the accused agrees to the requirement".</quote>
Such wording would, I believe, restrict this requirement to the kind of case the noble Earl mentioned and the kind of case the Government have in mind, and effectively prevent the courts from slipping back into the too ready requirement of money bail.<lb/>
Secondly, I believe that the penalty of two years' imprisonment&#x2014;and let me repeat that: two years' imprisonment&#x2014;introduced by paragraph <i>(b)</i> of Clause 3(3) of the Bill is quite unnecessarily severe. I have read with care the defence of that provision by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Rifkind, at the First Scottish Standing Committee on 10th July
<col>710</col>
1979, and I do not agree with it. If by absconding and thus failing to turn up on the morning of his trial an accused person attempts to defeat the ends of justice, I think that he should be charged with that crime. From my reading of Scots law I am quite certain that if a person deliberately sought to defeat the ends of justice by failing to turn up on the morning of his trial&#x2014;perhaps in order to allow much time to pass, witnesses' recollections to fail, witnesses to die, or evidence otherwise to be lost&#x2014;he could be charged at common law with that crime. Then the whole circumstances, including his motives, could be gone into.<lb/>
But what we are doing in this Bill is saying that if a person fails to turn up for a jury trial on the morning of the trial, the court&#x2014;and that includes the sheriff&#x2014;may impose two years' imprisonment in respect of that failure. So we leap from the present situation where he forfeits &#x00A3;10 or &#x00A3;14 to a sentence of two years' imprisonment, which of course is a maximum, and I think that this really goes too far. In approaching the matter in this way the Bill would give the sheriff in Scotland a power to send a man to prison for four years: two years in respect of the crime of which he was convicted, and two years in addition in respect of his failure to turn up for the trial on the first occasion. I do not believe that that is right.<lb/>
In the discussions on the previous Bill there was a proposal put forward on behalf of the Opposition (as they then were) to extend the sentencing powers of the sheriff. There are arguments both ways on that particular question, and I believe that these arguments ought to be looked at carefully, and perhaps we shall look at them carefully in the context of the new Criminal Justice Bill. But to deal with this by a side door is, I consider, quite wrong. I hope that if noble Lords opposite, who hear or read what I say, believe that it is a danger to give a sheriff power to impose four years' imprisonment where he can now impose only two, they will perhaps speak to the noble Earl and ask him to modify this proposal which was not in our Bill and does not derive from the Thomson Committee on Criminal Procedure. I hope to return to this matter at the Committee stage.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0364"/>
<col>711</col>
Clause 10, to which the noble Earl referred, enshrines what I see as a regrettable necessity. At the moment a court in Scotland may, and does, sit on a Saturday morning in order to deal with people who have been detained in custody since some time on Friday. This clause means the virtual end of Saturday sittings for dealing with persons detained in custody after falling foul of the law on a Friday night. Friday night is pay night. For many it is the end of the working week, and it is the night when people are most likely to get into trouble. As a result of this provision such people are unlikely to be released before Monday. They certainly could not apply before Monday to a court for release. However, I concede that we cannot hope to go on imposing the burden of Saturday courts on sheriffs, procurators fiscal, court staff and the police, and this clause must therefore stand.<lb/>
But let me draw your Lordships' attention to the latter parts of the same clause&#x2014;Clause 10. One sees from that that it is possible to have the courts shut for three consecutive days; that is to say, where there is a public holiday on Monday preceded by Saturday and Sunday, or indeed where there is a holiday on Friday followed by Saturday and Sunday. I wonder whether this does not perhaps go a little too far. Is it not possible to avoid the result that someone who is detained on a Friday cannot appear before the court until the following Tuesday morning?<lb/>
In Scotland we have always prided ourselves&#x2014;rightly, I believe&#x2014;on bringing the accused before the court very swiftly. Would the noble Earl not consider a new subsection? Again, I cannot hope to draft as carefully as I might when we come to this matter at the Committee stage, but would he not consider a clause along the following lines:
<quote>"Where a court holiday occurs on a Friday or a Monday with the result that persons arrested on a Thursday or Friday respectively would have to wait three days before the next lawful day, the court shall sit at least once during such three days to entertain applications from such persons for interim liberation"?</quote>
That would mean that on the rare occasion&#x2014;perhaps only once or twice a year&#x2014;when there was liable to be a three days' vacation, as it were, of the court, special arrangements would be made.<lb/>
<col>712</col>
What the Government have done in introducing the Bill&#x2014;and I fully understand and sympathise with them&#x2014;is to treat as separable and urgent a few of the more technical and less controversial parts of the Criminal Justice Bill that we introduced. I regret, however, that they did not see it possible to go a little further and introduce at this stage the proposals to modify slightly the 110-day rule. As the noble Earl will know, our proposals were contained in Clause 20 of our Bill, and the modification was to allow the 110 days to run to the start of the trial, not to its conclusion. I should explain to those of your Lordships who are not familiar with the provision that we have an excellent provision that works in Scotland, yet I believe hardly anywhere else in the world, providing that if a person is detained in custody, he must be brought to trial, and his trial concluded, within 110 days of his being committed fully into custody. That is a summary of the provision and there are many modifications, but in essence it means that, however serious the charge, no person can be detained for more than about 3&#x00BD; months.<lb/>
The trouble is that in a number of modern cases, whereas a trial has started within 110 days, there have been great difficulties in getting it finished within that time. Accordingly, we introduced a proposal to have the 110 days run to the beginning of the trial, not to the end of it. That was not a controversial proposal; it was not opposed in the other place. I consider that it is fairly urgent because any week now another such case might come up despite the vigilance of the Crown Office and the procurators fiscal. So I believe that that is a matter which should have been attended to at this stage, and I ask the noble Earl whether it is too late to introduce this desirable reform, which was not opposed in another place and which I would hope would go through without controversy?<lb/>
I have a number of criticisms of points of detail which I hope can be considered at the Committee stage, but I believe that the principles of the Bill are sound. It is a small but useful Bill, and I trust that your Lordships will give it your support. Subject to the points that I have made, and which I hope noble Lords will think about and perhaps speak to the noble
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0365"/>
<col>713</col>
Earl about, I would ask your Lordships to support the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01600">3.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01601"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, for his muted but nevertheless genuine welcome for this modest measure. I detected in his speech a great many references to what we know, or hope, will be a forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill. I am the first to sympathise with his very natural apprehension&#x2014;and I must be careful with my metaphors here&#x2014;that the legal child which he conceived is to be brought forth possibly in a form which may be slightly, or even materially, different from what he thought it might be. I do not propose to say any more about the Criminal Justice Bill; the noble and learned Lord must contain himself until it sees the light of day. I am aware that he has put down a Question for Written Answer, and that will be answered as expeditiously and as compendiously as possible, but I repeat that we must wait until the Bill sees the light of day before we can draw our conclusions.<lb/>
One of the strange matters that a lawyer who practises in England&#x2014;I was going to say "an English lawyer", but again I must be careful&#x2014;finds is the curious distrust that the noble and learned Lord and his honourable friends in another place have for both the prosecuting authorities and the judiciary. When one peruses the <i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings as this Bill went through the other place one sees time after time this mistrust for what could happen if either sheriffs or procurators fiscal took the wrong view of their duty and used the powers which the Bill gives them in such a way that it would be onerous, if not actually unjust, to accused persons. That is something which I am bound to say I found rather surprising, and, if I may say so, the first point which the noble and learned Lord made as to the residuary requirement for money bail illustrates precisely this point. I would prefer to think that the courts will use this residuary discretion (if I may so call it) in a way which will, as it were, provide complete protection for accused persons, as is the whole design of the Bill, but which, on the other hand, will ensure the attendance
<col>714</col>
at court of people who otherwise might not turn up if they did not have to deposit what will probably be very large sums of money to see that they do. This is something which I have no doubt we can go into in Committee, but at the moment, speaking for myself, I am satisfied that the provision is fair and at the same time reasonable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01602"><member>Lord McCLUSKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Earl will allow me to say that I do not mistrust either the judges in Scotland or the prosecuting authorities in Scotland, but I am human enough to know that people make mistakes. It is possible&#x2014;and there have been examples of it in the past&#x2014;that a sheriff might get out of bed on the wrong side one morning and do something quite extraordinary. This kind of thing happens from time to time. The second point is that the judges, in construing the subsection to which I made reference, cannot look at <i>Hansard</i> to see the three cases which the noble Earl has in mind; they must look at the wording. I seek to achieve precisely the same object as the noble Earl, by tightening up the wording to ensure that the circumstances are, as he said in his speech, very special, and not, as the Bill says, simply special.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01603"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, even I, as an honorary sheriff, made a mistake once, I believe, but it was put right on appeal, and there are full rights of appeal in this Bill which persons who find themselves in such unfortunate circumstances can invoke and pray in aid. As to the point which the noble and learned Lord made about my noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate, may I say that he is reserving his power for just such an occasion as the Criminal Justice Bill, when I, for one, shall be very glad of a 15-pounder alongside me.<lb/>
The next matter which the noble and learned Lord raised was the maximum period of imprisonment which could be imposed by a court&#x2014;that is, two years' imprisonment&#x2014;if somebody (putting the matter colloquially) failed to turn up for their trial. The first thing I should like to say is that only when somebody fails to attend court are they liable to this rather more severe penalty. The second matter is that the court which sentences them has to be satisfied that they have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0366"/>
<col>715</col>
failed to attend, in the words of the subsection, "without reasonable excuse"; so there is no question that they are not allowed to say a word in their defence, or that they will not be heard. They have to have failed to appear "without reasonable excuse". In other cases, of course, the maximum is far less; it is only three months. Let us realise that in ordinary circumstances a sheriff is entitled to impose a sentence of imprisonment of two years, so this is neither more nor less than the sheriff can customarily impose. Fourthly, and once more, my Lords, there is a provision that a person who has been so sentenced may appeal.<lb/>
So, as I suggest, this is a provision to deal with somebody who quite obviously, by his absence from the court, has seriously interfered with the carriage of justice so far as he or she is concerned. For myself, I think it would be a thoroughly cumbersome way of going about things to make a new substantive offence, and to say, "You, John Bloggs, are now going to be charged with failing to attend '', as opposed, as it were, to wiping the slate clean at the conclusion of the trial, or whenever he happens to be apprehended. Again, that is a matter which we can come to in Committee if the noble and learned Lord thinks fit. The other matter to which the noble and learned Lord turned his attention was Saturday courts. I fully appreciate that, at first blush, if somebody were so foolish as to misbehave on a Friday night and Christmas or New Year fell on the Monday, they could languish in prison for no less than three days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01604"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Earl give way at that point? Is it not the case that, in 1981, 1st January falls on a Thursday and that 2nd January is a Bank Holiday in Scotland, so it could be that he would be languishing in jail for four days?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01605"><member>The Earl of MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords; Scottish courts sit on 2nd January, so 1981 is going to be all right. What I want to say is this, that the whole point of Clause 8 of this Bill&#x2014;in other words, interim liberation (a splendid word that!) by the police&#x2014;is designed for just this sort of occasion. That is to say, where it
<col>716</col>
is not necessary, and indeed will not be desirable, for somebody to languish in prison, then it will be up to the police, in far wider circumstances than they have ever been empowered to do before, to admit somebody to bail. Because, as I said in my opening remarks, up till now the only conditions under which the police have been allowed to liberate persons who have been arrested are those in cases which would fall to be determined possibly by a district court; and if I illustrate that by saying that the maximum amount of money at stake in the case of theft is &#x00A3;20, noble Lords will see just how poor, if I may use that expression, just how puny, the jurisdiction of the district courts happens to be.<lb/>
So, my Lords, I am not convinced at the moment that the noble and learned Lord's point that Clause 10 will of necessity cause people to be kept in prison for longer than they need is necessarily a good one. But I repeat what I said in my previous remarks, that if, for instance&#x2014;and I am not going to be like the Solicitor-General for Scotland and illustrate what sort of commotion I have in mind&#x2014;there is likely to be some sort of riot on a Saturday evening, there is no reason why the sheriff principal should not make prior arrangements for a court to sit on a Sunday (which has not been empowered before) so that, again, persons should not suffer incarceration longer than they have to without at any rate the opportunity to apply for bail.<lb/>
Finally, the noble and learned Lord asks why we have not taken the opportunity in this particular Bill to further modify and indeed improve the reforming of Scottish law, and he mentioned the 110-day rule. My answer to that is that really the Government cannot win. On Thursday, when I was in your Lordships' House finishing off the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, the noble and learned Lord's noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones referred to my modest measure as "a rag bag". On the Tuesday, when I come forward with a small but nevertheless coherent and well-shaped package, I am then again criticised for not having gone further and turned it into a rag bag. But I can assure the noble and learned Lord that if he waits until our Criminal Justice Bill sees
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0367"/>
<col>717</col>
the light of day, then we can discuss all these matters fully, and no doubt at considerable length, and improve the law as best we can.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read 2<sup>a</sup>, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MINISTRY OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT (DISSOLUTION) ORDER 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01606">3.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01607"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member> rose to move, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the Ministry of Overseas Development (Dissolution) Order 1979 be made in the form of the draft laid before the House on 25th October. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that an humble Address to presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Ministry of Overseas Development (Dissolution) Order 1979 be made in the form of a draft laid before this House on 25th October. May I start by saying how much I regret the absence today of the noble Lord, Lord Brockway. Your Lordships may have heard that the noble Lord&#x2014;whom I should like to call "my noble friend"&#x2014;suffered an accident over the weekend and is in hospital. I am sure that we all wish him a speedy and full recovery.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01608">I think it is my duty to give your Lordships a full explanation of the procedure we propose to follow with this order, together with a description of the practical consequences which will flow from it. I also propose, with your Lordships' permission, to make some observations on our approach to overseas aid generally, particularly in the light of the public expenditure White Paper published last week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01609">We propose that this order should be made under Section 1 of the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975. Section 1 of the Act gives Her Majesty power exercisable by Order in Council to provide for the dissolution of a Government Department in the charge of any Minister of the Crown and for the transfer of the functions previously exercisable by that Minister to any other Minister. By virtue of Section 5(I) of the Act, no Order in Council which provides for the dissolution of a Govern
<col>718</col>
ment Department shall be made under the Act unless copies of it are first laid in draft before both Houses of Parliament and each House presents an Address to Her Majesty praying that the order be made. I should perhaps tell your Lordships that the other place agreed a Motion in identical terms to this one on Tuesday of last week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01610">Upon his appointment, my noble friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary assumed full responsibility for overseas aid and development, and the Ministry of Overseas Development became an Overseas Development Administration within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. My noble friend's full title is thus Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Minister of Overseas Development. These arrangements have already been put into effect administratively, in so far as is possible. However, this order is necessary to make formal provision for the dissolution of the Ministry of Overseas Development and for the transfer to the Secretary of State of the functions of that Ministry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01611">As part of the new arrangements, my honourable friend Mr Marten, the Member for Banbury, was appointed to be responsible to my noble friend for aid and development matters within the Foreign aid Commonwealth Office, and to be in charge of the Overseas Development Administration. He was given the title of Minister for Overseas Development. These arrangements stand. They have had, and will continue to have, a number of consequences. When development matters are considered among Ministers, they are handled by my noble friend in consultation with my honourable friend Mr Marten. That is the background to this order. May I now turn to what I believe to be the main advantages of the new arrangements.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01612">I am sure your Lordships will agree that it is particularly appropriate to have the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in charge of both the Government's foreign policy and their aid programme. This will ensure that all our dealings with oversea nations are conducted with consistency and, above all, represented in the Cabinet at the highest level.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01613">The Government have responded speedily and effectively to the appalling
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0368"/>
<col>719</col>
plight of the refugees who were forced to leave Vietnam, and now to the threat of famine in Kampuchea. In Rhodesia, the future health and welfare of the people&#x2014;all the people&#x2014;has been in the forefront of our thinking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01614">As my noble friend moves to re-establish the position of Great Britain in world affairs, he will be able to ensure, within the compass of his own responsibilities, that our aid programme and our foreign policy are administered hand in hand, and that all the relevant considerations, including our ability to find the money, are brought together, co-ordinated, and finally implemented with efficiency and compassion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01615">It has been suggested that this order will have an adverse effect upon the reputation of our aid administration overseas. I reject that assertion completely. If the reputation of those administering our aid programme stands high in the eyes of the developing countries and of countries which share with us our responsibilities in the Third World&#x2014;as I know it does&#x2014;then henceforward that reputation will be enhanced. This Government have the greatest possible concern to ensure that public money is properly spent and those responsible for this task in the Overseas Development Administration will continue their former duties. The new procedures which this Government have introduced and which will be formalised by this order differ from the old mainly in that liaison between the two wings of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will be closer. The experienced staff formerly of the Ministry of Overseas Development, who have been widely praised, will continue to contribute their expertise.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01616">I have explained what I believe to be the major advantages of this order and I have, I hope, allayed any doubts which may have arisen. I should like in conclusion to emphasise that the new order in no way implies any reduction in the importance attached by this Government to the problems of the Third World. We remain committed in principle to the achievement of the target set by the United Nations that the developed countries should provide 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. of GNP as official development assistance&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01617"><member>The Earl of LONGFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord prepared to tell us what
<col>720</col>
proportion is provided at the present time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01618"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I am not. I repeat that we remain committed to the principle of contributing 7 per cent. as official development assistance, although, like the previous Government, we are not yet able to set a date for achieving it. We give full weight to development considerations in our aid programme. We are at present reviewing aid policy, but I can assure your Lordships that we shall continue to take account of the needs of the poorest.<lb/>
We have had to limit the planned increase in the aid programme below the rate that the previous Government had intended, but the reductions are no more than appropriate to those we have had to make in nearly all public expenditure programmes. I must say quite firmly that the plans of our predecessors could not have been sustained. The Shadow Chancellor, Mr. Healey, has recently admitted that, had he remained at the Treasury, some cut-backs would have been necessary. Indeed, he did prune the aid programme in 1976, when he proposed reductions for the years 1977&#x2013;78 and 1978&#x2013;79. The amount of those cuts substanitally exceeded in percentage terms the changes we have recently announced. There will still be a very substantial and important programme&#x2014;we are planning to spend around &#x00A3;843 million this year on aid, of which &#x00A3;790 million is new money, the balance being recycled from the repayment of old loans.<lb/>
This order is intended to improve administrative arrangements, not to change policies radically, We are certainly not reversing the policies of our predecessors. We have already demonstrated our commitment to the relief of suffering in the case of Cambodia and, within our present restraints, we shall see that a fair share is allocated to meeting such needs in the future. We are also concerned to ensure that our policies are efficiently integrated and, accordingly, I ask your Lordships to agree to the Motion standing in my name. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

solution) Order 1979 be made in the form of the draft laid before the House on 25th October.&#x2014;<i>(Lord Trefgarne.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01620">3.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01621"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to begin by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, for his kind words about my noble friend Lord Brockway, whom we all miss today, who would have been speaking in this debate and who has certainly done as much as or more than any other living Britisher for the cause of the Third World. I should also like to express my sympathy with the noble Lord opposite. He has the thankless task of answering for a number of departments. Although I believe he is based at the Foreign Office, he was not responsible for the decision which we are debating on this order this afternoon. I understand from the Minister concerned that that decision was taken on May 4th or 5th; in other words, it was taken within a few hours of the General Election results being known.<lb/>
We are debating the fate of what was the Overseas Development Ministry and what is now the Overseas Development Administration. This was set up in 1964 under the very inspiring leadership of Sir Andrew Cohen and with a Minister, Barbara Castle, who was at that time in the Cabinet. It was an expression of the British contribution to the concept of internationalism, of a world of justice, and it was supported in its objectives by members of all and of no party. It was indeed a reflection of the fact that members of all communities in this country recognise the emotional and mental unease that we feel at a time when we in this country are living in a state of relative affluence while for every minute that this debate takes place 25 people somewhere in the world are dying, simply through malnutrition. The particular importance of this Ministry was that it was based upon the concept of the British contribution to development and, as a consequence, members of the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Labour Party and members of no party supported its pioneering efforts in providing our contribution to a world of greater equity and justice.<lb/>
Its special importance was that it was independent of other Ministries; it was
<col>722</col>
seen to be independent and, as it grew and as its influence extended throughout the world, this independence became of extreme importance and has been imitated in other countries. It therefore had an international reputation as a Ministry. When one adds to that the work often done on its behalf by the British Council, and the work done by the World Service of the BBC, this formed a unique triumvirate of British participation in international affairs.<lb/>
One can contrast the independence which the Ministry had, the ability which it had, to push for the needs of people poorer than ourselves in this country. One contrasts the example to be seen in the United States, with its disastrous record of linking overseas aid with foreign policy; and perhaps above all with France, the culmination of whose disasters has been seen very recently in the kind of support that they have been giving to the former Emperor Bokassa and other tyrants of that kind, because French foreign policy and aid policy were inextricably linked together.<lb/>
Fortunately, we are now able to see that the United States has learned its lesson. The United States is moving the opposite way from this Government. The United States has now set up an international development corporation separate from the State Department, very largely because it has learned the lessons of failure in linking aid with foreign policy. The party of which the noble Lord is a member at one time believed this. Their White Paper in 1970 said that the Conservative Government recognised that the management of overseas aid is a function distinct from the general conduct of foreign affairs. Apparently they have changed their minds since those days. We have not.<lb/>
Secondly, I should like to pay tribute to the work of this Ministry over the past two or three years. I believe it began, under the distinguished leadership of the right honourable Judith Hart, to add an extra dimension to the simple issue of aid as a charity. It had begun to do what the Select Committee of the other place had proposed and pushed it to do: to link overseas aid with domestic economic policy. This is of tremendous importance to the future of this country and of equal importance to the peoples of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0370"/>
<col>723</col>/>
the Third World. It was then able to see that through the Ministry of Overseas Development the infrastructure could be built with overseas investment to enable the development of better standards of living with greater purchasing power and, therefore, with the greater opportunity to buy the goods of our country and the other countries in the developed world. Twenty-five per cent. of our exports today go to developing countries. The aid programme itself is linked directly to the domestic economy of our country by providing, according to the latest reckoning, 40,000 jobs in this country.<lb/>
I hope that the noble Lord will not tell us that the Government should like to do a great deal more in the provision of overseas aid when our economy is in a stronger position. That is not the point. That is missing the point which I have been trying to make in this House ever since I entered it. The aid that goes to overseas countries is not dependent upon economic growth in this country; it is in itself the seeds of that growth. Instead of talking&#x2014;as many noble Lords opposite do&#x2014;about pruning the trees in the hope that they will grow higher, do they not realise that they are cutting the roots of those trees that can supply the sap of our own growth?<lb/>
We are told that the Ministry is to be absorbed into the Foreign Office. This is a measure which I greatly deplore. We have seen&#x2014;and I am sure the noble Lord will be the first to agree with me on this&#x2014;a dedicated group of civil servants in that Ministry. In the applications for Civil Service posts a very large percentage of young people specify the Ministry of Overseas Development as their first preference. This is a sign of the dedication of the young to the contribution of this country to the concept of one world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01622"><member>Lord SOMERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Lord? Would he not agree that there is something in the old adage that charity begins at home, that there are many causes in our own country that are quite as urgently in need of help as those of overseas countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01623"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my answer to that is very simple: we are a trading country; we cannot look parochially to the economy of this country as though it were surrounded by a wall.

In our own interests, and in the interests of solving our own social and economic problems, it is essential that we look to the market, which consists of half the world, that today is unable to buy our products.<lb/>
What I should like to say to the noble Lord about what is really an apologia&#x2014;and remember, my Lords, that this issue was considered to be sufficiently important in the other House for there to be a debate lasting between four and five hours &#x2014;so far as the inclusion of the Ministry of Overseas Development into the Foreign Office is concerned, is that I believe that to be not just a blow to the morale of the staff of the Ministry of Overseas Development, although it is&#x2014;it is much more important than that.<lb/>
I wish that the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary had been able to be with us this afternoon, as he took the decision. It is a decision of policy and certain consequences flow from that policy. We now have foreign policy dominating our policy on overseas aid, and I believe that it is a bad thing. There should be tensions; often in the past there have been tensions. The noble Lord spoke about the cuts that had been made by a previous Chancellor of the Exchequer. Let me remind him that they were restored, and that when cuts were made the Ministry of Overseas Development was given very special treatment. Let me remind him also that the last Government had already pledged themselves to make, and had made the budgeting arrangements for, a 6 per cent. increase in real terms in the Ministry budget over the next four years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01624"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for having given way to me. I think that his right honourable friend Mr. Healey has said since he went into Opposition that the programme that was foreseen by the then Government at the time of the election could not have been sustained. I do not really think that a 6 per cent. increase, which was certainly in the last Government's original programme, would have stood the light of day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01625"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. that may be the opinion of the noble Lord: it is not my opinion, and it is not my opinion according to experience. As I have just pointed out, when cuts have been
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0371"/>
<col>725</col>
made in public expenditure in the past by a Labour Government, the Ministry of Overseas Development has been given special preference in&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01626"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not in. 1976. When the noble Lord and his noble and right honourable friends were in power, as I said in my opening remarks, Mr. Healey in 1976 announced cuts for the years 1977&#x2013;78 and 1978&#x2013;79 which were of the order of 9 or 10 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01627"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: Indeed, my Lords; and I have already answered that point. Those cuts were restored, and from this year, 1978&#x2013;79, the budget of the Ministry of Overseas Development was increased by 6 per cent. in real terms and it was planned to be increased by 6 per cent. in real terms over the next four years.<lb/>
I want to come to the crucial point of what are the consequences of the control of the Foreign Office over overseas aid. We have already seen them; we have had six months' experience. As the noble Lord said, this administrative action was taken last May. I understand&#x2014;I believe this is not denied, and I would not stand pat completely on this figure&#x2014;that the programme to India is to be cut by 40 per cent. This has not been denied; but when you talk about maintaining the principle of aid to the poorest, I would point out that the <i>per capita</i> income of an Indian is roughly 150 dollars. The <i>per capita</i> income of a Turk is 1,000 dollars. Out of the reduced budget on overseas aid, this Government have managed to find &#x00A3;15 million for the Turkish Government. It seems to me that this is surprisingly close to a foreign policy directive that because Turkey is an important area for NATO the Ministry is ordered by the politicians in the Foreign Office to use its aid in support of Turkey, while it is being cut to many countries such as India.<lb/>
One can refer to the Home Secretary's announcement that the programme for refugees in Latin America is to be wound up. One can refer to the fact that it is now admitted that the aid that has gone to Kampuchea is being hindered at least by the fact that the Foreign Office insists on continuing to recognise the Government of Pol Pot. As we see the aid programme now coming under the aegis
<col>726</col>
of the Foreign Office, so that programme itself and the size of that programme come within the whole of the Foreign Office aegis. I suggest that already discrimination is being seen, Whereas we had budgeted for a 6 per cent. real increase in the aid programme this year, the present Government have budgeted for what comes down in real terms to a reduction of 5 per cent. We have seen the proposed cuts in the BBC World Service, and I need to say little more about that because so much concern has already been shown.<lb/>
Let me come to the operations of the British Council, which has worked closely with the Ministry of Overseas Development, often as its agent. I understand that the British Council has been told to cut its budget this year by 11&#x00B7;5 per cent.: that is for the coming financial year. This, I understand, in fact, through redundancy payments and the like, is a real cut of 15 per cent. Yet the British Council is responsible for the provision of cultural opportunities and for the spreading of British culture&#x2014;are we ashamed of spreading British culture?&#x2014;among people who want to hear about how our institutions work. They are responsible for the teaching of the English language, of extreme value to British businessmen; for the educational services which have been provided for bringing overseas students into this country, training them, helping them to go back and again assisting them in the development of the British connection, which is so important to our overseas trade. I do not think we should neglect the fact that the British Council has also been responsible for the dissemination of the various art forms that are indigenous to this country to other parts of the world.<lb/>
Finally, I want to come to a matter which is very close to my heart and which I must summarise very quickly: the running down and probable eventual extinction of the development educational programme. I asked the noble Lord in question last week whether he had read the Schlackman Report. He did not answer but I hope he has by now, because that Report shows that 64 per cent. of the people of this country believe that this country is too poor to help overseas countries, but when those people are told the amount of aid then their opinion changes. There is a great belief in this
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0372"/>
<col>727</col>
country that we just pour out aid willy-nilly, and when the facts are known opinion changes. That is the job of development education. I would remind the noble Lord also that when the Report of the Committee on Development Education was drawn up, it was approved not just by the Ministry of Overseas Development but by the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Department of Education, the Northern Ireland Office, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office. I would ask him whether those other Ministries were consulted before the decision was taken to run down to a minimal amount the involvement of the Government in development education. I would remind him also that his Prime Minister signed a document in Lusaka which included this phrase:
<quote>"&#x2026; to improving the public understanding of the need for change in the countries participating in the interdependent international system".</quote>
I would remind him, too, that the Minister he has referred to, Mr. Marten, said in another place just last week that,
<quote>"It is important that people in Britain should understand the problems of development and the extent of our interdependence with the Third world".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 30/10/79; col. 1181.]</quote>
Really, this is either a hyprocritical statement or an ignorant one when, at the very same time, the same man is closing down the Advisory Committee on Development Education and running down the involvement of the Government in development education, which is essential to underpin the overseas aid programme of this country and the concept of the people of this country of the rest of the world. I can tell the noble Lord that we shall continue to press for the renewal of that involvement, and I hope that many noble Lords on the other side of the House will do so, because it is already evident that every major Church and every major voluntary organisation in this country, which the Conservative Party was so anxious to support in its Manifesto, has protested against the running down of the development education programme as a disservice to this country.<lb/>
Morally, this order is wrong. I do not believe that noble Lords will support a philosophy which gives massive tax rebates on the one hand, and cuts down aid to starving people on the other.<lb/>
<col>728</col>
Economically, it is wrong. It is a distraction from our opportunity to restructure the industry of this country, and to associate it in an expanding trade programme with the peoples of the world who today are unable to buy our products, but on whom we depend for many of the materials essential to this country and on whom we also depend for an expanding economy.<lb/>
Politically, it is wrong. The noble Lord spoke of the efforts to re-establish the power of Great Britain, the British Isles. I do not want to re-establish that kind of power, but I believe that we have a much greater power&#x2014;the power of influence&#x2014;and that influence can be seen when we practise what we preach, when we see and recognise our neighbours as world citizens and when we get away from the philosophy which, at a time of professed stringency, will add 3 per cent. to our arms budget and take away 5 per cent. from our overseas aid programme.<lb/>
So I hope the time will come when, having reviewed the effects of this order, the Government will return to an independent, internationally recognised Ministry, able to re-establish its reputation in this country and throughout the world. I also hope that there will be Members on the other side of the House, as there were in another place, who will support this attempt to persuade the Government that they are wrong now and that they must reverse the effects of this order.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01629"><member>Lord BANKS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join with the two noble Lords who have already spoken in expressing the hope that the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, will soon be restored to full health and to his place in this House. I should like also to thank the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, for his very clear explanation of the purpose of this order, even although, like the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, I am unable to approve that purpose. It seems to me that this order is an example of one of the least satisfactory characteristics of British politics at the present time. It is an example of the way in which an incoming Government undoes the work of its predecessor.<lb/>
The Ministry of Overseas Development was set up by the Labour Government of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0373"/>
<col>729</col>
1964&#x2013;70, it was abolished by the Conservative Government of 1970&#x2013;74, it was reestablished by the last Labour Government and now the present Conservative Government want to abolish it again. These seesaw politics must inevitably be very unsettling and disturbing, and surely what was required was a period of continuity rather than yet another about turn. But there are other and substantial reasons why we on these Benches oppose this change.<lb/>
We oppose the dissolution of the Ministry of Overseas Development, first, because we think it is wrong in principle to bring aid under the Foreign Office. Aid, we think, should not be seen as an arm of foreign policy and we feel that it is easier for Third World countries to deal with a specific aid Ministry, than to deal with the Foreign Office. Also, the principle of aid for the poorest which is supposed to underlie our aid programme may not always accord with quite understandable and legitimate Foreign Office priorities.<lb/>
Secondly, we feel that there is a need for a Minister, backed by an independent Ministry, to stand up for the aid programme within the Government. We also believe that a stouter defence of that programme will be made by a Minister who has sole responsibility for it, than by a Minister who, quite rightly, is preoccupied with East-West confrontation and with the future of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. We think that relations with the Third World are so important that this Minister with sole responsibility should be in the Cabinet.<lb/>
Thirdly, we think it unwise to abandon a Ministry which has established so high a reputation as the Ministry of Overseas Development has. It is not in the interests of Britain to do that. Our fourth objection is this. The aid programme has been cut. It has been suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, that the cut is 5 per cent. in real terms, and he has referred also to the cuts in the services of the British Council and in the development education programme. I know&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has made this point&#x2014;that it is not the first time that aid has been cut. But there are suspicions&#x2014;they may be very unfair&#x2014;that the present Government are less enthusiastic about aid than their predecessors, and the dissolution of the Ministry of Overseas Development
<col>730</col>
will tend to confirm people overseas in that opinion.<lb/>
Of course, I agree that the Foreign Office must take an interest in aid, but they have to take an interest also in the overseas activities of many other Government Departments. They have to take an interest in trade, but we do not have the department responsible for trade as part of the Foreign Office. It has been argued in another place that the Foreign Office have a clearer idea of where British interests lie. But overseas aid is not primarily concerned with British interests, though of course those responsible for administering it cannot ignore them. But that is not the primary aim and the primary responsibility. So, for all those reasons, my noble friends and I are unable to express support for this order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01630">4.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01631"><member>Lord ALPORT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to intervene very quickly and shortly in this debate, simply because I should like to advance a different version of the history behind this Ministry of Overseas Development from that which has been advanced from the Benches opposite. In fact, the Ministry of Overseas Development developed from the ideas that were put forward by the Commonwealth Relations Office in about 1960, when Mr. Duncan Sandys was Secretary of State and Mr. Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister. It seemed to the Commonwealth Office at that time that it was most important that the political factor in aid should be removed, both in relation to the Colonies and in relation to foreign countries&#x2014;and I suppose, as well, in relation to the increasing number of Commonwealth countries that were coming into being at that time. We felt it was wrong that the aid effort of this country should be regarded by sensitive public opinion in Third World countries, as I suppose we would now call them, as being part of the political effort of the United Kingdom. My noble friend the Minister said that one of the objects of this action was to advance the position of Great Britain in world affairs. We did not think at that time that aid was a way in which you advanced politically the position of this country anywhere. Indeed, we felt that it was one of the ways in which we could produce something
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0374"/>
<col>731</col>
which cost us a good deal of money and which was politically counterproductive.<lb/>
Quite recently there has been a very good example of this. The noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, mentioned the United States and their policies. Not very long ago, and apparently in protest against the belief that the Pakistan Government were developing some form of nuclear weapon, the United States cut off overnight the whole of their aid programme&#x2014;not only their military aid but also their peaceful aid. This has caused such resentment in Pakistan towards the United States Government and the American people generally that I am sure it has hardened any opinion that there may be in favour of the development of nuclear energy in Pakistan. So far as the United Kingdom was concerned, this was one of the dangers that we felt the use of aid for political purposes might run us into.<lb/>
I say "we" because I was present at that particular time and my experience bears out a good deal of what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, and by the Liberal speaker. Certainly it was the Conservative view then, and so far as I personally am concerned it is my view at the present time. Our idea was not particularly original. I think the first country which tried to separate aid from politics was Canada. The Canadians had an organisation which administered the aid the Canadian people were giving to developing countries separately from their Ministry of External Affairs. When the proposal came from the CRO to the Prime Minister, and presumably to the Cabinet, it was agreed, and it was from the germ of that idea that the present Ministry developed. It should be realised, if only from the point of view of accurate history, that this was not a Labour Party idea or a Liberal Party idea. It came from the Conservative Government of Mr. Macmillan in 1960.<lb/>
I suppose&#x2014;and I regret it&#x2014;that idealism and sensitiveness to the feelings of overseas countries has somewhat declined in this country over the last few years. The intervention of my noble friend&#x2014;that charity begins at home&#x2014;reflects the sort of attitude which I fear too many people have in their minds now. So far as I am concerned&#x2014;and I believe that there are many people in all parties, and certainly
<col>732</col>
in the Conservative party, who share this view&#x2014;I do not regard this country as a pauper. I do not regard this country as ceasing to have a role&#x2014;idealistic, no doubt, but important&#x2014; in the world which enables us to go to the aid of people who desperately require that aid.<lb/>
I am sorry, therefore, that this decision has been taken. I know very well that the Foreign Office have always resented the removal of their control over aid which existed before 1960. Now they have got it back. The CRO has gone, the Colonial Office has gone and now the Ministry of Overseas Development has gone, and we have the Foreign Office. I have the greatest admiration for the Foreign Office but I am not sure that it is always the most sensitive organisation for dealing with problems which in the past, I always thought, were rather well dealt with by other Ministries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01632"><member>Lord SOMERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of what the noble Lord has said, may I say that I had no intention of conveying the idea that our home interests are the only ones which matter. Certainly aid to countries which need it is most important; I agree wholeheartedly with that. However, there is a school of thought in this country that foreign aid is the only aid which matters. Nevertheless, there are a good many things at home which also matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01633"><member>Lord ALPORT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know perfectly well the kindheartedness of my noble friend, and I would not in any way wish to criticise him. However, his intervention has given me the opportunity to say that this debate has gone on rather longer than I expected. I had not intended to take part in it. As I have to leave at half-past four, I hope that the House and the Minister will not regard me as being unduly discourteous if I leave then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01634">4.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01635"><member>Lord SOPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, once again we are surely talking about a matter far greater and more significant than administrative changes. Last week we discussed a reduction in public services to miserable and helpless alcoholics. Yesterday, in another place, there was a fiery debate on the reduction of services in the realm of education. The debate this afternoon is about the reduction of services. I am
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0375"/>
<col>733</col>
deeply disturbed and begin to wonder how much longer the Government may be able to maintain the argument that it is necessary, in the interests of economics and other matters associated with economics, to practise what does increasingly appear to a great many people to be a form of moral barbarism. I use that word advisedly. I think that in the process we are becoming uncivilised, and I intensely regret that process.<lb/>
It is perfectly true that the dissolution of this particular administration does not in itself prevent the achievement of those aims which first caused it to be put into operation, and I appreciate the difficulties and problems which have already been ventilated. I speak in the presence of my forthcoming Archbishop and I think that makes a quorum. So we can say that we are united in our belief that this whole attitude towards a reduction in the public services, particularly to those who are least capable of helping themselves, is a retrograde step and that no economic condition can finally justify it. I do not believe, for instance, even on the ground of economic convenience, that it would be a disaster if these services were increased. I share with my noble friend Lord Hatch of Lusby the belief that to raise the standards of help to those now impoverished in the economic field may be to our advantage as well as to theirs.<lb/>
However, it is not to that that I would venture to address my remarks. I would venture to speak about the British Council. The evidence of the general trend of Government proposals is already clear. The British Council has been reduced very largely in its opportunities, and the present depredations will increase next year and the year after. May I adduce two of the areas in which I believe this is disastrous.<lb/>
I share with the noble Lord opposite the view that this country has a very great deal to contribute. I do not believe that we are down and out. I think that there are many who look with envious eyes at the achievements we have already attained in the field of democratic and institutional Government. I was much encouraged when the British Council found a way of penetrating the Iron Curtain by means of its production of artistic and other shows which were presented behind that Iron Curtain, for this seemed to me to be the
<col>734</col>
only way, in many cases, in which people living in that Cloud Cuckoo Land would be able to appreciate something of the qualities of this country, despite its economic conditions and despite the propaganda so frequently and, in my judgment, malevolently directed against our own condition. That will go. I have evidence, with which I shall not delay the House but which seems to me to be unequivocal, that the reduction of 15 to 20 per cent. will mean that that kind of overseas communication in places where I believe it is most needed, and the kind of qualities which we should cherish and of which we should be proud, will cease.<lb/>
I am even more concerned about the educational facilities, for the British Council has been able to prosper in places like Rhodesia. Here we are the inheritors of the churchmanship which provided primary and secondary education for thousands of black and white Rhodesians hitherto. It is the British Council which has been able to supplement that elementary education with opportunities for further education in which at this very moment 2,000 of the inhabitants of that beleaguered country are able to acquire the kind of dispassionate education with which I believe they can contribute to its ultimate emancipation from the troubles which now beset it.<lb/>
But principally, my Lords, I cannot but register my own entire and increasing disapproval at the disagreeable and, to me, quite inhuman attitude which not consciously but inevitably categorises a government which believes that to get itself out of its economic necessities it is necessary to reduce its commitments in the civilised world in which I believe it has the most finally to contribute. Therefore, I join with my noble friend Lord Hatch and others in repudiating the underlying principle which governs this particular measure, and hoping that even at the last this Government will see the error of their ways. It would not disturb me too much if public opinion unseated them. What does disturb me is that while they are here they are, in my judgment, creating an impression throughout the rest of the world which is not conducive to their own merit and certainly does not produce the kind of advantages which even economic stringency of a most required type would demand. It is in that sense that I venture to intervene this afternoon and to hope
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0376"/>
<col>735</col>
that this kind of barbarism will cease and in its place we shall learn to be a civilised community, believing, as I do, that what is morally right in the end can never be politically wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01636">4.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01637"><member>Lord HANKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having been one of the delegates who was responsible for organising the foundation of OECD, with its great interest in development, and having subsequently served on the Development Aid Group of OECD, I agree with a great deal of the regret which has been expressed about the inevitable cutting down of development aid. But I underline the adjective "inevitable". It is always tempting to attack any particular section of expenditure on which reductions have to be made. The bald fact is that this country has been going down hill for years, and unless public expenditure is cut it will continue to go down hill and in 20 years we shall be a real slum. I am afraid it is inevitable. I regret it as much as anybody but it is inevitable that there should be cuts right across the board. The Foreign Office is having to make some and I think that cuts in development aid (among other things) right across the board are inevitable.<lb/>
But from what has been said in this debate anyone would think that aid was being turned off altogether. It is not. The Ministry of Development Aid may not be called the Ministry but there will he an administration. I know from personal experience, because I co-operated with it closely, that the Development Aid Administration in the early 70's was extremely efficient, very hard working, and forward looking. I have no doubt that a great part of it will continue and I am sure that will continue to be equally efficient and equally sensitive.<lb/>
I do not think it is fair to suggest, as my noble friend Lord Alport did&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not in his place&#x2014;that the Foreign Service may be less sensitive to the needs of foreign countries. In my experience they are extremely sensitive. Our embassies and legations are often teased by their fellows in our service for becoming so closely associated with the countries in which they work, and I know
<col>736</col>
that it will be extremely good for them to be more closely connected with aid questions.<lb/>
It is a good thing that we should look at aid against the whole background of our foreign policy requirements. By that I do not mean that we should be really tough about it. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, that there have been certain developments in the United States of America which have been deplorable. I do not think they have treated Turkey very well. I could give any number of examples, but they have been extremely generous over the whole field and I see no reason why the United Kingdom should become unduly tough in its relations with other countries simply because we are going to have this extremely able department under the overall control of the Foreign Secretary. It is going to have a Minister of its own, and I am sure that he will have influence with our very able Foreign Secretary.<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, there have been some happenings which have been hard to explain. I do not want to prolong the length of this debate, so I will give just one example. A year last August we gave an interest-free loan to Mozambique of &#x00A3;10 million and no repayment was going to take place until, mainly, the 'nineties. I think some repayment was going to take place in the 'eighties, but nothing very much. This was at a time when they were supporting Marxist guerrillas armed and financed by the Russians and the guerrillas were murdering nuns and school teachers, some of whom no doubt had had help from the British Council in the past. It did not seem to make any sense to give that loan. I was unable to get any explanation in this House. It went through, I think without any proper discussion here. That is just an example. I welcome the measures which are now being taken and I think the Government have been very reasonable about the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01638"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I just answer the point that he has made about the loan to Mozambique. In fact, the loan to Mozambique was a loan to a friendly country, a country which had just emerged from many years of colonial rule. It was a loan for development and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0377"/>
<col>737</col>
it has been used for development, but, so far as the harbouring of guerrillas was concerned, those guerrillas who were being assisted by the Mozambique Government were in fact fighting against the rebels who were against the Queen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01639">4.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01640"><member>Lord TAYLOR of GRYFE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I spend a good deal of my time travelling around the world financing industrial development, and that travelling includes frequent visits to the developing countries, and I want to ask the noble Lord just what the impact of the administrative changes will be on the excellent liaison which exists between the Department of Industry and the Overseas Development Ministry at the present time. Most countries which are engaged in financing international contracts, particularly in the Third World, have very substantial subvention from their aid programmes. It is a matter of vital importance to British industry that the continued relationship between the Department of Industry, which sometimes influences aid expenditure, should be continued, because in many parts of the world British contracts are lost on account of the element of aid that is built into the bids of other competitive countries. That is a matter which I should like to see clarified under the new arrangements.<lb/>
The other point is this. I am filled with admiration for the work of the Ministry which is now to be absorbed into the Foreign Office, but I must say, too, that I try to be fair about this matter. I read the report of the debate in the other place, and I recognise that during the period of office of the last Government there were times of tension between that department and the Foreign Office. There were occasions when the policies were not entirely consistent. I have also listened to the argument today and, while I would prefer to see a degree of consistency between foreign policy and aid policy, I am afraid that the transfer of the department to the Foreign Office will mean that instead of consistency there could be domination by the Foreign Office. That would be unfortunate, although, as I say, in the light of my own experience I can see something in the argument. The debate today has gone well beyond the area of administrative
<col>738</col>
change; it has developed into a debate on the whole subject of aid. Perhaps that might be more appropriate for a future occasion when we have more time to expand on this very important issue.<lb/>
I must say that I cannot support a Government which is concerned with the defence of democracy and proceeds to interpret that defence in terms of increased military expenditure while cutting back on aid programmes, because democracy will survive not because of the strength of its arms but because of the power of its ideas. I believe we gain a great deal more from being charitable and generous and compassionate, and showing that we are that kind of society, than by engaging in the continued expansion of armament expenditure.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will think twice about cutting aid in any form. We talk about the commitment to 0.7 per cent. of GNP, and I was delighted to hear the Minister's commitment to that as a long-term aim. But, you know, at the end of the war, when this country had been bombed, when many of our resources were depleted, this country committed itself to 1 per cent. of its GNP for reconstruction and aid to people who were less fortunate than we were. This country committed itself to 1 per cent. of its GNP to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and we were morally better people and we felt better for it. I would hope that our contribution to aid will make us more proud of our demorcatic society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01641"><member>Lord NOEL-BAKER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend to recall that after the 1 per cent. given by this country to UNRRA had been exhausted in constructive and most valuable work, a second 1 per cent. was voted by Parliament for that purpose within a year of the termination of the first expenditure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01643"><member>Lord HUNT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, who is to reply, has heard an almost unanimous chorus of dissent and disapproval and regret at the Government's intention to dissolve the Ministry of Overseas Development and absorb it into the Foreign Office. I am sorry to have to add another voice to the regret, but I feel that I must stand up and do so.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0378"/>
<col>739</col>
I had experience of the Ministry of Overseas Development in the 'sixties, and again with the administration when it was taken into the Foreign Office in the Heath Administration, and more recently when it was recreated a Ministry. I am in no position to say with proof that as an ODA, as district from an ODM, the ODA was notably swayed and influenced by Foreign Office policy when it came within the Foreign Office. What I am able to say with personal conviction is that as a Ministry, independent and separate from the Foreign Office, it was seen by the outside world to be administering aid to countries which, despite our own difficulties, were and are in greater difficulties, and doing so in an open and even-handed and impartial way. I think that a great deal of loss is incurred when that being seen to be independent and impartial ceases to be the case.<lb/>
I have only one other point to make; namely, that my connection with the Overseas Development Ministry in. the `sixties came about through my being president of the Council for Volunteers Overseas. That council and the bodies which worked under its umbrella&#x2014;VSO, UNA, IVS and the Catholic Institute for International Relations and other volunteer-sending bodies&#x2014;recieved support and financial help from the Ministry. One thing I can say with absolute certainty is that the young people in this country who volunteer their help to countries and individuals in those countries who need help, do not do so because they are interested in British foreign policy. They are interested in the intrinsic troubles and needs which they hear about and in regard to which they have a basic urge to go and help.<lb/>
I should like the Minister when he comes to reply to assure this House&#x2014;as I hope he will be able to do&#x2014;that the Council for Volunteers Overseas and its constituent bodies will continue to receive such help as the Government feel able to give, quite irrespective of the turns and twists of policies of the Foreign Office, and only on grounds of meeting that wish of young people to help other people overseas.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01645"><member>The Lord Bishop of St. ALBANS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I came this afternoon to listen and not to speak, but I am provoked to
<col>740</col>
intervene briefly because Lord Hatch mentioned the anxiety of all the Christian Churches about this move to wind up the ODM, which has been such a friend to many of the more progressive movements, and for the international awareness of the Churches, and also because Lord Soper has testified to the degree of Christian unity that is felt on these issues.<lb/>
It is a fact that the bishops of the Church of England, associated with some other bishops of the Anglican Communion, after considerable thought and some research, took the trouble to write a letter to Her Majesty's Government during the summer appealing for the Development Education Fund, a small sum of money but of considerable significance in the generation of understanding in this nation of voluntary aid development. We also associated that with a letter written about overseas students, a matter which is in a whole constellation of issues about which there is anxiety in the Christian conscience of this country. I have to say that we do not feel that representations of this kind have been treated with the seriousness they deserve. In my own immediate experience the Development Education Fund has created a network of centres around this country and has spawned a number of projects, of quite small dimension but of that voluntary character which should presumably appeal to the commendable attitude of the Government towards people taking responsibility for their conscience. This fund seems to have been lost with the department or else seems to have been terminated.<lb/>
Secondly, in order to broaden out the question, I should like to say that in the early part of this year I spent three months in Eastern Europe, and in meeting young people, particularly in the universities, one was conscious of the extent to which there was present there a group from the Third World, from developing countries, with no money problems, receiving a great deal of hospitality and real priority to their education. Along with that, one could not help noticing that when Governments spoke to visiting prelates about matters they found unsatisfactory in one's country they rated highly what they might regard as "distortion" on the BBC. I was impressed to discover that an investment in truth is still something of which this country may be proud.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0379"/>
<col>741</col>
Apart from that, at the type of peace conference which is promoted in Eastern Europe the question often asked is: "How much is being done to educate the people of your country, as we do in our democratic society, about the needs of the poor of the world; and how far are you able to break out of the type of charmed circle of the converted as regards international awareness?" One had a card that one could play in such difficult debates. They were prepared to listen to that point and to turn off some of the denunciations of colonialism, Zionism and capitalism because it seemed to be a valid point and one which we had some experience in developing.<lb/>
Therefore, it is a great disappointment to return to this country and discover that the Christian conscience must fight for these things now and in the years ahead.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01647"><member>Lord RITCHIE-CALDER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I commiserate with the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, in his now recognisable role as the receiver in political bankruptcy. He was the spokesman on the question of the World Service of the BBC. He had to defend an indefensible case. Today once again, he is the spokesman and the present Government have abandoned any attempt to appeal to heart and mind &#x2014;they have abolished the mind by withdrawing access to it and they have forgotten the heart. This is a matter that I find most regrettable, not just as regards the high moral level to which my noble friend, the right reverend Prelate, Lord Soper, and many other speakers referred. In a sense it is much more than that because that would be unreal unless we meant what we said&#x2014;that is, unless we backed it up by positive policies.<lb/>
Like my noble friend Lord Taylor of Gryfe, I have travelled a great deal in the Third world and I happen to know a great deal about the mistakes which have been made by multilateral and indeed our own aid programmes. However, we have learned something very profound. I wish to point out to the noble Lord, Lord Somers, that his intervention showed once again how completely we misunderstand what we are talking about. This is not charity. I am not derogating charity. This is investment in the future
<col>742</col>
of the world. It is investment in the future of Britain; and investment in all the high objectives for which any Government should be standing. We are now deliberately saying&#x2014;and I have said it with great emphasis when I have travelled around, and it has been demonstrated by the right honourable Judith Hart&#x2014;that we did know what we were doing. We knew what we were doing&#x2014;but no longer. We are blundering once again into that utterly crazy world which we have helped to produce and as regards which our motives are the wrong motives. Aid should be a positive input or transfusion into the debilitated systems of the world. If we are to put that in the hands of a foreign policy which will manipulate SALT treaties on the one hand and buy Turkey on the other, then we shall destroy not only the people for whom we have withdrawn aid, but the credibility of this country totally. We have lived on that credibility and we have benefited from that credibility.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Soper, said that we do not, in fact, think that this country is down and out; it just looks like that because like the noble Lord over here we keep on saying that we are down and out. We are not down and out. We are a very rich country, but the use of our riches is misdirected. That is something that we must recognise beyond peradventure. Like what happened in a recent debate on the World Service of the BBC, what is happening today is that this country, this empire, is not going out with a bang; it is not going out with a whisper. Now it is going out with a whimper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01648"><member>Lord HANKEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I should like to say that I did not say that this country was down and out. I said that it had been going downhill for years. That is not quite the same thing. I share the noble Lord's view that this country is not down and out. On the other hand, I am sorry that he seems to imply that the Foreign Service cannot be trusted to deal with aid responsibly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01649"><member>Lord RITCHIE-CALDER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course not. What we are talking about here should be basically a disinterested service&#x2014;a disinterested recognition that we must invest in order to recover on these investments. That can only happen
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0380"/>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01650"><member>Lord MILVERTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say how much I agree with those who have expressed their concern. Many Church people and others would be most concerned if overseas aid was likely to become less; in any way weaker; or not so effective. The people of Chippenham&#x2014;the area in which I live&#x2014;sent a petition asking that, if anything, overseas aid should be increased. Many of us believe that we can give moral and spiritual aid and we must presumably trust that so far as possible overseas aid will be used for good rather than (shall I say?) "not good" things. As the noble Lord, Lord Soper, and the right reverend Prelate have said, many Church people will be concerned if this link&#x2014;because that is what it is&#x2014;becomes weaker and less.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01651">4.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01652"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord replies I should like to make one point and I shall take only two minutes. I do not think that anyone &#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, or the Government generally&#x2014;can have any doubt as to the unpopularity, in this House at any rate, of the proposal to wind-up the Ministry of Overseas Development and to absorb it into the Foreign Office. There may be, as he says, a logical reason for doing so, and I would not dispute that. But it certainly will not be a popular move. The fact is that they have decided to do it. It is going to be done, and although people here may protest we must grin and bear it. If we do not like it, it is something that is over the bridge and we must recognise that it is going to be done.<lb/>
I should like to point out that two years ago we had a debate on the Berrill Report, and we criticised to a large extent what the Think-Tank were proposing should be done in regard to the Foreign Service. But we disagreed totally with them on their proposals regarding the overseas programme of the BBC, and equally totally on their proposals for economies in regard to the British
<col>744</col>
Council. Recently in this House we had a very good debate on the Overseas Services of the BBC. I do not know whether it was as a result of feeling in this House, but when the White Paper was published we noticed that the Government had had second thoughts and did not propose to cut the Overseas Services of the BBC by &#x00A3;4 million but only by &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;57 million. I believe that it is even conceivable that, due to the considerably greater uproar in another place, they may have second thoughts and not cut the Overseas Services of the BBC at all.<lb/>
But as yet in this House we have had no debate on the very substantial proposed cuts that the Government want to make in the British Council's vote. think it was the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, who said that effectively it was a cut of 15 per cent., which would have a very severe effect on the Council's activities. As I must relate this in some way to aid, I should like to know to what extent this very large cut will, for instance, affect the aid which is being organised and administered by the British Council. Can we be assured that this proposed cut of 15 per cent. will in no way affect the aid programme of the Government?<lb/>
Finally, I should like to inquire when, if at all, we shall be able to discuss the proposed cut in the British Council vote in the same way as we recently discussed the proposed cuts in the Overseas Services of the BBC. I hope that when the Minister replies he will be able to give me some assurance on that point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01654"><member>Lord UNDERHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was my intention to intervene in this debate at the start and raise the matter of the British Council, but in view of a number of speeches that have been made I decided not to say anything. However, in the light of the debate I still believe that the Minister must tell us precisely what will happen as regards the British Council. It is not only a question of the educational work that the British Council performs; it is not only a question of the image which it gives of this country, the achievements of this country and the background of this country; but, even from the narrow angle of dealing with our friends in the world and letting them know precisely where we stand and of our own interest
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0381"/>
<col>745</col>
in creating the right atmosphere for our trade and services, one would have thought that the work of the British Council would have continued. As has rightly been said, following on projected cuts in the BBC External Services, this seems to be the height of folly. First, it is the best way to lose possible friends and, secondly, it is the best way to lose possible trade. I hope that the Minister will give us some assurance that this matter will be reconsidered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01655">4.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01656"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the order before the House this afternoon in no way relates to the total quantity of aid. It does not relate to how much money we should give to this or to that country; nor does it have anything to do with the matter so close to the heart of the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, and indeed to the heart of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Saint Albans&#x2014;development education.<lb/>
The change which we seek to formalise by this order before your Lordships this afternoon is an adminstrative change. As I said in my opening remarks, there has been no reversal of policy upon the advent of this Government. The main thrust of overseas aid will proceed in the same direction as it did under our predecessors. Yes, we have had to review some of the figures that were put before us when we came to office, but so indeed would the other party if they had won the General Election. The noble Lord, Lord Hatch, disagreed with the figures which I have put before your Lordships, but my information is that the cuts which were made by his right honourable friend Mr. Healey were largely sustained, although I agree that a small percentage of the figure for the 1977&#x2013;78 cuts was later restored&#x2014;&#x00A3;25 million-worth of it.<lb/>
Much has been made of the fact that under the previous Administration there was a separate, special Ministry for this purpose&#x2014;as indeed there was&#x2014;and we were led to believe that the Minister in charge of that Department, Dame Judith Hart as she now is, was a Cabinet Minister of high rank. I should not wish for one moment to decry her skill or her performance&#x2014;certainly not from this Box. She was not in the Cabinet or, if she was, it was only for a short time. She was
<col>746</col>
ultimately a Minister of State, in theory responsible to Dr. David Owen, who was then the Foreign Secretary. The present arrangement is that Mr. Neil Marten is a Minister of State responsible to my noble friend.<lb/>
Complaint has been made that we shall now be associating our foreign policy too closely with our aid decisions. I believe that under the other Adminstration it went the other way. Your Lordships may recall that our predecessors undertook to supply ships to Vietnam. If ever there was a case of aid policy departing too far from foreign policy&#x2014;because those ships were supplied under concessional terms&#x2014;that was surely it.<lb/>
One noble Lord referred to aid to Cambodia. It is perhaps right that I should tell your Lordships that there are two programmes of aid to Cambodia with which we are directly concerned. First, there is EEC aid. There is now a total &#x2014;and I am compressing the figures before me&#x2014;of 29 units of account being made available by the EEC for food and other supplies to Cambodia. We also have our own bilateral programme. We are making a bilateral gift of the equivalent of 5,000 tonnes of wheat in the form of 1,800 tonnes of rice; I am advised that rice is more nutritious for people in that part of the world and so one does not have to supply so much to provide the same nutritional value. We also have an aircraft which has been based in Bangkok for the last few weeks and which will remain there for a while yet.<lb/>
Several noble Lords raised the matter of the British Council. The interests of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and of the Overseas Development Administration in the work of the British Council are rather different. The former is concerned with the Council's cultural and information work abroad and the latter is concerned with its educational and training aspects. For that reason, as your Lordships will appreciate, the British Council receives grants from both the overseas representation and the aid votes; and the Overseas Development Administration within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will continue to have direct dealings with the British Council. I cannot pretend that the British Council will be exempt from consideration in the cuts which we are
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0382"/>
<col>747</col>
making, but we shall certainly do our best to ensure that the effect of those cuts is kept to a minimum.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, asked about relations or, if I can put it another way, the interface between the Department of Industry and the Overseas Development Administration. The new arrangements will not jeopardise the already excellent relationship which exists between the DOI and the ODA within the Foreign Office. As I said earlier, we are reviewing aid matters generally and, if we identify ways of improving the relationship we shall certainly implement them.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also asked me about volunteers overseas. Again, I am not sure that that is directly related to this order, but I shall try to help him if I can. The Government fully recognise the invaluable contribution made by the Council and by the voluntary agencies generally. I can assure noble Lords that the help for such activities will continue to have priority. As I said at the outset of these closing remarks, this order is not about the total quantity of aid, nor even about our aid policies; it is about an administrative arrangement within the Government. For that reason, I hope that your Lordships will agree to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01657">5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01658"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I ask him three specific questions arising out of his answer. First, he tried to convince us that there was no change in the policy of the new Administration so far as aid is concerned. Will he tell us whether or not the present Government believe in direct Government monetary support for development education? Secondly, he said that this was simply an administrative matter and suggested that there was no policy difference. Then he gave the instance of the ships to Vietnam, and commented on that that this was surely a big gap between the aid policy and the foreign policy. Does not this then imply that in future it will be foreign policy that decides what aid policy shall be?<lb/>
Thirdly, in his reference to the British Council, he somewhat unctuously mentioned that he would try to keep the cuts to the British Council to a minimum. Is it not the case that the present cut to the British Council is 11.5 per cent., which
<col>748</col>
may very well be in real terms next year 15 per cent., whereas the cut to the Foreign Office itself is a mere 3 per cent.?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01659"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord is stretching the rules of order somewhat to ask for those points "before I sit down". However, I shall do my best. May I take up the point of development education because the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, was not the only noble Lord to refer to this matter, and I know his interest in it. Of course it is important that people in Britain should understand the problems of development and the extent of our interdependence with the Third World.<lb/>
The voluntary agencies, and many individuals, have for long led the way in explaining these issues, and we hope that they will continue to do so. What is in question, however, is how far this work should be boosted by Government funds. These must come from an aid programme which cannot be exempted from the general restraints that we must impose on public spending. Every pound spent on development education in Britain means one less pound available for direct spending upon aid overseas. We believe that most people would agree that our ability to provide direct help, whether for long-term development or short-term emergency relief, must come first. The previous Administration had ambitious plans to spend something like &#x00A3;9 million on development education over the next few years. These could not have been sustained. Our own spending will be over &#x00A3;600,000 this year. While I cannot say what will happen thereafter, we intend to provide enough over the next two years to allow existing schemes to come to fruition.<lb/>
The noble Lord went on to complain about my reference to the ships for Vietnam. We maintain quite strongly that the decision taken by our predecessors to provide concessional facilities for the purchase of those ships by the Vietnamese Government was a mistake, and way out of line with our then foreign policy interests. The noble Lord also asked me about the British Council. I am afraid that I am not in a position to go further than what I have said already, except to say and re-emphasise that we shall do our best to see that the cuts which may inevitably have to be made in the budget of the British Council are kept to a minimum. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ECC 10th REPORT: PASSPORT UNION</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01662">5.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01663"><member>Lord GREENWOOD of ROSSENDALE</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the Tenth Report of the European Communities Committee on a passport union in the European Community (R/1874/75) (H.L. 58). The noble Lord said: My Lords, there has been for me a certain irony in the debate we have just listened to because when I made my maiden speech in your Lordships' House nine years ago it was in opposition to the order amalgamating the old Overseas Development Ministry into the Overseas Development Administration. I thought that it was a mistake then, and nothing I have heard this afternoon has made me change my point of view. I say it with the greatest respect and affection for the Minister who is to reply to this debate. In my early days in another place I was frequently not wholly in harmony with the policies pursued by Mr. Ernest Bevin, but my heart was lifted when, on one occasion, he was asked the aim of his foreign policy and he said,
<quote>"It is to go to Victoria Station, get a railway ticket, and go where the hell I like without a passport or anything else".</quote>
It looked to me at that time as though the promised land was just around the corner, but it was not. The Cold War flourished, espionage became more intense, and terrorism began to acquire something akin to respectability. And the abolition of the passport became more and more a pipedream.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01664">With those optimistic beginnings, I should never have expected that I should be speaking in your Lordships' House about the difficulties and dangers of getting rid of the passport system. But I am quite certain that all noble Lords who sat on the Select Committee and who studied this problem with care are fully seized of the difficulties and dangers that are involved. I should like to thank all noble Lords in the House who helped us to prepare the report; to wish the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, good
<col>750</col>
luck when he comes to make his maiden speech in a few minutes' time; to thank our officials, the Government departments, and the other bodies who gave evidence to us; and also to thank the Lord President of the Council whose advice was absolutely invaluable to us in our early days.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01665">We decided broadly that proof of identity will be needed so long as countries have to combat crime, including terrorism, or to control immigration, or to carry out deportations, or to conduct health checks. We must not fall into the trap of not appreciating that this country is not typical of most of our partners in the Community. We have a long island frontier; the points of entry are fairly easy to control; and if we did not have that advantage there would have to be a great deal more police supervision than I think would be generally acceptable to the people of this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01666">The proposals that we studied originated in the Commission in 1974, and they were twofold. The first was that all Community nationals should have a uniform passport. That is to say, a passport which would show the country from which they came but would also include the fact that that country was a member of the Community. The second aspect was that passport control at internal frontiers should be abolished. The second possibility was quickly abandoned by the Community, and I shall therefore confine myself to the former proposal which is, I think, one which is at any rate superficially attractive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01667">Your committee would welcome a change, but&#x2014;and I hope that this does not sound too Irish, if I dare use the adjective&#x2014;only if it is a change of form and not of substance. We say that because the authority of passports differs from one country to another; the issuing power inside the country differs; the scope of the protection they give differs as well. I do not think that any of us would want to surrender anything which we regarded as being a specifically British characteristic, or benefit, in the passport that we carry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01668">But that does not mean, of course, that we should not adapt our passports so that in using them travellers would be symbolising a new growth in internationalism as well as proclaiming their national pride in their own land, and we
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0384"/>
<col>751</col>
summed up our general view in paragraph 26 of the report:
<quote>"The Committee support the proposal for a uniform European passport, as a modest symbol of the Community's identity, provided that passports retain their national character. The Committee strongly urge Her Majesty's Government to take a constructive part in any discussions on this proposal".</quote>
I think there would be a great deal of support for that point of view, and in my view it reflects very badly on the Community that they have not made more rapid progress in that direction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01669">Some of the objections that have come up in the course of discussions have been almost too trivial for words. On page 16 in the statement provided for us by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office there is a section entitled:
<quote>"Obstacles to agreement on a standard European passport".</quote>
It says:
<quote>"1. There is disagreement between Germany and the United Kingdom over the use of languages in the passport, and over the form of the outside cover.</quote>
<quote>2. The United Kingdom favours the use of the national language plus either English or French. The Germans favour the use of all six official Community languages plus Irish. With regard to the front cover, the United Kingdom favours the name of the issuing state to appear above the words ' European Community ': The Germans would prefer the words ' European Community' at the top".</quote>
That really seems so trivial that I think it appalling that it should have been necessary for us to receive evidence on a matter of that kind. I am fairly sure, and I believe most of my noble friends on the committee are fairly sure, that this passport will come, but not yet, and I was greatly encouraged to discover that Commissioner Davignan, that most urbane and civilised of men, took the same view as we did and seemed to have high hopes of something being achieved, even if in the not too near future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01670">In the meantime we must do whatever else we can to ease the traveller's way, and I think the most promising aid to facilitate travel, and one worthy of study is the machine readable passport, a project which has been greatly helped by the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Soames, and certainly it appealed to every one of us who sat on the Select Committee. In paragraph 23 we used a sentence of which we were rather proud:
<col>752</col>
<quote>"At the turn of the twentieth century the passport came to terms with the camera; now is the time to bring it to terms with the computer".</quote>
In so doing, we moved the Select Committee, as it were, into the computer age because the machine readable passport is one which can be scanned by a machine and its details checked by computer. It would probably look like an existing passport with a machine readable section, rather like a credit card let into the cover. It would be readable by the human eye as well as by the machine; the information it absorbed would be quickly processed in the computer and basically it would have a number of advantages. It would be very quick; we have every reason to suppose it would be very accurate; it would be much less burdensome for the traveller; it would put less pressure on immigration officials; criminals could be more readily spotted and we could avoid those horrible black looks from which so many of us must have suffered at one time or another.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01671">The initiative in promoting a machine-readable passport came from the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the European Community have not entered this field. We were told by the Home Office that they were taking a leading role in international discussions about the standardisation of passports, but without any obvious results. Certainly we on the Committee were unanimous in supporting the principle of a machine-readable passport, and we should appreciate hearing from the Government what plans they have in this respect and what help they are giving to the necessary research.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01672">There is one other suggestion we make which I should bring to your Lordships' attention which should make travel easier, and it comes towards the end of our report. There we suggest that as long as travellers are obliged to carry identity documents there might be a case for adding extra information on a purely voluntary basis. I emphasise that we were determined that it must be on a purely voluntary basis and that nobody should have to have this additional information on unless it was at their own request. It would be possible to include details, for example, of the holder's blood group, it could give his National Health Service number or his status under other national health regulations. If one's passport, one's
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0385"/>
<col>753</col>
machine readable passport, included items of information of that kind it would probably be much more effective in ensuring that anyone taken ill abroad got the right treatment, and it would probably save them a great deal of expense as well. We found that when we put this to the Commission they were sympathetic to it and we hope it will not be lost sight of in the discussions which we hope will be restarting once again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01673">The standard European passport has the committee's support but it is probably not a project which is worth undertaking on its own. If, on the other hand, it were part of a general campaign to make travel easier and was linked with the adoption of machine readable passports, it could do much more for the average individual in the European Community than at least some of the Directives and regulations with which the committee is usually concerned. My Lords, I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01674">Moved, That this House takes note of the Tenth Report of the European Communities Committee on a passport union in the European Community (R/1874/75) (H.L. <i>58</i>).&#x2014;(<i>Lord Greenwood of Rossendale.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01675">5.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01676"><member>Baroness ROBSON of KIDDINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was delighted when I was invited by the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, to join this Committee to examine the possibilities of introducing a European passport. I must say at once that unfortunately, because of many other commitments I had, I was not able to be present at all the Committee meetings, for which I am deeply sorry, but I attended some of them.<lb/>
I accept every word the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, said about the possibilities of moving towards a European passport or a European passport union. I am slightly sad that we should have to come to your Lordships' House with such a limited recommendation at the end of our deliberations. Paragraph 15 says:
<quote>"The Committee were therefore glad to learn from Commissioner Davignan that he considers this part of the proposals dead".</quote>
That is the part dealing with the passport union. I may be too much of an idealist, but I would say it was an over-statement to say I am glad the proposal is dead.
<col>754</col>
I am one who believed that the creation of a European passport union would be instrumental in welding together the different peoples of the Community, and making a whole of it; so I cannot say that I am glad that the proposal is dead.<lb/>
I accept that the difficulties that exist at the moment are such that we cannot proceed along those lines. As has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, one of the saddest difficulties and greatest obstacles to the creation of a European passport union is the increase in terrorism that has taken place ever since the idea of the abolition of internal frontiers was first mooted. This I believe is a terrible indictment of modern society and an enormous threat to the democratic way of life in which all members of the Community believe; and this is what makes it so tragic.<lb/>
In the report we also refer to the passport unions that exist in certain parts of the Community, such as the Nordic Union. We state&#x2014;and it is true&#x2014;that it is obviously easier to create a union among a small number of peoples of not very large populations, and of a very homogeneous way of life. I still believe that we can learn something from the way in which they are working their kind of union. I have made some inquiries, and it seems to me that the Nordic Passport Union works without the immigration laws and the terrorist laws being identical in all the countries. This is an interesting point. Immigration into the Nordic States is purely by work permit. If an immigrant enters illegally through Denmark, for instance, and he does not have a work permit, he then makes his way to Sweden and is discovered there without a work permit. On his passport it will be clearly stated that he entered through the Danish border. There is an agreement between the four Nordic nations that a person of that kind is immediately returned to Denmark because it is that country's responsibility to deal with that illegal immigrant. I believe that that kind of arrangement could be extended to an area greater than the four Nordic countries. Unfortunately the tourist arrangement in the Nordic Union is identical to that of many other countries among our European partners, under which a person has a permission to stay for three months and as he books in, a hotel is forced to register the fact that it has a foreign visitor
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0386"/>
<col>755</col>
staying&#x2014;something which we in this country do not believe is the right kind of thing for us.<lb/>
One objection contained in evidence given to us in the committee came from the British Airports Authority and it related to the problem of what would happen about duty-free drinks if there was a passport union. The Airports Authority claimed that it made enough on duty-free drinks to enable it to keep airport charges at a reasonable level. I inquired about what happens in Scandinavia. Although they have a complete passport union, if one travels between Sweden and Denmark, for instance, and one is in Denmark for more than 24 hours, one is entitled to take duty-free drinks back from that country to Sweden. Your Lordships may ask how does this happen if one does not have a passport and one has free access; it happens on one's return ticket. It is possible, I believe, to work systems of that kind.<lb/>
We should not assume that a passport union in the Community is dead for ever. If we do, we are abrogating our belief in the Community as a whole. I accept that it is not feasible at the moment. Nevertheless, I am sad that we have to come to the House and give your Lordships that advice.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, mentioned one other point related to the computerised passport, particularly with reference to health information being stated on a passport, and I agree with him a hundred per cent. that this should be voluntary, not compulsory. I wonder whether even before we have a European passport Her Majesty's Government would look into the matter so as to help people who are having problems with Form E 111. If nationals of this country voluntarily ask to have health information put on their British passports at the moment, would that not be helpful to the people of this country? I join with the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, in sincerely hoping that the Government will do their best to further this first step towards a uniform European passport.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01678"><member>Lord FAIRFAX of CAMERON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that a maiden speech in your Lordships' House should preferably be short and uncontentious, and
<col>756</col>
should be delivered on a subject of which the novice knows something. Of these criteria I can promise to fulfil the first, and I do not expect to infringe the second, for I hope that it would not be presumptions to say that at the beginning of its deliberations the committee found the question wholly uncontentious. This was a subject not to inflame passions, but to be approached with an open mind. There were no strong partisan views. For that reason it is perhaps a particularly appropriate subject for a maiden speech. So far as the third condition is concerned, I should like, first, to thank the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood of Rossendale, for having given me the opportunity to acquire some expertise on this subject. It is an opportunity for which I am particularly grateful. So, although I do not pretend to speak with any great expertise on the subject, nevertheless I can come before your Lordships feeling less like David before Goliath than I otherwise might have done.<lb/>
Turning now to the substance of the report, let me say at first that I shall try not to cover any of the ground that has been covered in previous speeches. There are two distinct limbs to the report. The first concerns the question of introducing a uniform passport. The second is the much more ambitious concept of establishing a passport union, a free travel area. It was thought that within such an area the citizen, whether or not from a member country, would be able to roam freely without check or hindrance. It is a grand idea, and it is entirely consistent with the ethos of the Treaty of Rome and its provision for freedom of movement. Proponents of such a scheme could point &#x2014;as the noble Baroness has done&#x2014;to the Nordic travel area and the special arrangements that at present exist between the United Kingdom and Ireland. But unfortunately the problems posed and the hurdles to be vaulted are enormous.<lb/>
Both the schemes that I have mentioned depend upon a far greater homogeneity of policy and law than exists at the moment between, for instance, the United Kingdom and either Italy or Germany. The implications for immigration of both humans and animals, security, and the control of terrorism and crime are vast, and in my view are undoubtedly unacceptable to member Governments, given the state of our nations at the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0387"/>
<col>757</col>
beginning of the 1980s. For instance, the obvious trick for someone wanting illicitly to get himself, his cat, or his cocaine to a particular place within the Community would be to enter the Community at a slack point and from there he could expect to travel as freely as a bird throughout the countries within the Community It seems fairly clear to me, then, that attractive though the concept of a Common European Community free travel area may be, at the moment it is not a viable proposition.<lb/>
Furthermore, given that the aim is to make travel not only easier but swifter, it is difficult to see how passport union, standing by itself, could achieve this without the simultaneous abolition of other checks at frontiers which are not based on the passport. I am thinking of things like Customs and health checks. For example, I understand the preoccupation with preventing the arrival on our shores of rabies. These checks clearly cannot go, but they certainly hold the traveller up; and the time it generally takes to go through passport control fades into insignificance in comparison with the time it takes a juggernaut driver to clear all his documentation with the relevant authority at a frontier, or for an airline passenger to retrieve his luggage, if he can find it at all. It is not for nothing that a cynical slogan for modern air travel may be, "Breakfast in Brussels, lunch in London, luggage in Los Angeles". With substantial problems like these, to abolish passport control within the Community would, I feel, be misguided, would help little and would simply open up Pandora's box.<lb/>
However, as your Lordships have heard, there are two limbs to this question which the Committee has studied in its report, and realistic prospects of progress look brighter on the second limb, which is that of introducing a standard-form European passport for use by citizens of European Community countries. In the first place, I feel it would be a tangible symbol of European unity. At the same time, I recognise that, particularly in this country, there may he a fervent reluctance to use a document which could be seen as yet another token of the subjugation of this country's individuality and identity to Europeanism. Without doubt a passport is something which people really feel
<col>758</col>
represents, not a nationality but also nationalism and patriotism. For that reason, I do not think that the possibility of strong, popular reaction against the possibility of introducing a common-form European passport should be underestimated.<lb/>
On the other hand, standardisation would offer a useful opportunity to incorporate into the passport some of the new innovations about which we have heard this evening. In the first place, it seems worth while looking into the question of making passports machine-readable. This would mean that passports could be scanned electronically by a machine, which would itself be linked to a central data bank. It is clear that a method like that would be much more efficient in, for instance, detecting those people who in the normal course of events would be refused entry into a country, such as, fugitive offenders. There would be no need to have those massive lists of names, the size of telephone directories, which you find at some ports of entry, where you have the hapless passport authorities flicking through them. With a machine-readable passport, the name would trigger the base in the data bank, and somebody who was not meant to enter the country could quickly be detected far more efficiently. Therefore, I would hope that not only would a machine-readable passport be more efficient but it might also be quicker, which is really, I suppose, the essence of what we are talking about.<lb/>
Secondly, there has been talk of including in the passport data relating to health. It seems to me that the bearer's blood group could very usefully be included, and those further details which at the moment are supposed to be included on Form E111. Before I sat on this Committee I certainly had not heard of Form E111, and I do not think anybody else had; but, simultaneously, there appeared in the papers several advertisements explaining its use to the readers of those papers. I think the substance of it is that if you fill in this form you are entitled to a certain amount of reciprocal, free medical attention in those countries within the European Community where it is applicable. I was unfortunate enough to be involved in a car accident in France this summer, and I know that none of the people on board who were injured&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0388"/>
<col>759</col>
and, luckily, that did not include me&#x2014;was armed with this E111; and they were therefore denied the opportunity of being afforded medical aid on a free basis, to which they might otherwise have been entitled if they had been armed with E111s. If that sort of information could be included in the passport, I feel that would be a very worthwhile innovation.<lb/>
In conclusion, my Lords, I feel that, superficially, a free travel area probably holds enormous appeal. It is a delightful thought, that you could skip within the European Community from one country to another without having to show any form of identification at the frontiers; and it would be the essential test, I suppose, of a European Community which had the attribute of a single country. But, of course, in practice it is totally unattainable; and it could not be achieved simply by abolishing passport checks, as I have tried to show. There are other checks which simply cannot go, so abolishing passport control would not help at all.<lb/>
Conversely, what is possibly attainable &#x2014;namely, the introduction of a common-form European passport, which would be a tangible symbol of European unity&#x2014;might, I feel, attract universal derision, almost, from those citizens of the European Community, and particularly people in this country, who would feel that it was a token of the further erosion of their national identity; and I feel that there might be a strong reaction against any mooted idea of introducing such passports. But if a new passport like that could be shown to have proper advantages, incorporating the innovations of which I have talked&#x2014;more efficiency, more speed to the traveller&#x2014;then it may be an appropriate moment to attempt to launch a common-form European passport in the continuing interest of European unity and harmony.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01680"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the first opportunity I have had in your Lordships' House to congratulate a maiden speaker, and I should like to do so most sincerely for a very lucid, articulate and concise speech. The only thing I found missing was the controversy. However, I thought that, in his opening, t0he noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, also felt that controversy
<col>760</col>
might be in order on another occasion, perhaps, and I am certain that he will enter into any controversies which arise in this House. On behalf of your Lordships, I should like to thank him for his maiden speech.<lb/>
This is a very welcome and very thorough report, and I found that it was a mine of useful information. One of the things that is happening in this country is that when we talk about the European Community we all get obsessed with sheepmeat, wine lakes and beef mountains, and in many ways we begin to lose sight of what perhaps we should be doing in Europe, and of what we are perhaps not doing. Because I believe that people in this country feel that they are not part of the European Community, and that they are no more part of it than they were on the day of accession&#x2014;&#x2014;1st January, 1973. I think that this House and the other place, and politicians generally, ought to be doing more, rather than just talking about the problems of sheepmeat. We know that those problems are serious, but rather than talking about all the economic difficulties I think we ought to talk about some of the wider things that we can be doing in Europe&#x2014;and a uniform passport is one of the ways in which we can move in that direction.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenwood of Rossendale, quoted Ernie Bevin over 30 years ago, when he spoke of how he would like to see people moving all over the world without the necessity of passports. The problem, I think, is that when Ernie Bevin said that it was in the time when Lancaster aircraft were converted to carry eight people and they were using old-fashioned York and Hastings aircraft, not when they were carrying 31 million passengers in and out of Britain, as they did in 1978. I think that is one of the problems: it is the sheer volume. In the late 1940s, during the term of office of the first Labour Government after the war, I do not think anybody believed that there would be the rush, the bustle, the movement of people that there now is every day of the week, every week of the year. That has partially made the difference. It is easy for a PLO terrorist to get on a plane from the Middle East and to be in London within half a day and for terrorists, of whatever sort, to be moving all over the world, threatening
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0389"/>
<col>761</col>
people wherever they go, because the world has shrunk in terms of passenger travel.<lb/>
I think that some of the suggestions in the report for removing some of the difficulties of travel ought to be investigated by the Government&#x2014;outside, in a way, the European Community and the way we handle this question within the Commission. We have to remember that the Commission set up a working party which has done absolutely nothing for the last two years. It may be that this Government ought to give some impetus on the problems of obtaining and using uniform passports. There is no doubt that one of the problems about travel arises when people arrive at their destination: the difficulty is the time that people sometimes have to spend in waiting to clear through immigration and customs and in waiting for their baggage which, as the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax, has said, may be in Los Angeles while they are in London.<lb/>
I think that the question raised in the report about the machine-readable passport ought to be seriously considered. Perhaps we have some problems at London Airport when we arrive, but I do not think our problems are anything like the problems of arrival in New York when they go through the book that they have to check you out, or check your visa. You may be waiting in the queue for almost an hour to get through immigration control. Certainly, the US, which prides itself on its computerisation, ought to be looking at this as seriously as we are.<lb/>
One of the things which is noticeable when travelling by car in Europe&#x2014;apart from the controls in London and Brussels&#x2014;is that for the rest of the time, you easily can sail across, or motor across, borders between Germany and Luxembourg and Luxembourg and France without (unless a terrorist check is on) much let or hindrance. That is noticeable because we happen to be on the external frontier.<lb/>
On the question of a uniform passport, I may say that I was fortunate to be one of the delegated Members to the European Parliament for three years. Members of that Parliament had what was to all intents and purposes a uniform passport. They insist on calling it a <i>Laissez-passer.</i> Nevertheless, it was a uniform passport.<lb/>
<col>762</col>
I never used mine when I came into Britain. Some of my colleagues did so and had great difficulty in getting past immigration with that uniform passport. I did not use mine because the officials had to read through everything before they decided whether one was allowed in. But it was a uniform passport.<lb/>
I never heard of any difficulty which was occasioned by the order in which the languages were used on the European passport. This one, starts in Danish and ends in Dutch. Nobody, as far as I know, argued in the European Parliament about whether their language was first, second, third, fourth or fifth. Certainly, the German objection is a rather strange one, in terms of the number of languages, in wanting the addition of Irish. In the European Parliament itself none of the documents is in Irish. They have the standard languages but they do not distribute documents in Irish. I found it strange that the Germans wanted suddenly to introduce Irish on to the passport.<lb/>
There was one thing in the report which I was hoping it would bring out further, but it did not. I understand the Committee went to London Airport and talked with immigration officers. I wish there had been in the report some written evidence from them as to their views on the introduction of a uniform passport or the relaxation of passport rules.<lb/>
One of the other things which I think the Government should think about&#x2014;again it is outside this report&#x2014;is the question of Form E 111. I think it is serious because we are told that citizens from all over the world can come to this country and receive medical treatment. There are people who say that it is abused. I do not believe it is. I do not think that somebody who comes to this country on holiday or business and who suddenly falls ill should have to worry about whether they can pay the sum of <i>x, y or z.</i><lb/>
It seems to me that the Government should be working on reciprocity, certainly within the Community, without the bother of E 111. I would take the view that the production of a British passport, without any documentation, ought to be all that is necessary to receive medical treatment. The document raises the question of how many people apply for form
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0390"/>
<col>763</col>
E 111. I did so before I went on holiday. I think it is another burden, in a sense, on the National Insurance offices. They have to do this job, to issue these documents, have them filled in and arrange the necessary signatures and stamping. I see no reason why, if you are a British subject, and there is a reciprocal arrangement with some European country, you should not use your passport as proof; and that that is all that is needed.<lb/>
I think that one of the other anomalies that I was disturbed about in the report &#x2014;again it is outside the terms of reference of the report&#x2014;was the letter from Shelton Orsborn on the question of fuel importation into Europe. I found it ludicrous that coaches with parties of tourists going to France were being stopped and having the diesel fuel in the tanks measured and, if it was over 100 litres, they were fined on the spot and had all sorts of problems. Not only that, but a Mr. Gilby, who wrote the letter, said that they could be going along the road after leaving the port and be stopped again and fined again. And they had the same problem in crossing the German border. I do not think that we ought to accept that. It is in the report and I think if it is true&#x2014;and I have no reason to doubt it&#x2014;the Government should be doing something about that outside the Community purely on the basis of some reciprocal arrangement. I understand that the same thing does not apply when French or German coaches come to this country. Regarded from those points of view alone, it is a valuable report.<lb/>
One of the other things I should like to do is to congratulate the Passport Office on their work over the past 10 years. From the figures given in the report, we learn that they issued this year half a million more passports than they did 10 years ago; and the staffing figure is only nine above what it was 10 years ago. That is remarkable. We hear a lot of criticism in Parliament, in this House, in the other place and outside, of civil servants; and the criticism in very many cases we know is unjust. We ought to congratulate the Passport Office on their work.<lb/>
It is a very valuable report. I think that if the Government do not act on the uniform passport&#x2014;and I realise the diffi-
<col>764</col>
culties; and the report outlines the difficulties&#x2014;certainly some of the points raised in this report ought to be raised outside the Commission and the European Assembly and dealt with fairly quickly by this Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01682"><member>Viscount AMORY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like with enthusiasm to support the congratulations which the noble Lord, Lord Murray, offered my noble friend Lord Fairfax of Cameron on his excellent maiden speech. I do so with added enthusiasm because, 70 years ago, either the noble Lord's grandfather or his great-grandfather took me out shooting. That was 70 years ago, when I was 9&#x00BE; years old. I do not want my noble friend Lord Fairfax to interrupt me at this point, for he will probably say: "No, it was my great-great-grandfather who took you out shooting."<lb/>
I agree entirely with the observations that our chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood of Rossendale, has made and the excellent exposition he made, which means that there is very little I need say. Also, I agree with the excellent points made by my noble friend Lord Fairfax of Cameron. I hope that anything I say will be treated with reverence because, as I told the committee, my first passport&#x2014;and, for all I know, the passport I am still using&#x2014;begins: "I, George Nathaniel Marquess Curzon &#x2026;" which shows that it is now quite a dated document.<lb/>
There are many burning issues in the EEC now; but from the evidence the committee received, the passport union does not seem to be among them, either in the United Kingdom or in other EEC countries, as things stand at present. Anything approaching passion was notably absent from the evidence that we received. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, said, the original proposal for the passport union seemed attractive and in line with EEC philosophy. In the five years since then, as the report said, discussions have been desultory and progress minimal. The original proposals, the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, said, involved two practical steps: a common form of passport, and the termination of internal and external checks.<lb/>
It seems astonishing, so far as the first goes, that four or five years' discussions at official levels should not have produced
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0391"/>
<col>765</col>
an agreed common form. Active interest, support and prodding at ministerial level does not seem to have taken place. What we are talking about is, of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, said, a change of form and no great change of substance. It is difficult to believe that, if Ministers had exerted pressure on their officials, the relatively simple matter of devising a common form would not have been solved by now. It must be remembered of course that the passport that results must be usable for all countries and not only for EEC travel. In passing, I should like to say how much I agree with the tribute that the noble Lord, Lord Murray of Gravesend, paid to the officials of the passport office. It is very well deserved indeed.<lb/>
As regards the other aim, of the removal of checks, the practical difficulties are obviously much more formidable. Sadly, it needs saying that today the needs of security and even immigration control seem greater than ever, and the police forces in every country have a hard enough job to do at present with security. It is clear the possession of some means of identification for people crossing frontiers, both external and internal, is going to continue to be necessary in present conditions. So unfortunately the laudable aim of the late Ernest Bevin for absolutely free, documentless travel is not at present realisable.<lb/>
As the committee say in paragraph 26 of their report, since passport control cannot be ended, the object must be to make control as light and quick as possible This seems an eminently sensible approach. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, that one way in which the committee were impressed was with the possibility of devising a machine-readable passport which would also be capable of course of being read by the human eye. This we were told was probably technically feasible and therefore should be practically considered. Another was by the incorporation on a standard passport of certain additional information relating to health requirements. The noble Lord, Lord Murray, doubts whether they would be needed as an addition. If they were, and if they are, then the question should be considered whether they could not be incorporated in a single passport.<lb/>
We were not, however, optimistic about
<col>766</col>
progress being made even with these limited objectives unless Ministers took a renewed interest in these questions and provided an impetus. Vicomte Davignon seemed alone to have retained a degree of hopeful optimism. There are some issues of course about which, in spite of lack of progress, one can feel comforted by what one of our distinguished predecessors called the "inevitability of gradualness". In this case, there is no such inevitability of progress with the number of pressing problems which the EEC has. I believe that the committee are right in the report which has been prepared under the beneficent and wise chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood, to urge Her Majesty's Government to press forward with a limited number of improvements and simplifications which seem to the committee to be well within the field of practicability.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01684"><member>Lord PLANT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I too pay tribute to the excellent speech of the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron. I hope that we shall hear more from him. I want also to pay tribute to the excellent chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Greenwood, who gave us a very wide brief and helped us to prepare a document which I think will be of some value to the Government in pressing ahead with the issues that we have before us. When Ernest Bevin made his statement I agree that there was not the flow of passengers and travellers that there is today. We have to accept that it is not possible to do what he thought could be achieved even during his tenure as Foreign Secretary. Terrorism and other issues mean that the passport has to be retained.<lb/>
However, if we have to retain the passport and we are members of the European Economic Community the Government must make things more flexible and thus give less cause for irritation to visitors to the United Kingdom and to citizens of the United Kingdom visiting other parts of the EEC. While it is true that generally the United Kingdom immigration service investigate outward and inward travellers more thoroughly than most other countries, they certainly give an air of great efficiency and a complete absence of official or bureaucratic rudeness&#x2014;something that I have encountered in other countries. Some travellers seem afraid of immigration
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0392"/>
<col>767</col>
and customs formalities; probably they have read too many novels. If therefore we can not only speed the flow, but also reduce personal confrontation, we shall do much to help travellers. So I believe that a further review by the Commission may lead to some harmonisation of passport laws. That is surely not too difficult if we are to make steady progress to further integration. A machine-readable passport clearly has to come. The committee are right in pressing the Commission to study seriously machine-readable passports and brush aside the many difficulties which will be suggested. The present leader of the House told us that he was very much in favour of the machine-readable passport, and if your Lordships read page 41 of the report you will see what he had to say.<lb/>
Like my noble friend Lord Murray of Gravesend, I accept that too many of us think of ourselves as within the EEC but still not part of it. It would help towards further integration and a feeling of unity if we had a common passport. It should be of the same colour and the same format but retaining distinguishing sovereign marks, probably on the cover. I, too, am greatly in favour of some health statistics in the passport and of using it in some way to help travellers with the problems of form E 111. I think the suggestions made by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, and my noble friend Lord Murray should be considered by the Government.<lb/>
The committee have done well to urge further consideration of the whole issue and I believe they have given some impetus to the Government and, I hope, to the Commission to review these problems with alacrity. Like my noble friend Lord Murray, I had a <i>laissez-passer</i> when I was a member of the governing body of the International Labour Organisation. I certainly never used it to get into the United Kingdom&#x2014;it would only have delayd matters&#x2014;but it was accepted very freely in Switzerland and in France.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Greenwood has emphasised some of the objections we encountered. Many of them, as he said, were trivial but they were a demonstration of national pride, and if the European Economic Community means anything for the future it is that some national traditions have gradually to dis-
<col>768</col>
appear. I believe that the acceptance of this report by your Lordships will give a much needed impetus to the Commission urgently to consider the many problems which clearly have to be solved.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01686"><member>Viscount ULLSWATER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should very much like to add my congratulations to those of others before me on the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Fairfax. He has shown us a glimpse of his agile brain and, with his barrister's mind, he will be able to enlighten your Lordships on divers subjects in the future. I am sure we would welcome that. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood of Rossendale, for putting down the Motion before us tonight. The noble Lord has put the case for acceptance of this report most succinctly and has picked out really all the salient points the committee discussed from the report. I had the honour to be a member of that committee and I think it came to the only conclusion that was possible. I would just go over one or two of the opinions they gave.<lb/>
In the first instance, there is still a need for an identity paper of some kind, and the passport is the internationally recognised one. It provides a check on the movement of criminals and terrorists, and I would venture to say that the last few days have shown how difficult it is to take men like Jacques Mesrine or to apprehend an escaped convict like Michael O'Rourke, who must have passed out of one country and into another undetected. I do not think it is fair to the public at large to allow such men to wander around Europe unchallenged, and so a passport is needed to check undesirables. Immigration control is another stumbling block for the free movement of people from one country to another and, while these controls remain, a passport showing the nationality of the holder will be required.<lb/>
The committee went on to press for a machine-readable passport. In my own mind, it will not significantly speed up the traveller because the time spent on passport control is not as great as that spent on the baggage claim area for a holiday or business journey. Immigration control will always take a certain length of time which an EEC passport, as opposed to a national passport, will not
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0393"/>
<col>769</col>
alter. However, on the plus side, a machine-readable passport will allow the provision of a greater number of ingress or egress points controlled by a supervisor and, where baggage is not involved, a faster passage through frontiers.<lb/>
Perhaps the most important improvement to present-day passports, which has been mentioned once or twice before, would be the inclusion of the health status of the holder: by that I mean not only the current vaccination certificates needed for travel all over the world but, perhaps more importantly, with the harmonisation of health controls among Member States, the provision of free hospitalisation and medical attention for United Kingdom passport holders in the eight, and soon to be 11, other countries of the EEC&#x2014;thereby overcoming the necessity of filling in form E 111 before the journey is started. The foregoing matters led the committee to their conclusion as pointed in the report. It is a conclusion with which I concur, and I hope Her Majesty's Government take note of this report and are more prepared than their predecessors to see the move continued.<lb/>
I should like just to ask your Lordships to cast your minds forward to the reasonably near future&#x2014;say in five years, or 1984. I think there will be a demand for greater information and the compiling of more statistics to control a more mobile world, with improved communications. Government bodies will be looking to monitor more closely the shifts in population, and their make-up on an age pattern, in order to provide the educational and welfare facilities that will then be needed. I believe we must take a pragmatic view of what life may be like in the future, and I think it is unreasonable to believe that the freedom of movement which we think of as being a possibility now will not in fact become possible. It may prove difficult to accommodate those from the poorer parts of the North of England, Southern Italy, parts of Spain and Portugal or the Greek islands who migrate to well-paid jobs in Germany, Belgium or the South-East of England. It would put a great strain on the social and welfare provisions of these relatively small areas, and the setting up of so-called "ghetto labour-forces" which upset all the local inhabitants. This touches also on immigration and its control. I believe that the integration of different ethnic popula-
<col>770</col>
tions will not take place if there are too many migrants to be swallowed into a native population. I do not discount, either, the added pressure of colour integration.<lb/>
My prediction, if it should be spoken of in that way, is of a world of even greater violence&#x2014;not from the general breakdown of law and order but from the upsurge of more vociferous minority groups, each with its own interpretation of freedom. Crime, or the detection of crime, is increasing and criminals have a tendency to resort to greater violence to achieve their unhealthy aims. Community responsibility is diminished by the onslaught of so much collective State intervention. This intervention is the root of documentation and, because of this need for increased documentation, it will be necessary for us all to carry a form of identification permanently with us. I think that George Orwell has come uncomfortably close to the truth. Between now and 1984, however, the move towards common citizenship in Europe may be apparent, and I urge Her Majesty's Government to reflect on the content of this report and to support the conclusion that the Select Committee reached.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01688"><member>Lord INGLEWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should first like to add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron. I think he made a good choice of subject for a maiden speech, and it certainly was a good maiden speech. I shall try not to repeat the points that have already been made in this debate, but it will be difficult to keep entirely to new matter. First, I shall mention Mr. Bevin, because when passports are talked about his remark often comes to the fore, and I do not think he is by any means the only one among us who has had that romantic view. Certainly, many people to whom I have talked since this committee was sitting echoed his wishes, and felt that probably those in charge of the different systems of control that we have at frontiers are altogether too bureaucratic. We in the committee did not find that at all, but I think that the general public believes it.<lb/>
It is no good being romantic today. One hundred years ago there was much less travelling abroad and a passport was
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0394"/>
<col>771</col>
not strictly necessary. But over the last 50 years there has been a great increase in travel by all classes. People are now travelling more often, they are travelling farther, they are travelling faster, there is an increase in crime&#x2014;not just terrorism, but serious crime and minor crime&#x2014;and there is greater awareness of health hazards. All this points to the fact that we must have some form of checks&#x2014;identity documents&#x2014;and checkpoints where documents are examined.<lb/>
What we in Parliament, and Governments, have to do is to search for a fair balance between a too tight bureaucratic system of control, and a system that is so lax that it is ineffective. We, of course, are members of the European Community but we are not always so ready to notice that we are in a different position from other countries because we are an island. That means, in particular, that our controls at points of entry on the frontier can be very different from what there would be if we had nothing but land frontiers. Also, as a country we have a great dislike of identity cards, such as is not shared by other members of the Community who find them of great use.<lb/>
Not so long ago a German police officer of some seniority, who was on a course in this country, said to me, "What the English fail to see when they criticise the German system of identity cards is that in Germany there are far fewer arrests on the streets and far fewer nights spent in detention at police stations, because we have a much better system of identification and more knowledge of people's permanent place of abode". That hardly comes within this debate, but it shows that some of the things that happen on the Continent which we dismiss may not necessarily have all the disadvantages that we are apt to suppose. What we want is a system that is acceptable and that is not extravagant in manpower.<lb/>
One suggestion, which has not yet been mentioned this evening, is: Why can we not have passports examined on boat trains, such as between the Channel ports and London? It happens on the Continent. Surely that would save a great deal of time here. I knew a British police officer who, some time ago, was on official attachment to a Continental force and who found that part of his duties on
<col>772</col>
the other side of the Channel was examining passports on trains. He told me that one should not run away with the idea that such a check can be other than a very simple examination, because if you have some slight suspicion that some detail has been scratched out and something else written in, you can hardly do much in a railway compartment in poor light to check with six or more passengers very close to you. Further, unless you maintain a certain speed in going down the train, the chances are that the train arrives at the station where many of the passengers will get out without their passports having been examined at all.<lb/>
All the same, I am sure that we are right to work towards a passport that is, in part, readable by machine. Such a passport could still be read in the ordinary way by control staff, because there are not many countries which would find it worth their while, at the start at least, to make a very big investment in the equipment for reading such documents, which has to be the same all over the world. There is just one other point about the passport that is machine-readable, which has not been mentioned. There will be some number or code embodied in it, which the owner of the passport would know but which no thief could read. The owner of the passport would push it into a slot and would tap out a code. If the code that he typed out was the same as the invisible code on the passport he would get a green light and go through. If it was not, then a red light would come on&#x2014;I am speaking figuratively&#x2014;and some official down the line who was checking at the barrier would see that there was something wrong and would go and see for himself.<lb/>
But none of these checks that we are talking about is any real defence against incompetence or sheer awkwardness. I went to Czechoslovakia on business only about a month ago, and on my return the staff were just pure awkward. It was very easy going in, and my colleague was even asked why a Member of your Lordships' House did not have a special passport and should be travelling on an ordinary passport. So much for the classless Communist Eastern Europe! But on the way back I was held up for a very long time, for no good reason that I could see, except that the men at the barrier wandered into
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0395"/>
<col>773</col>
a vineyard alongside to pick grapes. A machine-readable passport is no defence against that kind of mentality.<lb/>
I am glad that the EEC have given up the idea of checks at internal frontiers. It would be placing an impossible task on the staff checking documents on the perimeter. Even if, in theory, we harmonised the immigration rules of the different members of the Community, there would frequently still be special regulations dealing with health and so on. The amount of knowledge and information that would have to be in the heads of those checking passports at the perimeter is beyond what one could expect of any official.<lb/>
There is one other point that has not been mentioned. Although we talk of other countries having identity cards and, to some extent, duplicating the system by having both a passport and an identity card, we in this country issue a so-called Visitor's Passport as well as the normal one. I heard not long ago of the case of a man charged with drug offences, who when his passport had run out had obtained a Visitor's Passport and had since been travelling about the Mediterranean. I thought it was worth going to a main post office this morning to find out whether I could get one too. I got an application form and found that if I signed only once at the bottom&#x2014;a false declaration&#x2014;I could have a Visitor's Passport handed to me across the counter. There was no reason for this application to be countersigned by anyone else, and by making just one false declaration, saying that I did not hold another valid passport, it would have been given to me and I could have shown it to your Lordships here this afternoon. This is something that we ought to look into.<lb/>
I have also been told by a friend in the police that, having got the second document, I could go abroad on it with my real passport in my pocket. I could then give my real passport to some friend who might like to come to this country, but who would rank as an illegal immigrant and come back on any Visitor's Passport. With my real passport he could then unpick it and fake it in various ways. Tam asking whether the existence of these Visitors' Passports may well contribute to the number of real passports falling into wrong hands. I must not expand on

that, but I thought that the point was worth making.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01689"><member>Viscount AMORY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the point made by my noble friend is very well worth making, and I hope he will pursue it further. What he told me about the ease with which you can get these Visitors' Passports really horrified me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01690"><member>Lord INGLEWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it horrified me, too, and that is why I went to a post office to check. There is, perhaps, a perfectly good reason and purpose behind it, but it seems to me that it is all too easy to get something which is called a passport and which has the same validity when travelling around the countries which are listed in it. When the noble Lord winds up, no doubt he will be able to say something about all this. I do not want to exaggerate or give the wrong impression, but I do think that the present position invites cheating.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01691"><member>If we have common rules for the issue of passports within the Community, we ought also to work towards common rules for refusing passports and for taking them away in the very rare cases where this should happen.

We must move step by step.<lb/>
One speaker mentioned that after a long period very little progress had been made by the Commission and their officials. I hope that this debate will encourage all those concerned to look again at this whole question and to take some steps forward, even if they cannot take all the steps forward that we feel are desirable at this time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01693"><member>Lord BRUCE of DONINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on this side of the House and I am sure all noble Lords wish to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Greenwood of Rossendale, and his committee on the production of yet another excellent report. Despite its slimness, this report is encyclopaedic when one considers the extent of the information that it contains. After reading through it, one is bound
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0396"/>
<col>775</col>
to know a very great deal indeed about the underlying reasons for bringing forward proposals for some kind of passport union in Europe and also about some of the facts which have a bearing upon it.<lb/>
I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, on his maiden speech. Bearing in mind that it was non-controversial, it displayed a degree of virtuosity. We look forward very much indeed to being informed by him when, as is inevitable after the passage of time, he adopts a more controversial role.<lb/>
Turning to the points which have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, I do not propose to deal with them myself. However, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, will be able to comment upon the remarks that were made by the noble Lord during the latter part of his speech.<lb/>
Today we are considering a report produced by the Select Committee on the European Communities, of which we are invited to take note. It has arisen from a communiqu&#x00E9; issued at the European Summit meeting held in Paris in 1974. This provided for a working party which, among other things would&#x2014;
<quote>"study the possibility of establishing a Passport Union and, in anticipation of this, the introduction of a uniform passport.&#x2026; It will, in particular, provide for stage-by-stage harmonization of legislation affecting aliens and for the abolition of passport control within the Community".</quote>
If there is one thing which has emerged from the report and, indeed, from the contributions of your Lordships this evening, it is that the question of the abolition of passport control is not, in the words of Commissioner Davignon himself, for mature consideration at the present time. This is putting it at its mildest. So it is not perhaps surprising that much of this afternoon's debate has centred around whether there should or should not be a European passport. This implies, I suggest, although it has not been directly stated, that so far as we in the United Kingdom are concerned a European passport should be in substitution for a British passport. It has to be considered, I think, in that context.<lb/>
I gathered the impression this afternoon that many noble Lords regard the British passport as very little more than a travel
<col>776</col>
document. The report makes it quite clear that it is much more than that. Indeed, this is implicit in the words which appear on the front of every passport:
<quote>"Her Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs requires, in the name of Her Majesty, all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may he necessary".</quote>
The words "requests" and "requires" are of some significance because they imply to the holder of the passport, in so far as this can be perceived, appreciated and understood by those in other countries, that the whole power of the unitary State is behind it. As the report states at paragraph 6:
<quote>"A passport has more than Community significance. It provides <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the nationality of the bearer from which the possibility of protection by the issuing State may flow".</quote>
Indeed, this is why most people in the United Kingdom are quite proud of their British passport. It is evidence of nationality and it carries with it the implication that if the holder gets into difficulty the power and influence of the United Kingdom, in so far as this is apprehended in the other states concerned, is placed at their disposal. For example, if one is in difficulty abroad one may with confidence take one's United Kingdom passport to the Embassy, and one does receive such assistance as the Embassy is able to provide. It is therefore a document of some value.<lb/>
It has been suggested that it would be better if we had a European Economic Community passport. Of course, this would be a different document, because it would not be issued by a unitary State; it would not be issued on behalf of a coherent body having a coherent body of laws; and it would not have the same degree of united implication that the ordinary national passport has. Indeed, it is nowhere suggested in the report that the issue of a European passport would make it any easier for anybody to go through the existing passport controls. It has not been shown in any part of the evidence that travel delays would be minimised. However, the point has been made by my noble friend Lord Murray of Gravesend and, indeed, by others that the issue of a European passport and its accepted use would somehow be taken as a symbol of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0397"/>
<col>777</col>
our commitment to European untyi. Those are the main grounds upon which the adoption of a European passport has been commended this afternoon to your Lordships.<lb/>
I venture to put forward the idea that we may have got it the wrong way round. Perhaps it would be better to work for practical unity within Europe and for the closer coming together of the Member States of Europe to a point where it would be possible progressively to abandon some of the internal controls. Then, when that was done, a European passport would in fact symbolise a practical unity that had been achieved and would mean something.<lb/>
So I think there is a danger that we might support the idea of a European passport purely as a symbol, because there is a point where a symbol can become a gimmick. I have ventured to make the point many times not only in your Lordships' House but also in Europe that the great difficulty about securing progress in the European Economic Community is that from time to time&#x2014;in fact almost perpetually&#x2014;Commissioners and others invite our eyes to contemplate distant vistas and to devote a tremendous amount of time to debating things like economic and monetary union which, as we know, cannot be achieved for some considerable time yet, instead of getting down to the practical problems which arise from our membership of the Community in order to promote a far greater unity in Europe than there is at the moment.<lb/>
As and when we do achieve that, as I sincerely hope we shall, we may then be able to have a European passport that really means something; that is a symbol of an existing unity in which people may then have confidence, rather than being symbolic of something that may be achieved later. The greatest danger in these matters is always that we may take the achievement of a symbol as being the substitute for hard and constructive work, building bit by bit the Europe that we hope to see. With that contribution, my Lords, I hope your Lordships will be pleased to note the report of the Select Committee and will regard it as something on which future progress will be made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01695"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron,
<col>778</col>
made a quite remarkable and excellent maiden speech, which I am sure all your Lordships appreciated. I hope that my noble friend will intervene again in your Lordships' affairs, soon and often. The report before us this evening is a most helpful one and the Government greatly welcome it. We agree with its general interest in removing restrictions on travel between the countries of the European Community. We also agree that a political will is needed if we are to make progress in this direction. The British Government certainly have the will to make a success of our Community membership. The Prime Minister has made it clear that there are certain important problems&#x2014;notably the size of our net contribution to the budget&#x2014;which we are determined to resolve at an early stage. This is our priority and pressing concern. But it is only one side of the coin. The Community has positive goals and aspirations. The Government want to pursue these in the interests of people in Britain and in the Community as a whole. It is in this spirit that we approach the proposals for passport union which are the subject of the debate today.<lb/>
As other noble Lords have said, the apparently simple phrase "passport union" can have a number of different meanings. One of the many values of the report which we are debating today is that it provides a clear and thoughtful analysis. Anybody concerned with this subject in the future will I believe regard the report as a basic document. It first makes the distinction between passport union in the sense of a standard European passport and passport union in the sense of abolition of frontier controls within the area of the Community.<lb/>
Perhaps I can deal first with the more fundamental question of frontier controls within the EEC and it may be helpful if I say a little about our current system. Our immigration control has two broad purposes. First, to deny entry to certain individuals (essentially criminals and terrorists); secondly, to control classes of people coming here for long-term purposes such as employment or settlement in accordance with the Government's economic and social policies. Membership of the Community means that controls of the second kind have little application to Community nationals who are broadly
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0398"/>
<col>779</col>
free to come and go in accordance with their rights under the Community treaties. The immigration control at the ports for EEC nationals is therefore largely concerned with identifying a tiny minority in the context of controlling crime and terrorism. It is therefore a much simpler procedure than that which applies to other nationalities.<lb/>
EEC nationals arriving at our major ports are therefore dealt with separately. Our system of "channelling" has the great advantage of dealing quickly with the large number of people who can be passed through the control with minimal formality rather than making them wait behind those who require closer examination. The principle is exactly the same as that which leads our banks to have special quick service counters and supermarkets to have special check-out points for people with only a very small number of purchases: those of us who, when wanting, to cash a cheque, have found ourselves behind someone paying in the week's takings in coin or making some complex international transaction will readily understand the common sense of such an arrangement.<lb/>
EEC nationals do not have to produce a passport on arrival. A valid national identity card is sufficient. We propose at the end of the year further to reduce formalities for EEC nationals. They will no longer be required, as a matter of routine, to complete a landing card and an embarkation card on arriving and departing. This change demonstrates, I believe, our readiness to look afresh at long-established formalities and retain them only if they genuinely serve a necessary purpose.<lb/>
The Committee pointed out in its report that the advantages of abolishing immigration control are slim. But the consequences of abolition are potentially dangerous. So far as EEC nationals themselves are concerned, the abolition of all checks would, as I have said, make it easier for criminals and terrorists to enter this country. But the concept of completely free movement within the perimeter of the Community could also mean that anyone from outside the Community, once admitted to a Member State, would be free to travel without further formality to any other Member
<col>780</col>
State. This would have serious consequences for immigration control. So long as there are different immigration procedures in different Member States, an immigration officer in any Member State would have to master all the details of procedures in all the other States. As an island, our system relies heavily upon control at the port of entry, whereas some other Member States place greater emphasis on internal police controls. The Committee was very much against this here, and rightly so. The abolition of all controls within the Community would enable a person to enter where controls were least stringent and then to travel freely to any other Member State.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington, referred to the arrangements which apply in the Nordic countries and I think the distinct difference between those procedures and the ones we have is the degree of police surveillance which takes place after travellers have entered the country in question. We prefer to exercise our controls at the border. Your Committee rightly recognises the risk of such an arrangement not only to immigration control but in such matters as prevention of terrorism. The Government therefore agree with the views of the Committee that the right course is to concentrate on simplifying the procedures at ports for EEC nationals rather than to abolish all immigration controls within the Community.<lb/>
Turning to the more specific issue of the format of passports themselves, I was interested to note the connection which the Committee saw between this and the proposal for a machine-readable passport or card. There is indeed a link between the two. On the first, the Committee considers that the proposals for a uniform passport offer a potential modest boost to the ordinary man's sense of being part of the European Community. The question of the uniform European passport has been dormant for some time. Work has, however, continued under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on a machine readable passport. A panel of experts was asked to study the question and their report is now being considered by the Air Transport Committee of ICAO. We and our Community partners have taken an active part in these studies and we support the principle of a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0399"/>
<col>781</col>
machine-readable passport. These studies are well advanced.<lb/>
There is a substantial measure of agreement within the panel of experts on the basic specification required to produce the machine readable capability. Indeed, we did prepare a specimen in accordance with what has so far achieved a pretty good consensus in ICAO, although I must tell your Lordships that this is not yet the formal position of the Government. The machine-readable card&#x2014;I have one here&#x2014;is about twice the size of the average credit card, but in other respects is rather similar; it is made of a similar sort of material, but the card itself can be interrogated by machine where that equipment is available.<lb/>
Already some of our EEC partners are moving towards the introduction of a machine readable identity card that would meet the specifications, and it is very likely that such cards will be presented at British ports and airports within the next year or so. There is, of course, no suggestion of introducing compulsory identity cards in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
We hope that the work being carried out by ICAO will lead to agreement to introduce machine readable passports by many countries, not only in Europe. This work adds a new element to the discussion on a common format passport for the Community. A common format passport which also provided the advantages of the machine readable passport has attractions. It should give the traveller the practical benefit of less delay at points of entry. It would also give people a greater sense of belonging to the European Community. And it would help to show to the rest of the world that the Community has its own political identity.<lb/>
I should perhaps take up one of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. I think he was under the impression that these passports will be centrally issued within the Community. That is not so. The present proposal is that these passports should continue to be issued by individual States to their nationals but in accordance with a common format.<lb/>
The Committee suggested that passports might fulfil a greater number of functions; for example, they could include health details. While seeing the attraction of
<col>782</col>
these arguments, we should perhaps tread cautiously. We do not want to complicate the task of securing international harmonisation by trying to achieve too much with one document. We also have to be very careful about the requirements of privacy. We should not compel people to have on the passport personal information which is not strictly necessary. But I recognise that the Committee were anxious that the inclusion of medical information should be on a strictly voluntary basis.<lb/>
Perhaps I can refer to a related point at the same time, and that is the question of the E 111 form which several noble Lords raised. Under present arrangements, if one is to travel to a country within the EEC and one imagines one may wish to take advantage of reciprocal medical arrangements, one must apply in advance for one of these forms. Unfortunately, the entitlement to these benefits is not uniform throughout the Community, and, although one may well be entitled to the benefit of the National Health Service here in the United Kingdom, it does not necessarily apply that one is so entitled in other EEC countries. Indeed, one's entitlement may vary from year to year because it depends upon, among other things, whether one is self-employed or paying contributions, or what one's contribution record is. For that reason, bearing in mind the fact that passports may often be valid for 10 years, we are in some difficulty about using the passport to convey information concerning the eligibility for benefits at the present time. We recognise that the present E 111 form arrangement is not perfect. We are hoping to extend the range of benefits that can be obtained within EEC countries so that the eligibility scale is more in line with that of the United Kingdom. But for the moment we are obliged to continue with the present arrangement.<lb/>
Machine readable passports do not mean the disappearance of a national passport. Of course, the machine readable data would have to be standardised in the passports of all the countries which adopted this type of document, to avoid the need for a multiplicity of machines to read them. But this does not mean that there must be total uniformity of every feature of a machine readable passport or card.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0400"/>
<col>783</col>
Your Lordships may already know from the public announcement on 26th July that we have produced a specimen machine readable passport made out, for some extraordinary reason, to Sir Walter Scott. This comprises a machine readable card, which incorporates a photograph and the data presently contained in the first few pages of the current passport. This might go in a hard cover booklet which would look very much the same as our present passport and which would also have conventional pages for visa endorsements. Although this is only one of many possible arrangements, the format of the card itself accords with specifications recommended by ICAO, and it can be assumed that an internationally agreed machine readable travel document will generally have the layout of this specimen. But it will still be possible for each country's travel documents to have a national identity and a European dimension (taking the shape, for example, of a distinctive common format) in the passports of all members of the Community if this is what we all in the end decide upon.<lb/>
We have also prepared a specimen of what the common format of a European passport might look like. As your Lordships can see, it looks on the face of it very much the same as the present British passport. We hope it will have provision for the machine readable card to which I referred, and it certainly contains those fine words inside the cover which the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, read out to us. I must emphasise, however, that, if proposals for a common Community format were implemented, the prerogative to issue passports would, of course, remain with member States.<lb/>
There are one or two other points that perhaps I could deal with. The noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, asked about the British Visitor's Passport. It is indeed true that British Visitor's Passports valid for a limited number of countries can be obtained comparatively easily from any post office. It is a popular document with the public; over 1 million are issued annually. If it were abandoned a great strain would be placed on the resources of the Passport Office, and I can offer no assurance at this time that we will be able to withdraw it in the foreseeable
<col>784</col>
future. However, we are well aware of the abuses to which they are subject. For example, a person who obtains a British Visitor's Passport to which he is not entitled and uses it to travel abroad and return to the United Kingdom does not thereby gain legal residence here. I must assure your Lordships that in our consideration of machine readable passports we will bear in mind the comments on British Visitor's Passports which have been made here this evening.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Murray of Gravesend, asked me a specific point about the dipping of tanks of coaches and other vehicles arriving in EEC countries, particularly from here. I have no detailed knowledge of that difficulty before me at the moment, but, if I may, I will look into the matter and write to the noble Lord.<lb/>
My Lords, I am sure that the Committee were right to conclude that it is along this path that we should proceed if we are to make progress on a European dimension for the national passports of Members of the Community. When the proposals are further advanced, the Government will look at them with sympathy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01697"><member>Lord GREENWOOD of ROSSENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like briefly to express my appreciation of all the speeches which have been made in this short debate, from that by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington, to the one which we have just heard by the Minister. They were all most kind in their references to the work of the Committee and they were all extremely solid and constructive contributions.<lb/>
I should like specially to pause to say thank you to the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, for what I thought was a model maiden speech which was characterised by grace and a warm sympathy with the problems. I know that it bodes well for the future. It is not easy to make demands upon the young Members of this House who have the obligations of bringing up families, developing their careers and involving themselves in professions. When we do put these additional burdens upon them, we should be particularly grateful to them for accepting the responsibility and being prepared to help the House in that way. Your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0401"/>
<col>785</col>
would not expect me, with my background, to be an uncritical admirer of the hereditary principle, but every day in this Chamber I look around and I ask myself where the young men would be if it were not that they were here because of the hereditary principle. They make a contribution and the noble Lord, Lord Fairfax, has given us striking evidence of that.<lb/>
I should like to make one point. We should not be too defeatist about the possibility of matters speeding up. I am not over-optimistic, but one remembers that, when Commissioner Davignon told us that he was optimistic about future progress, he told the Committee that one reason which had led to recent inactivity was the wish of the British Government not to complicate plans to introduce direct elections. I am looking to the new Government to find some other source of embarrassment which they can use in order to galvanise the Commission and make it more positively forward-looking than it has been in the past.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, very much indeed for the practical work that he has done. Indeed, I am prepared to offer a small prize to the noble Lord who will get to the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood's post office first thing in the morning and bring the noble Viscount, Lord Amory, up to date. With those few words, I ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BRITISH AIRWAYS' FUTURE STRATEGY</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01699">6.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01700"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are satisfied that the future strategy of British Airways is adequate to meet the problems facing the industry. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In view of the proposed forthcoming sale of shares in British Airways to the public, I feel that it may well clear the air if tonight I raise a few controversial points, even at the risk of unpopularity in certain areas. I also hope that, under its new status, certain strategic errors with which British Airways seems
<col>786</col>
plagued, will be able to be rectified, and as such I hope that my criticisms will be accepted in a constructive manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01701">The object of the BOAC/BEA merger was to create a world airline through existing manpower and resources. It was to be more flexible and competitive, while simultaneously reducing wasteful duplicate administration. However, because of the entrenched attitude of key management, problems have arisen which have caused a marked decline of confidence in the upper echelon of management by those of more humble status, be they captains or cleaners. That has resulted in a lowering of morale to an alarming level. The two pyramids which should have integrated themselves into one are still side by side, and they sit with a third and very bureaucratic one sitting on top of them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01702">British Airways is top-heavy in administration and over-manned by perhaps 7,000 or 10,000 in those areas the merger was supposed to reduce. For example, a directive to reduce manning leaves the boardroom, it goes to the top echelons and is passed to middle management where this directive is most necessary. But middle management then puts the axe in at the level which can least afford it&#x2014;engineers, pilots, loaders, and traffic handlers. The former Chairman. Sir Frank McFadzean, a tough and experienced industralist, tried to streamline the operation but even he could not cope with all the in-fighting. The amorphous mass of British Airways administration remains much the same, and the only sufferer is the passenger through insufficient tarmac-level personnel, which means that the airline fails to meet its schedules.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01703">British Airways, like other large organisations, suffers from a lack of communication inside itself. However, that could be off-set by management's determination to promote good relations with its work force. Your Lordships may be surprised to know that BEA employed a consultant psychiatrist, Mr. Russel Smith, who advocated a policy of confrontation as the most efficient way to obtain the maxi mum productivity. Unfortunately, that policy appears still to be maintained at most levels and has had a disastrous effect on industrial relations. Management is despised; getting people to work becomes a problem; responsibility is not re-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0402"/>
<col>787</col>
warded, and leadership is not encouraged. A reluctant workforce with little pride in the company, which resorts to restrictive union practices, combined with over-manning and under-utilisation practices leads only to inefficiency and a waste of money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01704">British Airways accountancy is run on a mini-budget system employing several thousand accountants. The system causes constant "Who pays for what?" bickering; massive over-charging for key equipment, which has even resulted in its standing idle because nobody knows who will pay for it. For example, British Air Tours once asked the European Division for a quote for handling 707s at Lisbon. The quote was rejected in favour of that of TAP which was less. However, if that is rationalised, money left the company, and even if the European Division's quote was far higher, it would still have been cheaper than paying out money to TAP.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01705">Very often the aircrew and tarmac level personnel exist in shabby surroundings of litter and peeling paint. It could well pay some of the accountants to step out of their pristine offices and see conditions at the coal face at first hand.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01706">British Airways is desperately short of aircraft. The buying policy of the European Division has resulted in inadequate capacity in the medium range caused by the Trident fiasco. Whatever British Airways may say, there has been an unbelievable lack of forward planning, and I have said that in your Lordships' House on several occasions in the past. British Airways has naturally denied that charge, but this lack of foresight means that British Airways has to react to events instead of anticipating them. As a result, it is often too little, too late, as well as probably being the wrong aircraft. This then leads to wholesale cancellation of services, and to sub-chartering. To lose revenue in that way is both inexcusable and commercially disastrous.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01707">Comparisons are odious, but British. Airways staff productivity on short haul is about 25 per cent. of the best United States carriers. For instance, on the London-Glasgow run the wages cost per passenger is about &#x00A3;8 on a 344-mile route. On a similar route in California by
<col>788</col>
Pacific South-West, it is about &#x00A3;4 and the American staff are paid twice a much. British Airways on short haul carries about 760 passengers per employee, and its equivalent in the United States, like South-West Texas or Pacific South-West, is 2,800 passengers per employee. Unfortunately, the baggage handling produces the same sad story. Over here it is about eight bags a minute and in America about 16 bags a minute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01708">Regarding maintenance, the aircraft are adequately maintained but are often inadequately cleaned inside and out. The last results in lower performance and increased fuel consumption. When a new aircraft is ordered the research and development section insists on a "bespoke tailor" requirement. This not only delays service entry, but also reduces operational flexibility. The buying policy leaves no buffer for unexpected expansion of demand. Even allowing British Airways the benefit of the doubt that the 737 is more suitable for its needs than the 1&#x2013;11, the decision to purchase the 757 paper aeroplane instead of the airbus seems very odd. One wonders why there is this urgency for British Airways to buy American, and in particular Boeing, unless there are some other influences of which the public and T are unaware. Here it is perhaps pertinent to note that the following European airlines have all ordered the airbus in one or other form: SAS, Lufthansa, Hapag-Lloyd, Air France, Air Inter, British Caledonian and Laker, K LM and Martin-Air, Iberia, Alitalia, Sabena, Austrian Airlines, Olympic Airlines and Swissair.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01709">Not long ago in this House I asked the question, "Can all these airlines be wrong?" At the moment the only two contenders for the 757 are British Airways and Eastern Airlines in America, and even Eastern uses the A300 on its shuttle services from New York. I am told that British Airways intends to cram about 223 passengers into the 757 at a full fare whereas Laker puts about 215 into an airbus at a cheap rate. So the excursion passenger will travel both in more comfort and at less expense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01710">I believe that British Airways does more damage to British industry and our balance of payments deficit than any other company in the United Kingdom. For two decades it has actively pursued a policy of not buying British unless under
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0403"/>
<col>789</col>
Government persuasion. It has then derided the aircraft, and the Government have usually had to subsidise the operation &#x2014;for instance, as in the case of the VC.10, the 1&#x2013;11 and Concorde. It cannot deride the airbus because it has not ordered any, but should it find itself in the position of having to, there will be a very long wait for delivery, as it will be at the bottom of the customers' list.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01711">On page 52 of the annual report of British Airways it states:
<quote>"A substantial proportion of the fleet commitments is payable in US dollars, and approximately 20 per cent. thereof is covered by contracts for forward purchases of US dollars over the next two years at various rates of exchange".</quote>
Capital expenditure commitments are &#x00A3;950&#x00B7;7 million, which must be getting on for 50 per cent. of our balance of payments deficit for this year. In fact, since writing this down I have discovered that from January to August 1979 our balance of payments deficit was &#x00A3;443 million in US dollars&#x2014;that is in eight months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01712">However, on the credit side British Airways has championed Rolls-Royce and has even paid for having that company's engines fitted to 747s. But perhaps to the cynic this could be due to the numerous malfunctions of the Pratt and Whitney JT9Ds which have caused many passengers to be delayed, sometimes for days, thus necessitating British Airways doling out free drinks, meals and hotel rooms. The service is creditable, but at what cost in lost revenue, and transporting spare engines. Page 15 of the annual report devotes four paragraphs to the Trident fiasco, but virtually only two small throw-away sentences on the problems of the 747 and the TriStar.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01713"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend tell me what he is talking about when he refers to the "Trident fiasco"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01714"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, certainly. In saying that I refer to the cracks in the wings which put the entire Trident fleet out of service for a certain period of time. Further on on the same page there is a profound statement about the EEC:
<quote>"Until recently British Airways has scarcely been affected by the British membership of the EEC. It is now clear, however, that air transport will be of increasing interest to the Commission,
<col>790</col>
and we have taken steps to ensure that we are kept closely in touch with and influence what is happening in Brussels".</quote>
About time too, for there are two factors which will affect British Airways after 1980. One is the EEC regulations which will require open tendering from all European countries for equipment, and the second is the new routes within Europe which will be open to independent airlines. I am sure that Her Majesty's Government will give strong backing for British Caledonian and our great entrepreneur, Sir Freddie Laker, in their campaign to extend their routes.<lb/>
On 23rd October last, in another place, during the Second Reading debate on the Competition Bill, at column 272 in <i>Hansard</i> the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mrs. Sally Oppenheim, said:
<quote>"But we believe that competition is a potent weapon, both in the fight against inflation and in the establishment of consumer sovereignty".</quote>
I agree with her. In fact, it could be very desirable for the CAA to alter the licensing obligations, thereby encouraging greater competition which would lower the air fares on British airlines. The announcement or leak that British Airways wants to get rid of 26 unprofitable routes and that four independent airlines are keen to compete for them must only be good.<lb/>
Reverting to the merger, this produced operating problems of procedure on the flight deck. The European and overseas divisions have been working towards a common operating procedure, but it is still some way from fruition. For instance in the European division TriStar is approved by the CAA for landing in extremely foggy weather whereas the same aeroplane in the overseas division is not. However, as in many ways the merger appears to have been more of a take-over by BOAC, there appears little urgency at the moment to bring the overseas division up to the same standard.<lb/>
Divisions in the pilot work force at union level seem to be deliberately unresolved by the company for industrial reasons. The matter is further complicated by retaining flight engineers in the overseas division. I believe that there are many progressive airlines which use the European division operating procedures and which have no flight engineers. British Airways co-pilots have morale problems due to the absence of a career
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0404"/>
<col>791</col>
structure&#x2014;for instance, in aircraft expectation. Many co-pilots have been in the same type of aircraft for over 10 years. Other airlines consider this to be a dangerous practice and retrain their co-pilots at five or six year intervals, thus giving added benefit and experience for command. In other words, the basic problem is long haul <i>v.</i> short haul. There is no common seniority system. If a Trident captain wants to transfer to the overseas division, he has to start right at the bottom again.<lb/>
I now give some praise. British Airways' ground engineers are superb at all levels. They are perhaps the company's real strength. But there seems to be a curious reluctance to pay them the going engineering rate and as a result key men are often lost after a great deal of time and money has been spent on training them. British Airways should perhaps pay more than their competitors, otherwise the engineers vote with their feet. Hundreds left last year over a &#x00A3;3 pay dispute. Disenchantment leads to restrictive practices affecting the flexibility of aircraft. European division engineers will not service an aircraft standing on an overseas division hard standing. Page 20 of the annual report states that:
<quote>"Engineering management is at long last nearly unified".</quote>
But how long is "at long last"?<lb/>
Congestion is the bane of all airlines and as such is one of British Airways most serious problems. Flights at peak periods are subject to anything up to three-quarters of an hour airfield delay. This delay is naturally compounded when the aircraft is turned round at the other end for its return journey.<lb/>
We are still considering a third London airport, but we have two perfectly adequate and good ones at Gatwick and Stansted, but both need two operational runways. Should there be any disagreement, not from your Lordships' House but outside, I would humbly suggest that the person who disagrees obviously never flies with the European division of British Airways at peak times. It is true that air congestion was partially solved by the wide-bodied jumbos on long hauls. But the proliferation of short-haul mini aeroplanes is threatening disruption on a far larger scale. This is why British Airways should rethink its aircraft procurement
<col>792</col>
policy. It seems uncommercial for British Airways to fly three-engined TriStars to Paris when Air France flies two-engined airbuses to London. Is there not supposed to be a worldwide fuel shortage?<lb/>
Air travel is international. British Airways' thinking tends at best to be national and I cannot even praise its domestic routes and services. British Airways must formulate an international policy if it is to make some sort of order out of the impending chaos resulting from narrow concepts, narrow minds and narrow-bodied aircraft. There is still time before it is too late for British Airways to re-think its forward planning needs. I can only hope that by selling off part of British Airways to the private sector&#x2014;if anybody will buy it&#x2014;this may prove to be the catalyst to make the airline fully competitive again in the world market, so that once again we may fly the flag and arrive on time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01715">7.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01716"><member>Lord HAYTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has had a tremendous ear-bashing today in a variety of different contexts, and I hope that I shall be very gentle and not disturb him at all. I am obliged to the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for asking this Question, because I rise, although it may not look like it, like a phoenix from the ashes. My little Quango has been disbanded. I was chairman of the Little Neddy which looked after international freight movement, and it would therefore be on my conscience if I did not speak on this Question in the context of air cargo.<lb/>
That is fair enough because we are talking about the problems of the industry. We are also, in a way, talking about the problems of industry, and the air cargo side has been perhaps not as widely recognised as it ought to be in various circles. For example, last week you may have seen a large article in the <i>Financial Times</i> about the "Civil Aviation Authority's Unenviable Challenge". There was not one word about cargo in it. Yet another article on Monday; "British Aviation Changes Course". Again not one word about cargo. And yet, as these wide-bodied aircraft come into use all over the world, this further subordinates cargo policies to passengers.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0405"/>
<col>793</col>
I hope you will take it from me that nearly one-fifth of imports into this country by value come in by air, and nearly one-fifth of the exports of this country by value go out by air. So you have a tremendous impetus here for the export and import business of this country. Now all this serves to emphasise British Airways' traditional role as the national carrier, and it speaks for the industry in many contexts, particularly with the International Air Transport Association and with Government. It is therefore all the more important to make sure that cargo is playing its relevant part in their considerations.<lb/>
I understand that there is not a single director on the board responsible for, or knowledgeable of, air cargo. This seems to me quite astonishing. Secondly, I understand that the board as a whole is rather slow to react to the changing demands of the international air freight industry&#x2014;and they change very quickly these days. Thirdly, there is a failure to maintain the competitive service standards &#x2014;and that is a common problem for national airlines. They are rather inclined to rely on their own reputations. Fourthly, how important it is for the board to have genuine consultation at top level with the other major interests in their context: the freight forwarders; the customs; and this computerised cargo-processing system.<lb/>
However, all is not lost. I am a little more optimistic than the noble Earl who put forward this Question, for at senior cargo management level quite a lot of things are happening. There is the new commercial rating policy; they are consulting more with the bodies that they should be consulting with; and they played a significant part in the development of a project called the freight forwarders bond at Heathrow. It was developed as a result of my Little Neddy. It really is the facility at Heathrow which enables cargo to come in there from the various airlines, he sorted out by the freight forwarders, and then to find its proper destination elsewhere, maybe in Europe. It is so successful that it has been generally agreed that it has to be expanded 200 per cent. But there are many complications, and I cannot quite see, now that my Little Neddy has been disbanded,
<col>794</col>
who is going to come to some of those conclusions. I shall come back to that in a moment.<lb/>
I shall now plunge into future strategy. It has been said that one could not be satisfied with the British Airways' future strategy about cargo because nobody has ever heard of it. There is a certain element of commercial secrecy behind which they take shelter. But a lot would be gained if we could see, particularly in the new context, the appointment of a cargo product director to the main board. I happen to know that there is a very sizeable and quite expensive research programme going on, and that should be directed by one of the top people in the organisation.<lb/>
Secondly, one would hope that there would be a strengthening and a stabilising of cargo management, and in particular the establishment of a better cargo career structure so that young men going in would know that their future was reasonably assured in the light of their own ability. These things would provide leadership and confidence in the workforce, and they improve the terminal handling, and as a result both British Airways and the United Kingdom industry as a whole would benefit.<lb/>
Today's rapid development and the high competition in air cargo requires national strategic planning, and that is where, to the extent that the Government share in the responsibility for British Airways, they must take a part. So I get back to the beginning. We have to meet the problems of the industry in competition with the other airways in Europe. We have to meet the problems of industry to ensure that the goods can flow as freely, as quickly, and as efficiently as possible. It is a pity that my Little Neddy is no longer there to help, because some of these things cannot be done by British Airways alone. Take that freight forwarders bond area. There are endless complications there which I shall just outline in a few words: the unions; the customs; the International Trade Procedures Board; the freight forwarders industry; industry itself as represented by the CBI. All these have to be drawn together if it is going to be a success.<lb/>
Until there is a change of heart towards air cargo in British Airways as a whole, I
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0406"/>
<col>795</col>
think the only possibility of bringing some of these projects to fruition will be the British Overseas Trade Board, for which the Government are in part responsible, together with that famous organisation to me, though maybe not to you, called SITPRO, which stands for the Simplification of International Trade Procedures&#x2014;vital to all of us in industry mixed up with exports and imports. But it is not only in this area of the freight forwarders bond but in the general furtherance of air cargo expansion against our competitors in Europe, who are very alive to many of these projects, that I hone that British strategy from the British Airways' point of view will become clear, and that the Government will be backing them to the best of their ability.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01717">7.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01718"><member>Lord PONSONBY of SHULBREDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sometimes feel that we expect perfection of some of our national institutions and that we enjoy attacking the Post Office, British Rail, or British Airways. Perhaps this is because we all have our own personal experiences of where things have gone wrong. The noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, certainly enjoyed himself this afternoon. He raised the important question of whether British Airways' strategy was adequate for meeting the problems facing the industry.<lb/>
Certainly the major problems which one sees air transport facing in the 1980s and beyond are the continuing demand of the leisure traveller. The tourist industry sees the demand for travel increasing, and that in fact in the course of time the leisure traveller will become more and more important for airways <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the business traveller. Another problem in the air transport industry which it is facing acutely at the present time is the question of escalating fuel costs. In the USA they have been up 72 per cent. in the last nine months, with a consequent pressure on the earning capabilities of United States' airlines. We know that during the first nine months of this year profits were down some 50 per cent on last year. These pressures will make British Airways think very carefully about the type of aircraft it flies, the routes it operates and the fare structures it has.<lb/>
On the question of the type of aircraft, this was dealt with to a considerable extent
<col>796</col>
by the noble Earl, who informed your Lordships that British Airways are going for the Boeing 757, whose operating costs, if powered by the RB 211 engine, British Airways believe will be between 5 and 10 per cent. lower than those of any other comparable aircraft. Lord Kimberley criticised this decision on a number of counts, but perhaps to some extent on the basis that all the other European airlines which had ordered the Airbus could not be wrong. It should be said that at the time the order was placed for the 757s, the Airbus was not available with an RB 211 engine, and that this availability apparently came about only during this summer. On all counts, it was and is a fair decision to have decided to purchase the 757.<lb/>
The other problem I mentioned was competition for the custom of the leisure traveller. This has led to intensive fares competition, as witnessed by the present applications before the Civil Aviation Authority. Application has been made by Laker Airways to operate 666 routes and, perhaps rather more reasonably, by British Caledonian to operate 20 routes. It is ludicrous to think that Laker actually intend to operate 666 routes in Europe when one considers that the biggest of America's airlines, United, operates only 400 routes throughout the United States. Whatever the outcome of the applications and whether European fares are slashed or not, everything will depend very much on the attitude of the receiving nations, and I understand, to mention only a few, that the Swiss, Germans and French are against any considerable dropping in fares. As an article in the Financial Times pointed out last Friday:
<quote>"If anybody is looking for an early breakthrough in cheaper fares in Western Europe, he is likely to have to wait some time. In the meantime, British Airways, with its partner flag-carriers of other European nations, will continue with its own steady erosion of air fares, offering cuts wherever it can on a bilateral basis".</quote>
It is well known that British Airways is able to, and does continually, offer an increasing range of special types of lower fare which people can avail themselves of in special situations.<lb/>
One of the other main prongs of Lord Kimberley's attack on British Airways was criticism of the internal working of the airline, and there was considerable validity in his remarks. Certainly the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0407"/>
<col>797</col>
productivity of British Airways per employee is below that of other comparable world airlines, and this is recognised by British Airways. It could of course be that British Airways, with 60,000 employees and possibly 10,000 too many&#x2014;Lord Kimberley gave a slightly lower figure&#x2014;is too big to be able to weld into a single corporate whole. But they are trying to do something about this internally and I understand are currently involved in operation QARP, which stands for Quality and Reliability Plan, which is aimed at motivating the staff to remember that passengers are the reason for the airlines' business. What Lord Kimberley said with regard to middle managers needing more support from the top is also a criticism which I have heard.<lb/>
It is not right for us this evening to consider whether the decision to merge British European Airways and BOAC was or was not right, but it is certainly the case that the proposal at the time by Sir Ronald Edwards in his report on the British Air Transport Industry in the 'seventies, which proposed a federation, might have been more successful, as then one would have had a situation similar to that which, in a sense, is now crystallising, as mentioned by Lord Kimberley, in that the work of British Airways is breaking down more and more into activities on long and short-haul routes. I doubt whether the other issues about British Airways which we are not discussing this evening&#x2014;and I would refer to the sale of the shares of British Airways &#x2014;will affect these issues at all; I think it is largely one for internal management.<lb/>
The problems which noble Lords have discussed this evening and the problem of freight as raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hayter, are matters of concern, and we are surely all concerned to see that our national airline enjoys the prestige which we would wish it to have. Having flown on airlines other than British airlines, one can understand the point of some of these attacks, but I hope, and I am sure all noble Lords will hope, that the prestige of British airlines can be enhanced.

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01720"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: Two down and one to go, my Lords! The noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, has displayed a commendable sense of timing in raising this Question. We have all had cause recently to cast our eyes both backwards and forwards in relation to British Airways. The look backwards was occasioned by the 60th anniversary of the airline's first regular international scheduled service. It was on 25th August 1919 that a converted bomber left Hounslow for Le Bourget under the flag of Air Transport and Travel Limited, a forerunner of what is now British Airways. The flight took two and a half hours, and it is a measure of the airline's progress when we consider that Concorde takes little more than that to cross the Atlantic. The forward look came with the publication last week of the Government's Civil Aviation Bill, which provides for a major change in the status of our national airline from a nationalised industry to a private sector company in which a proportion of the shares will be held by the general public.<lb/>
There have been many changes in between these two events, including the various stages of State ownership which culminated in the creation of the British Airways Board in 1972. This was a crucial development designed to fuse together the operations and resources of the erstwhile air corporations and thus provide a single entity offering worldwide services, and to reap the economies to be gained from a large, integrated organisation. The merger was a mammoth task and it took a considerable time to be implemented properly. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those throughout the airline whose efforts have enabled the merger to be carried through successfully.<lb/>
Amidst all the changes which have occurred over these last 60 years, British Airways&#x2014;in whatever form&#x2014;has shown itself capable of meeting successfully the challenges of a growing, innovative and increasingly competitive industry. A few brief facts will illustrate that success. British Airways' route network is the largest in the world. The airline serves around 180 cities in 80 countries. In 1978&#x2013;79 it carried nearly 16 million passengers and clocked up 36,000 million revenue passenger kilometres. Cargo and mail amounted to well over 1,000 million
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0408"/>
<col>799</col>
tonne kilometres. Total turnover was &#x00A3;1,640 million, on which the profit for the year was &#x00A3;110 million.<lb/>
As well as operating scheduled air services, the British Airways Group undertakes a wide range of other activities, for example, British Airtours operates in the charter and holiday markets and British Airways Helicopters has established itself firmly in the North Sea offshore market. In addition, there are the highly successful International Aeradio Limited, and numerous other subsidiaries operating in industries related to the airline, such as hotels, holidays, and engine overhaul. It will be obvious from what I have said that British Airways has grown over the years into a large and diverse organisation.<lb/>
I referred briefly to the constantly changing environment in which British Airways, in common with all airlines, has to operate. Some of these changes have been foreseeable, but others have come quite by surprise. For example, the massive and unforeseen increase in fuel prices in the early 1970s came at a time when the newly created British Airways Board had hardly had time to get on its feet. Although this resulted in two loss-making years in 1974&#x2013;75 and 1975&#x2013;76, the airline made an admirable recovery thereafter for which all concerned can take credit. Over the past year or so fuel prices have again caused serious problems, and I will return to this later.<lb/>
Another example of the changing airline world is the pressure for low fares, about which we have heard an increasing amount over the past couple of years, and which is very much in the news today in this country. British Airways has this factor uppermost in mind in its strategic thinking, and is already closely associated with the trend towards low fares.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Kimberley has not spared us the details of the problems which all airlines face in the future, and in this he is quite right. British Airways has been among the first of the world's airlines to address itself squarely to the problems and challenges which lie ahead. Before formulating its present corporate strategy, British Airways set its sights to the mid-'eighties to try to make reasonable assumptions about what the international airline industry would look like then and
<col>800</col>
the sort of service it would have to provide in order to continue to compete successfully. Nineteen Eighty-Six&#x2014;just after all the old aircraft which do not meet modern noise standards would have to be phased out&#x2014;was taken as a representative year. British Airways saw continued growth of the market combined with a major increase in the proportion of that market represented by leisure travel, and a fall in the real level of fares, and decided that the only recipe for success was to continue to serve all segments of the market and to grow in order to maintain its total market share.<lb/>
At the same time, the airline has set itself a financial objective which may be expressed as follows:
<quote>"To generate a cash flow that will pay interest on loans and currently payable tax, pay an appropriate dividend on public dividend capital, and fund an asset replacement programme at current cost and a reasonable proportion of capital expenditure on assets needed for expansion".</quote>
That objective is a testing one, and is reflected in British Airways' current statutory financial target of an average annual return on net assets of 6 per cent. in real terms.<lb/>
In order to remain a market leader, weather the future changes in the industry and achieve its financial objective, British Airways has developed a strategic plan to adapt its products and to reduce costs. The main elements in this plan are a redesign of the product range, a rationalisation and complete modernisation of the aircraft fleet and a substantial increase in staff productivity. The first of these items involves a better recognition of the different needs of business and leisure traffic. Business travellers and others paying full fares have increasingly complained that they are not getting a fair deal from the airline in comparison with those travelling on various kinds of dis-counted fares. The new strategy is designed to eliminate these complaints and at the same time to produce an attractive, but simpler, service for leisure passengers which will be financially and competitively successful.<lb/>
The second element&#x2014;rationalisation of the fleet&#x2014;involves a policy which will give British Airways a highly competitive four-type fleet in a few years' time. Future operations will he based mainly
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0409"/>
<col>801</col>
on the Boeing 737, the Boeing 757, the Lockheed TriStar, and the Boeing 747. These fleet plans require a very large capital investment programme. In addition, British Airways will of course continue to operate Concorde at the top end of the market. Your Lordships will be aware that the airline are to acquire a sixth British-built Concorde for the supersonic fleet, and it is open to them to make proposals to the Government regarding the seventh such aircraft if they wish. Concorde operations by foreign airlines have been facilitated in conjunction with British Airways, and it is clear that Concorde services by any airline other than British Airways or Air France can be a practical proposition only with extensive support from either of these two main carriers. British Airways is therefore continuing to play its full part in the pioneering of supersonic civil air travel.<lb/>
The rationalisation of the fleet will have many cost advantages for British Airways and is a major feature in progress towards the low cost targets which the airline has set for itself. The new fleet will be more fuel efficient and quieter than current operations. It will fully meet the new noise regulations due to be applied in the United Kingdom from 1st January 1986. As regards energy consumption, the position is put into stark perspective if I quote British Airways' own estimate that by 1986 the airline's total traffic will have doubled with an increase of only 25 per cent. in fuel consumption.<lb/>
The right fleet will therefore make a substantial contribution to the success of British Airways' strategy, and I should like to make a brief reference here to an important, related point. Your Lordships House has in the past, and again tonight, heard criticisms that British Airways' fleet plans are too heavily dependent on American aircraft rather than British or European aircraft. I can understand the sentiments of those who express such views, but in the prevailing environment of the civil aviation market it is essential for an airline to be able to choose the aircraft which is best suited to its own particular route pattern. Flying the right aircraft on the right routes can make all the difference between profit and loss, and the Government firmly believe that it is the management of British Airways who are best placed to decide which aircraft
<col>802</col>
will produce the best results on their route network and that they should therefore be free to exercise their own commercial judgment in this respect. British Airways' preferences for certain aircraft types imply no criticism of competing aircraft from a different source, but simply reflect what they consider to be best for their own circumstances. The airline's preference for Rolls-Royce engines which already power its TriStar fleet, part of the 747 fleet, and will power the 757s, is similarly based upon commercial considerations.<lb/>
Several noble Lords were particularly critical of British Airways' choice of the 757. Again, that choice was a purely commercial decision, based upon the airline's particular requirements. We could no doubt have a very long and inconclusive debate on the merits of that decision, but we are not here to do the management's job. Mr. Ross Stainton, the chairman, has stated recently that the developing fuel crisis emphatically underlines the commercial rightness of their decision to buy this aircraft, and that the airline's calculations show it will burn between 30 and 40 per cent. less fuel per passenger than the Trident 3. He has also pointed out that, because it is smaller than its rivals, the 757 represents flexibility in deployment, which British Airways consider a valuable commercial plus factor in the fiercely competitive environment they expect to face. With respect, I would suggest that there is nobody in your Lordships' House with sufficient knowledge of British Airways and its particular commercial requirements to say that the airline's decision is wrong, and that they should be acquiring an alternative type of aircraft. The best service the Government can render British Airways is to give its management the freedom to exercise its commercial judgment in matters such as this, because they are the people best placed to make those decisions.<lb/>
Returning to the details of British Airways' overall strategy for the future, the third element I mentioned is the need to increase staff productivity. This is vital. The right product combined with the right aircraft will not be sufficient to ensure the success of the airline's strategy without a significant contribution to cost reduction from better productivity. This is not to say that productivity has stood
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0410"/>
<col>803</col>
still in the airline. Over the past 10 years, available tonne kilometres produced per employee has risen from just over 78,000 to almost 135,000. But this trend has to be continually and more rapidly improved if British Airways' costs are to be contained at a level which will enable the airline to continue to compete successfully in the future. The required improvement in productivity is one of the management's priority objectives in British Airways' overall strategy, and particular efforts have been made over the past couple of years to secure the necessary increases, both by normal managerial action throughout the airline and by the linking of increased pay with increased productivity. Steady progress has been made, and the airline's employees at all levels are to be congratulated on this. However, the momentum has to be increased. The need is simply illustrated by British Airways' forecast that by 1986 the doubling of the airline's traffic will be achieved with fewer staff than are currently employed.<lb/>
A related and important factor is the quality of the airline's service. I have no doubt that many noble Lords could provide examples of individual complaints about flight punctuality, baggage handling, <i>et cetera,</i> and it is no use denying that there are such cases. British Airways are fully aware of this and are making strenuous efforts to improve their performance with a quality and reliability campaign which covers the whole airline. They realise it is no good having the right product at the right price if it cannot be delivered in reliable working order on time.<lb/>
These, then, are the essential elements of the strategy, but, in formulating it, British Airways recognise that there are a number of external constraints over which they have little or no direct control. These include the speed and manner in which the world moves towards deregulation, the problems of United Kingdom airport capacity, the problems of air traffic control congestion, the position regarding aviation fuel supplies and their desire for freedom to acquire the aircraft of their choice. I have already dealt briefly with the last point, but noble Lords will be aware that over the past months another of the items mentioned &#x2014;aviation fuel supplies&#x2014;has had a
<col>804</col>
dramatic impact on all airlines. Fuel price increases over the past year have placed a large, additional and unavoidable burden on airline costs, including those of British Airways. The magnitude was illustrated by Mr. Ross Stainton when, on the publication earlier this year of the airline's 1978&#x2013;79 report and accounts, he indicated that British Airways' previous forecasts of the future nature of the airline industry had assumed that by 1986 crude oil prices would have risen by 15 to 20 per cent. in real terms. He then went on to say&#x2014;and I quote:
<quote>"As far as fuel prices are concerned the 1986 in our prediction has already come and gone".</quote>
British Airways have also suffered recently from another factor over which they have no control&#x2014;the strength of sterling. While this represents some advantage in respect of the airline's dollar-priced expenditure, such as oil and aircraft, it has precisely the opposite effect on revenues. The proportion of British Airways' revenues earned abroad is approaching two-thirds, and a strong pound means a fall in the sterling value of overseas receipts from ticket sales when they come back across the exchanges. Despite a growth in traffic higher than forecast, these factors are combining to create an extremely difficult year for British Airways, as noble Lords may have read from recent Press accounts. The airline is therefore engaged in a cost-cutting exercise to preserve, so far as possible, the level of profitability necessary for its large investment programme.<lb/>
One aspect of cost-cutting which has recently received much public attention is the decision to withdraw from a number of United Kingdom domestic routes. I do not propose to go into this question in great detail, because it is a commercial decision by the British Airways Board, and they have fully explained their reasons for it: that is, that the relatively small number of routes in question are loss-making, could not be turned round to make a profit and could not justify the investment in new aircraft to replace the aging Viscounts. Given the competitive climate in which British Airways have to operate, it is essential that they should be free to take and implement decisions such as this without interference. In this particular case your Lordships will have noted that other United Kingdom airlines have applied to take over the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0411"/>
<col>805</col>
routes, and thus the interests of the travelling public should not be adversely affected, It is an imperative for any business to concentrate its resources, and not to fritter them away or under-employ them. It would, however, he wrong for Ministers to dictate to British Airways how that principle should be implemented.<lb/>
The question of freedom brings me conveniently to another major aspect, without reference to which my answer to the noble Earl would be incomplete. I refer, of course, to the Government's plans to change the status of British Airways from that of a nationalised industry to a private sector company in which the general public holds a proportion of the shares. The Bill which provides the framework for this has been published, and your Lordships will have the opportunity to debate it in due course. The essential policy intention as regards British Airways is to release the airline from the existing r&#x00E9;gime of Government controls which are applied to any nationalised industry. British Airways are by no means a monopoly, and have to operate on a commercial basis. The Government's proposals recognise this, and, when implemented, will free the airline from controls imposed by the Government on important matters, such as borrowing powers, cash limits and financial targets, and controls of investment. Controls of this nature will be replaced by the disciplines of the commercial and financial markets, which, in the Government's view, is an infinitely preferable arrangement given the airline's particular circumstances, and one which will enable the management to plan ahead without fear of intervention, such as cuts being imposed on financing for its capital investment programme because of the Government's wider public expenditure considerations. Thus, in future, the airline's success will depend entirely on its own efforts, and the Government believe such freedom will be essential for British Airways to face successfully the challenges which lie ahead.<lb/>
My Lords, I have taken some time to reach the answer to the Question asked by my noble friend Lord Kimberley, but that Question was widely drawn and a proper understanding of the background is almost as important as the answer itself. Like any large organisation, British
<col>806</col>
Airways throw up individual matters which can be criticised, and indeed are. In this repect, they know their weaknesses and are making every effort to improve where necessary. But it is all too easy to concentrate on the particular, and my noble friend's Question requires us to stand back from what I might call day-to-day matters and look at British Airways more broadly, and at the plans they are making for the future. As I have indicated, those plans are based on realistic assumptions which boil down to the simple fact that life for all airlines is going to become more difficult, and only the fittest will survive. British Airways have identified what they need to do, not only to survive but to do so successfully. Although the problems have been increased by recent events largely beyond British Airways' control, their central strategy and determination remain. Nobody pretends that the road ahead is easy or that the mere existence of a plan is enough in itself, but the Government's firm answer to my noble friend's Question is, Yes, we are satisfied that British Airways' strategy can meet the problems facing the industry, and I am sure your Lordships will join me in wishing all those who work in the airline every success in their efforts.</membercontribution></p>

Petrol prices are a factor in the forecasts of vehicle use.

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01749">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01750"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01751">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01752">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they agree with the well-substantiated finding of the London Conference on Overseas Students that there is no question of such students being subsidised by the State to the tune of &#x00A3;100 million a year, and that, on the contrary, even from a strictly financial point of view, their presence results in a clear credit balance for the nation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01753"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of EDUCATION and SCIENCE (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government remain of the firm opinion that in 1979&#x2013;80 the quantifiable
<col>812</col>
demand made on public funds by overseas students will amount to about &#x00A3;100 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01754"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that reply. May I ask her whether she is aware that the findings of this conference, which no doubt she has read, seem to be broadly speaking acceptable to all those responsible for higher education in this country? Therefore, may I respectfully ask her also whether the Government would agree to give a detailed reply to the arguments advanced by the conference in this paper, so that we may all know the precise reasons for the assumption which has just been made&#x2014;an assumption without any good reasons supporting it, apparently&#x2014;that the students are in reality now being subsidised by the State to any extent whatever?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01755"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the basis of the &#x00A3;100 million that I have indicated is that the fees currently paid by overseas students in 1979&#x2013;80 will amount only to some 40 per cent. of the costs of their courses. The balance of 60 per cent. is currently provided through public funds, and that is the basis of the figure to which I have just referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01756"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the Minister will be kind enough to read this report she will see that that is simply not so. Indeed, the arguments that can be advanced against that assumption seem overwhelming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01757"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have of course read the report to which the noble Lord refers, but the fact is that that is based on using marginal costs whereas for other purposes of public funding of institutions the basis is unit costs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01758"><member>Lord WEDDERBURN of CHARLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister tell the House what account the Government have taken of the unanimous plea of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals imploring the Government to reconsider this falacious belief? Secondly, may I ask her to recognise that this policy will debar universities&#x2014;whose income is being cut by an average of 13 per cent. and in the case of certain institutions, including those in the University of London, in which I am proud to declare
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0415"/>
<col>813</col>
an interest, of something over 30 per cent.&#x2014;from recouping that income from overseas students, especially students from the Commonwealth, who have looked to Britain for many years? That is so because of the massive increase in tuition fees which the Government are insisting on placing on universities, of between &#x00A3;2,000 and &#x00A3;5,000 a year, which will make our universities have the highest tuition fee system in the world? Thirdly, would the noble Baroness not accept the words of the Secretary General of the Vice-Chancellors Committee two days ago, that this policy will inevitably end in universities, in a year or two, being unable to pay their staffs, being unable to meet their commitments&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01759"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01760"><member>Lord WEDDERBURN of CHARLTON</member><membercontribution>: &#x2014;and therefore will inevitably damage irreparably the education which they can offer&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01761"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Speech!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01762"><member>Lord WEDDERBURN of CHARLTON</member><membercontribution>: &#x2014;not only to overseas students&#x2014;I am sure the Minister will wish to hear my final few words&#x2014;but to home students who come from British schools as well?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01763"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have of course discussed the matter of overseas students with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and it is our proposal that we shall be entering into detailed discussions with them for some means particularly of helping postgraduates. The fact is that every time the charges to overseas students have gone up, so the number of overseas students in this country has increased. It is perfectly clear that the numbers overall have increased from 32,000 in 1970&#x2013;71 to 85,000 today, so we have to remember that in the background to our thinking. The Government have looked at all these matters in the context of their need to look at the costs of the total education budget and we believe, although we should prefer not to do many things, that in this context this is an appropriate saving that we can make to balance the budget in other respects.</membercontribution></p>
<col>814</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01764"><member>Baroness DAVID</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it true that there are to be certain reductions for EEC students? If so, would it not be suitable to make similar reductions for Commonwealth students?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01765"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: There will be special arrangements for EEC students, my Lords, but the way in which many Commonwealth students are currently looked after through ODA will continue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01766"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister, and I do so as a former university treasurer, whether it is a fact that as a result of these people being educated in Britain and then going back to their own countries, they forge a link with Britain which serves British industry very well indeed in future years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01767"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what the noble Lord says undoubtedly has some truth in it and there are those links, but it is very difficult to quantify in exact terms what the gains are. The figures I have given are the figures which apply to the education budget and it is very difficult to offset those against other figures which may be true but which are quite unquantifiable and would not in any event affect the need to cut Government expenditure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01768"><member>Lord ROCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: Nevertheless, my Lords, even if the subsidy is as high as &#x00A3;100 million a year, would it not be very hard to find another subsidy of the same amount which gave the same value for money in terms of our influence in the world at large?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01769"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: That would be an extremely difficult question to answer, my Lords, because one would have to look at the complete budgets of Government spending. What I and my colleagues are concerned with is the education budget and we have had to look at all aspects of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01770"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Baroness not agree that this is not an economy at all, that it is the reverse of an economy?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01771"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a statement I am not prepared to accept. I have read the article to which the noble Lord referred, and if one tries to balance
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0416"/>
<col>815</col>
it by the amounts of money overseas students might spend in this country, which in effect is describing them as a kind of invisible export, that is an unquantifiable sum, whereas the other sums are in fact on the education budget.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01772"><member>Lord ROBBINS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness realise that many of us have no objection to the raising of fees in general, provided that it is done after proper consideration of the financial situation and the benefits and losses accrued therefrom? But there are, I think, a substantial majority of those of us who have worked in universities who regard this discrimination as morally shabby. If I may be permitted to quote in one sentence the thought that goes through my head: I should have been ashamed if, in the mid-thirties when Dr. Emminger did the London School of Economics the honour of registering there, I had had to say to him, "Since you come from Germany I am obliged to charge you a higher price than someone who comes from Eton".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01773"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to assure the noble Lord, Lord Robbins, that this matter had not been gone into without very careful consideration of all the facts regarding it; but as an economist he will know better than I that the rate of the fees at universities that home students now pay is, to a certain extent, an artificial figure. When we are talking about students from overseas we should remember that they are now paying more nearly the true cost, and this has therefore put us into a particularly difficult situation. We have looked at this as one aspect in a very difficult exercise that we have had to carry out. The Government have been committed to cutting public expenditure and the education budget has had to take its share of it; and this is one way in which it is happening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01774"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware of the fact that, because of the suggestion to charge a smaller fee to people from the EEC, it will be possible for a student from Martinique to come here and be educated at a cheaper rate than a student from St. Lucia, whereas in fact the Martinique
<col>816</col>
student, having been trained, will go back and use all the training he has received to aid France, while the St. Lucian would probably use his training to aid Britain?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01775"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to assure the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, that our proposals include, as before, the arrangements which have been made particularly, I think, for students from former British colonies to come and study through the Overseas Development Agency, and that is a separate exercise from the one that I am describing.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IMMIGRATION RULES: <lb/>PROPOSED CHANGES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01776">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01777"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01778">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01779">To ask Her Majesty's Government how they reconcile their proposals for changes in the treatment under the law on immigration of husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s of women with a right of abode in the United Kingdom with their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01780"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will very soon be presenting a White Paper containing proposals for changes in the immigration rules. The Government do not believe that these proposals will contravene our international obligations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01781"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that, according to the best advice that I have been able to receive, these proposals are contrary to Articles 3, 14, 16, 17, 23 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Articles 8, 12 and 14 of the European Convention? Is the noble Lord further aware that the Home Secretary publicly admitted that the proposed changes regarding husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s are discriminatory, but refused to be drawn on
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0417"/>
<col>817</col>
whether or not the Government's policy would be reversed if the European Court should subsequently find us guilty of an offence? In the circumstances, would it not be better to think again about this matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01782"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not one of the articles which the noble Lord has quoted so far as the International Covenant is concerned is relevant, because, when the previous Government ratified the covenant in 1976, the Government entered a reservation so far as this country's immigration control is concerned. So all the articles that the noble Lord quoted to me are not relevant at all. So far as the European Convention is concerned, I repeat that the Government do not believe that we shall contravene the convention, but perhaps your Lordships would prefer to see the actual text of the White Paper before we discuss that matter in detail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01783"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that a woman who is a citizen of any other EEC country may come to Britain and bring her overseas husband with her? This puts British women in an absolutely absurd and iniquitous position. Is the noble Lord further aware that countries such as the United States, Sweden, and Israel treat men and women citizens alike, and there is no bar on foreign spouses? Perhaps he could let me know whether there is any developed nation which discriminates against women in the way that is proposed by this Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01784"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not believe that the reply to a Question for Written Answer in another place on 1st November, from which the noble Lord's Question arises, in any way reflects proposals which are sexually discriminatory. The abuse of the arranged marriage system is in itself sexually discriminatory, and I am surprised that the noble Baroness does not recognise this. It uses girls in this country in such a way as to enable men to enter illegally, in effect. I think this is something which all fair-minded people in this country would wish to see brought to an end, and it is at this that the Government's proposals are aimed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01785"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to intervene again but, in view of
<col>818</col>
what the Minister has said, I think we ought to be presented with some evidence about this&#x2014;what are the abuses, what are the numbers concerned?&#x2014;so that we know on what basis this really reactionary proposal is made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01786"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a perfectly fair question, and perhaps the noble Baroness, and indeed the House, would prefer it if detailed statistics were given when the White Paper is presented; but, in broad terms, the number of husbands coming into this country has changed since the concession was made by the previous Home Secretary, Mr. Roy Jenkins, in 1974, so that we now have husbands coming in at three times the rate at which they were coming in during 1974. So far as concerns the number of male fianc&#x00E9;s coming in, the rate of increase is considerably greater.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01787"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend not agree that, regarding international civil and political rights, it would be equally apt to ask Members opposite how they reconcile their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights with the trade union closed shop?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01788"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01789"><member>The Lord Bishop of TRURO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the fact that there appears to be an admitted intention to discriminate on grounds of colour, may I ask the noble Lord whether the Government have sought the advice of the Commission on Racial Equality on the implications of such a step?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01790"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say to the right reverend Prelate that, if he cares to look at the Written Answer to a Question in another place given by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary on 1st November, he will see, I think, that it is not apparent that the proposals are racially discriminatory. They will mean that Asian and other girls from the new Commonwealth who are born here will benefit equally with women born in the United Kingdom from provisions enabling them to bring in the partners of genuine marriages.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0418"/>
<col>819</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01791"><member>The Lord Bishop of TRURO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I asked whether the Commission on Racial Equality had been consulted. Js that so, or not, may I ask the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01792"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, so far as I know that is not the case, but it is not the case for the reason that I have given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01793"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord agree with his right honourable friend the Home Secretary that the proposals mentioned in this Question are both sexist and racialist; and, if so, does this not directly contravene the pledge given by the Conservative Party in its Manifesto that all British citizens should be treated equally?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01794"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right about the Conservative Party Manifesto, but the Manifesto also said that firm immigration control is essential for good community relations, and it is this that the Government are attempting to achieve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01795"><member>Lord SEGAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord say whether the immigration officers (who, by and large, do a difficult task with sympathy and humanity) will give priority to immigrants who are refugees from political and religious persecution; and will he not agree that these immigrants, in respect of whom this country has a great tradition, are likely to prove a far greater asset to the community than those who seek to enter the country because "the grass is greener on the other side"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01796"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say this to the noble Lord, Lord Segal. I think it has run across party boundaries that in this country we really have attempted to do our best so far as concerns people who are fleeing from r&#x00E9;gimes which are harsh; and, of course, the latest example of this has been the tragedy of the Vietnamese boat people. I do not know whether it exactly answers the noble Lord's question, and indeed I think we ought to wait until we have the statement on the White Paper, but may I draw the noble Lord's attention to the second paragraph of the Written Answer given by my right honourable friend the
<col>820</col>
Home Secretary on 1st November, in which he refers to the discretion which the Secretary of State has in looking at applications for entry into this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01797"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the question of the abuse of the arranged marriage system, is the noble Lord aware that in an answer which I think he himself gave me it was shown that, since the change in the rules in March 1977, only 356 husbands have been refused leave to remain indefinitely in the United Kingdom following the 12 months' probationary period, and that this amounts to less than 3 per cent. of the total number of husbands admitted during that period? Further, is the Minister aware that in neither of the instruments I mention in my original Question, nor in the law of any civilised country, can there be found the notion of reasonable and unreasonable discrimination, introduced in the letter from the noble Lord to me of 3rd August? If the Government really believe in the rule of law, as they say, then why do they persist in doing something which is clearly contrary to the obligations we have assumed, at least under the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Great Britain has solemnly bound itself by its adherence to that instrument?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01798"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to the first part of the noble Lord's supplementary question I would simply repeat, without going into statistics, which I have but which I do not think the House wants at the moment&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01799"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01800"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: Very well, my Lords. In 1973, before the concession was made by the then Home Secretary in 1974, there were some 2,440 husbands who were already here and were allowed to settle. In that year, a further number of husbands were admitted for settlement, making a total of about 3,000 of these men who had then entered the country. In 1974, only one year later, after the concession, some 7,000 husbands were admitted; and last year that total had risen to 9,500. So far as fianc&#x00E9;s are concerned, in 1973, before the concession, only a handful of male fianc&#x00E9;s was admitted for settlement. Last year, the number was over 2,000. I think those statistics show that this is a practice
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0419"/>
<col>821</col>
which not only is deliberately evading immigration control but is increasing. I say that because I think, if the noble Lord will forgive me for saying so, he really is ignoring the fact that there is a problem here, and it is a problem which is on the increase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01801"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's figures do not show anything of the kind. Is it not the case that, if the noble Lord wants to show that abuse is taking place, he has to demonstrate to the House that during the 12 months' probationary period, for which husbands are now admitted following the change in the rules in March 1977, further leave to remain is then refused? Is it not correct to say that in a Written Answer to me the other day the noble Lord himself gave the figure that only 356 husbands had been so refused leave to remain permanently in the United Kingdom since the change in the rules, and that this represents less than 3 per cent. of the total admitted during that period?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01802"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the pleasure of answering in writing so many Questions from the noble Lord on this subject that I am afraid that one or two of my replies slip my memory. Perhaps the details of this matter are something which we should now debate on the statement on the White Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ANIMAL IMPORTS: <lb/>RABIES ORDER CONDITIONS</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01804"><member>Lord GRIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01805">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01806">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are satisfied that the legal conditions applicable under the Rabies Order 1974 to the import of animals through Heathrow Airport are being observed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01807"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES and FOOD (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are satisfied that the terms and conditions of the 1974 order are widely observed.</membercontribution></p>
<col>822</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01808"><member>Lord GRIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend the Minister for his reply, may I ask him whether it is not a fact that, under an informal Ministry and airlines animal dealers agreement at Heathrow, live animals are being imported through Heathrow to transit sheds or cargo sheds, and not direct to the quarantine station, and that thus they are for many hours under no supervision at all? Does this not invite abuse of the Rabies Order?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01809"><member>Earl FERRERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when an animal is imported to Heathrow it goes into a holding facility, where it may stay for up to four hours, to be collected from there by an appropriate carrying agent, who will take it to the quarantine kennel. If it has to stay for longer than four hours, it will then go to the animal quarantine centre, where it can stay for 48 hours before going to a quarantine kennel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01810"><member>Lord DRUMALBYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend remind the House what animals are covered by the Rabies Order?</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NATION'S DIFFICULTIES<lb/>AND OPPORTUNITIES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01813">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01814"><member>Lord THORNEYCROFT</member> rose to call attention to the difficulties and opportunities facing the country; to take note of Her Majesty's Government's policies in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0420"/>
<col>823</col>
dealing with them; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move the Motion in my name, which is couched in fairly unexceptional terms. It is to draw attention to the difficulties and opportunities facing the country and to take note of the policies to deal with them. At this time of year, it is indeed not unusual for the House to have a general debate which rises above the details of legislation and takes a view of the broad strategy of the Government of the day. For reasons well understood, we are not having that kind of debate on the gracious Speech this year. But it may be for the convenience of the House that we should at least have one such general debate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01815">My Lords, I do not speak as a member of the Government. I do not have the responsibilities and the heavy burdens of office. There is a small but positive gap between this Bench and the Front Bench there. I speak, however, as the chairman of a great political party and I think it is perhaps not unreasonable that we, all of us, on the Back Benches should have a chance of saying how we view the scene and what we think could usefully be done about it. If I start with the scene, I am going to put it shortly, drawing it on the canvas with a broad brush, but I put it this way. We are a country heavily in debt. It is said that the interest payments with which we support that debt could, of themselves, if devoted in another way, pay for a National Health Service or for the defences of the nation. It is a massive burden. We pay large sums in tax&#x2014;not quite as large in direct taxes as we used to, but still very substantial. The gap between what a man earns at work and what he earns if he does not work is still, in many cases, a pretty narrow one. I observed that the Social Services Commission was urging that that should be kept narrow for a long time. I, myself, hope that such advice will not be followed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01816">We are a nation producing not much more than we produced at the time of the three-day week ; our productivity is among the lowest in Europe, and despite the enormous assets of North Sea oil and natural gas our balance of payments is only narrowly and sometimes uncertainly achieved. On top of that, we find ourselves faced with a planned overspend of
<col>824</col>
somewhere about &#x00A3;3,500 million. That is a plan to spend money of that kind, which is not available and with no plans to raise it. That is a grave and difficult series of problems to confront us. Those are facts and your Lordships will observe that I have not tried to apportion blame about them; I take them as the facts of the situation confronting us at the present time. I doubt whether in this debate they will really be controverted from either side of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01817">We could meet our problems by putting up taxes; but we would have to raise the taxes to something like 38 per cent. of a standard rate or VAT at 20 per cent. We could print the money&#x2014;but this is something that we have tried before, with disastrous consequences. Or we could try to borrow even more; but, as I have already indicated, the cost of borrowing is now more than we can sustain. It is true that in these circumstances to cut the planned expenditure is the only option realistically open to this country at the present time. If anybody in this House thinks that there are any other realistic options one would listen to them in the debate, but it does not seem so at this moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01818">It is true that after we have cut, after we have made all the efforts that the Government are making at the present time, that, of itself, will create no room for extra taxation. We shall still be spending as large a proportion of the gross national product as before. Public spending in the coming year will be as high as, indeed marginally higher than, it was last year. But this is not an argument against the policies. Rather, it is the measure of the need for them. Therefore, I conclude that the Government are right in their decision to impose cuts and the debate is more about where we spend and what we save.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01819">My Lords, we were left with some pretty heavy burdens; we were left with a post-dated cheque on wages of &#x00A3;250 million. There is no cash ready available to pay for it. It is the equivalent of 10,000 hospital beds or looking after 300,000 patients for a year. When we talk about wages, I sometimes think it a good thing to translate wages into the terms of the real things that that money represents in the country in which we live. Every wage increase which is unmatched either
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0421"/>
<col>825</col>
by increased production or by improved efficiency is a direct blow to the weak, to the sick and to the unfortunate in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01820">Of course, the best way of saving is not in services but in overheads. If I am an expert in anything, I would claim to have had some experience in cutting Government expenditure. My knowledge was learned the hard way. If your Lordships will bear with me for just a moment, as an old hand looking at the National Health Service, I think that, with a proportion of 100,000 administrators to 33,000 doctors, surely there is an opportunity there. Surely, there is something that could be done, or quite a number of things that could be done, inside the National Health Service without having any immediate or desperate effect on the patients.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01821">Let us take my old friends in the Ministry of Defence. I remember in the old days if you approached them on cuts they would say, "Minister, it means the end of the First Armoured Division". I am not sure that there is a First Armoured Division at this moment, but the same kind of argument will be advanced all the time. The last thing they think of looking at is the enormous machinery at the centre&#x2014;with the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, most of them, alas! still pursuing their separate policies for their catering services and the rest. Believe me, there is room for a good deal of movement together. And there are those who cut in most sensitive areas. I am bound to say that the Inner London Education Authority's choice of schools would bear a little examination, if I may suggest it to my noble friend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01822">In regard to a Government department, if one asks such a department to cut, the last thing they will offer is a deputy secretary. These are sacred to the organisation. That is why I rather favour as a profession putting in outside people to examine closely on the spot where the fat really is, and where it could most usefully be removed. Regarding the local authorities, I observe that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment suggested that if we did not replace one person out of every four who left the Civil Service it would be a good thing. But what does the Brent Council do? I observe today
<col>826</col>
that, having lost their chief executive, they are appointing two chief executives in his place. These are the things which the public ought to go for.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01823">The Lambeth Council now has one local authority employee for every 28 fortunate citizens of Lambeth. They have a debt interest payment of &#x00A3;34 million a year which somebody has worked out as &#x00A3;1 a day for every family of three. There is room for indignation in Lambeth, but not at the Government for cutting. There is room for indignation at the appalling waste of public money in one area after another. I should like the indignation that the people feel, the pain and suffering which we all feel in some of these cuts, to be diverted for a moment to examine together where we can cut overheads; where we can prune overblown bureaucracies; where we can cut down the amount of administration, and how best we can concentrate on providing the real services we require.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01824">So far I have dealt with the facts and with the actions that are taken on them. I, however, know that the crisis that confronts this country is rather more subtle than that. Many of the problems that face us as a nation are moral as much as they are monetary. The Labour Government, when they were in office, were supported by a minority of the electorate and led by social democrats&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01825"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: So are you!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01826"><member>Lord THORNEYCROFT</member><membercontribution>: I know, my Lords. I accept this completely. If the noble Lord will follow me, he will see the point of what I have to say. The Labour Government were led by social democrats; yet they were determined to achieve a permanent shift to the Left, an irreversible shift to the Left. I am not absolutely sure&#x2014;I know they lost the election&#x2014;whether they succeeded or failed in that particular objective. What I do know is that the attempts to do it had some dramatic effects upon this nation when they were in office. I do know that the attempt to do it also has had a dramatic effect upon the Labour Party now that it is in Opposition. The attempt by the unions to obtain control of the Labour Party through the NEC is of much more than domestic importance to the Labour Party. It is a trend which goes to the very root of the prospects
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0422"/>
<col>827</col>
of this country, its government and its constitution in the years to come.<lb/>
Mr. Clive Jenkins was claiming at the Trades Union Congress that the unions provided a democratic alternative government for the British people. My Lords, the unions provide nothing of the kind. It is vital that in this House, as indeed in all parts of Parliament, this principle should be asserted. What, therefore, should be the attitude to the unions? Once every few weeks I leave the Central Office and go to Transport House. There I sit down with Mr. Moss Evans, Mr. Jack Jones and other leading trade unionists and industrialists on the Ernest Bevin Memorial Trust. There we plan together how best young trade unionists can go overseas to study the events in other countries, how they run their affairs, and so forth. That is not an important discussion so far as grand policy is concerned, but to me it represents a kind of small island of sanity in a world in which sometimes sanity is sadly missing, a tiny bridge in a world where bridges are singularly absent.<lb/>
The Conservative Party approaches the trade union movement not as an enemy but as a friend. Millions of trade unionists voted for the Conservative Party in the last election. The Conservative trade union movement itself is growing constantly in size. Millions of trade unionists&#x2014;look what is happening in British Leyland at the present moment&#x2014;are demonstrating that they are really determined to try to get an atmosphere of reality into the world in which they live and into the relations which exist between their companies and the unions of which they are loyal members.<lb/>
How do we then approach this matter? The trade union movement is based on privilege&#x2014;and rightly based on privilege. Under our laws, the trade unions are placed above the law as it applies to other institutions or other individuals. But the public in this country are increasingly aghast at the abuse of trade union power; at the activities of NUPE; at the blackmail tactics of unions like SLADE; at their arrogance in refusing to participate even in an inquiry.<lb/>
It is not just one section of the public; it is all sections of the public. It includes millions of trade unionists as well. The Government propose some modest reforms
<col>828</col>
in trade union legislation; reforms with regard to the ballot, the closed shop and the picket. As they go forward, I think that it would be a very brave man who would attack them for going too far. The criticism that they are likely to meet in the country is that they are not going far enough. I am, I claim, a friend of the trade unions. I believe in preserving the privileges which they have earned and which I believe were rightly given to them. I see the gravest danger that if those privileges are abused too far the British people will say: "Privilege is all right; but privileged men have special additional responsibilities themselves and these responsibilities have to be shown and exercised".<lb/>
Going beyond the trade union side as to what happens in the places where we work, this country is pre-eminent in many things; it is pre-eminent in its capacity to invent and design; it is pre-eminent in its service industries. It is pre-eminent in agriculture; but when it comes to men working in large units, particularly when heavily unionised, we show a degree of inefficiency compared with our competitors which is going to place the gravest problems before us if we are to build up the kind of society which we want. If we are to pay the kind of wages which are earned in other parts of the world, if we are to have social services of the standards which all of us on all sides of your Lordships' House would wish to see, we must create wealth; we must earn profits; we must be able to have enough to distribute this wealth and these profits widely and for the benefit of all. We must provide opportunities for the strong and succour for the weak. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RHODESIA: CONSTITUTIONAL<lb/>CONFERENCE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01827">3.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01828"><member>The SECRETARY of STATE for FOREIGN and COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS (Lord Carrington)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise to the Leader of the Opposition but, with the leave of the House, I will make a Statement on Rhodesia. A similar Statement is being made in another place.<lb/>
In my Statement of 24th October I described the proposals which the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0423"/>
<col>829</col>
Government had put to the constitutional conference for the holding of elections in Southern Rhodesia and the administration of the country in the pre-independence period.<lb/>
The full proposals which the Government tabled on 2nd November have been placed in the library of the House. We have also published today as a White Paper the summary of the independence constitution accepted by the parties at Lancaster House.<lb/>
At Lancaster House we have now achieved provisional agreement on a constitution, and have made considerable progress towards agreement on the interim period. I hope that we shall soon be able to proceed to negotiations for a ceasefire and the arrangements for monitoring it. The conference is therefore moving towards a conclusion. We must be able to act without delay to implement the final agreement for which we are working with all parties. Any delay in putting a settlement into effect would cost further lives and could place the settlement itself at risk.<lb/>
The purpose of the enabling Bill which the Government are introducing later today is to enable us to implement the interim arrangements without delay. It will enable the Government to make the independence constitution, to introduce parts of it before independence, to allow elections to be held, and to provide for the appointment of a governor with full powers. Existing legislation is not adequate for these purposes.<lb/>
The Salisbury delegation have accepted the proposals which the Government have put to them as a basis for a settlement. The Patriotic Front have also accepted the principles of a British governor and new elections. We are therefore very close to a settlement which is fully consistent with the communiqu&#x00E9; of the meeting of Heads of Commonwealth Governments in Lusaka. In these circumstances the Government believe that it would be wrong now to take the positive action of renewing Section 2 of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965. But, as the House will be aware, the great bulk of sanctions&#x2014;those relating to direct trade and the transfer of funds&#x2014;do not depend on Section 2 but on orders made under
<col>830</col>
other Acts, and they will continue until they are revoked. These sanctions will be lifted as soon as Rhodesia returns to legality with the appointment of a governor and his arrival in Salisbury.<lb/>
The Bill which will be placed before the House enables the Government to take whatever action is necessary in relation to Rhodesia, depending on the state of progress at the conference. This includes the power to continue those sanctions at present imposed under Section 2. But, given the position now reached, the Government find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which this would be necessary.<lb/>
While the Government would have preferred to give both Houses more time to consider the Bill, the timing of the introduction of the Bill has been related to the progress of the conference. It is essential that the governor should be in a position when, as we hope, agreement is reached to give effect to a settlement without delay and for elections to be held as soon as possible. A great deal of progress has been made in the talks. We were glad to hear this morning that President Kaunda will be coming to London tomorrow. This will be a most timely visit. His presence will, I am sure, assist our progress towards a peaceful settlement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01829">3.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01830"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, for making that Statement. Clearly, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia issue has reached a crucial and perhaps a decisive stage and, as throughout the past nine weeks, the Opposition&#x2014;we on this side of the House&#x2014;do not propose to say or do anything today which may in the least imperil the chances of an agreed settlement. The noble Lord will need all his very considerable skills to complete a settlement which will be agree-able to all parties.<lb/>
We very much welcome the publication, even at this late stage, of a White Paper summarising the independence constitution. I have one question to put on the Statement we have just listened to. In paragraph 2, there are these words:
<quote>" the independence constitution accepted by the parties at Lancaster House ".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0424"/>
<col>831</col>
Then immediately after that there follows this sentence:
<quote>" At Lancaster House we have now achieved provisional agreement on a constitution &#x2026;".</quote>
Perhaps the noble Lord may be able to assure us that there is in fact final agreement on the independence constitution. If so, it is a very big step forward indeed and, if there is such agreement&#x2014;and by "agreement" we would mean the agreement of the two delegations from Rhodesia at Lancaster House and of the Front-Line Presidents as well as the British Government&#x2014;then we would not cavil at the most expeditious way of putting into effect what flows from such agreement. Nevertheless, my noble friend the Chief Whip will be putting certain Business questions, probably with a certain amount of professional acerbity, after we have completed this particular set of exchanges.<lb/>
I will say no more at this stage but will leave it to my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones to raise one or two legal points affecting our position internationally. However, I will put these two questions to the noble Lord. They relate to the action which he clearly proposes to take, possibly in the next few days, in relation, for instance, to the nomination and accrediting or empowering of a governor. That may happen&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014;very quickly indeed.<lb/>
First, as to sanctions, are the Government satisfied, and will they be in a position to satisfy the House, that nothing they propose in regard to sanctions will in the least place us in default with the United Nations, by whose resolutions in this matter we are morally and legally bound? Secondly, as to the management of the transition stage, which is possibly one of the most difficult aspects of this agreement that the noble Lord has had to cope with, is it intended that there shall be an assumption of legality, as we understand it, on the appointment and positioning of the governor with full powers in Salisbury ahead of the agreement on a ceasefire? If so, it seems to me that he and the country may be placed in a very difficult situation. We devoutly hope that the reference made by the noble Lord in his Statement to the possibility of proceeding quickly to negotiations for a ceasefire and arrangements for monitoring it will bear fruit.<lb/>
<col>832</col>
Those are the two points I would leave with the noble Lord and the House at this point. However, he needs no reassurance from me that we shall seek to be as helpful as possible, subject to the completion of a truly agreed and durable solution. We have not yet seen the enabling Bill. We hope very much that it is an enabling Bill and that whatever flows from it in the form of regulations sanctioned by Orders in Council will in every case return to both Houses on the basis of Affirmative Resolutions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01831">3.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01832"><member>Lord GLADWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we should like to be associated with the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, in welcoming this very important and extremely satisfactory Statement on the part of the Government. I must say that a month or two ago few people in this country thought that the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, would get as far he has. The fact that he has got as far as this seems almost to be approaching a miracle. If he brings it off, he deserves the congratulations of the entire nation. It is quite true that there is now one outstanding point which is very difficult, and which is, of course, the cease-fire and the arrangements for monitoring it. We can only hope that, with the arrival of President Kaunda, some kind of formula will be found at this stage. Perhaps we may even hope that it will be fairly soon. Of course, everything else depends on that.<lb/>
I have one question to ask, which is virtually the same as that put by the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts. I read in the Statement that,
<quote>" These sanctions will be lifted as soon as Rhodesia returns to legality with the appointment of a governor and his arrival in Salisbury ".</quote>
It rather depends on what is meant by "returns to legality". I imagine&#x2014;I may be wrong&#x2014;that when the governor arrives in Rhodesia, there will already have been some arrangement on a ceasefire. It is difficult to imagine that the governor will be able to do much without a return to a ceasefire. So one assumes that "returns to legality" means that there will be an agreement on a ceasefire, also.<lb/>
If that is so, then the remaining question is the United Nations. We have always assumed that the United Nations would have to agree in principle. But if it
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0425"/>
<col>833</col>
really is a question of returning to legality in the sense that I have already used the term, then a great many people in this country would certainly not be in favour of keeping on sanctions. How you get the agreement of the United Nations is an interesting question, and the noble Lord may like to make some reference to that aspect when he comes to reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01833">3.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01834"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for their approach to the Statement that I have made. The White Paper on the constitution, which we have laid for convenience in the Printed Paper Office, has, of course, been available in the Library for about a month, so I think that any of your Lordships who would have cared to could have read it in that time. But I thought it would be convenient if it was put in the Printed Paper Office, in case any of your Lordships had not seen it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, asked about the difference between accepting the constitution and the phrase following. The situation has always been that both delegations have accepted the constitution, on the understanding that they are satisfied both with the interim period and with the ceasefire; they arc happy with the constitution, provided that they are happy with the other processes. I thought at this conference that it was necessary to proceed stage by stage on that basis, because, if one can learn anything from the past, it is that if you try to do everything at once all the waters get muddied. It seemed to me that on this occasion the right thing to try to do was to separate the three issues of constitution, interim arrangements and ceasefire, and having got conditional agreement on the first two, then to tackle the last one.<lb/>
I hope very much that we are now entering into a phase when things are going to happen very quickly indeed, and I agree very much with what the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, said about that. If things happen very quickly, I think that, in a sense, the sanctions issue will resolve itself, because we shall be able to take off sanctions legally very quickly. Sanctions will be taken off when the governor takes over in Salisbury, and he will take over
<col>834</col>
when a ceasefire has been agreed. I would not say that all the shooting will have stopped, but not until the ceasefire is agreed will he take over. Then, at that point, there is, of course, legality.<lb/>
I said in the original Statement that the Government had taken powers, under the new enabling Bill which will be published this afternoon, to continue sanctions which are at present imposed under Section 2, which we do not intend to move. But I went on to say that, given the position now reached, the Government find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which this would be necessary, which means to say that I hope that we shall continue very quickly. But, of course, the bulk of the sanctions still remain and I think I am satisfied, and the Government are satisfied, that we would not be in breach of our United Nations obligations about sanctions, and we would be in a good legal position and a position which I, personally, would find unanswerable, if we could say to the United Nations that the rebellion was at an end, that Rhodesia was once more a legal part of Her Majesty's Dominions and that the governor was in charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01835">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01836"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I welcome what the noble Lord, the Foreign Secretary, has said and ask him to clarify the position as I understand it. Is it that the arrangements about a ceasefire are a pre-condition to the sending of the governor to Salisbury and the return to a state of legality? That is the first question that I wanted to ask, and I think it is implicit in what the noble Lord has just said that that is so. But I want a little clarification on that, if he will he kind enough to give it. Secondly, will he give an assurance that when the relevant orders are brought before Parliament they will be made subject to Affirmative Resolution? Thirdly, will opportunity be given for Parliament to consider the constitutional proposals. That is a little obscure at the moment. I imagine that that will be so, but it will be as well to get an assurance to that effect. If I may say so, the summary is a helpful one. It has, in fact, been in the Library only since a week today, but that is a point of detail and is of no great importance. But if the noble Lord will give that assurance, I think it will be very
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0426"/>
<col>835</col>
helpful. May I, finally, ask whether the noble Lord is aware that we on this side of the House greatly welcome the arrival of President Kaunda?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01837"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there is to be an agreement between all the parties at the conference, between the Patriotic Front and the Salisbury delegation, it is essential that there should be a ceasefire, because if there are to be elections in which everybody takes part it is not possible to have them until there is a ceasefire. Consequently, a ceasefire is necessary. In the context that we are talking about, it will obviously be necessary for a ceasefire and for the governor to go as soon as it is arranged. I wonder whether I might find out the answer to the second question put to me by the noble and learned Lord. I am afraid that I do not know the answer, as it is drafted in the Bill, and I ought to. But I will find out.<lb/>
Also, I apologise for the three-week error that I have made about the placing of the document in the Library. It certainly should have been there a month ago and I will find out why it was not. I must apologise to the noble and learned Lord for that. As regards a debate on the constitution and so on, it will be necessary for an independence Bill to be put before your Lordships' House and Parliament, as well as, I am afraid, a number of other orders on which there will be&#x2014;I promise your Lordships&#x2014;plenty of opportunity for debating anything to do with Rhodesia and the proposals that we are making.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01838"><member>Lord CHELWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend whether he could say the briefest word about the scale on which international aid is likely to be available for Zimbabwe-Rhodesia after the return to legality? Also, to what extent is he satisfied that this will match reasonably well with their needs, bearing in mind the parlous state of the economy after many years of sanctions and civil war?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01839"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that my noble friend raises a very important question. It has not been possible&#x2014;while we have been negotiating to see whether or not it is at all possible
<col>836</col>
to get an agreement&#x2014;to ask those who might be prepared to contribute to the rehabilitation of the country, and to help, whether or not they will do so. We know for certain that the United States will help over the question of the resettlement of land, and I have on a number of occasions recently, when visiting my colleagues in Europe and elsewhere, pointed out that there will be need for funds to assist Rhodesia to recover from these last years. I certainly accept the implication behind my noble friend's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01840">3.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01841"><member>Lord BARNBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the Statement included information that legislation is to be promptly introduced with the hope of a rapid passage through Parliament, and in view of the recollection of the experience of the Pearce Commission and the misfortunes which that brought about, does the Foreign Secretary feel that he is in a position to indicate that after the passage of the legislation there will be a clear understanding that a maximum time will be set before the elections are completed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01842"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the interim arrangements, about which I think your Lordships know, the period set aside for the election is two months. This is two months after the ceasefire actually operates, so it is a little longer than two months. In ideal conditions I think that that is, in the circumstances, too short, but we are not, unfortunately, in ideal conditions. We have to take into consideration the problems. There will be the problem of what I am afraid will necessarily be a fragile ceasefire, and there will also be the problems that the British governor will have to face in managing affairs during that period.<lb/>
If I may say so, I think it is an act of some courage on the part of Her Majesty's Government to assume this responsibility for a period of time, in view of the fact that the issues in Rhodesia are not entirely unknown to the people of Rhodesia. Ever since August it has been known that there was going to be a conference, and ever since 10th September we have been discussing the question whether or not elections could be held. I have no doubt that the parties are already getting themselves ready for the election. However,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0427"/>
<col>837</col>
I am absolutely certain that my noble friend is right when he says that if the period between the ceasefire and the actual taking place of the elections is too long we shall be in real danger of losing the settlement as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01843"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the Foreign Secretary agree that this rebellion which is now coming to an end has been brought about entirely by the action of the Patriotic Front in carrying the war into Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, so that it is now recognised by the rebels in that country that rebellion does not pay? Would the Foreign Secretary make quite sure that the period which is necessary for there to be free and fair elections is wholly adequate from the point of view of those who have brought this rebellion to an end?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01844"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, speaks as if it were a foregone conclusion that the rebellion is at an end. And the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, was optimistic. I must tell your Lordships that the Patriotic Front has not yet accepted the interim arrangements, and it is by no means certain that the way ahead is clear&#x2014;by no means certain. I hope very much that it is and I hope that tomorrow President Kaunda will enable us to come to a conclusion. However, with regard to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, No, I do not agree with him. If the rebellion is brought to an end I think it will be brought to an end by the good sense and statesmanship of all concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01845"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will not the Foreign Secretary, in doing what is really a balancing act, accept that perhaps too short a period could be as dangerous as too long a period, if not more dangerous? In other words, does he not think that an extension of the period by a month or two may provide a more balanced election which would be seen to be fair and which would be accepted as fair, whereas an election that has been forced through in a short period may be regarded as a rigged election and therefore the rebellion does not end, or the problem which that area now faces may in fact continue?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01846"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord says that I am doing a balancing act. It is about the best description that could possibly be used. If you lengthen the period of the election too much you fall off one way. If you shorten it too much, you fall off the other way. The only thing which any of us can do in these very difficult circumstances is to make a judgment about the time which is fair for both parties or for all the parties who are taking part in the election to be able to compete in and win a free and fair election. I think that we have got it right, though no doubt there will be arguments both ways. But since I am balancing and am still on the tightrope, I hope that your Lordships will support me.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01847">3.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01848"><member>The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Lord Soames)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following on the Statement made by my noble friend and the questions put to him by a number of your Lordships, it may be for the convenience of the House if I make a Statement on the Government's intentions regarding the Bill on Southern Rhodesia which is being introduced in another place this afternoon.<lb/>
It is expected that the Commons will complete their consideration of the Bill in time for it to be taken through all its stages in this House on Monday next. In these circumstances, the Public Bill Office will accept amendments to the Bill from tomorrow onwards. Any such amendments should be tabled by reference to the Bill as first printed for the Commons which will be available later today in the Printed Paper Office&#x2014;in fact, very soon, I hope. Any amendments tabled will then be printed with their correct references and published on Monday at the same time as the Lords print of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01849"><member>Baroness LLEWELYN-DAVIES of HASTOE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be very grateful to the noble Lord the Leader of the House for explaining about the Bill. I ought to say that if the Bill, which is obviously of overwhelming importance, takes an inordinate time on Monday, we might have to ask for an extra hour or two on Tuesday. I thought it fair to mention that. Secondly, we are most
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0428"/>
<col>839</col>
grateful for the information about the amendments. May I take it that five o'clock on Friday, the usual deadline for amendments, is the same deadline for this Bill, and that anything after that would be a manuscript amendment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01850"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as to the last question asked by the noble Baroness, that is indeed correct. As to her first question, I must say that it is very much the hope of the Government that we shall be able to deal with this Bill on Monday because it is a matter of great urgency and because there is a final moment by which we want to get it. Therefore, I hope very much that it will be possible, in view of the fact that it is an enabling Bill of, I agree, enormous importance, to complete all its stages on Monday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01851"><member>Lord WIGODER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, whatever the reasons for the delay in bringing forward this enabling Bill, we on these Benches certainly recognise that it is now being brought forward at such a late stage that somewhat more haste in dealing with it is necessary than would really be desirable. We shall certainly not oppose the taking of the various stages of this Bill with more rapidity than is customary. However, could the noble Lord the Leader of the House indicate what procedural steps he will be taking in order to achieve that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01852"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we shall put down a Motion to suspend the relevant Standing Order which will enable the House to take the Bill through all its stages on the same day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01853"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Leader of the House to dispel some rumours which have been going around during the last day or two, one of which is that we shall be taking this Bill tomorrow and that we shall be sitting on Friday, although I understand from the Leader of the House that in fact we shall not be sitting on Friday?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01854"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not if I get my way ! The Bill will be taken through all its stages in this House on Monday. What happens in another place on Thursday, Thursday night or Friday I wot not of, but we shall not be here on Friday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01855"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Leader of the House be good enough to
<col>840</col>
inform me, because I have perhaps missed something, whether this enabling Bill will be subject to an affirmative order if it is passed? If that is so and we are not giving a blank cheque, one's attitude towards the Bill will be much more friendly than it otherwise would be, because I do not believe in giving the Tory Party blank cheques.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01856"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this will enable Orders in Council to be laid; whether some of them or all of them will be affirmative as opposed to negative orders I am afraid I cannot say at this juncture but I will inform myself as soon as may be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01857"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely the Bill itself will take the ordinary course of Second Reading, Committee stage, Report, Third Reading and so on?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01858"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: Absolutely, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01859"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there is any doubt on any of these points, will the Leader of the House be good enough to make quite sure, not that the "usual channels" operate but that the House will be informed as to what the procedure will be?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01860"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill will be published and it will be available in the Printed Paper Office at any moment now. It will go through all its stages. I thought the particular question that the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, was asking me was the same question as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, asked my noble friend the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;that is, whether all the orders that flow from this enabling Bill will require an affirmative vote or not. My noble friend regretted that he could not give an immediate answer to that and, as he cannot give an immediate answer, I am terribly sorry to say that I cannot either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01861"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord the Leader of the House cannot give an answer, before we pass this enabling Bill we must have an answer and I suggest therefore that we must get the answer not later than tomorrow, because otherwise, so far as I am concerned, I shall oppose this Bill tooth and nail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01862"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will be in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NATION'S DIFFICULTIES<lb/>AND OPPORTUNITIES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01863">4.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01864">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01865"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, now we turn to mundane matters. I should like first to address my remarks to the noble Lord who opened the debate. He said that he did not speak for the Government. All I can say is that he made a very good case for the Government and I remember listening to a very fine broadcast which be made on sound radio and thinking, "My goodness, Lord Thorneycroft is again like he used to be years ago when I first knew him in 1945&#x2014;Captain Peter Thorneycroft who wrote a very fine pamphlet on development areas". I am afraid he has become a little more Right-Wing since then and I regret it. I do not think I have changed my stance at all. I am proud to be a member of the Labour Party and I am proud to say that I am a socialist, in the best sense.<lb/>
I welcome this debate. The noble Lord is quite right; we need occasionally to have debates of this kind where there is no specific Motion but where we can discuss the broad strategy of Government policy, although I must admit that many of the points which have been raised by the noble Lord were covered in the debate which we had on the gracious Speech, which I thought was a good and effective debate.<lb/>
I regret what the noble Lord said about unions. I think he has got it wrong. He is living in the world of fantasy. I know that he is now a distinguished businessman and has done much for the regions with one of his companies in the North-West, but I think he has got it wrong. I do not think we can blame every trade unionist for shifts to the Left or even shifts to the Right. Generally speaking the trade unionists that I meet in my party and at conference are reasonable men. Obviously in any organisation or any party one may get some unreasonable people, but broadly speaking the British trade union movement is sound at heart and I am not going to attack it as some of my own colleagues do sometimes. We had difficulties, of course. I believe that the long "winter of discontent" paved the way for the downfall of the Labour
<col>842</col>
Government. It was not so much the Tory Party, although now I believe that the British people are beginning to see that they have the most reactionary Right-Wing Government that I have known since the war. That is not heaping abuse on the Government. In the last debate I was accused of being abusive. I am never abusive but I believe in arguing vigorously, as does the noble Lord. I do not think that abuse wins the day: you have to win it by argument and I believe that what one has to do is to show to the British people, in particular in a democratic community, that we have a good case without abuse.<lb/>
I will not take too long because there are now approximately 30 speakers. The noble Lord set a good precedent in his opening speech and I propose to confine my remarks to about a quarter of an hour or probably less. Above all I want regional policies to succeed and I want to debate regional policy today. I believe that we are still living under a two nation system. I believe strongly what Disraeli said in his novel <i>Sybil,</i> that we have two nations. We still have two nations. We have different emphases here and there on the regions, to which I have referred so often. There are the problems of the North-West, the problems of the North-East, the problems of industrial Wales and the problems of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01866"><member>Lord BLEASE</member><membercontribution>: And the problems of Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01867"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, and the problems of Northern Ireland, as the noble Lord, Lord Blease, has quite rightly said. When I think of regional aid I think also of Ulster. So I argue that here we are still having virtually a two nation system and a most important policy which I feel is wanted is a good regional policy to revitalise these areas by attracting industry. This is something about which we are very proud. Over the years the Labour Government have given much more regional aid than successive Tory Governments and I have a whole list of figures here to prove it. I was glad to know what was said at the CBI the other day. I do not know whether noble Lords have read the speech of Sir Alastair Pilkington: I am sure he is not a supporter of the Labour Party, but he emphasised the importance of regional aid. It was not
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0430"/>
<col>843</col>
only what he said at that conference but I believe it was addressed to a wider audience.<lb/>
I hope that there will be no slackening in this and I trust that whoever is winding up this debate tonight&#x2014;I believe it is the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie&#x2014;will return to this subject because I believe that aid has been cut. I know that the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, defended this well and he was kind enough to send me particulars and details, but I believe that regional aid has been affected and I get the feeling that the Tories in power arc not as enthusiastic as we were at that period. It is part of our national strategy to recreate wealth in these areas. After all the men and women of my old constituency, in the steelworks, the men and women of Durham and the miners and others in different parts of the region and the shipbuilders in Scotland, are the people who produce the wealth and they are the people who have to be helped. I hope noble Lords will read carefully what Sir Alastair Pilkington said at the CBI Conference.<lb/>
Added to that, we not only have to see that we have proper distribution; we have to see also that we apply the right technology. I read today&#x2014;or was it yesterday?&#x2014;in the <i>Financial Times, t</i>hat the micro-electronic industry support programme which began with a &#x00A3;70 million budget has had its allocation cut by at least &#x00A3;15 million and possibly as much as &#x00A3;25 million. Goodness gracious! this country should be in the forefront of micro-technology. That is what the Labour Government did; that is what the National Enterprise Board did. That is what was announced by a Labour Minister in another place. Now we hear that there is to be an attack on this. I hope that the noble Earl will be able to reply on this matter.<lb/>
I was very proud to serve as chairman of ACARD&#x2014;the Advisory Council on Research and Development&#x2014;which produced a very fine report for people to read carefully, as to what the problem was re the development of the chip processes. I asked the noble Lord, Lord Soames, in a debate what was to be the future of ACARD. I asked that because of the cutting down in many Civil Service departments of superfluous activity. I
<col>844</col>
hope he can now tell me that he is not cutting down ACARD, and I hope he can probably tell me at some later stage in the debate&#x2014;I do not want him necessarily to get up now&#x2014;whether ACARD is still there or whether it has been thrown into the dustbin. I think that is important.<lb/>
So I argue again about the regions: Why cut down on the roads?&#x2014;as mentioned in the White Paper. We need good infrastructure, we need technology; roads are essential. I cannot understand the mentality of Tory politicians who produce such a document detailing the cuts that we see before us. The expenditure cuts are going to harm the regions. Not only that, but I believe, turning quickly to the social services, that they are going to harm the Health Service. My noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell, I thought, delivered one of the finest speeches that I have heard in this House for a long time on this very matter. He indicated how we want to care for the family and he indicated what were the dangers facing us.<lb/>
I have here a lot of figures. I shall not weary the House by reciting all the figures, but let me take the social services. Here are some examples of the steps which some local authorities have been forced to consider: one borough reducing home-help, cutting the service by 5 per cent.; another metropolitan district in London imposing a minimum charge of &#x00A3;1 per week for the home-help service, which was previously free; another authority postponing the opening of a newly-built home for mentally handicapped children; another authority closing homes for the elderly, for children, and for people recovering from mental illness, and a day centre for the physically handicapped; delaying starting a new intermediate treatment scheme for juvenile offenders; another one imposing a reduction of &#x00A3;900,000 on the social services budget of &#x00A3;11.7 million, a cut of 7.7 per cent.; another authority forced to delay appointment of specialist social workers to promote foster care of children. These are figures provided in the Social Services Parliamentary Review. What a tragedy that some of these services should be cut or postponed in this way. So I say to noble Lords opposite, I still have a feeling that they never really believed in a comprehensive National Health Service. I have heard whispers of the possibility of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0431"/>
<col>845</col>
the Health Service itself facing cuts in a big way. I hope that we can have a reply on this. I am proud of the National Health Service. I think it was one of the great achievements of the Labour Government and a great achievement of Aneurin Bevan, and his then Parliamentary Private Secretary is sitting here now. The Labour movement will always recognise that the Health Service must be comprehensive and must play a major part in our country's life and activity. Indeed, people in many other countries, even people in the United States, admire so much what we have created. And yet now, because of difficulties, we are to have cuts and we are to have blows at the Service itself. I hope the Government will think again.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, what about education? Why attack there? The noble Lord mentioned the schools in London. I am very proud of some of the schools in London. I am very proud of the comprehensive school to which I sent my own boy, even though he passed the 11-plus exam when it was in existence. I am very proud that my family are connected with that school. I think the noble Lord will regret what he said. I do not think he should criticise schools unless he can really show in a broad general sense what he means.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01868"><member>Lord THORNEYCROFT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord may have slightly misunderstood me. I was not attacking the schools in London. I was saying that the Inner London Education Authority seemed to have a rather curious choice of schools.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01869"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: Actually, my Lords, ILEA has a fine record. I know the Tory Party in London are trying to destroy it and trying to bring in something different which will not work. I believe ILEA should be defended. Every local authority in London, even Conservative, accepts this. I think he should have been better briefed on this. I do not know who has advised him, probably Mrs. Thatcher's office. I think he has got it wrong. But there again we are still living in a strange society where we separate our children at an early age. I thought we were moving away from this. I speak as a former school-teacher who taught in a grammar school. I thought we were moving away from the tripartite system; we debated
<col>846</col>
that on a previous occasion when the Bill was mentioned. I think noble Lords should really look further afield. We have got to create a democratic system in the best sense, where boys and girls of all abilities are able to mix within a unit. That is why Eton and Harrow are very good comprehensive schools, as I once said before. There is no problem of a dull child at Eton or Harrow; they get the right education; they also develop the high flyer. That is what a comprehensive school is and that is what I want for our children. I do not want the tripartite system. I want a system where a child can be given within that school unit the type of education suited to his capabilities. So I regret this attack on comprehensive schools and I regret the subsidisation of the direct grant schools. This is what we are opposing.<lb/>
I have been told my time is up. So I conclude by saying that this debate is a very important debate. We believe that we shall fight you continually on education, on the cutting down of health services, and we will have no holds barred, in the best sense; we will be vigorous parliamentarians looking critically at the legislation which will flow from the Government, and indeed at the policies. As I said at the beginning, I think this Government are one of the most reactionary Governments I have ever known, and that is now accepted even by parts of the British Press. I do not know whether noble Lords read the <i>Observer</i> this weekend. I hope the noble Lord will read the editorial there. So it is for these reasons that we reject the viewpoint being adopted by the noble Lord who moved the Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01870">4.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01871"><member>Lord MACKIE of BENSHIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not enter into competition in deciding which of the noble Lords, Lord Peart or Lord Thorneycroft, is further to the Right. I am perfectly certain that they are both fairly conservative (with a small "c"), perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Peart, even more so. I think this debate is very apt. I think it is perfectly true to say that the Government are not only doing a balancing act on Rhodesia but that they are in an extremely difficult position, and they are tackling the problems in a fresh way. It is also true to say that the Labour Government in the period after
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0432"/>
<col>847</col>
the Lib/Lab pact did not really proceed to tackle anything, and we do need fresh thinking on the state of the nation. We wish the Government well in their efforts, which will not stop us criticising the detail as much as we think necessary.<lb/>
Certainly it is true that a trade union cure for the evils of our economy is not possible. The last Government indeed tried to legislate in the way the trade unions wanted; in fact they went far too far in giving way to their demands, in the view of many people, in their own party as well as in others, and it simply did not work. You really cannot really cure a burst appendix by kissing it better. That we have got to take drastic action there is no doubt. Consider the oft-repeated figure, which cannot be repeated too often in my opinion, that making the same motor car by the same firm on the Continent and in Britain takes twice as long in Britain. It is a figure which cannot be ignored, and it is a result without any doubt of the attitude into which the whole country, particularly trade unionists through the trade union movement, has slipped.<lb/>
Of course, I shall not attack trade unionists. This country is full of good men and good firms who can compete with anyone and who are doing so. But it is a fact that large sections of our economy are performing so badly that they are making our country a laughing stock in the world. Unions are not wicked, but such is the climate that is being created throughout this country that foolish, arrogant, wicked men can take advantage of trade union procedures and set up phoney picket lines which can do enormous harm. Because many people suddenly have the idea that anything a trade union does in a picket line is a form of holy writ, we are doing untold damage to our economy. Moreover, our attitude is keeping the working man of this country poor whereas his counterparts on the Continent and elsewhere, such as Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, are becoming richer and richer. We cannot dodge the issue.<lb/>
I have just been on a visit to Hong Kong and China. It was most interesting. While in Hong Kong we were taken to see the new metro which has the horrible name, "Mass Transit System". However, it has opened three months ahead of schedule; the cost is below budget;
<col>848</col>
and the take is above the estimated budget. By comparison let us consider, for example, Glasgow. Her Majesty opened a line there which the public will not be able to use for another few months because of disputes. The line extension to Heathrow was over a year overdue and the cost was astronomical. The same is true of the Victoria Line. When we compare that with Hong Kong we realise that there is something wrong with our system. We should also consider that at the end of the war Hong Kong had a population of 600,000. Its population has multiplied&#x2014;be it five, six or seven times&#x2014;and is now about 5 million, and they rehoused over 3&#x00BD; million people. That is a fantastic achievement and something which we in this country should be considering and trying to emulate instead of our present panacea, which is the only word that can be used.<lb/>
We then crossed the border to China. China is changing. The Chinese have been held back enormously by the Cultural Revolution and by the foolish ideas spread by an aging leader and the Gang of Four. We were told appalling things about that period and about factories where the Red Guards preached against production. They said that the people should not think I too much of production because that is a capitalist attitude. We were told about the teaching schools and hospitals where they had to accept students who were politically proper but who, in terms of their ability to take the course, were way below par. We went to see a music conservatoire which had been shut for seven years during the Cultural Revolution. We went to see a cotton printing factory where they had overcome the troubles by using the old-boy network.<lb/>
The point that I am making is that China has revolted against the system. The turn round is complete and I have no doubt that members of the Labour Party will be most interested in the statement that I am about to read from the <i>Official News Bulletin</i> No. 11222 of Saturday, 6th October, 1979. This extract gives the National Congress instructions on agricultural policy. The relevant paragraph says:
<quote>" Economic organisations, at various levels of the people's communes must conscientiously implement the principle of, 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his worth '."</quote>
I do not think that that is quite as the original, but it goes on:
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0433"/>
<col>849</col>
<quote>" And shall give more pay for more work; no pay to anyone who does not work; and equal pay for equal work, irrespective of sex. It is imperative to work out payment in accordance with the amount and quality of work done, to establish the necessary system of reward and punishment, and firmly to overcome egalitarianism ".</quote>
That is an extraordinary statement, but it shows that the Chinese are really determined to overcome the stagnation into which they have fallen due to their system. That is what we must do here. Our Government, of whom I do not wholly approve, have the job of changing attitudes. They must change attitudes in this country. We must stop fighting over the kill and arrange to kill more. Perhaps I have used an unfortunate metaphor and I should say that we should stop fighting over the cake and arrange to bake more.<lb/>
However, we clearly must show that we require production and that we can distribute. This is a wonderful country in which to live. We get on extraordinarily well with each other&#x2014;at least we do in Scotland; I do not know about England&#x2014;but what we lack is simply the means to keep up our present standard. Of course we must make cuts, and of course they will hurt. Every cut will be fiercely opposed, I dare say, and I hope that the Government will listen to reason and will deploy reasonable arguments; but when they are beaten in argument I hope that they will accept it. It occurs to me that quite a case was made as regards overseas students. I hope that the Government will look carefully at regional aid. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Peart, said about that.<lb/>
I hope, too, that the Government will, look at the way in which savings are deployed in this country at present. The day is long past when money fructified in the pockets of the people. I have never quite understood the meaning of "fructified", but it is a fine word and I understand that it means "multiplied". As a result of a long series of legislative acts concerning tax concessions for insurance, high personal taxation, and so on, money does not fructify in the pockets of the people&#x2014;it goes into the pockets of the insurance companies. The institutions supply the capital for many of the changes and advances in this country. It does not always go the right way. It might be true to say that many of the property
<col>850</col>
booms which did us no good in this country, really took place because the money was available in large quantities and it was a sure thing and better than manufacturing. That is the kind of attitude that must be changed. It is only by the success of the manufacturing industry that we can create wealth.<lb/>
The Scottish Development Association (SDA)&#x2014;I do not know about the NEB&#x2014;has done a great deal of good. I must here declare an interest. It built a factory for my company in Perth and let it to us. We could not have expanded in that area without the availability of that capital in the form of a factory to let. I can give many examples in Scotland where the SDA has done a great deal of good. The Conservatives should not be frightened of it. If they back new ventures and they are successful, they can always sell the shares back at a profit&#x2014;if they take shares. There is no reason why they should not do so as long as it is not a method of backdoor nationalisation. I ask them to look very carefully at this matter and to look at the good that has been done. We must have a system in this country which is fair and which is seen to be fair. We must encourage the strong and protect the weak. But in the protection of the weak, again we must watch legislation.<lb/>
We have had a very unfortunate example of the working of the Redundancy Payments Act in the north-east of Scotland this year. In theory that Act is a fine thing, but in fact the factory of Lawsons which is a bacon factory, had to close down. Unilever wanted to close it; these big firms are not always as efficient as they think they are. A local cooperative and others wanted to take it over. The whole thing fell down because the workforce voted against the terms because, I am told, they could not bear the thought of passing up the lump sums which were due to them under the redundancy agreement. They would rather take a chance on getting another job than preserve this first-class and necessary adjunct to the bacon industry of the north of Scotland.<lb/>
The Protection of Employment Act is a fine piece of legislation, but in my company the managing director and another busy director had to spend three days over a fatheaded appeal against dismissal, and in the end the dismissal
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0434"/>
<col>851</col>
was upheld. Three days of valuable production time was lost by these able people. If we are to change the attitude, it must be seen that to raise production will benefit everyone. I was glad that the CBI recently had a great deal to say about getting really close to our own workpeople. Of course the directors of a firm have far more in common and far more benefits to share with their workforce than they have with the trade union organisations, which seem totally unable to control their branches which have got out of control. The directors, shareholders and the workpeople have a common cause which should be clearly seen by everyone.<lb/>
A great process of education must take place and the extension of the profit-sharing provisions introduced under the Lib-Lab agreement needs to be examined by the Government. Already well over 200 firms have taken the opportunity afforded by this very small Bill. Profit-sharing schemes play a large part, but genuine productivity deals, which reward weekly and monthly, are probably more effective. They must be genuine. Where such schemes exist, they must be explained with great clarity to those concerned.<lb/>
If we are to survive, we must see the prospect of one Britain&#x2014;not two Britains or several Britains&#x2014;where the people work together. We do not want dull uniformity; we want a chance for all. We want taxes to be fair, to be low and to allow enterprise a chance. However, some taxes need to be adjusted in order to be seen to be fair. I do not see why capital gains tax, which should be indexed, should not be as high as the tax on income. Tax on labour and the sweat of the brow or the brain should not be higher than capital gains tax after indexation. The capital transfer taxes are good taxes, as long as income tax is low; because nothing does more good to the son of a rich man than for him to pay off a hefty capital transfer charge when he starts, instead of starting where his father left off. If we had more of this and the chance to do it, perhaps the sons of rich men might work a little harder instead of playing as much as some of them appear to do.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01873"><member>Lord MACKIE of BENSHIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was very careful to mention indexation. To make &#x00A3;1 million is good for the nation, but to be a millionaire is not necessarily so good for the nation. We do not want the sort of candy-floss millionaires who sprang up in the City during the periods of both the last Governments and who got this country a very bad name. I see that one of them has returned to this country. even though he crashed his enterprise, and owes a bank &#x00A3;17 million. According to Lady Olga Maitland in the <i>Sunday Express</i> he is back in a &#x00A3;1 million house in Chelsea and has returned because Mrs. Thatcher and the Conservative Government are in power. I hope and trust that the Conservative Government are not as welcoming to him as he is to them. But this is a symptom and the sort of thing we must get over&#x2014;we are living in a world that may be tough, but it is a world that should be fair. I do not think that this will come about by popular acclaim. I think that foolish and selfish men, power-drunk and hungry, will oppose sensible measures.<lb/>
In the winter ahead the Government will face great difficulties. The people of Britain may have to empty their own dustbins and put up with great hardships, but it must be shown that striking does not always pay. We must ensure that the built-in procedures to stop this sort of thing arc used. The Government must represent the vast majority of the people in order to do that and to stand the strain. I am not sure that this can be done entirely on a party basis. The Government will need allies and the confidence of the nation. I hope that they have the wisdom and the character to gain that confidence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01875"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, once again we are deeply grateful to my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft for having initiated this debate. I am sure that there are few in your Lordships' House who have had more experience over the years than my noble friend in the matters that he has discussed, both in Government&#x2014;and I remember the happy days when he and I sat next to each other in Cabinet and used to pass each other rude messages from time to time&#x2014;and later in industry. My
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0435"/>
<col>853</col>
noble friend has a wide international as well as a national experience. We are grateful to him for originating this debate and for the excellent speech that he made.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, made a very balanced speech, giving credit where credit was due. On the whole, I think we received more credit than attack. The noble Lord put us on notice that he would attack where he thought we were wrong, but I was fairly happy that the general thrust of his speech was that the Government were more or less on the right lines. I certainly agree with much of what he said and with his analysis of the problem. The noble Lord, Lord Peart, pinpointed two or three specific areas&#x2014;the regions, the National Health Service, and education. He called ours the most reactionary Government Britain has ever had. I think that we are the most radical Government that this country has had since the war&#x2014;I think that is a better description.<lb/>
However, as I see it, my job this afternoon is to sketch out the picture&#x2014;rather as my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft did&#x2014;and to outline the context of policies within which the Government expect to be judged. On this occasion I do not want so much to go into the details of the policies themselves. We expect to be criticised. All Governments do, and they always will be and must be. But, I believe that criticism is sterile and unproductive unless there is some general agreement, some common ground, if you like, about objectives and about where we are trying to get. I believe that there is more common ground in the country than there has been for quite a long while. In that situation the criticisms have a context. They serve to identify and to highlight difficulties, and to help to overcome them.<lb/>
Until just six months ago we on this side of the House were in Opposition for five years. We respect the role of Opposition and will be scrupulous in the way we deal with it. But we do not respect the kind of Opposition which professes that the world in which we have to earn our living is other than what it is. We are happy to argue, for instance, about the priorities we have determined in last week's White Paper on our expenditure plans. But it is a waste of our time and everyone else's time to argue with
<col>854</col>
people who believe that wealth is a kind of Christmas tree which a Government only has to shake and then pick up all the presents and hand them out to the most deserving; or who do not make any connections between Government borrowing and spending, or taxation and spending or who believe that if Governments only stimulate enough demand there will be jobs and social services for all; or who choose to deny or ignore the paramount need for our industries to be competitive in world terms; or who believe that you can pay for a Welfare State just by taxing earned income at 80 per cent. or more.<lb/>
The Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;Mr. Callaghan, not the noble Lord opposite&#x2014;lent his authority to that view only last week. So we must try and stake out a common ground about the really fearsome decline of this country's industrial capacity and just what that means for the Government's&#x2014;for any Government's&#x2014;tax and borrowing base; for their ability to provide services; for jobs; for the maintenance of a civilised, open and plural society, where people can steer a decent course between individual freedom and collective responsibilities&#x2014;which is what I understand to be the fundamental of a mixed economy.<lb/>
I am going to try and stake out the common ground, and the context in which I hope our policies will be judged. It is against this background that my noble friend Lord Gowrie, when he comes to wind up, will deal with the particular arguments and representations which your Lordships choose to make. Britain has two great problems, two central difficulties affecting everything we want her to be. There is the particular problem of the decline of our manufacturing capacity and competitiveness through low productivity. There is the general problem, affecting others as well as ourselves, of world recession fuelled by the steep rise in energy costs. In other words, we are operating in a malign international economic atmosphere.<lb/>
Following the first round of oil price increases most of the industrialised democracies, including ourselves, reacted by overspending&#x2014;or, if you prefer, reflating demand&#x2014;while they tried to pretend to their electorates that the problem would go away. There has been
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0436"/>
<col>855</col>
the inevitable counter-reaction; a hard stamp on the brakes of money and credit; deflation. That is what we are seeing in the United States of America and elsewhere at the moment, and very unpleasant it will be for all of us. So it is against the background of a world recession that we have to tackle the chief difficulty: low output and our competitive decline, and that does not make it any easier.<lb/>
If your Lordships are looking for the origins of cuts, or the source of threats to the Welfare State in the future, do not, I beg of you, look at these Benches. Look around and about you. Look at the goods that people buy with the money and credit available to them. Look at the names of the cars, of the television sets, of the household appliances that people buy, and consider where they come from. Look at the industrial items, the machine tools, the agricultural equipment, so much of the advanced electronic and automation marvels, and consider what they cost and where they come from. There is the source, there is the reason why no responsible Government can envisage at the present time the sort of expansion of public services which we would all like to see.<lb/>
It is largely of course a supply problem; a failure on the part of our industry to compete adequately here at home, let alone in world markets. In the 1950s we were accustomed to living with a ratio of exports to imports of manufactured goods of the order of 3 to 1&#x2013;3 of exports to 1 of imports. That ratio, coupled with the benefits that we derived from our invisible exports, enabled us to purchase the food and the raw materials that we needed. Now what is the ratio? It is just over 1 to 1. Perhaps 1&#x00B7;1 of exports to 1 of imports, and no higher than that, and that picture tells a sorry story.<lb/>
Some people argue that we could fight the threat to our welfare system and our mixed economy imposed by our manufacturing decline by greater protection of our native industries, hoping thus to nurse them back to health. I am not talking here of the loony Left and their ideas, but of certain economic commentators like Mr. Wynne Godley and our own&#x2014;I refer in the sense of this House's own not the Government's&#x2014;Lord Kaldor. We
<col>856</col>
are of course ready to review any particular problem cases where our industry may be unfairly hit. But in general it remains true that, even if it were possible to disregard our Treaty of Rome obligations, it would not be in our national interest to turn protectionist for we are ourselves an importing value-adding, exporting country.<lb/>
We do very well, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, said, in many areas, and I include of course out highly successful invisibles: the City's overseas earnings were indeed at a record level last year. Foreigners may not buy many of our motor-cars but they still buy our banking, insurance, and other services. We would be very vulnerable to retaliation. The wealth and tax base on which our public services depend would shrink even further. I am absolutely convinced that our supply-side and output problems would not be solved by sheltering existing industries; and I am equally convinced, for it is obvious, that the industries of the future will require larger markets than our domestic one for their development. Nor do I believe that an international beggar-my-neighbour policy is a sensible, or humane, or internationally acceptable approach to a recession.<lb/>
So we are left with the job of putting our own house in order and continuing to use the European and wider councils of the world to communicate what we are trying to do and relate it to the needs and policies of others. However difficult it is to get our own sums right, that remains the only way to give ourselves the credibility and viability to co-operate with any real effectiveness with the other industrialised democracies, and to find our way through the recession, and by so doing to lighten the even heavier load on the poorer countries of the earth.<lb/>
The front line in our strategy has to be industry and enterprise itself&#x2014;the wealth creators. We are determined to strengthen incentives. We have already reduced the standard rate of direct tax to 30 pence in the pound. We would like to be able to do more, and I am sure we will when we can. We have already reduced the top rates of tax on earned income to 60 pence in the pound. It may affect relatively few people, but we believe that among them are people crucial to the welfare of our economy. We also believe that it is important psychologically, and if it affects
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0437"/>
<col>857</col>
relatively few people it is also comparatively cheap to do. The money lost is trifling, and has no relation to old people's homes, as Mr. Callaghan seemed to suggest&#x2014;in direct contradiction, incidentally, to his own repeated and courageous insistence to the Labour Party of the counter-productive effects of high marginal rates, and the necessity for public spending to take a falling share of the nation's output.<lb/>
Incentives are essential for revitalising the supply side of our economy, where everything starts. It is the supply side that has gone wrong, yet it is on the success of the supply side that the country in general depends, and so does the success of the Government's policies. We depend on it to get the wealth base, to get the tax base, to meet our responsibilities; the social services, the money we give to local authorities to supplement their tax base and pay for education and for their social services, the money we need for law and order and for our defence.<lb/>
We cannot repeat this message too often. Governments of both parties have so far failed to get the message across that what we are able to offer in the way of services to the people depends essentially on the wealth that they themselves create, and that excessive pay rises claimed by people unrelated to production and wealth-creation must mean the erosion of among other things, public services.<lb/>
The other side of the wage coin is, of course, employment. Wages rising faster than productivity inevitably result, sooner or later, in higher prices to customers, falling profits, less reinvestment, a less competitive position at home and abroad, greater vulnerability to import penetration; job after job is lost, people thrown on the mercy of what shrinking services a shrinking tax base could provide.<lb/>
But if the front line has to be industry and enterprise, the Government's job is to provide a background in which the essential conditions for the creation of wealth are met. The most important condition for the creation of wealth is stable prices. So long as inflation is seen as an endemic problem in our islands there is not the confidence to put up money for investment prospects. People tend to prefer property or goods. It is to help to master inflation that the Govern
<col>858</col>
ment turn their face against printing money to underwrite inflationary pay settlements and against excessive borrowing.<lb/>
Here of course is the direct connection with the public expenditure issue. We have to bring down the rate of inflation through control of the money supply and the consequent control ofGovernment borrowing. Even if a prices and incomes policy were on offer to this Government&#x2014;and it is not on offer to us any more than it was to the last Government, as I argued in the debate on the gracious Speech&#x2014;we would still have to control the money supply and control our own borrowing. We cannot expect private industry to submit to disciplines which we are not ourselves prepared to submit to. And "we" in this context have an enormous effect. We occupy not so much, I think, the commanding heights but the vast deeps of the economy, nearly half of the total&#x2014;so we have to insist on the connection between pay and productivity in our own area. Industry would have every right to complain if we demanded that it should face the realities of pay bargaining alone while the Government were prepared to foot the bill for excessive increases in the public sector, or do so without making rapid compensations in the volume of services provided. The reality of public sector pay bargaining is that unjustified increases have to be paid for by fewer public sector jobs or reduced public services, or a combination of the two.<lb/>
The strategy of last week's White Paper is to hold public spending at its present level, in volume terms, for the time being. The projected out-turn for the current year, 1979&#x2013;80, and next year, 1980&#x2013;81, is very close to the estimated out-turn of last year, 1978&#x2013;79. And indeed, if we look back over the previous four years at the record of public spending, it rose fast. But what was the item that made it rise fast? It was the increased servicing of an increased debt. That was where there was the greatest rise by far&#x2014;in the servicing of the debt in the four previous years. When translating volume into cash limits, we have made allowances for inflation. We have also allowed for an increase on present levels of unemployment, uncertain though forecasting in this area always is, particularly in view of the high number of vacancies that are on record at present.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0438"/>
<col>859</col>
In the whole social security area, therefore, planned expenditure for 1980&#x2013;81 shows an increase in effect, and not a cut. I am not just thinking of the fact that there are likely to be additional people eligible. As I said earlier, we have allowed for an increase in unemployment. I am thinking, too, of this month's record uprating of pensions and other benefits, as well as the increase in child benefit premium for single parent families and the recently announced provision for assistance with fuel costs.<lb/>
It is, I believe, a travesty to represent our efforts to contain the growth in public spending as a programme of "savage cuts" or an attack on our great public services. Let us be clear. The threat to the future development of our social services comes from the erosion of our wealth and tax base, or from pay claims that outstrip what the tax base is able to provide. It is utterly bogus for previous Ministers to claim otherwise&#x2014;and here I exempt the noble Lord, Lord Peart, from this; he did not do so today. But others have described our reduction of Labour's planned expenditure, which was based on optimistic assumptions, both about high growth and low pay claims over the next two years, as an assault on the Welfare State, as if it were a machine for putting people out of work.<lb/>
But I suggest that noble Lords opposite know every bit as well as we do that, had they been re-elected, the 2 to 3 per cent. growth that would be needed to finance the expansion which we have ended would not, in the real world, have materialised. Their own average rate in Government was, say, 1 per cent. during the four years. Nor would they have been able to tolerate politically, any more than the nation would have tolerated actually, the higher taxes, which would have resulted. The difference between their spending plans and ours is equal to the yield of an 8p increase in basic rate income tax. As I said at the beginning, we expect criticism, we expect opposition from able former Ministers and parliamentary colleagues. But we are entitled to require them to cost their criticisms every penny of the way.<lb/>
My noble friend's Motion mentions the difficulties. I have not tried to shirk them and I have urged the Opposition not to do so either. But the Motion
<col>860</col>
also mentions the opportunities. It may surprise your Lordships that I really believe that the opportunities outweigh the difficulties. And I am not just whistling in the dark or looking for a kindly light amid the encircling gloom. Thanks to the flow of North Sea oil, we are the first Government since the war who, in the seemingly endless quest for greater growth, greater output, and productivity in the British economy, are not liable to wake up one morning and find themselves unable to pay the import bills for food and raw materials, which was one of the nightmares my noble friend had when he was at the Treasury. There are disadvantages to operating a petro-currency, but here is a clear advantage.<lb/>
The Government also have a secure parliamentary majority to tide us over what will undoubtedly be difficult times and hard decisions, decisions which the mass of the people are in their hearts expecting us to take. We have a formidable will to succeed, greater again perhaps than at any time since the war because the difficulties are greater. We are the first Government since the war to take seriously the message to put our own house in order first and tackle inflationary spending in our own hack yard. We cannot be called divisive. The policies we are pursuing enjoy continuity with those pursued by the last Government during the period of their greatest success: monetary discipline; cash limits; public spending restraint. It did not last very long.<lb/>
But within this framework of order we have placed a clutch of necessary freedoms. We have ended the rigidities governing pay and price structures and investment decisions; judiciously, I hope, relaxed planning controls and licensing requirements; introduced legislation to increase competition; and as a measure looking far into the future, we have removed exchange controls so that we may look again to benefits to our balance of payments from investment abroad.<lb/>
This is all the positive side of our difficult task and the way we seek to stimulate activity and enable opportunities to be taken. But, my Lords, freedom is precious. It must be cherished, and not abused. We must as a country be willing to accept the disciplines necessary to preserve it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0439"/>
<col>861</col>
Among other things this means restoring our competitive position; it means coming to accept that increases in income have to be linked to production rather than to inflation levels. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, said&#x2014;and I so much agree with him&#x2014;it is going to require a sea-change of attitudes in regard, among other things, to our working habits; and are we not already seeing hopeful signs in this regard?<lb/>
My Lords, in spite of all our difficulties, we in this country are immensely fortunate. We have little excuse if we continue on downhill. We should have everything going for us. We have the inherent social stability still guaranteed by our constitutional arrangements and by our great institutions: Parliament; the Judiciary; the unions, our manufacturing and financial enterprises; our cultural and educational institutions. In a hungry world we have the most advanced and efficient agriculture of any industrial country except America. In a world starved of energy we sit on a mountain of coal, surrounded by a sea of oil. We should "have it made", as the Americans say. Or to put that less selfishly, we should be able to use those opportunities, that capacity, to play a more impressive and more spiritually rewarding role in the history of these last years of our brilliant, yet horrifying century. The Government have made a start in setting the scene for our country's very survival&#x2014;for that is what it is about&#x2014;and we mean to continue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01876">5.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01877"><member>Lord STEWART of FULHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask indulgence for someone who addresses this honourable House for the first time. The subject that we are discussing does not readily lend itself to a non-controversial speech, and I fear that my own temperament is not much help to me in that direction, either. But I will begin by saying that I do indeed agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, that the nation now faces, on a remarkable scale, both opportunities and dangers, though I hope without offence to venture to suggest a little later that I think that with regard to some of them the Government's approach is not quite right. I agree also with what has been said on both sides of the House about the importance
<col>862</col>
of productivity. Indeed, in my judgment this, rather than the rate of public expenditure, as the White Paper says, is at the heart of the matter, both long-term and short-term. If we can so arrange matters that an hour's work or a week's work will produce more wealth, then sooner or later we shall get all our other economic problems right. If we do not do that, we shall not get anything right&#x2014;neither private incomes nor public services, nor defence, nor aid to other countries, and so on.<lb/>
But it is not a simple process. Why do we not have higher productivity? It is not because we are not inventive. The noble Lord who opened the debate rightly said that we are an inventive nation. But we have this dread that every new invention can only mean unemployment for somebody. This was a point well made in a newspaper article not long ago by my noble friend Lady Wootton of Abinger. But this really is not so. If we can discover how to produce with less labour what we are now producing, there will he many options open to us. We could actually produce more of what we are producing; or if we are capable of moving labour from one industry to another&#x2014;and that we shall have to do on a considerable scale&#x2014;we can produce different kinds of things. We shall be in a stronger position to produce many things that we now have to buy from foreigners, or to produce things which foreigners will he willing to buy from us.<lb/>
But of course all this depends on the labour force&#x2014;men and women&#x2014;being mobile, more mobile than it is today. That involves not only necessary arrangements for retraining, learning new skills, but also a willingness among the whole population to accept the idea of learning new skills. It involves accepting that in the future, unless we are going to be driven down into a stagnation of unemployment because we are inventive&#x2014;which would be very silly indeed&#x2014;there has to be a general acceptance that it is going to be normal for a man or woman in the course of working life to learn a new skill perhaps not once but twice, to have several different careers. If we do not get that right, I believe that in the end we shall not get anything right.<lb/>
If one is to do that&#x2014;this is what I really want to address myself to and invite the House to consider&#x2014;what sort of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0440"/>
<col>863</col>
things are necessary'? It is not in dispute that the good will of the trade union movement will be necessary. It is quite natural, indeed up to a point it is a duty, for any trade union leader in the face of a new invention, to ask himself, "What's the effect going to be on my members' jobs?" What I am saying is that he must also ask himself the question, "What's going to be the effect on the standard of life of all of us if we don't introduce new inventions?" But you have got to get this good will and the good will of the men he represents.<lb/>
I wonder therefore whether the Government's approach to the trade union movement is really on the right lines. Instead of approaching it with critical and repressive legislation, ought there not to have been a bold invitation to consider the problems posed to the country by new invention, by the need for productivity, the need for greater mobility of labour? I was happy to see that there was one speech&#x2014;I do not think that there was more than one&#x2014;on these lines at the conference of the Confederation of British Industry. The noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, considered whether the Government were going too far or not far enough on trade union legislation. What worries me is that they may not be going in the right direction, or starting from the right premises.<lb/>
There is something else that will be needed if we are to have this movement into a more mobile society. There has to be the readiness to encourage new inventions, to encourage the setting up of new firms, the creating sometimes of new industries. It seems a little surprising that in those circumstances the Government should want to curtail the activities of the National Enterprise Board. I should have thought that rather it was a case for expanding them and making them more imaginative.<lb/>
If I understand rightly the view of the party opposite, it is that if you reduce the taxation level, particularly on those people who in the main own and control industry, this will so stimulate them that the invention, the new industries, the new firms, will pour forth and the productivity problem will solve itself&#x2014;well, it will not solve itself, but it will be solved as a result of the incentive regarding lower tax. What worries me is that we tried this before,
<col>864</col>
more than once, and it has not worked, as Mr. Edward Heath once lamented to employers.<lb/>
By contrast, there was a period in our recent history where we made a great leap forward towards greater mobility. It was in the years immediately after the war, when we had to make a huge shift of man and woman power from making one kind of thing to making another, when we had to meet the challenge of regaining export markets. We did it very well. The noble Lord, Lord Soames, referred to the healthy state of our exports in the 1950s, and I am bound to say that we did it with a good deal of Government encouragement and direction, even; and we did it in an atmosphere of high, rather than low, taxation.<lb/>
Then, another thing seems to me to be needed if we are to get the nation's general acceptance of a more mobile society, and that is connected with our education system. First, it cannot be a merely elite education. We want to get the mass of the population having a sensible understanding of the kind of society they are living in; and, as far as concerns that part of education which deals with learning a job, we shall not want narrowly vocational education to teach a person to do a job now which will be out of date in ten years' time, but the development among as many people as possible of a general quickness of mind, hand and eye. All this means, surely, a generalised (and I need not be ashamed of the word), a mass approach to education. I am doubtful, therefore, whether it is right for the Government now to pursue a policy of spending more on special education for a very limited number and less on the general education of the mass. I think they ought to reconsider that matter.<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, I want to refer to something which I do not think has been referred to so far but which is in the White Paper and is certainly encompassed in the phrase "the dangers facing the nation." We have problems abroad, and there is provision in the White Paper for increased expenditure on defence. I believe that to be unavoidable if we are to fulfil our commitment to NATO. All the NATO countries are committed to increase their expenditure. The last Government accepted that; this Government must
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0441"/>
<col>865</col>
accept it. But when you decide to spend more on defence, is that not pre-eminently the time when you ought to say to the nation, "This is something where everybody makes sacrifices, and, if anything, those who are best off will have to make most sacrifices?" That is a fair proposition when what you are proposing is an increase in the national defences.<lb/>
Is it right, therefore, for the Government to arrange the impact of income tax and VAT, and various charges which are going to be imposed on people, in a way which is actually going to make some of the richest people in the country better off and some of the poorer people in the country worse off? I should have thought that that was the wrong way round. When one was obliged to make the demand for greater expenditure on defence, it was to the richer people that traditionally one used to look for an example. Now, apparently, contemporaneously with higher expenditure on defence, those who are really well off are going to have their tax burden lowered, and it is mainly working people who have got to pay more. It is they who are being asked specifically to set the example. It looks to me as if the Government take the same view as Oscar Wilde's character, Lady Bracknell, who said:
<quote>" Really, if the working classes cannot set us a good example, I fail to see what is the use of them".</quote>
I must not weary your Lordships' House further. I repeat that I am in agreement with the noble Lord who opened the debate that we face dangers and opportunities, and I am in agreement, I think, with many who feel the desperate importance of this question of productivity and mobility of labour. I merely suggest that there arc some topics&#x2014;such as their attitude to the National Enterprise Board, to the trade unions, to education and to the burden of taxation&#x2014;on which the Government may not have got their emphasis quite right.</membercontribution></p>

<col>866</col>
might suggest, it will probably not be possible for me to be present at the end of the debate; and I would apologise in particular to the noble Lords on the two Front Benches who will be winding up.<lb/>
Having said that, my Lords, I have a very special pleasure, as he will know, in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, on his most impressive maiden speech. My Lords, I can claim that, with the possible exception of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, I have been listening to, had my mind improved by and ventured to argue with the noble Lord for, I think, longer than anybody else in this House. When I first listened to that same clear, logical, incisive speech at the Oxford Union 50 years ago&#x2014;and it has not changed a jot, my Lords, over the years&#x2014;I had only one thought, and that is that it seemed to me so extraordinary that a man who spoke such good sense so well could possibly be a member of the Labour Party. Fifty years later, in a wildly changed world, that wonderment, having listened to his admirable speech this afternoon, is even stronger. But I think the whole House acknowledges that the noble Lord is a great reinforcement to our strength. No one, I think, is going to agree with many of the things I am about to say, but I think everyone will agree with me when I express the view that I hope he will illumine our minds and entertain us with similar speeches with great and increasing frequency. It was a joy to listen to him.<lb/>
No one, of course, could have initiated this debate more appropriately than my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft, because nobody (with the exception, of course, of the Prime Minister herself) has a greater degree of responsibility for the fact that we are now sitting on this side of the House. Noble Lords opposite will have noticed with rueful admiration my noble friend's skill, courage and endurance as chairman of the Conservative Party organisation, and the great part that he played in securing the (to us, though not, of course, to them) highly satisfactory outcome of last May's election. I know the House will agree with me when I say that he introduced this debate with a most admirable speech, which gave great pleasure and set the scene for subsequent speeches with extraordinary clarity. None of us, of course, within the reasonable
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0442"/>
<col>867</col>
length of their own speech, can cover anything like all the grounds that are open on one of the widest-drafted Motions I think I have ever seen in this House; but I should like very much to welcome the start which the Government have made in the conduct of our affairs.<lb/>
History is apt to repeat itself, and the bonfire of controls (to quote the father-in-law of the noble Lord the Leader of the House) which was set alight in 1951 has been repeated with similar arsonist activity by my noble friends and right honourable gentlemen in another place&#x2014;and I welcome it. We have got rid of dividend control; we have gigot rid, as my noble friend the Leader of the House reminded us, of exchange control; and we are getting rid of the Price Commission and of price control. To noble Lords who are perhaps a little taken aback by the courage and determination of that approach, I would say there is reassurance to be got by studying what happened when we went over something like the same course in the early 1950s. The net result was a recovery and a revivification of the economy, an increase in activity, a fall in unemployment and a rise in standards of life; and in a number of years it became possible for the Prime Minister of the day to say with accuracy that we had never had it so good.<lb/>
In this attack on excessive Government interference with the working of our economy we are not moving over uncharted ground. I think your Lordships can draw some reassurance from the fact that we have been there before, and when we were there before the medicine worked. Indeed, on that occasion we did something even more courageous, I think, than my noble friends are doing on this occasion. We abolished the food subsidies. Everybody protested that it would be disaster. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Peart, made rather the same sort of speech then as he made this afternoon. Everyone forecast disaster. But, on the contrary, we took full care that the poorest did not suffer by simultaneous increases in social services payments and, for the rest, relied on the general restoration of freedom for a general restoration of the economy&#x2014;and it worked. And not only did it work in the interests of the economy, let me reassure noble friends, it did them no
<col>868</col>
political harm. Within four years we had a general election and trebled our majority and, five years later, another, when we doubled it again. So the path of courage, as so often in our history, is not necessarily the path to unpopularity and defeat.<lb/>
My noble friends themselves will be the first to say that there is an enormous amount still to do. Their attack on the levels of personal taxation carried a great deal of support but personal taxation in this country is still very high. There are individuals with high salaries and a modest tranche of investment income who still pay, on certain parts of their income, a tax rate of no less than 75 per cent. which, I think, in most countries of the world would be regarded as confiscatory. Therefore, I would say&#x2014;although, as it was a maiden speech, I would not wish to enter into argument as I hope I may in the future with (I call him) my noble friend Lord Stewart of Fulham; it is a technical inaccuracy&#x2014;that it is relevant, when one considers how the burden of taxation should be adjusted to pay for defence, to have in mind the point we are starting from. And the point we are starting from in our system of personal taxation is a system which, even now, taxes the highest earnings at rates well above the level ruling in our competitors.<lb/>
So I hope that the Government will go on attacking the problems of taxation. They have not yet touched the scandal of capital gains tax in an inflationary age in which that tax is paid on sales which may not represent, in real terms, any gain at all. That, again is confiscatory. If capital gains tax is to remain&#x2014;and personally I think it should remain for at any rate short-term speculative gains&#x2014;a major part of our taxation system, I am sure that it is necessary to introduce either indexation or a formula which reduces it in relation to the number of years an asset has been held. Capital transfer tax has also been the ruin of many small businesses and has caused many people to leave homes that their families have occupied for generations. There is much more to be clone. In expressing to my noble friends gratitude for what they have done so far, I would express it in accordance with the traditional construction of the word "gratitude"&#x2014;a lively anticipation of favours to come.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0443"/>
<col>869</col>
The abolition of exchange control, I am sure is right. Noble Lords on the Benches opposite know that it could have been done years ago. With the growing strength of sterling based on our oil revenues, it was absurd to retain this restriction. It hampered investment abroad, which is in the national interest, and it was based on the impossible hypothesis that somebody at the Bank of England would have a better idea as to whether a particular overseas investment was viable or not than the company or individual who studied the particular project with a view to making that investment. This was a plain fallacy. Although in my own experience I have no criticism of the Bank of England, which administered this control with intelligence and tolerance, in principle to restrict investment in this way did nobody any good and must, cumulatively, have done a great deal of harm. It is a good thing that has been got rid of.<lb/>
I come inevitably to the so-called cuts. I use the word "so-called" because, although they involve some reduction in particular expenditures, in total they involve, as I understand it, the stabilisation of expenditure at the very high levels which noble Lords opposite had attained when they were in Government. Therefore, there does not seem very much justification for heat or emotion on this subject. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Callaghan, in the other place referred to the Government in this context as "vandals and hypocrites". We all have some sympathy with Mr. Callaghan over certain of his other problems and should not judge the violence of his language too harshly, but I am bound to say that the word "vandal" puzzled me. A vandal is someone who destroys or damages something which is sacred or beautiful. Nobody certainly, in this House, would think that was a very good or precise description of the British economy as the last Government left it behind. My only doubts are as to whether these so-called cuts are adequate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01880"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether I may interrupt the noble Lord since he has said he would be leaving early. I am rather puzzled as to why he refers to them as "so-called" cuts. If they are only "so-called" why are inroads being made into education, the social services and everything else? I can understand
<col>870</col>
the argument in favour of cuts, but I do not understand the addition of the word "so-called".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01881"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that I owe the noble Baroness an apology. I tried to explain a moment ago why I used that expression. If I have failed to convey this clearly, I will attempt to do so again. I spelled out the fact that they will result in reduction of certain expenditures but that, overall, they will result in (and I recall that I used the expression) "the stabilisation of expenditure" at the level which the Government which she supported carried on. To describe such an overall financial operation as "cuts" without some qualifying adjective seems to me to be misleading and likely to confuse those people&#x2014;and there may be some outside&#x2014;who are not wholly aware of exactly what it is that is being done. I hope that I have made that clear to the noble Baroness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01882"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: It is still not clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01883"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my doubt is whether the cuts go far enough and whether there ought not to be real cuts. The world economic situation is gloomy, there is a real need for reductions in the tax burden, and I wonder whether these cuts go as far as the economic situation justifies. Of course, I know the Government's problem. As I have told the House, I have been through this before. No Governments impose cuts if they can help it. It is unpleasant and an unpopular thing to do and naturally Governments seek to avoid it.<lb/>
But even, I think, the noble Lord. Lord Peart, in spite of his speech this afternoon, is not really going to pretend&#x2014;in this House at any rate&#x2014;that there are no areas of Government expenditure where there is no waste. There must be a great deal of waste which good hard housekeeping by the Government, aided by the Public Accounts Committee in another place, can help to cut back. And the Government arc energetically pursuing this.<lb/>
I should like to see them go a little further in monitoring these. Some of the subordinate bodies on whom cuts are imposed seem to me to be trying to be a little too clever. If given a reduction in expenditure as a target, there are many
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0444"/>
<col>871</col>
bodies that seem deliberately to offer the most popular and admirable of their activities as the potential sacrifice. The calculation is that there will be such an uproar that the Government will have to let them go on spending as much as they have been spending. In concrete terms, there are local authorities who promptly close some old people's homes, if told to cut expenditure by <i>x</i> per cent. They do no consider removing the director-general of recreation.<lb/>
And it is not only local authorities; it would be unfair to leave it there. I see that my noble friend the Foreign Secretary is no longer here; but even the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has, I think in one respect, not altogether resisted temptation to similar conduct. They offered, in reply to the Treasury's demand for reduction in expenditure, a very substantial cut in the BBC's Overseas Service rather than a reduction in their posts and establishments overseas. I think this was unwise, though I fully understand and I have seen that kind of thing before. But it must be a mistake to cut out some of these language services, particularly the service in the French language. As your Lordships know, the French are on the whole bad linguists&#x2014;or prefer to pretend to be&#x2014;and a translation in French could be particularly valuable at this moment when, if I may suggest it, it might help them&#x2014;using their own language&#x2014;to
<quote>" <i>Revenir &#x00E0; nos moutons</i> "!</quote>
There are other areas where the cuts could be made. I think with the abolition of exchange control foreign aid needs less. With no exchange control, viable projects in the developing countries will attract free private investment, and if they are not viable projects, it is probably better that they should not be backed at all. In that situation, of course private investment will only go where there is political stability. It is not a bad thing for the developing odd to see that countries&#x2014;for example Kenya and Malawi&#x2014;which have an admirable record of tolerance, of political stability, should gain in investments at the expense, if you like, of other countries which prefer to indulge in a more theatrical method of conducting their affairs. There are other areas where I hope that we will be told by the noble Earl who is to reply that further cuts can be made.<lb/>
<col>872</col>
I want before I finish to touch on the most sensitive area of all: the position of the trade unions. Let me say at once that I am in no sense hostile to the trade unions. I can claim that the company of which I happen to be chairman, under my chairmanship for the first time recognised and entered into negotiation with the appropriate unions, and we have the most happy relations with them. But it is an indisputable fact that trade union power has grown and is excessive in this country. It is the lesson of history that when any body of people obtain excessive power there sets in the process of modifying their position and restoring the balance. It is not just an abstract question as to where power should reside; it is a highly practical question. I have already referred once in this House to Sir Nicholas Henderson's farewell despatch from Paris which I think is the <i>locus classicus</i> of an analysis of our country's present woes.<lb/>
He is immensely revealing on this subject. He compares the position of our trade unions with those in France and Germany. He points out that in France and Germany the closed shop is contrary to the constitution, and illegal; that agreements between employers and workers are enforceable in the courts; that strikes do not take place when an agreement with the employer is still current. He says that his labour counsellor cannot recall a case in the past two years when a strike in France has been successful. He concludes with what I think is the most important part of his analysis: that the much weaker position of the unions in those countries has not resulted in their workers being overworked and victimised wage slaves; that indeed the converse is the case. I quote from the dispatch:
<quote>" The paradox of the British labour scene at the present time is that despite the contribution that our unions have made towards a better safety record in our factories, their influence and ready resort to strike pressures have not secured better general employment conditions than in France and Germany. Not only are real wages lower but hours of work are longer ".</quote>
In other words, if one compares the way the organisation of trade unions and the law governing them operates among some of our principal competitors and ourselves, one is driven to the conclusion that it is we who are out of step and not they.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pearl, said that this was the most reactionary Government
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0445"/>
<col>873</col>
of modern times. I agree with him if by "reaction" he means a reaction from failure, a reaction from discredited methods and a return to sanity and to reality. Time was overdue for such a reaction for us to get away from what the Chancellor of the Exchequer so rightly called the dream world, the world in which people think that the mere passage of time without any increase in productivity entitles one to increased remuneration&#x2014;a world in which the mining union can put forward an enormous wage claim at the very moment that it has been demonstrated that the price of British coal is so uncompetitive that the British Steel Corporation is going abroad and paying for imports with all the added cost of transport.<lb/>
It is because there was a subconscious but real feeling in the minds of the majority of our electors that we were living in an unreal world and things would not get better until cold reality returned, that my noble friends find themselves on the Benches on this side of the House. The greatest achievement&#x2014;far more important than the measures they take&#x2014;the greatest service to this country, will be simply to restore reality and make us all realise, as my noble friend Lord Soames said so well, that our standards of life, our individual standards, our social services, our power to defend ourselves, depend on our efficiency as earners in the world and on nothing else whatever.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01885"><member>Lord HARRIS of HIGH CROSS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to address your Lordships' House for the first time, I am so bowed down by the great privilege and honour that I shall need all the customary indulgence you extend to maidens in distress. By way of all too inadequate preparation, I applied myself to reading your Lordships' proceedings in copies of <i>Hansard.</i> I must say that I found the results extremely impressive. Even the occasional irrelevancy is very telling. Last week the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, countered a suggestion that your Lordships' House should be abolished (this emanated from another place, which sometimes seems like another world) with the proposal that there should be a referendum, and the referendum was to be on the question: "Which House will you have abolished?" If we can get
<col>874</col>
people to read <i>Hansard,</i> I believe her optimism about the outcome might well be justified.<lb/>
The trouble is that it all sets a standard that is rather intimidating to someone who has not served an apprenticeship elsewhere. There is a particular obstacle for the maiden speaker to try to circumvent the requirement to avoid&#x2014;I hope it is "undue"&#x2014;controversy, at least to avoid extreme provocation. This is very difficult indeed for a working economist. All my life it has been very difficult to find any words that an economist can utter that will be regarded as wholly uncontroversial, particularly if other economists are within earshot. After many years of being myself denounced as a self-confessed monetarist, I was rather glad the other day to think that things are getting better when I heard a BBC producer ask where he might find the last living Keynesian. I am afraid I pointed him hopefully in the direction of Cambridge. Now I see from the list of speakers that Nemesis might be about to descend upon my head. So, my Lords, you may judge my difficulty in coming before you in the unlikely guise of a maiden. I will endeavour, however, to steer clear of Standing Order 29&#x2014;which I enjoyed reading&#x2014;dating back to 1626. I shall endeavour to forbear from personal or sharp speech, though it may be more difficult on this occasion altogether to avoid what it calls "taxing references".<lb/>
Since my Introduction in July the thought of making any kind of speech in this great assembly has, in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan's Lord Chancellor, when confronted with a different kind of maiden:
<quote>" robbed me of me rest ".</quote>
It was only when I saw that the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, had put down this Motion for Papers&#x2014;which Papers I now discover he does not want anyway&#x2014;that I though I should take the plunge.<lb/>
I thought I should like to pay here and now a public tribute to the noble Lord for his resignation in 1958. It is difficult for people outside politics fully to understand the reluctance of Ministers to resign, whether from principle or from mere love of ease and pleasure; but evidently it is a rather rare condition. I think it was very memorable on that occasion that all three Treasury Ministers resigned together,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0446"/>
<col>875</col>
though it might be controversial to mention the name of at least one of the other two ! Looking back, I think 1958 was a bit of a watershed. It certainly seemed to me at the time that these Ministers sacrificed office in a vain attempt to prevent Government spending from rising, which it has gone on doing remorselessly ever since, under Administrations of both parties. It was the last brave stand until 1979.<lb/>
I turn to the White Paper, which starts from the proposition that public expenditure is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties. Very well, I am prepared to go along with that. It is now almost 100 years since a little known German economist called Adolf Wagner formulated the law of increasing Government activity or, as I prefer to call it, increasing Government spending&#x2014;if only other economic laws had proved equally prophetic, my Lords! When he produced his law, Governments were commonly spending between 5 and 10 per cent. of national incomes in Western economies; and here today it has gone on rising to reach a rate of between 50 and 60 per cent. of national income. We can argue over the precise figures, but it is impossible to doubt the direction and velocity.<lb/>
It is plainly not a progession that can continue much further, even if we wished that it should. Therefore, I am glad to bring your Lordships news that there are a growing number of economists around the world who no longer believe that Government spending on anything like this scale has much to do with the public interest or with the welfare of the neediest sections of society. Indeed, the massive increase in what is called "Government welfare spending" does not seem to be an obvious prescription for countries where average real incomes have risen as rapidly as they have in recent decades, even in poor old Britain. It is surely a paradox that, as family prosperity has risen, both main parties have competed in providing more and more central and local government spending and services on an indiscriminate&#x2014;literally a free-for-all&#x2014;basis, without charge and therefore necessarily without sufficient concern for widely varying needs and urgencies.<lb/>
A humble market economist, if such there be, would predict that the multipli
<col>876</col>
cation of so-called "free" services must end up by exerting a quite intolerable strain upon the Exchequer. The reason is perfectly simple. Citizens who voted for more Government services they thought free begin to vote for reduced taxes when the bills come home to roost in their pay packets and in their rate demands. The dilemma for this Government, as for the last one, is how to extricate itself and the voter who, by this time, has become thoroughly schizophrenic. All would like to have some of their taxes back, yet each logically wants to preserve the particular services that he values most. Everyone prefers to live well off the state, but as much as possible at somebody else's expense. All have a strong economic interest in becoming "free riders"; and that is the reason why there can never be a consensus within a party or between parties about where you can best cut "free" services.<lb/>
I believe we must seek a more promising approach and I am going to quote a single sentence that provides a pointer. It does not come on this occasion from Adam Smith, but from the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, whom I am glad to see is with us at the present moment. In a prescient paper he wrote a few years ago, entitled, <i>Paying for the Social Services,</i> the noble Lord wrote as follows:
<quote>" While people would be willing to pay for better services for themselves, they may not he willing to pay more in taxes which may bear no relation to the services actually received ".</quote>
I must hope for another occasion to urge the Government and noble Lords on the other side that this homely, common sense insight of the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, points to a more rational alternative than the present indiscriminate and necessarily arbitrary cuts. It would mean calmly and unemotionally examining how far we can raise charges on a wide range of so-called "free" services, so as to allow individuals to retain a great deal more of their own incomes and to choose where they will economise, where they will draw in their horns, and also to choose where they will preserve or even increase particular lines of expenditure for the benefit of themselves and their families.<lb/>
Such an approach, I accept absolutely, depends on a comprehensive policy of minimum income support, preferably along
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0447"/>
<col>877</col>
the lines of a reverse or negative income tax; and that might be a task to challenge the versatile talents of the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, who I have not seen about on this occasion. My Lords, I have done. I will only add that I hope that radical rethinking along such lines as these might find an echo in all parts of the House, although for some time perhaps a subdued echo; and I now brace my back for lofty chastisement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01886">5.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01887"><member>Lord KALDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is my pleasant duty to begin by congratulating the maiden speakers, of whom we have more today than on any previous occasion I can remember. I should like particularly to congratulate my noble friend Lord Stewart of Fulham on an admirably concise speech. In my view, he put his finger on some of the most important points which we on this side of the House see fundamentally differently from those on the other side. I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, who, as an economist, stands at the very opposite end of the spectrum from myself. I think that in future there will be occasions when he will not be so restrained by tradition to be quit. so uncontroversial as he was today, but will express his views more forcefully and pointedly and will criticise anti-monetarists and Keynesians in a more radical manner. In any case, we welcome him as a Member of this House and I am sure we shall gain a great deal in the liveliness of debates by his presence.<lb/>
I should like also to add, before I close this introductory and congratulatory section, my pleasure by anticipation that I am to be followed by another maiden speech from my noble friend Lord Lever of Manchester. I am sure he will surpass us all in wit, brilliance and amusement. I think he will add a note to the liveliness of this House which will distinguish the polite tone of our debates even more from that of another place. After saying all this&#x2014;I have spent two minutes on congratulations&#x2014;I must hurry on.<lb/>
As noble Lords opposite know, we are not, on certain fundamental matters, divided, that this country is in a perilously difficult situation; that inflation is a terrible curse and it must somehow be brought to an end, and that our uncompetitiveness
<col>878</col>
has brought us down a slippery slope where the gradient gets ever steeper. Where I differ fundamentally from the other side is in their beliefs of how to turn things around. This is what I wish to speak about. This is a wide-ranging debate, the terms were carefully so chosen that one can speak on almost anything, and I should like to spend my time on one aspect only&#x2014;a detailed textual criticism of the first page of the White Paper on Expenditure Plans which the Government issued last week. I apologise to noble Lords for going into such detail on a few paragraphs, but I feel that this is the only way in which one can hope to carry conviction and to convince them that they suffer from numerous delusions.<lb/>
When I first read this page I was so surprised that I said, "Here is a neo-Conservative Manifesto, a testament of faith in monetarism, which is something quite new and distinguishes the present Government from the traditional Conservative Party." It is something that could not have been written when either Winston Churchill or Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister, or when the noble Lord, Lord Butler, was Chancellor. It is a neo-Conservative Manifesto which calls to mind, at opposite extreme, the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels which is well over 100 years old. The very boldness and vagueness of its assertions make the two documents rather similar.<lb/>
It is very disconcerting to those of us who are accustomed to the studied moderation and carefully guarded language of traditional State papers in this country. In fact, when I first read it the first thing that came to my mind was a well-known remark by a great historical figure of your Lordships' House, the third Marquess of Salisbury, who said about the <i>Daily Mail</i> that it was a paper written by office boys for office boys. Reading the first page and a half of this White Paper, I felt that he might have said almost the same about this new manifesto.<lb/>
When carefully examined, this manifesto collapses into a series of <i>non-sequiturs,</i> interspersed with assertions which can easily be proved false by an examination of relevant statistics. Since the truth or falsehood of its basic assertions are absolutely critical to the success of the present Government's whole economic
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0448"/>
<col>879</col>
strategy, I hope I shall be forgiven if I deal with them at some length. I take my cue, in the same way as the preceding speaker, the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, did, from the opening sentence which reads:
<quote>" Public expenditure is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties ".</quote>
This raises many questions. It does not say which aspect&#x2014;whether it is its size, its rate of growth or its composition&#x2014;they regard as critical. By saying that it is at the heart of Britain's difficulties, the implication is that public expenditure is something which peculiarly plagues Britain and does not plague ether countries. Indeed, the next paragraph insinuates, without actually saying so, that public expenditure was responsible for Britain's dismal economic performance.<lb/>
It goes on:
<quote>" Over the past five years output has grown less than half as fast as it did over the previous 20 years, and a little over a third as fast as in other industrialised countries ".</quote>
Economic historians would confirm, I think, that the same statement, or something very like to it, could be made about the Edwardian period, the first decade of this century. Perhaps public expenditure was responsible for that too&#x2014;because it was too small rather than too large.<lb/>
However, in the third paragraph the authors reveal that it is the growth of public expenditure rather than the size which they regard as the main cause of our difficulties. It runs:
<quote>" Over the years public spending has been increased on assumptions about economic growth which have not been achieved ".</quote>
This statement is quite inconsistent with the table on page 9, which shows in line 13 that at constant prices total public expenditure fell over the last five years by no less than 2&#x00BD; per cent. It has not been growing. The noble Lord, Lord Soames, referred in his speech to the rapidly growing burden of public debt, and to anticipate critics I should like to add that total public expenditure in line 13 is defined so as to exclude the service of the public debt. But even if you add that item to it (from line 6) it still remains true that public expenditure, including debt interest, fell by 1 per cent. between 1974&#x2013;75 and 1979&#x2013;80. Over the same period our national output, unsatisfactory though it was, had risen by between 6 and 7 per
<col>880</col>
cent. So clearly, contrary to what th White Paper says, there has been an appreciable fall, and not a rise, in public expenditure both absolutely and even more, in relation to the national income.<lb/>
It would be equally untrue to say that our public expenditure is large in comparison with other countries as a proportion of the GNP. In a recent book on <i>Budgetary Policy,</i> Ward and Neild have shown that our expenditure has been, and is, below the average of the 10 major European countries, and it remains below the average even if account is taken of our relatively low income per head and of the relationship of income per head to public expenditure in relation to the GNP. The manifesto is completely wrong on public expenditure, and all noble Lords opposite who believe it are wrong, because they just repeat to themselves certain slogans, and the more often they repeat them, the more strongly they believe them and the less they feel to be under the necessity to check their beliefs against the facts. They are equally wrong on taxation.</membercontribution></p>

Turning to taxation, the author of the White Paper could not have seen the December 1978 issue of <i>Economic Trends.</i> Page 98 of that issue shows that Britain was the only one of 17 leading countries in the world which had reduced the sum of taxes and social insurance contributions in relation to gross national product between 1970 and 1976 and that it had done so by three percentage points of GNP. If noble Lords do not believe me, they should turn to page 98 of <i>Economic Trends</i> for December 1978 which is an

Moreover, according to the evidence contained in this paper, in 1976, which is the latest year for which comparative figures are available, the United Kingdom occupied ninth place among the 17 countries. With a total burden of 40 per cent. of GNP it was bang in the middle between the upper extreme of Sweden, with 58 per cent., and the lower extreme of Japan, with 22 per cent. So we were the only country among the 17 which actually reduced taxation in relation to GNP, whereas all but two of the others increased it. We were right in the middle. So what justification has the White Paper for saying,
<quote>" increases in taxes have made inflationary pressures worse and reduced incentives ".</quote>
If the writers of the White Paper had looked up their facts and studied them, they should have said the opposite. They should have said that a reduced burden of taxation lightened the inflationary pressure and improved incentives.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01891"><member>Lord KALDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot tell the noble Lord now, but so far as personal income taxation is concerned I can assure him that we are by no means the most heavily taxed country. There are the three Scandinavian countries, and Holland, whose personal income tax is higher than ours. But that is not the point, nor is it according to the point made in the White Paper.<lb/>
Let us turn to paragraph 4. This contains even bigger blunders. It says that to bring down the rate of inflation,
<quote>" it is essential to contain and reduce progressively the growth of the money supply. This means that Government borrowing must in turn be firmly controlled. It is a main determinant of monetary growth ".</quote>
It is only an uneducated person, or a person who is not in the least familiar with the subject, who would not know that since 1970 there has ceased to be any correlation between the borrowing requirement and the change in the money supply. The facts are everywhere to be seen&#x2014;in
<col>882</col>
all kinds of official publications of both the Government and the Bank of England. It is true that a relationship existed until 1969 and I believe that I was the first economist to draw attention to it in an article which was published in 1970. Almost immediately afterwards, however, the relationship ceased to exist because the new Tory Government which came into office in 1970 abandoned the old system of credit control by means of credit ceilings and introduced a new system called "Competition and Credit Control". I can tell those noble Lords who are familiar with the technical jargon&#x2014;noble Lords such as Lord Harris&#x2014;that I calculated the correlation coefficients by computer at Cambridge and that it comes out exactly at zero. So much for saying that the borrowing requirement is the main determinant of the money supply. There is a zero correlation between the change in the money stock in the United Kingdom and the borrowing requirement.<lb/>
Equally, it is only a person who is totally ignorant of monetary statistics who could believe that it was the excessive rate of growth in the money supply which was responsible for Britain's high rate of inflation over the last five years. Anybody who cares to look up the facts needs to go no further than that admirable storehouse of information, <i>International Monetary Statistics</i> published by the IMF. From that it can easily be discovered that the rate of growth of the money supply, in the broad and only significant definition (on which the Government, the Bank of England and everybody else concerned with this matter are agreed), namely, M3, clustered around 10 per cent. a year, at an almost identical rate for the last five years, 1973 to 1978 in four countries: Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. All four countries had the same rate of growth in the money supply. Yet the rate of inflation averaged no less than 15 per cent. in Britain over that five year period, but only 4&#x00BD; per cent. in Switzerland, 4&#x00BE; per cent. in Germany and 9 per cent. in Belgium.<lb/>
I think it is obvious from these figures that the growth in the money supply no more explains the high rate of inflation in the United Kingdom than it explains the exceptionally low inflation rates of Switzerland and Germany. Indeed, if one relates the money supply to the gross
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0450"/>
<col>883</col>
national income, Germany's money supply is twice as large as that of the United Kingdom. It is 67 per cent. of GNP as against our 34&#x00BD; per cent., while Switzerland's money supply is nearer four times that of the United Kingdom. It is 125 per cent. of GNP against our 34 per cent. So monetarists please note that on their own chosen criteria the danger of inflation through excessive liquidity is greatest in Switzerland and Germany, while the United Kingdom ought to be the least vulnerable. Of course this is nonsense, but it is nonsense because monetarism is nonsense. It is not Germany and Switzerland which stand in real danger of a high rate of inflation, but this country.<lb/>
In fact, the United Kingdom has by far the worst record and is in the most dangerous situation from the aspect of inflation, and the policies of the present Government are, I am afraid, more likely to speed up this process than to slow it down because they go so completely the wrong way about it. There is not a word about wages or a policy on wage settlements in the White Paper.<lb/>
As far as output, employment and economic growth are concerned, the White Paper adopts a wholly fatalistic attitude. All it says is,
<quote>" that the prospects arc poor &#x2026; both in this country and in the rest of the world ".</quote>
This reminds one of a statement attributed to Neville Chamberlain during the great depression that the Government is no more capable of regulating the general demand for labour than it is of regulating the weather. After a long circle we now seem to have returned to the same point.<lb/>
The philosophy underlying the present Government's policy is that wealth can be created only by the private sector, not by the public sector, that wealth can be created only by giving incentives for risk bearing and so on, and that Governments cannot create wealth. Indeed, they say that
<quote>" to plan for more public expenditure before the required output is available to support it would ensure that the growth of output does not take place ".</quote>
The absurdity of this view is shown by the fact that this Government would be only too glad to see more motorways built if private enterprise built them&#x2014;as is the
<col>884</col>
case in France&#x2014;but it nevertheless feels that the same economic circumstances compel reducing the road building programme by &#x00A3;200 million merely because this is produced by the public sector and not by the private sector. Why do they not hand it over to private enterprise and be done with it? Then they can say "Ah, the private sector has increased our wealth or output, so now we can be allowed to spend more money."<lb/>
There are certain expenditures, like defence, which are exempt from that philosophy. I only wish that we were in the same situation on defence as we are under the Common Agricultural Policy. We pay a disproportionate share of the burden. We only have to look at the proportion of the defence expenditure of Germany, which is two-thirds of ours; of France, which is less than two-thirds of ours and of a number of other countries which is only one-half of ours, As a percentage of GNP there is no other country in Europe which has as high a proportion of defence expenditure as we have, with the exception of the United States.<lb/>
As to the rest, there is one thing on which I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, when he mentioned the "so-called" cuts. The White Paper is full of "so-called" cuts. They are not cuts at all; they are not cuts in services, provided they are treated as negative public expenditure, which is a concealed form of taxation, hypothetical taxation of the most regressive kind. When they say that the country can no longer afford to send children to school by bus it is not that the buses will stop&#x2014;on the contrary they cannot stop because the schools are to be concentrated in bigger villages. It is simply that a charge is made for the transport of the children. There is no change in the use of resources, but only a regressive change in redistribution of taxation. The road to national salvation is sought by making higher prescription charges for the same makes of prescription ; by compelling higher payments for school meals and school milk and goodness knows what else besides. It is a plain cheat to call these cuts in public expenditure. It is not that the resources are transferred from one use to another. It is just a way of putting more burdens on the poor; and they are worse than general indirect taxes, because if you put VAT of 15 per
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0451"/>
<col>885</col>
cent. on clothes then everyone has to pay&#x2014;not only the poor but also the rich. When you have private medicine along with public medicine and private education along with public education then you impose tax on the person who is not rich enough to have private education and private medicine whereas the person who is able to afford private education or medicine is wholly exempt.<lb/>
I want to close my speech with one sentence, because I realise that I have spoken for a very long time. My Lords, I will conclude where I began, with a quotation. I began with the opening sentence of this neo-Conservative Manifesto. I think it is only fitting that I should end with the opening sentence of its counterpart, the Communist Manifesto, which runs:
<quote>" The history of mankind is a history of class struggles ".</quote>
I cannot say that I ever believed in this, but the present White Paper makes me feel that there must be more to it than I had once thought.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01893"><member>Lord LEVER of MANCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House must be increasingly fatigued by the cries of <i>soi disant</i> reluctant maidens. However, I must say that the arrangements of the House have won my instant admiration. The noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, was put on to precede me thus being enabled, with good heart, to congratulate me. I wonder whether a delayed appearance by the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, would necessarily produce the same result, because Lord Kaldor and I have long been friends and worked together in the Treasury; but there were only intermittently those points where our views met in harmony. I am glad to say that today he included one of those points in his speech.<lb/>
I, too, resent the semi-theological passion which has lately accrued as the bogies of monetary aggregates. I am not an expert in this kind of algebraical economics, but my own impression is that those countries which are most successful in combating inflation preach vigorously about the control of monetary aggregates but practise whatever is convenient. Those countries which fail to cope with their balance of payments and inflation problems are constrained by their creditors
<col>886</col>
not only to preach monetary aggregates but actually to practice it, and that is far less convenient. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, that Germany and Switzerland have had monetary aggregates during a period of low inflation which do not appear to cohere with the uncritical enthusiasm of so many of the monetarists that I meet, but I claim no expertise in this area.<lb/>
I also wish to express my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, for this wide and stimulating debate, although as will appear I am going to concentrate on a very narrow part of the economic situation. I am grateful too to an old colleague in the House of Commons, the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, for refreshing my mind about those tragic events of 1958 when, for what now seems a derisory sum, Lord Thorneycroft resigned from the high office of Chancellor of the Exchequer. It seemed to me in itself to explain why resignations thereafter were less frequent; because the three Treasury Ministers could resign without much impact upon the then Prime Minister it was rather discouraging for those of us who held more modest positions to seek to emulate them.<lb/>
The narrow area on which I am going to speak is that of the recent abolition of the remains of exchange control, and I hope the House will bear with me because so far it seems to me that a subject which my old Treasury experiences teach me should be largely devoid of party political excitement, has not yet been discussed without a great deal of party political excitement, at any rate in the other place. For when the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the disposal of this residual exchange control he was, on the one hand, described as "a lickspittle of international capitalists", and, in the more approving sense, he was treated as the greatest liberator since Heracles struck the chains from Prometheus. Neither of those extreme views was well documented in the discussion, so far as <i>Hansard</i> has recorded it, and therefore, in my few minutes, constrained as I shall be from these excitements of party political hyperbole in relation to this matter by the conventions of a maiden speaker, I shall seek to examine what has been achieved, good or ill, in the abolition of these exchange controls.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0452"/>
<col>887</col>
It is of course no secret to Members of this House that the exchange control never existed until the war in 1939, but what is not so commonly remembered about this hangover from the wartime controls is that most of the exchange control of wartime has gone. The wartime exchange control was deliberately designed to put economic power into the hands of the Government by controlling all foreign sterling holdings, whether they were owned by United Kingdom residents or anybody else, in effect controlling all imports and exports, so as to give, rightly, priority to the prosecution of the war. Secondly, the exchange control was intended&#x2014;whether or not this was desirable, I know not&#x2014;to maintain the same rate of exchange rather artificially throughout the whole period of the war.<lb/>
This power, of course, was sharply reduced by all Governments, stage by stage, after the war, very necessarily and rightly so. All that was abolished with so much elan and proclamation by the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer was a residual relic of those exchange controls. All the foreign holdings of sterling have long been exempt from control of any kind. Foreigners have been entirely free to do what they like with any external sterling that comes into their possession. The controls have had little or no relation to exports and imports. The only people controlled at all, and only very partially controlled, have been United Kingdom residents, and then only to a minor and not very rewarding extent.<lb/>
So, since these exchange controls were effectively abolished before the recent announcement, we have to ask ourselves what good were they doing or what evil were they averting in that truncated form. I am very sympathetic to and conscious of the argument, especially in the trade union movement, that the final abolition of the exchange controls might in some way prejudice investment in our country. I have examined that very briefly, and although I understand the anxieties they feel, and especially in relation to the long industrial decline which is so frequently commented upon in the British industrial performance, we have to see whether the recent abolition of exchange controls really has the effect which causes them this anxiety.<lb/>
<col>888</col>
The first thing that has to be noticed is that investment in this country depends upon the conjunction of three factors. First, there has to be profitable investment opportunity. I am not talking about State investment; I am talking about private investment, which is the only investment that is affected by these controls. There has to be a profitable investment opportunity. Secondly, there has to be the entrepreneurial skill and eagerness to exploit that opportunity. Thirdly, there has to be the investable funds to follow up those two essential ingredients.<lb/>
Of those three crucial ingredients for heightened investment the one that has always been present in abundance has been investable funds. There has never been a shortage of investable funds. This has been established time and time again. Of course, it could be said that there are plenty of investable funds but our entrepreneurs are rather slack at searching out profitable investment opportunities. That is not true either. If anything, our investable funds are so pressing upon the market that their anxiety to find profitable outlet in our country often borders on credulity, and situations are chosen for investment which more hard-headed people on the Left of politics like myself would find it difficult to support. It is these barons, true blue contributors to the Tory Party's Central Office, which enables Lord Thorneycroft to be so well-informed when he addresses us, who all to readily give way to credulity.<lb/>
So the great thing that has been wrong in our investment performance has been the lack of profitable opportunities, not the lack of investment funds. British investment abroad has never lost us investment here. On the contrary, if anything, it has added to investment here and added to the demand for our goods. That has all been established. I am not saying this because a Tory Chancellor brought in this measure. I was saying this throughout my years in Labour Government to anyone who was prepared to listen, including many of my colleagues, although not, apparently, all of them.<lb/>
On the question of our long decline, I hope I may be allowed to say some blunt words without being too controversial. It is a relative decline. Our standard of life and production of wealth is higher
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0453"/>
<col>889</col>
today than ever in our history. But relative to the top performers we have done badly. The most notable and apt comparison with which we are rightly often challenged is Germany. It has always struck me as somewhat anomalous that those who never tire of contrasting the inadequacy of our performance with that of the German economy, whose performance we are asked to admire and seek to emulate, never mention the methods by which they achieved this. We have to be quite frank and say that the Germans could hardly wait after the war to get rid of exchange controls.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01894">A noble Lord: They had Marshall Aid!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01895"><member>Lord LEVER of MANCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: In fact, the Germans got rid of their exchange controls just as speedily as they could, and as a matter of fact the only capital controls they have at the present moment are to save them from the embarrassment of too great a flow of money inwards. Well, I hope that we shall find ourselves similarly embarrassed in the not too distant future. I must say, however, that the problem of ending our lack of investment, or lower peformance in investment, is a very grave one. I have to tell the House (a) that I do not know the answer, and (b) if I did I could not hope to explain it within the confines properly assigned to a maiden speech.<lb/>
One thing I will say is not the answer is to compel British fund holders to hold their funds in Britain in the hope that in despair they will invest them where no profitable opportunity exists. And the second point on which there has to be greater consideration before we rush in is the belief that Britain's industrial decline can be halted by Government good intentions, Government power and Government cheque book alone. I am not saying that Government power and Government cheque book will not have a role from time to time, but it is naive and dangerous to believe that that is the deciscive role in the light of the painful lessons of recent years.<lb/>
We have to be honest and face reality. Reality is neither Left Wing nor Right Wing; I would immediately say to anyone who criticises this view. The reality is that with the best intentions in the world,
<col>890</col>
and with an enormous cheque book, we were worried about the decline, for example, of the motor industry. What happened? Did we reverse the decline or slow it up? On the contrary, unhappily, the mere recipe of Government intervention and Government genuine intentions, with learned and erudite officials to back it all up, resulted in an even swifter decline in the motor industry than in the previous years, made it in fact the most spectacular decline of a major industry, among many others in recent years, and very alarming too. Though I emphasise, especially to my noble friends, and for that matter to the other side, that anyone who for doctrinal reasons rules out the use of Government intervention or the use of public funds is as unjustified as anyone who believes that they are the automatic and simple remedy for the decline of industrial investment.<lb/>
To return to and finish with the theme of exchange controls, one of the ways of getting more industrial investment is certainly not to coerce your citizens by exchange controls. That being so, we have to recognise that the only possible reason for retaining this residual relic of exchange control is to protect us from a run on sterling. Here again, anyone who knows the facts of this exchange control&#x2014;and however wrong my views may be on other matters I have had some experience in this area&#x2014;knows that the existing level of exchange control before the Chancellor acted was entirely futile to protect against a run on sterling. All it could do was to inhibit, veto, the marginal and relatively harmless expenditures of a few well-to-do citizens who go on holidays or who want to buy a house abroad, or the like. The great movement of funds came from sterling holders not within the control of the Government&#x2014;from foreign sterling holders&#x2014;and not a little of it from domestic sterling holders who cannot be controlled by exchange control.<lb/>
In the modern world leads and lags dwarf the puny effects of the exchange control on the few harmless private spenders. If industry forms the view that the exchange rate will go down, it leads on its payments and lags on its receipts, and so does everyone else. The United States suffers that today without exchange control, and we suffered it with exchange control. So, it is not even a useful
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0454"/>
<col>891</col>
machinery for protecting against a run on sterling.<lb/>
In those circumstances, we should all be glad to know that we have got rid of a relic from the last war that was serving no useful purpose either as regards investment or in protecting us from runs on sterling. At the risk of sounding fulsome I must briefly pay a tribute to a rare institution&#x2014;an institution with power that seeks to give it up and is active and persistent, and indeed pertinacious, in seeking to give it up. I do not often see eye to eye with the Bank of England on all these matters, but I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien of Lothbury, in his place, because I remember how anxious and, incidentally, how right he was about 20 years ago to give this up because it was serving no useful purpose. It is remarkable that the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, and his successor Gordon Richardson, possessed of this power, spent a great deal of time urging Governments to take it away from them. That, I am sorry to say, is a rare phenomenon in the exercise of public power and one that I think is worth a passing tribute.<lb/>
In so far as there is a longer term danger from the currency situation for Britain, it does not arise from the abolition of these last pieces of puny and irrelevant exchange control. It arises from the desperately dangerous situation in the world monetary system, especially as it relates to financing deficits. I urge the Government&#x2014;I do not want to go into technical detail&#x2014;to recognise that the area which they must look to is the effect of all this on the banking system, and not the more popular targets for criticism.<lb/>
However, for all the reasons that I have given, I can, as a member of the Labour Party and of the former Government, welcome the end of this exchange control which has served no useful purpose, and the abolition of which could be a considerable encouragement to a great trading, insurance and banking nation like our own.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01897"><member>Lord COBBOLD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have listened to three admirable maiden speeches today and it falls to me to congratulate in particular the noble Lord, Lord Lever of Manchester. I think
<col>892</col>
that in any event I should have enjoyed his speech very much, but I enjoyed it perhaps more because he spoke about subjects in which I have a very considerable interest. It so happens that in 1939 I spent a great deal of time putting on the exchange controls and throughout the 1950s, as he rightly said, we spent a great deal of time in getting rid of most of them. It would be very foolish for me to say to the noble Lord, Lord Lever, that the House will look forward to hearing from him more often. That appears to be a more than obvious self-evident fact.<lb/>
My purpose in intervening in this debate is only to stress one point and to draw on my experience in the 1950s, when I carried some responsibilities for these matters. I propose to talk&#x2014;and I am sorry to say that I propose to talk rather gloomily&#x2014;about inflation. I make no apology for making once again the "central bank" speech which will be very well known to the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, and to ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer who have heard me make it very often. Indeed, I make no apology if only because rather to my surprise inflation has not been mentioned often in the debate this afternoon.<lb/>
Throughout the 1950s, when inflation was running at what seems today minimal figures, I and various others who sit in your Lordships' House today, made a great many speeches warning of the dangers of progressive inflation. It is a fairly dull subject and on the whole the speeches fell on deaf ears and were generally regarded as a routine form of central banking and economists' mumbo-jumbo. The very clear recollection which I have comes from my discussions during the 1950s with my colleagues in other central banks around the world. Some, like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada, had the same difficulties as we did in getting across the message about the danger of inflation. We were almost envious of others, especially perhaps the West German Central Bank, which only had to mention the word "inflation" and everybody leapt immediately to attention and action. I can perhaps make the point best by quoting some words from a speech which I made to the Canada Club in April 1959. I emphasise that I said this 20 years ago. The extract begins:
<quote>"Obviously the dangers of inflation are more easily understood in those countries which have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0455"/>
<col>893</col>
known complete collapse of a paper currency: in those countries the bogey is familiar, and a call to defend the currency has a real personal meaning to every citizen. In other countries (it is happily the case both in the United Kingdom and Canada) no collapse of the currency has been known: such gradual decrease in the value of money"&#x2014;</quote>
I repeat that I am talking about 20 years ago&#x2014;
<quote>"as has taken place has brought benefit to some and suffering to others&#x2014;it has not been seen in the stark terms of complete loss of savings, social upheaval and insolvency of the State. It has to be proved over the next few decades that paper currencies, and indebtedness expressed in terms of paper currency, can, by the will of democracy and with the support of democracy, retain public confidence as a store of value. This will require an ever wider understanding of the problem by the peoples of our countries, and a continued willingness to accept the disciplines without which the objective cannot be won".</quote>
I repeat that that was said 20 years ago.<lb/>
In the last few years we have seen the beginnings of a wider appreciation in this country of what real inflation means. But there is still much to be done in bringing full realisation home to the public. Inflation is a bit like alcohol. A little alcohol makes most people feel good&#x2014;quite a bit of it, over quite a long period, makes a lot of people feel good. So does inflation. But, it is not always easy to realise, or at any rate to realise in time, that if it gets out of hand, the one will destroy the body politic as the other will destroy the physical body. Nor is it always easy, in either case, to accept the necessary disciplines to prevent that from happening.<lb/>
Both Administrations in recent years have set the attack on inflation as a primary objective. But every time that there have been signs of a check, inflation has moved up again to higher levels. There are very different views which have been forcefully put forward, and will again be forcefully put forward in this debate, about the right or wrong ways of pressing the attack home. There is, however, a view common to most people on all sides of this House, and increasingly accepted by the country as a whole, that inflation is the prime enemy and that the attack on it must have the highest priority. I hope that the debate in your Lordships' House today may help in some measure to make the dangers of failure to deal with inflation still more widely understood and increase the willingness of the
<col>894</col>
public to accept the disciplines which will surely be needed if failure is to be avoided.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01899"><member>Lord IRVING of DARTFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a maiden speech is perhaps a suitable occasion in a debate as wide as this for a newcomer from another place to make his views about your Lordships' House clear. I was very disappointed to be so unceremoniously and painfully dismissed from another place during the May election. When it happens to one twice in 10 years, there is no greater test for a democrat. Nevertheless, I was very pleased to come to your Lordships' House because I have always taken the view that it does a useful job, and a very good job indeed, as regards European legislation. In time I hope to make a modest contribution to that work. I have never wanted your Lordships' House to have more power than it has at present. Nor have I at any time wished it to make a real challenge to the elected House. I do not do so now. I do not wish it to be abolished; nor do I wish it to be elected because I believe that inevitable conflict will arise between the two Chambers.<lb/>
Eighteen months ago I led a delegation to Australia which included two Members of your Lordships' House&#x2014;the noble Countess, the Countess of Loudoun, and the newly-ennobled Baroness, Lady Skrimshire of Quarter. During that time we saw the bitterness that conflict between the two chambers had left in Australia. I should not like to see that take place in the United Kingdom. The great majority of our people take the view that this House is part of our history, and generally they respect the wide range of distinction and knowledge that your Lordships bring to debate. Once this ceased to be true, due to abolition or election, the bitterest controvesy would arise and many people would join in it. I submit that there are many more better things to do than to become involved in the time-consuming and destructive exercise that this would involve.<lb/>
Leaving that subject, I should like to make a more parochial plea to the Government. One of the casualties of the last two or three years, because of our economic difficulties, has been the road programme. Although we have built some very fine roads in many parts of the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0456"/>
<col>895</col>
country, one part of the country that has been totally neglected is the road to the South-East&#x2014;the road to the garden of England, the gateway to Europe. I am sure that those noble Lords who use that road will agree that it is absolutely appalling. There is an increase in delay, frustration and wear and tear, and it now takes about two hours to do the 20-mile journey up from the South-East. It reflects no credit on anyone, and I should like to urge the Minister to use his good offices to obtain a speedy improvement in this road before the traffic snarls up entirely.<lb/>
I want to make another cry from the heart. For nearly 30 years I have been a member of a local authority. I believe that a healthy system of local government is essential to a sound democracy. I wish that more parliamentarians were involved in this kind of work. However, at present I am the chairman of a finance committee which is wrestling with the problem of trying to interpret the intentions of the Government in respect of local authorities. Local authorities face an impossible task. In my local authority our calculations show that in order to meet increased wages and salaries, comparability payments and such payments as interest charges, which we could not take into account nine months ago, there must be at least a 30 per cent. increase in the rates. That is after we have made serious attempts at cuts and, indeed, after we have for two years frozen many appointments. I hope that the Secretary of State will bear in mind that local authorities have been squeezed for the last two or three years, that many of them have run down their balances, and that there is little fat left.<lb/>
I should like to make one other point clear. I believe in a mixed economy, because I believe that that is the best way of ensuring freedom of choice and efficiency. I believe in the need to make British industry profitable and I believe in the need for Government to create the environment in which this can happen. I am certain that we need a closer understanding, both between Parliament and industry, and between the two sides of industry. Two or three years ago a number of us co-operated to establish the Industry and Parliament Trust which has been at work for the last three years. The first 20 or 30 fellows have nearly
<col>896</col>
completed the task to which they committed themselves of attaching themselves to and working in industry for 25 days. I believe this has been completed to the mutual satisfaction of both the members themselves and, indeed, of industry. I hope that perhaps some of your Lordships may have an opportunity to take part in a similar exercise in the future.<lb/>
However, our present situation is very serious. The economic facts are grim. We have an economy which has consistently been unable to compete in world markets. It is common ground that, although we disagree with the extent, there is a need to hold back expenditure, and we agree that the money supply is an important element in any Government's policy. But the Government themselves have withdrawn from the control of prices and profits and, indeed, from wage bargaining. I do not believe that that can continue because I am certain that the Government must become involved in the industries which they control. In setting the cash limits they will, in fact, be setting the going rate for industries outside those which they control. I do not believe that we can do without a wages policy. I am certain that sooner or later the Government will have to return to a wages policy, which I hope will be a voluntary one.<lb/>
In the meantime I hope that the Government will seek to secure the closest cooperation with the trade union movement, because it is particularly important at this time. We face a new industrial revolution based on the technology of the micro-processor, which will alter beyond recognition so many of the industries upon which national wealth and employment prospects depend. In the last 10 years Japan has spent something like &#x00A3;500 million on micro-processors, while the United States has stimulated its industry through enormous defence and space exploration expenditure. France and West Germany have been investing at the rate of about &#x00A3;60 million per annum.<lb/>
Until recently our programme has been very slight indeed. In its second report which the Advisory Council on Applied Research and Development presented to the Cabinet Office yesterday it says:
<quote>"We are in great danger of being left a long way behind in the application of programmable automation and robotics".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0457"/>
<col>897</col>
The new technology presents us with a dilemma. If we do not invest, we shall never be able to compete in world markets. If we use the new technology, we shall find that we need fewer people. One or two people like Arthur Little believe that many new jobs will be created, but they are very few in number. But the Think Tank and the Manpower Services Commission do not believe this at all. Professor Freeman said in his J. D. Bernal Memorial lecture last year:
<quote>"Developments in the micro-electronics industry are far more important than developments in aircraft, cars, steel, chemicals and in any other industrial sector because micro-electronics is a new 'heartland' technology".</quote>
Sir James Hamilton, the Permanent Secretary to the Department of Education and Science, this morning said that this was the most important new technology since the Industrial Revolution, although he did point to a number of other new developments. Mr. Ray Curnow and Professor Ian Barron of INMOS have talked of "a tidal wave of electronics" which will sweep through existing industries destroying some of them completely.<lb/>
Information technology will affect 95 per cent. of the economy. Derek Roberts, the Managing Director of Plessey micro-systems division, believes that the electronics revolution will fairly swiftly lead to organisational investment and manpower changes in practically all established industries. The computer and telecommunications merger will be the first, and this will lead to a catastrophic loss of jobs.<lb/>
I believe that we have a time-scale of about five years&#x2014;10 years at the most. But the effects will be considerable. It will almost inevitably mean that, if we are to get more efficient and simplified production, we shall use more resources, and therefore we are concerned not just with the conservation of oil, but we must be concerned with the conservation ofmany other raw materials. It will require a new approach to our education system in terms of training and retraining. People and institutions will need to adapt to more extensive work sharing and a new relationship between work and leisure. It will require an increase in research and the search for alternate materials.<lb/>
<col>898</col>
I believe that there should be a minister charged with the special responsibility of co-ordinating all these matters. Whether this is to be a threat or a promise of better things to come, whether it is to be a danger or an opportunity, will depend on the degree of co-operation between management and workers in securing the enormous adjustments which are involved. I believe that the British people are capable of achieving that co-operation.<lb/>
It is in times of difficulties&#x2014;difficulties like the present&#x2014;when we should have faith in ourselves and the courage to plan for the future. I hope that the Government and all others concerned will act positively on the lines of the new report so as to enable all our people to enjoy the benefits, and a better life than ever before. The prizes are great, and although the hour is late I believe that the future is still in our hands if we, as a nation, are prepared to act sensibly, act together, and act in time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01901"><member>Lord NUGENT OF GUILDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it falls to me to have the privilege and pleasure of congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Irving of Dartford, on his maiden speech, which your Lordships obviously enjoyed very much in its highly constructive vein. It must have been a relief to your Lordships to know that there are some distinguished Members of the House of Commons who really wish the House of Lords to continue in existence. Of course, the noble Lord occupied an important position in the House as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Ways and Means. I was interested to see in his wide-ranging career of public service that one of his jobs had been to help with raising the finance for the University of Kent. Here I can sympathise with him because I was chairman of the appeal for the University of Surrey, so he and I must put our heads together and console each other on what must have been many difficulties in the past. We all look forward to hearing the noble Lord, Lord Irving, often in the future, and hope that he enjoys our company as much as I know we shall enjoy his.<lb/>
May I start by thanking my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft on making this debate possible. He must have been pleased to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0458"/>
<col>899</col>
hear the felicitous reference by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, to the events of 1958 as, as he put it, the last brave stand against excessive public expenditure. I am bound to say that at that time I was a junior Minister in the Government and it seemed to me to cause quite a stir when the Chancellor of the Exchequer and all the Treasury Ministers resigned together. It is true that at the time it was classified officially as only a little local trouble, but the rest of us thought that it was very considerable. It must be good for my noble friend to be taking part with this Government today who are trying once again to stem the tide.<lb/>
This debate starts from the point where we took over, as the White Paper describes, this record of the past five years of accelerating decline, national debt doubled, the pound sterling losing half its value, and the great enemy, of course, of inflation&#x2014;to which the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, so authoritatively referred&#x2014;for ever working away and damaging everything. At the same time let us not forget that unemployment doubled. That is something that matters to all of us. We do not hear so much about that now. GNP slightly rising, but let us face it, only saved by the incredible bonus of North Sea oil. In fact, the output of our factories, as we know, is down on what it was five years ago.<lb/>
This record of accelerating decline&#x2014;and it is that acceleration which is such an anxiety to, I am sure, noble Lords on all sides of the House; heaven knows we have been accustomed to decline except in the 1950s&#x2014;is really worrying. This has been achieved by a Government which has tried. And let me give personal credit to the former Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, for striving to keep the wage award level last winter to 5 per cent. My word, he strived hard in the interests of controlling that inflation which is at the bottom of it all. But at the end of five years of all the best intentions and enormously high spending by the Labour Government, here we are in Britain worse off and less competitive than any of our neighbours. I believe we are even about to be passed by Italy, which I hear is going to be ahead of us next year.<lb/>
This is the background of the White Paper, and it is only right and proper that this Government should be making a
<col>900</col>
complete change. This is what we were elected to do. This was in our election manifesto, and so this is what we are now doing. The basis of the change is to put top priority on the creation of new wealth, which must come from private business. The start of this was of course in the Budget with the reduction of personal taxation to a very considerable measure, and then this to be followed by the restraint of public spending which we have before us today.<lb/>
Let me make the point, because it needs making and making again throughout the debate, that the measure of the cuts is really not all that dramatic. I hope that noble Lords opposite, and indeed members of Her Majesty's Opposition generally, are not going to exaggerate this, because they are in fact no more than stabilising expenditure at the level they were themselves spending. In terms of public presentation this is no more than half the cut which the Labour Government imposed in 1976&#x2013;77 as a result of the IMF conditions, when of course they had the support of the Conservative Opposition of the day. The Labour attack as the noble Lord, Lord Peart, presented it, which pitched in particularly to our cuts in the education service and the National Health Service, is not a serious contribution to the debate unless it can present a viable alternative to the path we are treading. Perhaps they can. I hope they are able to.<lb/>
Unless we can reverse the present trend of decline, even the existing levels of social services will not be able to be maintained. The whole thrust of the Government's policy is to increasing growth in the private sector, which alone can create the new wealth, the new jobs, the higher living standards we all want. I firmly believe that the reduction in income tax is the basic step to encourage employers and employees alike. It makes men running their own businesses able to earn a better profit, and therefore they have a greater incentive and can develop their businesses and make savings. This is good for everybody. If it makes them richer at the same time, well this is something which is going to benefit the whole community in the end.<lb/>
One aspect of this policy must be that the rich man is not to be seen as somebody to be persecuted. He is valuable to us.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0459"/>
<col>901</col>
He is not an enemy of society. He is not to be squeezed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer until he howls with anguish. For what does he do?&#x2014;he goes. We all know about the brain drain. It is increasing and nobody knows its dimensions, and one of the more galling aspects of it is that the big fish get out whenever they want to. They move their money about the world without the slightest difficulty. The smaller ones get caught, and thus we all suffer.<lb/>
Top talent today is in an international market, and men and women can move about and have a bigger part of their earnings left to them, so they feel they are better rewarded. I am not speaking just about the spectacular people, the sportsmen and "show biz" people, because it runs right through the professional and industrial world. We cannot afford to lose these wealth-creaters. We must make this place attractive for them to live in and to come hack to. I had contact with one such person the other day when canvassing for my Conservative Party. Somewhere in my neighbourhood I asked a man whether he would make a subscription to the party. He was obviously extremely wealthy&#x2014;his large house and everything about it indicated that he was rich&#x2014;and he obviously moved about a lot, and where his main residence was I do not know. In any event, his reply to me was, "Why do you think I should give money to your party, which has put out of office the Labour Party, when I was making so much money as a result of their mistakes?" I hope noble Lords will take the message, though I make it as a joke, that persecuting the rich simply impoverishes everyone.<lb/>
I turn briefly to industrial relations, because this is part of what the Government are doing, and they have my support. It is necessary to redress the balance between trade unions and management, including individual workers, and I hope noble Lords opposite, Labour politicians generally and trade union leaders, will recognise that industry and commerce are not a battlefield for political power. Management must have a certain measure of authority if it is to function efficiently. It has a function to perform; it must take decisions and give leadership. If it is weakened by the labour force having too much of the power, it will become
<col>902</col>
inefficient in its function and then we all suffer. We shall have other debates on this subject when measures are produced by the Government, so more about this subject later.<lb/>
These are only the bare bones of political policies, and we must now ask, what response will the nation give? Everything depends on that. I would accept something the economists have not said today; namely, that all the economic moguls predict this recession deepening. Therefore, there is only one thing which can change the present economic trend in our national life, particularly against a trend of world recession, and that is a change of heart by us as a nation. This I believe is possible, and I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, saying so; and others have said it.<lb/>
What we need to get over to the nation is that there is no trick of Government policy, of financial arrangements, which will give us a soft option. Government can only spend money which the nation produces. Government can of course create short-term money, but unless that is covered by extra production from our factories and offices, inevitably there will have to be more borrowing, more taxation, higher inflation and the same cycle of decline to which we are all too accustomed. Let us face the fact that over the years Governments, perhaps all Governments, have been all too ready to create the impression that they can manage the money of the nation in such a way that they can provide what is wanted. Maybe this belief stems from past days of our Imperial greatness when we really were a rich nation; but we are certainly not today and we have only what we earn. I therefore hope that the Opposition attack will not encourage the great trade unions this winter, especially in the public sector, to make excessive wage claims, because that would exacerbate the situation and make greater difficulty in controlling the money supply and getting inflation under control.<lb/>
There are, however, a few encouraging signs, perhaps the odd straw in the wind. There was the poll by the British Leyland labour force; about one-third of all the workforce in the engineering industry continued to work during the strike; and there has been the Talbot settlement&#x2014;the employers are of course French, and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0460"/>
<col>903</col>
the employees knew they would not get more than 5&#x00BD; per cent., so they settled for that. Those are just a few straws, and they are certainly nothing like enough to show that the message has got over; but I believe that more will follow so long as the Government stand fast and management plays its part too. Management has been making a lot of sense at its conference this week because basically what is needed in every factory and workplace is teamwork between management and workforce. Only by getting that team work, and the Government creating conditions in which that work can take place harmoniously, shall we get the extra production we want.<lb/>
The precedents for making a recovery of this kind are not encouraging, but we have one which is very near us and we can take a great deal of comfort from it, namely, that of our neighbours in France. I can remember well 25 years ago motoring across France and having a conversation with a friend on how France could recover. Everything was going downhill, Governments w alked in and out of office, Ministers were unknown and the whole country was in a state of continuous decline, with endless industrial troubles and production falling. There seemed to be no hope whatsoever, yet look at France today; it is booming with prosperity. That was achieved by one man with courage and vision, General de Gaulle, who gave leadership with immense skill and trenendous courage&#x2014;my word! he ran into opposition, people trying to kill him, but he survived&#x2014;who led his country through to prosperity. France is now enjoying prosperity she has never known before, all done in the space of 25 years.<lb/>
There is an example for us, and I do not think there is anyone in Britain who would not say, "What a Frenchman can do, I can jolly well do better!" We here in Britain today have a leader with courage and vision, and she has my support. The Prime Minister is giving us a policy which starts us on this road to recovery, which I believe will win a response from our people as a whole, and which will carry us through so that we will deploy the great strength, ingenuity and enterprise which we as a nation have, so that our standard of living could be rising again, with better social services and the whole of our lives made a great
<col>904</col>
deal better. I warmly support the Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01902">7.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01903"><member>Lord JACQUES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with previous speakers in congratulating the four maiden speakers, and this is one occasion when we can say sincerely that we hope to hear from them very often in the future. It is accepted that this country is one of the poorest members of the European Economic Community. It is also true that we suffer from some of the disadvantages which inevitably overtake a pioneer, but our resources, both human and material, are such, especially our resources of energy and our experience of manufacture, that we should be one of the richest members of the Community; and we could be one of the richest if we could find a way of co-operating and working together rather than spending our resources fighting each other. That is putting it bluntly, but I believe that it is the core of the trouble.<lb/>
I also believe that unfortunately we are further from reaching that position than we have been at any time in the post-war period. We now have an entrenched Right Wing Government locked in a combat of will power with a strong trade union movement, and there could never be a less propitious time for that to happen because it is against the background of a very sombre international situation. It is having, and it is going to have, tragic effects upon our economy.<lb/>
I would direct the attention of the House to the work of a number of independent economists who represent a comprehensive cross-section of private and public industry, finance, and public administration. They are pooling together their knowledge and experience for the purposes of making forecasting more accurate, and they are using the Treasury computer forecasting model. Their last report&#x2014;they are to report quarterly&#x2014;was published in full in the <i>Guardian</i> of 15th October, 1979, and any figures that I use will be taken entirely from that report.<lb/>
In a free-for-all organised workers can be expected to seek to maintain, and where possible to increase, their standard of living. The threat that we will not print the money has no effect whatever in the short run, and in the long run the effect is uncertain and is minimal. It is much more likely that the workers would com
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0461"/>
<col>905</col>
mend their trade union leaders for having tried to maintain or increase their standard of living, and then blame the Government for any unemployment, even though some of it was consequential. Let us have no doubt about it&#x2014;that will be the reaction of the workers.<lb/>
The threat that we will not print the money is of course a bit of political shorthand. In practice the control of the quantity and the velocity of circulation of money and credit is both uncertain and difficult. The principal instrument in the control of money is the rate of interest. A high rate of interest strengthens sterling. That in turn makes exports dear and imports cheap, which in effect means that foreign competition is used to inhibit the increases of prices by home producers; and that is what is happening at the present time.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the effect upon wages is minimal, and the effect upon wage applications is minimal for the simple reason that so often one man's increase in wages is another man's unemployment. It is only when the two things affect the same man that there is any relationship whatever that has any meaning. In consequence it is expected that despite the strict monetary policy of the Government, earnings will rise by a further 16 per cent. in 1980 and a further 14 per cent. in 1981. In the meantime the effect upon the economy is, and is going to be, devasting. For example, it is expected that in the next two years the gross domestic product will decline by 9 per cent. compared with the peak of 1978&#x2014;a decline of 9 per cent. from 1978, in a period of two years.<lb/>
It takes time to adjust to this decline in output. First of all overheads continue as before. Secondly, manning continues if not indefinitely, certainly for a period, and overmanning can be expensive. But of course in the end there is a shake-out and there is unemployment. It is expected that because of this fall in the GDP in the next two years there will be a gradual shake-out and unemployment will rise to 2.5 million by mid-1981. Many of these 2.5 million will be people who have never worked, and at the other end there will be many who will never work again. It is a very sad prospect.<lb/>
In the meantime the proceeds of North Sea oil are being used not to help our economy, but to fuel the economies of
<col>906</col>
Germany, France, Japan and the other countries from whom we are importing goods. They are getting the benefit of the proceeds from the North Sea oil&#x2014;not our economy. But even after using the North Sea oil proceeds to pay for imports, it is estimated that in the present year we shall have a deficit on current account of &#x00A3;3,000 million. It is further estimated that this deficit will be &#x00A3;3,500 million in 1980, and it will be 1981 before it becomes less than &#x00A3;1,000 million.<lb/>
That is the devastating effect upon our economy that we can receive from present policies in the next two years. In the meantime the effect upon inflation is expected to be negligible. It is anticipated that inflation will rise to a peak of 19 per cent. in the spring of next year. This is pretty generally accepted, even by the Government themselves, I think. From then onwards it will decline, but in 1981 it is likely to be in the region of 13 per cent. In the meantime, the high rate of interest is attracting money into short-term uses, and consequently we have less long-term investment in the private sector. It is estimated that investment in the private sector will decline by 5 per cent. in 1980, and by another 4 per cent. in 1981. That is a sorry picture, and that is the picture we have to look forward to for the next two years.<lb/>
I would accept that monetary policy is an essential element in the control of the economy, but I do not accept that inflation can be controlled by it alone. I believe that to try to control it by monetary policy alone is leading us to disaster. Even if we could cure inflation by the control of the money supply alone, it would take a very long time, and because it would take a long time the damage to the economy would be great and the bitterness left behind would be deep.<lb/>
Britain can be a prosperous country, but not with free-for-all, but with a conscious and deliberate attempt to cooperate, involving restraint not only by trade unionists but by all concerned. Now I am not calling for a rigid, temperate incomes policy. That is inappropriate, I believe, but as I indicated when I spoke in the debate on the Queen's Speech, I consider that we should have a permanent, but flexible, policy.<lb/>
I believe that we should have a national body, on which the trade unions, employers
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0462"/>
<col>907</col>
and Government are represented, which lays down, not a norm but guidelines to be followed by negotiators and conciliators. I also believe that there should be an attempt to get both sides of industry to agree that before they take industrial action they will negotiate; that if they fail in their negotiations they will be prepared to conciliate; that at the end of the conciliation period (which should be relatively short; it should not be a delaying device) the conciliator should report, and that report should be circulated to all concerned; and that there should be a ballot before there is a strike.<lb/>
My Lords, you cannot get that from the trade union movement without being prepared to pay some price for it, but it is worth a considerable price because it is the key to the situation. You will get better industrial relations in this country, and you will get more confidence, more investment and greater productivity. It is the key. It is more important than a reduction in taxation. I have always taken that view, and I still take it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01904"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord be so kind as to allow me to interrupt him? I am most grateful. Would he not agree, though, that those who are in the trade union movement and who, like the noble Lord and myself, wish to see improved industrial relations are the same people who are calling, and have been calling, for reduced taxation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01905"><member>Lord JACQUES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not want to deal with the subject of taxation, but I mentioned it so I think I must answer the question. As I said when I spoke in the debate on the Queen's Speech&#x2014;and this was before the Budget&#x2014;I would accept a moderate transfer from direct to indirect taxation; but, of course, I regard what happened in the Budget as an immoderate transfer. I believed there was a case for a moderate transfer.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the price has got to be paid. It is inevitable that trade unionists will say, "What about prices and profits?" They said that to a Labour Government, and they would say that to any Government. I am not saying that we should go back and have all the paraphernalia of price and profit control that
<col>908</col>
we have had in the last few years, put I think there are changes which could be made which would go at least some part of the way. For example, I think we ought to change corporation tax. I believe that, when dealing with corporation tax, the profits assessed should be related to the value of the assets employed in the business, and that the tax should be graduated. In that way high profits, excessive profits, would be subject to a higher rate of tax. Many noble Lords on the other side of the House will put up their hands and say, "This is quite impossible", but that is the kind of price you will have to pay if you want to win the confidence and support of trade unionists&#x2014;and, my Lords, I suggest that it is a price that will be well worth paying. </membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01906">7.24 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01907"><member>Lord SELSDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have just realised that if the pattern of previous speakers were repeated I would be in the very privileged position of congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Jacques, upon a maiden speech. It has indeed been a great pleasure to listen to maiden speeches of this sort, and to have the assurance that the House of Lords has, I suppose, a peerless or a glorious future! But in speaking today I recall advice that Lloyd George once gave to Harold Macmillan after Harold Macmillan's maiden speech. He called him up to his room and he said, "When you speak from the Back-Benches, make one point and make it as many times as you like. It is only when you are Prime Minister that you may have the luxury of making two".<lb/>
My Lords, I propose to make two points. They are not new points, but points I have made before. Inspired by the noble Lord the Leader of the House, who spoke of industry and enterprise, I am going to be sufficiently enterprising to try to pass a message to the octopus of Government through the mediation of that honest broker of wit and wisdom, the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie. To him I would say that I should like to give him some advice, and if, through the chain of the octopus of Government, he can pass it back to the Mekon, I shall be very grateful to him.<lb/>
The two points I seek to raise&#x2014;and there are many one could choose&#x2014;are, first, international, and, secondly, domes

tic. The Government of the day have taken steps which innumerable collective bodies urged them to take. They have been surprised, when they have taken these steps, that many of them have not been warmly received, whether it be a reduction in Government spending, a reduction in taxation or a removal of exchange control. Often the support that they would have anticipated they would get from the historic and traditional Conservatives has not been forthcoming. I do not believe that the reason is because there is not such support, for the Government have done almost everything one could have hoped they would do; but perhaps they have failed to recognise that if you wish to change the course of a river or reverse its flow, or stop a water wheel, there has to be the elapse of a period of time. It is only the great American nation which ever succeeded in making one river run backwards&#x2014;the Chicago River.<lb/>
My Lords, the French have a lovely saying. I think I would lead into it by pointing out that, recently, we who are not in Government&#x2014;the private sector, or even large public sector bodies&#x2014;have come to rely too much upon Government to lead us. We blame Government when things go wrong. Suddenly Government turn round and say, "You must lead us". The French say, "<i>On ne doit pas mettre le chariot avant le boeuf". </i> The Government have caught us all by surprise. They have perhaps done too much too quickly. I do not think they have done too much, but it may be that they have done it too quickly, and may be the great British people in the private sector are not yet ready to accept the trust and the glory the Government are willing to bestow upon them.<lb/>
This leads me to try to draw some conclusions as to what might happen as a result of the Government's current policies. First, their restriction of spending. We are, whichever way we look, moving towards the father and mother of all recessions, unless certain things happen. There is to be a world recession. A reduction in Government spending reduces demand, in the United Kingdom perhaps to a far greater extent than one would have anticipated because of the high level of Government spending. That reduction in demand reduces the incentive to invest,
<col>910</col>
and thus industry steadily becomes more and more out-dated.<lb/>
At the same time, we are faced with a world recession which could, among OECD or developed countries, reduce demand abroad; and, not wishing in any way to propound the themes of Keynes, I think there is a case, when we are planning to reduce our consumption abroad at a greater rate than world recession might force upon us, for seeing whether there are opportunities around the world where the demand for British goods and services could be increased. I submit that there are. There is going to be no real growth in the developed world, but there will be growth in the developing world. In order to benefit from that growth in the developing world, industry needs the support of Government. This may not be necessarily large volumes of financial support, but to remove the BBC French service when we really ought to be going all out to sell in French West Africa, to reduce aid at a time when little bits of aid can give the British an entry into a project or contract which otherwise might be denied to us, is in my view wrong.<lb/>
I think that if the Government were to give more consideration to the potential of these Third World countries and to their desire to industrialise, we might be able to some extent to compensate for the reductions in expenditure at home, and thus not fall too far behind our major industrial competitors. Because we have the situation where recession is coming, and our own Government action&#x2014;the right action&#x2014;of reducing expenditure will accelerate the rate at which that recession hits us, and will delay our ability to recover when the world moves out of it.<lb/>
Further, my Lords, in many of these Third World countries, particularly in the Commonwealth, there is an overwhelming amount of goodwill towards the British. It may be so in Africa&#x2014;and the goodwill towards us in Africa will grow markedly if my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is successful in his negotiations, as we hope and believe he will be. We have a situation where Government across the board are cutting expenditure. This is right; but I hope they are perhaps cutting more than they would wish and may be thereby in a position to reinforce certain sectors at a later date. I come back to the question of the need for aid linked with

trade to support and encourage development in the Third World. We do not need large amounts of money, but we need to recognise that the Government should be active.<lb/>
My second point is a domestic one. It relates to taxation. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer cut taxation. I think (and world opinion is) that he did right. He removed exchange controls; and he did right on that so long as there may be a stable pound. But the policies of the Government will take a long time to work. Thus, we need from the Government a strong assurance that they intend to be in power for the next 10 years. Without that assurance, people may be concerned about the stop-go of economic policies. Having reversed the flow of the river, unless the next Government, if they are not a Conservative Government, wish to do the same thing, we will all have wasted our time. But, at home, the Government say to the people: "We have given you a free hand. We have given you tax reductions which should provide incentives." My Lords, these tax reductions will not provide incentives. Most people believe that they are entitled to a fair rate of taxation and have been so entitled for a long time. Therefore, they think that the position is now about right; so that it is not necessarily an incentive for the future.<lb/>
We forget that the bulk of the people in this country who are to regenerate and revitalise industry are not in the organisations which might be described by the collective nouns; the trade union movement, the CBI, the large corporations or in Government. They are the people who wish to start building their own businesses. Thus, I ask the Government to give immediate attention not to increase or reduce the level of tax but to shift the emphasis of tax; that is, let us examine who pays tax. Industry is not very profitable at the moment. At the CBI conference someone said that the real profitability is only 3 per cent. The Government wish to encourage profitability and then to receive revenue from that profitability by taxing profits.<lb/>
At the moment the situation is extraordinarily unfair where the leading 500 companies in the United Kingdom pay an
<col>912</col>
average rate of tax well below the corporation tax that is stated; and yet they complain about it. Whereas the man in the medium-sized business, with no ability to take into account all the concessions made by the Government to offset his taxes or defer them, is faced with a high level of tax. It is true, too, that tax from companies has been relatively low in terms of the total tax take. It is under 20 per cent. I think that it was only under the stewardship of the noble Viscount, Lord Amory, that the amount of taxation paid by individuals fell.<lb/>
I am not arguing about income tax on people who are employed by large bodies and corporations. I am arguing in favour of a move to remove taxation totally, or to reduce it effectively, from people who are struggling to start their own businesses and who are faced with high interest rates and all the difficulties that go with that situation. At the moment more people wish to start businesses than at any time in the last 10 years. That, I believe, is a direct result of the Government's action. But they are faced with difficulties. They start a business, they build it and after they have made a profit, after the first year or so, their accountant says, "You are going to have to pay some tax. Why not buy a new car or a new van?" They usually answer, "We like our old car; we would rather put the money into the business". But, because of the high level of corporation tax, they are advised that they should do something to offset their taxes. They have not generally paid themselves big salaries and perhaps they wish to pay a dividend. It is often a husband-and-wife business. Then they must pay a high level of taxation, even at the reduced rates, on the dividends that they pay.<lb/>
There is a strange thing about people who start and own their businesses. They actually wish to put money back in the business. We spend all our lives encouraging the large organisations to put their money into expansion and we make rules and regulations to encourage them to do so; but the individual has a wish to build his own business. We suffer from too many collective nouns, too many big bodies. I looked up, before making my speech&#x2014;and I always deliberately leave my notes at home&#x2014;the Latin for the collective noun for a gaggle of geese; but I could not find it in the Library. Nor
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0465"/>
<col>913</col>
could I find an English-Greek or English-Latin dictionary. It may be that some noble Lord after I have sat down can advise me. But it is a problem of collectivism.<lb/>
I would urge the Government to pursue the course on which I have tried to set them. Perhaps the next Budget could make a major attempt, probably to reduce the overall level of corporation tax but to encourage the large corporations to be more profitable and to pay more tax, and to encourage the smaller companies to pay nil or less tax provided they plough the money back into the business. Those are simply my two points. I thought that I would "have a go" at my noble friend Lord Gowrie, because private enterprise has some ability. So I thought that in this speech I would give him due notice that I propose to use all the resources, although limited, available to rile to take up those two issues at greater length; hoping, therefore, that if eminent men&#x2014;far more so than I could hope to be&#x2014;were to write to give advice to the Government, they would gain support from the Government, particularly bearing in mind the words of my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft, who said that the Government are willing and eager to accept outside advice. I hope that they will accept mine.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01909"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like first to add my congratulations to the four maiden speakers, the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, and three of my former colleagues in the House of Commons: the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, with whom I served in the European Parliament; the noble Lord, Lord Irving, who is a neighbour of mine in North Kent and the noble Lord, Lord Lever. Lord Lever and I have something still in common after all this time out of the House of Commons. It is that he still makes erudite speeches on finance and I still cannot understand them.<lb/>
My Lords, I think the problem with this debate is the fact that it is very cynical&#x2014;as, I believe, the Conservative Party were very cynical during the last General Election. I do not necessarily want to fight the last General Election over again; particularly in view of the fact that we lost it. Nevertheless, I<lb/>
<col>914</col>
should like to point out one or two things where I think the Conservative Party were dishonest&#x2014;and I use the word advisedly. And not only were they in this category but the <i>Daily Mail</i> and other national newspapers fell into that category.<lb/>
They are saying now, "We have a mandate for this. It was in our manifesto." We have to allow for the fact that the electorate sometimes take politicians at their word. But I do not think that the electorate were quite aware of what these cuts were intended to be and where the cuts were going to take place. Everybody thinks that public expenditure is wasted public expenditure unless it is spent in the area in which they are involved. Everybody wants there to be cuts; but if the cuts affect them, they say that it is not wasted public expenditure. We must be aware of that. Nevertheless I do not think that the public were fully informed by the Conservative Party of what exactly was going to happen.<lb/>
I say this in the knowledge of what the <i>Daily Mail</i> printed at the end of April&#x2014;which was known as "Labour's dirty dozen" which was a denial by the <i>Daily Mail</i> which they said came from the Conservative Central Office. Recently they were taken to the Press Council on this matter. I think that the Press Council behaved disgracefully in this matter in reply to the allegations made against them. But, having said that, there were 12 statements which they claimed the Labour Party had made and which the Conservative Party had categorically denied as being true. One of them, the most sensitive one, was the question of prescription charges. The Labour Party said that the Conservative Party would be raising prescription and health charges. Not only did Mrs. Thatcher deny this, which is fair enough&#x2014;or the Conservative Party with Mrs. Thatcher&#x2014;and Mrs. Thatcher nailed her colours to the mast, but when she did this I am assuming that she meant it.<lb/>
What have we had? Not just one increase in prescription charges but two within 12 months of them taking office. Whether the <i>Daily, Mail </i> says that is one of Labour's dirty dozen or not is another matter; but I think that the Conservative Party ought to be fully aware that that was a lie when they denied it and they have in fact increased the charges subsequently.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0466"/>
<col>915</col>
Regarding value added tax, our Prime Minister at that time, Jim Callaghan, said that the Conservative Party would be doubling VAT. To be fair to the Conservative Party, they did not double VAT. They took it from 8 per cent. to 15 per cent., and, even though I am not an Einstein, realise that there is 1 per cent. difference. Nevertheless, it was a denial and it would take a smart mathematician to say that that is not almost double. I think that they misled the British public in this direction.<lb/>
The selling off of various parts of British industry was again denied. Do not just take my denial, look at the <i>Daily Mail</i> for 26th April, and see on this House's own check-list where those denials have been abrogated. They are intending to sell off parts of British industry, which they denied; and also consider the health and prescription charges and VAT.<lb/>
That is not just unfortunate for the Conservative Party, but it is unfortunate for politicians generally. People then say: "You are all the same; we cannot believe politicians". It raises cynicism about politicians from everybody. The Conservative Party has a lot to answer for. The recent cuts are measures that hit the poorest, those least able to protect themselves in our community. Just look through them again on the check-list, things like school meals. The Minister in the other House responsible for education in his speech on Monday said that there are children who "flog" their free school meal tickets. I would have thought that, with the attitude of this Government, they were in favour of entrepreneurs. Those who "flog" off meal tickets are a minimal number, so do we have to cut school meals because somebody has done that?<lb/>
School milk and school transport charges are things that affect the hardest hit in our community anyway. Those who get the tax cuts from the Chancellor's recent Budget in our community are not affected by the question of school buses or school meals. Those that do not get a tax cut because they are earning too little are the ones who have to suffer, and they have to suffer with the increase of from 8 per cent. to 15 per cent. in VAT. Again it is hitting those in the poverty trap.<lb/>
The Government's recent Education Bill (No. 2) they say is going to give a
<col>916</col>
wider choice to children. The Government know that is not true. They know that there are schools known as "sink" schools to which people do not want to send their children, but they are going to be forced to do so because the Government will not close the school down and enlarge another school.<lb/>
I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, is not in his place because I shall attack him slightly. He attacked the ILEA, he attacked Lambeth Council and various other councils, all Labour councils. He did not attack Kent County Council, who are responsible for the education of my children and are I think one of the least progressive councils in the country. That is where we ought to be looking. If we are talking about one nation, one society, let us cover the whole of our nation and society rather than just individual labour councils that he was prepared to attack. When we are in the midst of all these cuts and we are talking about sharing out among all of us, they decide that they are going to have special places for bright children, that they are going to spend by the middle of the 1980s, I presume&#x2014;certainly they have denied that it will be very soon&#x2014;something like &#x00A3;70 million on this scheme for 15,000 children, and we are told that everybody else has to cut. Those in the poorer authorities, or those who have average children, are not the ones who are going to get the benefit. If we are going to spread our resources, if we have to believe what the Conservative Party and the Government say, we have to share the responsibilities and hardships if we are going to have these problems.<lb/>
Just after the General Election campaign, when Sir Geoffrey Howe made his post-Budget speech on how great a Budget it was for all of us, he started talking on 12th June about giving everybody some real incentive again to show those people, managers, doctors, skilled workers and even pop stars who are going to work abroad that it is worth while coming back to Britain to stay here. If "pop stars". means Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck, I am not all that keen. Nevertheless, thought that Freddy Laker would have had air charters by the dozen fetching all these people hack.<lb/>
One of the reasons that a lot of people go abroad is in many cases they get
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0467"/>
<col>917</col>
overpaid. Pop stars go to the United States because they can earn more than in Britain. It is nothing to do with tax. They can appear for a week in Las Vegas or on a coast-to-coast hook-up that earns them much more. It is kidding people to say that the taxation system is causing problems, and causing people to leave the country. For doctors in the United States it is not a question of taxation; but the make-up of their health service, practitioners and specialists means that they earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is nothing to do with how much they are taxed. It is basically how much they can and do earn. People have been misled in this direction.<lb/>
We have had almost every speaker from the Conservative Benches attacking in one way or another the trade unions. They seem to think that trade unionists are some little group, 50 people or something, without accepting that it is half of our working population that they are talking about. It is this continual attempt to divide one half of the working population from the other. If one accepts that it is a half of our working population, it is acceptable that it is half of our population involved with trade unionists whether they are the husbands, wives, or children of trade unionists. There is this constant division. The CBI, in their conference this week, were making some most primitive speeches about the closed shop. If they want to legislate on the closed shop, that is fair enough. I hope that when they are legislating on the closed shop, they will look at some of the professions like lawyers and doctors who operate a pretty fair closed shop, a pretty decent closed shop. You try and operate in those professions without being a member of what is their appropriate trade union. I am a trade unionist and I have been an active one all my life and I wish that I received their fees. This is one of the points about this division, dividing one from the other.<lb/>
If we want to talk about the closed shop&#x2014;and the Conservatives are very keen on this&#x2014;I should like to see in any legislation that they bring in&#x2014;and all the noises they and the CBI are making are moving towards legislation&#x2014;some method devised so that if somebody does not want to pay their union dues and get involved in trade unions, then they do not get the benefits of that trade union activity. It is not fair
<col>918</col>
that people should give their contribution to a trade union and they fight, work and, indeed, go on strike to get their rights, and then they find that somebody who has not contributed, not taken any part, gets the same benefits. It is all right for the Conservative Party and anti-trade unionists to attack trade unionists. But, in my view&#x2014;and I have no doubt that it will be contradicted&#x2014;trade unionists have played the major part in altering conditions in British industry in terms of pay and holiday entitlement. However, what happens is that most of the non-trade union industry follows on the coat-tails of the benefits that trade unionists receive.<lb/>
Neither management or the CBI have been criticised in this debate&#x2014;it has all been "Britain's problems are the result of trade union activity". I think the Conservative Party have to look at the divisiveness they are creating. Another area where the Prime Minister is creating divisiveness is in foreign affairs. She has been named "Iron Lady" by the Soviet Union and she seems to want to live up to that tradition. She seems to be wanting to create troubles and arguments between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. I do not know what she thinks that will achieve, but this is again part of the divisive approach which the Conservative Party has in regard to not only problems in this country but foreign affairs. Indeed, if she wants to use an element of propaganda against the Soviet Union or against communism I am surprised that they have cut the BBC's External Services. It seems to me that the weapon of propaganda by the human voice, whether to Greece, France or Italy, is very powerful. It is very interesting to me that she makes these very aggressive speeches&#x2014;and I have no doubt that Mr. Brezhnev and one or two others rarely get a wink of sleep at night over all this&#x2014;but then, on the other hand, cuts down the External Services of the BBC, which I think have made a valuable contribution.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peart, said that we were again getting the two-nation syndrome. I think that is absolutely right. If you look at the nation, you see a nation which is divided politically. We have in the South of England, for instance, 160-odd constituencies, of which only 12 are Labour and the rest Conservative or Liberal. I do not think that is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0468"/>
<col>919</col>
good for democracy. Certainly I want to see a change, because there are only 12 Labour seats. Having said that, the sort of policies now being dreamed up by the Conservative Party will continue this division of the nation not only between the North and South but between trade unionists and non-trade unionists.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Soames&#x2014;I think it was he&#x2014;mentioned that foreigners do not buy our cars any more. Looking in the Lords' car park, it seems there are not many noble Lords who buy them; and I think you have to say that people ought to be supporting our car-makers because they are telling everybody else to support British industry. I think this Government have to make a realistic reappraisal of their present policies and certainly a realistic reappraisal of the White Paper, and come back to the people of Britain and say: "We have thought again and we are going to change it".</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01911"><member>Lord SPENS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join in congratulating our maiden speakers today and in particular to support the noble Lord, Lord Irving of Dartford, both in his plea for better roads to the South-East, and also in what he said about the technological revolution brought about by micro-electronics which is now upon us. In a debate in June, I predicted that unemployment would rise to some 3 million by 1984&#x2014;and I believe that the noble Lord would have supported me in that prediction&#x2014;unless something very drastic is done very quickly. I said then I did not believe that ordinary market forces would solve this problem, however freed from Government controls they may have become. This needs a speedy but thorough review of the alternatives that are available. Your Lordships may remember that I rather stuck my neck out and suggested that a partial and temporary solution might be to persuade married women not to take paid employment. Such persuasion, of course, would have to be financial.<lb/>
As unemployment increases there will be large numbers of people receiving sizeable redundancy payments, and it must be the Government's intention to encourage these people to invest their new capital in some form of business which will
<col>920</col>
allow them to make use of the skills they have learnt and practised in their former employment. So every encouragement must be given to these people to set up small businesses of their own. There are a lot of obstacles still in the way of small businesses. There are still far too many restrictions in the Employment Protection Acts. There are too many planning restrictions which will prevent people from working in and from their own homes, which I think is very important in these days of need to conserve energy. I hope we shall see more relaxation in those fields, but it must be made quickly in this Session; next Session may be too late.<lb/>
The problem facing anyone who decides to start up his own business must be this Ought he or she to become self-employed, alone or in partnership, or ought he or she to start up a small company? The latter is expensive and requires the use of experts to keep the books and prepare annual returns to the Registrar of Companies. Why should directors' and auditors' reports have to be filed annually in such detail for new and very small businesses? That all costs money which would be far better employed as working capital. The owners of the company will not be able to benefit from the profits earned until dividends can be declared. But the great advantage of a company is that the directors can pay themselves salaries charged against tax and, in particular, can protect themselves through their National Insurance contributions for unemployment benefit if the company should collapse.<lb/>
Becoming self-employed also has its snags, the most important one perhaps being that the owner is no longer protected for unemployment benefit: nor can he or she charge out his or her work against tax. When a self-employed person does make a profit he or she faces various tax assessments, and the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, dealt with most of those very eloquently. I should like to add one more, and that is the Class IV National Insurance contribution. That, my Lords, I think is an iniquitous tax on the self-employed. I tried, through the Printed Paper Office, to get hold of a copy of NP 18 of 1979, which describes this tax. They told me they have not any. However, I did find one in the Library and had it photo-copied. That gives the reason for this tax. I say it is a tax and not an
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0469"/>
<col>921</col>
insurance contribution, because the persons who pay it obtain no additional benefit whatsoever from paying that Class IV contribution. The reason, according to this pamphlet, is:
<quote>&#x2026;to ensure that the self-employed as a whole pay a fair share of the cost of pensions and other National Insurance Benefits without the lower earners amongst them having to pay excessively high flat rate Class II contributions".</quote>
So what in effect is happening is that those self-employed who are making a bit of a success of their business are carrying the can for their not-so-successful competitors.<lb/>
The tax starts at a profit of over &#x00A3;2,250 which, converted to wages&#x2014;your Lordships must remember that the self-employed cannot charge against tax any drawings that they take&#x2014;works out at just less than &#x00A3;44 a week. On a profit of &#x00A3;4,000 in the year, which works out at about &#x00A3;76 a week, a self-employed person would have to pay &#x00A3;87&#x00B7;50 in this tax, as well as having to pay the normal income tax on that profit&#x2014;a profit which includes the full cost of his or her own labour. Surely, this is a tax which ought to be abolished at once.<lb/>
Another snag, which affects both small companies and the self-employed, is value added tax. The present threshold for compulsory registration for VAT is a turnover of &#x00A3;10,000 per annum&#x2014;turnover, not profit. No small business is going to earn very much for the company or the self-employed person with a turnover of that amount. Even a turnover of &#x00A3;75,000 a year is not going to earn more than something between &#x00A3;4,000 and &#x00A3;5,000 net profit. So that nearly every new small business is going to have to cope with value added tax.<lb/>
I make a very small living out of looking after the VAT and income tax returns of a few small businesses, and I want to say this. The people who come to me do not have a clue as to how they should cope with VAT. They throw all their papers at me and leave me to organise what should be done. A business with a turnover of about &#x00A3;70,000 a year&#x2014;that is, a corner shop&#x2014;will probably have something like 1,200 receipts which must be recorded for VAT, and of course the returns have to be filled in fairly promptly once every quarter.<lb/>
<col>922</col>
The report of the Customs and Excise for 1977&#x2013;78 gave us some very significant figures on VAT and its collection. The net revenue raised by the tax was &#x00A3;4,234 million, raised from 1,274,000 traders. Of these, 881,000 traders had a turnover of less than &#x00A3;50,000 per annum and contributed between them only &#x00A3;190 million. Another 178,000 traders had turnovers between &#x00A3;50,000 and &#x00A3;100,000 per annum, and contributed another &#x00A3;140 million between them. So that more than I million traders out of the 1&#x00BC; million&#x2014;that is, five-sixths of the traders in 1977&#x2013;78&#x2014;had turnovers of less than &#x00A3;100,000 and contributed between them less than 8 per cent. of the total net receipts.<lb/>
Here, surely, is an area where the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, could put in his cutters. Raise the threshold of VAT to &#x00A3;100,000 and five-sixths of those registered for VAT will disappear, leaving about a quarter of a million who will earn and return nearly &#x00A3;4,000 million. I believe that that, too, is something that should be done, and done quickly. So I ask the Government to give further help to small businesses in three areas&#x2014;simplify the procedures for small companies; abolish the Class IV National Insurance contribution; and raise the VAT threshold to &#x00A3;100,000.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01913"><member>Lord CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of the advantages of being a later intervener in this debate is that at least one has the pleasure of congratulating three old colleagues, and I hope one new friend, on their maiden speeches. With my three old colleagues and comrades&#x2014;"comrades" is a word that I am not ashamed to use, even in this House&#x2014;I have shared platforms from Muswell Hill Broadway to the Parliament of Europe. I have a particular regard for my leader in Europe, my noble friend Lord Stewart, who I believe, with others, is bound to make a very valuable contribution to the discussions in this House.<lb/>
I also want to congratulate the Conservative Party on their good sense in staging a debate of this kind, because I cannot believe, despite his distinction, that the mover of this debate was entirely acting without consultation with his old colleagues. It has, of course, been a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0470"/>
<col>923</col>
liberal education in economics, and I use the word in the plural because we have had so many economics and economists, both professional and amateur, and I shall understand a little of what some of them said when I read the <i>Official Report</i> tomorrow morning. I do not mean to follow them into the labyrinth of economic theory, because it is much more important to reiterate some of the things which have been said in this debate, and which deserve an answer from the Government spokesman who will be replying.<lb/>
As we all know, the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, is well equipped to defend his own case on this, and I want particularly to direct his attention to one or two points which were mentioned earlier. But, more especially, I want to ask him whether there are any inconsistencies which we can expect from the Government, because up till now the basis of our complaint must be that the Government have been consistent in attempting in office to do what they promised in the Conservative Manifesto at the election. I am very sincere in saying that, because I believe that honesty in politics does pay, and it was not complete honesty which sent the Conservative Party to the Benches opposite. We, on our part, believe that the planned diversion of resources, which, by and large, was explicitly spelled out in the Election Manifesto, amounted to turning the governmental back on the time-honoured analyses of Beveridge and of Keynes, whose gospel had received almost general acceptance in most strata of our society. Properly interpreted, I believe that that is what was said in the White Paper last week. Beveridge is over; Keynes is over. We have different values now with which to establish ourselves&#x2014;hence these proposals.<lb/>
At the General Election, "So what?" said the electorate when on all sides the Labour Party pointed out the disasters, as they saw them, which would happen when the new philosophy of what is called "Thatcherism" was applied. Numbed, as we believe, by rising prices and rising unemployment, the British electorate committed the offence which has enabled us to present the charge sheet of the misdoings of this Government. The date on that charge sheet is not the date of the White Paper but the date of the election. Far be it from me to deplore in
<col>924</col>
this assembly how the other House got its majority, but one is shocked, when one examines the White Paper, by the intentions of the Party opposite. One is shocked at how much the White Paper differs in some particulars from what was advocated by the Conservative Party leadership during April.<lb/>
I have said, that, by and large, the Government are fulfilling their promises&#x2014;to the great disadvantage, I think, of this country's industrial health and economic future. There are three matters to which attention was drawn earlier in the debate, and I believe that some justification ought to be vouchsafed to us by the Front Bench opposite. To cut matters short, may I mention that the dismal three which seem to me to flag the retreat from the caring State are, first, the threat of still further increases in prescription charges; second, the curtailment of funds for school meals and transport services and, third, the abandonment of the Ministry of Overseas Development to the Foreign Office, about which such misgivings were so rightly expressed yesterday by your Lordships.<lb/>
These three proposals share the same disagreeable nature of attempting to save national money at the expense of those least able to repair the injuries that they will receive and also of being wholly obscured during the propaganda of the last election. The White Paper proposals regarding prescription charges justify the fears of the great Aneurin Bevan when he fathered the National Health Scheme: that no matter how small the initial charge you impose for any of its services, you dislodge a pebble which will quickly start an avalanche. We have seen that he was right, because of the other threats that there are to impair the free nature of the service. It is said, in effect, that we are now to pay 14 times as much as was originally imposed at the beginning of the service. No amount of inflation can justify such an imposition.<lb/>
The second indictment upon which the Government must stand alone in the dock is that of attempting to save &#x00A3;240 million on kids' meals and school buses. To my mind, this is both inhuman and socially unwise. It is hard for the more fortunate members of this House to realise what a fundamental change was brought about by the school bus and free school meals, especially in the British countryside.<lb/>

May I impose upon your Lordships a personal memory. When I was first at school, aged five, in the village of Sunning-well near Oxford, I remember, without fully comprehending it at the time, how astonished I was, while sitting in the class damp through rain but at least fed upon lovingly prepared sandwiches, that other children&#x2014;such was the poverty in those days&#x2014;were sitting wet and unfed while learning lists of the rivers of Africa and the Kings of England and that at lunch time they should sit around me hoping that if there was something disagreeable to my palate in the sandwiches I would share them. Memories like that make socialists. I am unashamed that when I went hack to Sunningwell as a Labour Candidate in a by-election and stood against the late Airey Neave, people came up to me and said, "Thank God that things have changed since those days, Ted". How much I agree with them. This is why I feel angry that there should be a new attempt to put back the clock.<lb/>
The third matter I want to mention is the micro-chip. The House deserves a full explanation from the Government regarding their default. We are all acquainted with what was said earlier this week in the <i>Financial Times.</i> There is no doubt whatever that this industry, upon which we place so much reliance in our attempt to regain our industrial health, has been very scurvily treated on account of the Government's doctrinaire adherence to their belief that handouts should not be given to industry.<lb/>
In conclusion, may I thank the proposer of the Motion, and, I assume, those people who bear responsibility for it on the Government Front Bench for having, as they will have seen, completely united what was supposed to be a disunited party. We are utterly and completely united in our condemnation of at least those three matters which I have raised and, I believe, of the Government's general strategy as revealed in the White Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01915"><member>Earl DE LA WARR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, for giving us the opportunity to have this debate at such an opportune moment. We have been enabled to have a wide-ranging discussion about the
<col>926</col>
difficulties and opportunities facing this country, and we have been enabled to listen to a brilliant exposition by the noble Lord, Lord Soames, on what the Government are doing and the philosophies that lie behind their policies.<lb/>
We have had a chance to see something of what lies on both sides of the watershed which it seems to me that this country is approaching: On the one side a resurgence in productivity and a return to an increase in prosperity, and on the other side the possibility of massive unemployment and a real fall in our standard of living. A frightening situation? Yes, it is, and it is enormously to the credit of this Government that they are not hesitating to tell the country in the starkest terms of the economic and social perils that beset us all. It is essential that they should go on doing so, particularly if things get worse, and worse I fear they will get. Simple statements are needed about productivity and the results of failing to improve it; warnings about the damage of paying ourselves more than we can afford and the terrible dangers of inflation ; the vital part that profits play in reinvestment; the effect of strikes upon the maintenance of people's jobs. These are simple lessons, my Lords, but ones which I believe are still very far from being accepted, or indeed understood, by millions of people in this country and I have to say, with reluctance and with regret, that it is not unnatural that this should be so because seldom, if ever, are these lessons taught by the trade union leaders and seldom, if ever, by the Labour Party.<lb/>
I have just come back from the CBI conference in Birmingham, and a most encouraging conference it was. Noble Lords may have seen in the media some of the more dramatic parts, but the significance of the conference lay in its whole mood and it is about that that I want to say a few words tonight. There was a mood of intense gratitude that at last we had a Government that was engaged in setting industry free. There was a mood of certainty that the new policies would be further developed and, moreover, that they would be adhered to. Certainly there was no euphoria. Indeed, there was what I would describe as almost a "hair shirt" mood among some who felt and admitted that too often in the past management had abrogated its functions to the Government on the one
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0472"/>
<col>927</col>
hand, and to the unions on the other. I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Nugent of Guildford, refer to that.<lb/>
The need for more direct communication between management and their staff was a message that came through with a bell-like clarity. I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, refer to that earlier in the debate. To be sure, there was a determination that industry and Government between them should set about redressing the balance between management and the unions; but let me emphasise&#x2014;and emphasise very strongly&#x2014;that there was no call for confrontation. The word "confrontation" was never used, nor was any speech made in which there was any sign that this was the feeling that existed. It was a call for the strengthening of the hand of management.<lb/>
The reception of the CBI initiative in setting up a strike fund was seen&#x2014;and in my opinion rightly seen&#x2014;as an imaginative move by industry to help itself, and this again was something that ran through the conference. But very evident was the view that the Government had a vital part to play in redressing the balance of power. The voting on the need for agreements to be legally binding, the vote against the closed shop (which took place rather to the dismay of the platform), were both manifestations of this view, and speaker after speaker spoke of the affront to personal freedom implied by the closed shop. I believe that there was a feeling&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, referred to this&#x2014;among the delegates that possibly the CBI was not advising the Government to be as strong as they, the delegates, would have wished. This came through very clearly, and I hope that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment will take considerable note of what was said at that conference.<lb/>
Because it was my intention to give your Lordships the general spirit of things, in summing up the attitude of the conference not to itself but to the Government, I think I can do no better than to quote very briefly from a speech of one senior delegate as he summed up at the end of one of the sessions of the day. He said:
<quote>" Let our message to the Government be this. You have made a start sorting out our taxation
<col>928</col>
system. Keep at it. Make it worth while to invest, to take risks, to expand and to work hard. Keep spelling out the economic facts of life because it will help us to communicate that information to our workforce. You have shown this country and the world that we have a Government of courage and spirit, that puts heart into us all. We will not like everything you do&#x2014;no one will&#x2014;but above all stand firm on the essentials, and bit by bit you will bring back that essential ingredient to prosperity&#x2014;confidence in ourselves and in our country ".</quote>
I hope that noble Lords will take very special heart in the way that that great body of industralists reacted to the policies and the leadership which they perceived they were getting from this Government.<lb/>
In conclusion, my Lords, I would say just this: I believe&#x2014;and I hope I am not to be accused of being too pessimistic&#x2014;that this country is indeed in fearful danger at this moment, and I believe that it is up to all of us to put it to rights. It will not be done overnight; the way will be long and the way will be hard. Nor can it be done by the Government alone. But I am convinced that under the leadership of our great Prime Minister and her courageous Government it can and, in the end, it will be done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01917"><member>Lord UNDERHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a comparative newcomer to your Lordships' House, I, too, would like to express warm appreciation of the four speeches from the four noble Lords who made their first speeches here this afternoon. I am certain that their collective experience and knowledge is going to be very helpful to the deliberations of this House. May I also thank Lord Thorneycroft for opening this debate, and, not being unfair to him, say that I thoroughly enjoyed his rumbustious speech, which I am certain, again without being unfair, was directed outside this Chamber as well as to those within it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Soames, referred to the lack of emphasis and the lack of serious attention given to the importance of production and to the realities of the situation. I am certain that criticism cannot be levelled at any of the speeches during this debate today. And in case there is any innuendo in his remarks, reference to the Labour Party manifestoes of 1974 and 1979 will make it quite clear that the attention of the nation was
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0473"/>
<col>929</col>
drawn to the seriousness of the situation, and the Labour Government itself took very stern measures, often very unpopular even with our own supporters.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Soames, also referred to consumers' choice and listed various imports that come in. I will not weary your Lordships by going through them, except to say that in the case of most of the things he referred to it is possible to get British made articles, and I hope all your Lordships will ask about those when purchasing anything. My mind goes back to the loss of the motor cycle industry, where we led the world, and yet management&#x2014;and it can only be management&#x2014;allowed the motor-cycle industry to slip completely from British hands, which I think is a thorough disgrace and tragedy for this country. There appears to be general agreement, which I am pleased to note, in criticism of the failure to invest adequately in manufacturing industries. But what I am concerned about is that the Government seem to be leaving this question to hope that there will be improved investment. I would like the Government, seeing that they shy away from intervention, to say how they will help to ensure that the tax reliefs go to investment in our manufacturing industries. We have in mind that on past occasions investment has gone into property speculation and into get-rich-quick candy-floss activities. What will the Government be doing to ensure that that does not happen on this occasion?<lb/>
Referring to the tax cuts, the Government have announced their intention to appoint 600 additional inspectors to check social security abuses. We are told this will save &#x00A3;50 million. I am certain all your Lordships would wish to end any abuse, but surely all abuses. I would ask the noble Earl who is to reply if he would please tell the House what plans the Government have, if any, to deal with tax evasion and tax avoidance, which the authorities tell us run up to some &#x00A3;700 million a year, many times more than the social security cheating. While on the point, I am sure all your Lordships will not wish any check on social security abuses to be at the expense of hitting those who genuinely are entitled to benefits. They must be not given the feeling that they are unworthy in applying for benefits.<lb/>
<col>930</col>
May I remind your Lordships that it is clear that millions will gain little or nothing from the tax reliefs. I would like to draw attention to the speech of the farmworkers' leader over the weekend. He explained that after allowing for tax cuts a family with two children at school in a rural area will be &#x00A3;9 a week worse off due to the doubling of VAT, the extra cost of school travel and school meals, the absence of school milk, and other public service cuts. And, of course, we are heading for a 17 per cent. inflation rate, double the rate when the Labour Government went out of office. Of course we can exhort, but of course people will expect and ask for wage settlements to cope with rising living costs. It is not much use the Government advising workers in nationalised industries and working for local councils that wage increases must be kept down otherwise they will exercise financial control. It is no use doing that while other people are allowed to go ahead, some with complete encouragement and support of the Government.<lb/>
In view of a remark made, I think by the noble Lord, Lord Soames, I would ask how do you estimate the productivity of a nurse, how do you estimate the productivity of most of the council workers? Yet productivity was made a point in this debate. The Government have elected to follow the path of market forces. They cannot divorce wages from market forces if that is what they want. I speak as one who is in favour of incomes policy; I believe it will have to come. But you cannot divorce rising costs from the demands for increased wages. That is why co-operation with the trade unions is so vital and essential. There must not be any suggestion of confrontation. That would be the way to economic disaster.<lb/>
May I echo what my noble friend Lord Murray said. I have been a trade unionist for 47 years, and we trade unionists also have a conscience; we have a conscience about people who will take benefits and not contribute towards getting those benefits. Therefore, conscience must work two ways. The Government must bring the unions into consultation, genuine consultation ; it will not be sufficient, as one union general secretary said at the Labour Party conference, to be summoned in to a Minister and told in a few minutes
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0474"/>
<col>931</col>
what the Government's decision is. That is not consultation. I am pleased to learn the Government share my view. There must be genuine consultation. The workers of this country have a right to be consulted about their future and the future of their families. That is why there is so much anger and anxiety and worry in areas of closures.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, referred to the excessive power of the unions. Well, there is the excessive power of industrial concerns which can close down whole factories without any consultation with the workers. There is this great concern, which one can understand, of the workers in Shotton and in Corby, where we may be heading for 30 per cent. unemployment. It is not much use saying that the workers must go elsewhere to find jobs. If you have got a house and nobody wants to buy it because there is 30 per cent. unemployment you are in a real mess. I think these are things the Government have to consider. That is what the Social Contract was all about. There was cynicism about the Social Contract, but that is what it was all about. To millions of workers the social wage is a supplement to the wage which they draw in their pay packet. That point must be considered.<lb/>
We have referred to the necessity for increased production and I think that we all agree that that is vital. But what we have not heard from the Government is exactly how they propose to achieve it. Again there appears to be a hope. Is Britain to put the clock back? Is Britain to be one of the few industrialised nations that put on one side Government intervention? Countries which have better production than we have; higher wages than we have: and greater investment in manufacturing industries, nevertheless follow the line of governmental intervention. I was pleased to note that, even at the CBI conference this weekend, concern was expressed that the Government are possibly going too far as regards the absence of governmental intervention.<lb/>
The Labour Party accepts that we are in a mixed economy. Of course there must be an efficient and developing private sector. There must be adequate investment and the Government must help to achieve that objective. Equally,
<col>932</col>
there must be a thriving and efficient public sector. Most of the publicly-owned industries are essential to the well-being of this country and without them industry would not function. Why do the Government give the impression that they dislike public industry? Nothing is ordained that things must be produced by private industry. It is a matter of judgment as to whether certain things are best done privately or publicly. No one would think of giving the police forces over to the private security firms. There are many matters which are best left to the public industries to handle.<lb/>
A number of speakers have referred to the fear of recession. What troubles me&#x2014;and I am certain that it troubles many of your Lordships&#x2014;is that many people speak as if we have to wait for the recession and can do nothing about it. I am sufficiently old-fashioned to believe that something can be done about it, but it will require Government activity, Government intervention. I hope, on the grounds of ideological conviction, that the Government will not reject that path.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01918">8.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01919"><member>Lord VERNON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are reaching the end of this debate and I think that I have listened to nearly all the speeches, including the excellent contributions from our four maiden speakers. The debate has certainly given a wide scope for noble Lords opposite to criticise the Government, and indeed it is their duty to do so&#x2014;at least, it is their duty to do so provided the criticism is constructive. It is on that particular issue that I have been somewhat disappointed by their contributions. They have given us rather the same recipe as before, and we know that that recipe is one of failure.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Jacques, to whom I always listen with great attention, suggested that there should be much closer co-operation between the Government and trade unions; that they should work together, and that there should be an incomes policy and so on. But the last Labour Government tried very hard to work with the trade unions. What happened?&#x2014;it was the trade unions that would not work with the Government and they were finally responsible for the Government's defeat at the election. It does not seem
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0475"/>
<col>933</col>
to me that the omens for close-working with the trade unions are very good, unless the trade unions are pepared to modernise their attitudes.<lb/>
There has also been an element of hypocrisy in the criticism, because we all know that the Labour Party, if it had been returned to office, would have cut or made substantial economies in public expenditure; that has been admitted by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Healey. I only hope that some of the speeches that we have heard today are not a prelude to the same Opposition tactics which eventually brought down the Heath Government in 1974. They did the country no good then, and, in the long term, I do not believe that they did the Labour Party any good either. By stoking the fires of inflation it made their task in Government infinitely more difficult.<lb/>
We have heard a great deal about the unfairness of the cuts. None of us likes the cuts, and I for one would have wished them to be more selective. For example, the decision to cut the external services of the BBC seems to me incredibly shortsighted and ill-advised. I hope that it will, in due course, be revoked.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Lever of Manchester, in his interesting maiden speech, referred to the abolition of exchange controls. In the short debate which took place in your Lordships' House last week on that subject, we were informed by the Minister that there would be a saving of &#x00A3;14 million as a result of this measure. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, who was speaking from the Opposition Front Bench, described that saving as derisory. I think that that says a little about the attitude of the party opposite. Fourteen million pounds may not be worth what it was some years ago, but it is still a substantial sum with which many useful things can be done.<lb/>
Reverting to the cuts in general, one must look at them in the context of the Government's philosophy as a whole&#x2014;a philosophy which may be disliked by the Labour Party, but for which the country voted decisively at the general election last May. That philosophy has two prongs. On the one hand, we must strengthen our defences within NATO, in the light of the enormous Russian military and naval build-up which has taken place over the last few years. I
<col>934</col>
was very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, endorsed the Government's decision to increase defence expenditure by 3 per cent. That will cost money; indeed, money which could otherwise have gone towards reducing the cuts on the social services. However, it is surely money well spent if it will help deter the Russians from their offensive attitude towards Western Europe and a possible attack on Western Europe. I believe that it will help to deter them. We all want disarmament and a reduction&#x2014;indeed the elimination&#x2014;of nuclear missiles. But it must be fair and genuine disarmament, which the Russians have so far been unwilling to negotiate. We are much more likely to achieve a successful negotiation if we do so from a position of strength.<lb/>
The second prong of the Government's philosophy is to create more wealth by increasing dramatically our industrial productivity and efficiency so that we can once again compete effectively with the rest of the industrialised world. That matter has been referred to obviously by the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, in opening, and by many other noble Lords. The Government's whole policy is geared to that end. What is the alternative? We know that under years of Labour administration, British productivity as compared with that of other countries went down and down and, as a nation, we became poorer and poorer. Are noble Lords opposite really suggesting that we should continue on that road? If they are, it is incomprehensible.<lb/>
The present Government are trying a new approach. None of us knows whether it will work and whether the measures that they are taking will succeed. But we must all hope that they will, and I should have thought that they should at least be given the benefit of the doubt. If they do succeed and if British industry can be revived and again become competitive in world markets&#x2014;and as a small over-populated island in the midst of a ruthless world we must be competitive to survive&#x2014;we shall have the resources available to improve the social services, to give more generously in overseas aid to those countries which are less fortunately placed than ourselves, and to do all the other countless things which are so necessary here at home, and which we all want to see.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0476"/>
<col>935</col>
The theory advanced by many in the Labour Party that the Tories are out to grind down the faces of the poor would be laughable if it was not so malevolent. After all, the present Government would not be in office now if a large number of the less affluent members of society had not voted for them. The British people are not fools, and they are beginning to realise that the lot of the average man and woman will not be improved until the wealth has been created to pay for these improvements. That is what Government policy seeks to do, and I believe that it behoves all of us to give them a fair wind in the attempt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01920">8.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01921"><member>Viscount SIMON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is now a good many hours since the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, rose to invite us to debate this Motion which, as has already been remarked, covers a very wide field. In the interests of brevity I want to make only a few observations, as a result of which your Lordships may find my remarks a little disjointed, but I hope I shall be forgiven for that. I want to take up a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Vernon. He is, of course, a supporter of the Government, but he very rightly said that he hoped that their policies would succeed. I am not a supporter of the Government, but I also hope that their policies will succeed and I hope that many noble Lords on this side of the House think the same way, because whether we like it or not they are the Government, the responsibility is theirs, and we must earnestly hope that they will succeed because the penalty of failure would be so serious for all of us.<lb/>
That does not mean that we shall not critisise their policies. That is the duty of Opposition parties; and we, too, are an Opposition party. However, I do not want anyone to think that we want the Government to fail, and I hope that there is no one in the Labour Party who believes that their failure would be good for the Labour Party, for the situation is too serious for us to take that sort of view. I do not think that there is any point in saying any more about the difficulties we face and the opportunities before us. They have been well set out and argued, and I generally agree.<lb/>
<col>936</col>
As regards the opportunities, I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, was a little less than explicit but that gap was tilled to some extent by the noble Lord the Leader of the House. Therefore, I shall concern myself with the policies of Her Majesty's Government for dealing with these situations. First, I want to say something about the cuts. I do not want to argue whether they are cuts or stabilisations, or how they appear in any White Paper or Statement. What concerns people in the country is the effect that the Government's action has on them. It they are not to receive something which they used to receive, or if they have to pay more for something they used to receive, to them that is a cut.<lb/>
Like my noble friend Lady Seear, who commented on the Statement when it was made last week, I feel very strongly that the cuts show insufficient discrimination. I recognise that it must be very much easier to impose a cut across the board. For one thing, I suppose it stops so many arguments in the Cabinet between Ministers, all of whom want to support the expenditure of their own departments. However, I believe that it is an abdication of the responsibility of Government to set priorities and to justify those priorities to Parliament.<lb/>
My noble friend referred in particular to the question of the local authorities. As some noble Lords may remember, she raised the question whether the wise virgins would be penalised as much as those who had been foolish. I would rather use the analogy of the good husbands&#x2014;are the authorities which have carefully husbanded their resources to be subjected to the same cuts as the authorities which have been profligate? In answer to my noble friend's comments on the Statement the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, indicated that this was being locked into, and I hope that tonight he will be able to confirm that something will be done to ensure that there is protection for people who have been, as I say, careful in the husbanding of their resources.<lb/>
There is also, of course, the question of education. I must repeat the comment that my noble friend, Lady Seear made on this and which I thoroughly endorse. It seems to me that of all our services education should be given the highest priority because. if the young people miss
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0477"/>
<col>937</col>
out on education, it is something from which they will never recover. I know that it is common for people on the Government side to say, "What is it that you are suggesting?" I should like to stick my neck out a little and put forward some things that could be considered to be of relatively lower priority. I begin with one that may shock your Lordships. I should have thought that it is much more important to maintain the education of our children than it is to preserve the lives of old people in hospitals. I think that I am entitled to say that because I am an old person myself. These are very difficult matters. Of course, we want to do all these things, but if we cannot, we must ask the Government to assess priorities.<lb/>
Turning to more simpler matters, I believe that all new capital expenditure could be postponed for a year or two. I know that we urgently need new schools and hospitals and new prisons; sometimes we may even need new town halls, although I should have thought that that was less likely. Surely, if we have lived under the conditions that we have for some years, to postpone that for a year or two until we get our finances straight would not impose an undue burden upon people.<lb/>
What about the maintenance of roads? I believe that the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Murray of Gravesend, referred to roads, although they were speaking of new roads. I am thinking merely of normal maintenance. On the tape today it was said that the Automobile Association had pointed out that some of the damage to roads by weather last year would not be repaired for several years. It is a pity, but I do not think the country will come to grief because of that. I think that one might have to put up with that for a year or two. Although I recognise that it is a difficult problem, because deferred maintenance can be very expensive, I do not suggest that this is something that would be done for a long time; rather, a slowing up of the maintenance programme on roads should I think be given fairly low priority.<lb/>
I have notes here which I can almost throw away. I was going to talk about unemployment, but the splendid maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, said exactly what I wanted to say. I was astonished at how close it was to the notes I have before me, so shall save your Lordships' time and ask noble
<col>938</col>
Lords to read the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stewart, in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, if they did not hear it. It was a splendid speech and I was a little surprised that he had the same line of thought as I did about the necessity for training, mobility, and so on.<lb/>
Now I come to the question of encouraging business. Here I was very interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Peart, speak of the importance of developing regional policies. As your Lordships know, this is something which we on these Benches are keen about, and I hope that this is something about which the Government will be able to give us some encouragement. On the general question of encouraging business, I have never been of the opinion that cuts in personal taxation would be a stimulus for investment. I do not think they have been. If there is a small stimulus it is, I suggest, completely outweighed by rising interest rates.<lb/>
In another maiden speech the noble Lord, Lord Lever of Manchester, spoke very clearly about the conditions which encourage investment. I think he agreed that lowering personal taxation had very little to do with it. I hope that the Government will be able to help on the matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, and I think by the noble Lord, Lord Spens, about taxation on small businesses, because it is important. This is very difficult, but it would make an enormous difference to small businesses. It is those small businesses which very often, if they go well, turn into big businesses. It would make a great difference to them if something could be done about taxation on the lines that the two noble Lords suggested.<lb/>
One other point on the encouragement of investment was put to me by a friend the other day. He said, "How can anybody be encouraged to invest here when they are always seeing on the television, or hearing on the radio, or reading in the newspapers, about strikes and trouble?" I recognise first that we have a free Press, and we do not interfere with it; secondly, that strikes, trouble and riots are news, and that successful businesses that are doing very well are not news. They may be news once a year when the annual meeting is held, but that is only in the <i>Financial Times,</i> which most people do not often read.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0478"/>
<col>939</col>
The suggestion my friend made to me is something which the Government obviously cannot act on because they are not supposed to control the Press or the radio, but perhaps they could just say a word in the right quarters, that if these unfortunately rather frequent reports could occasionally be balanced with some indication about the far greater extent to which business is going on without these troubles, it would do good to the people and would encourage them&#x2014;or rather not discourage them to the extent that they are discouraged nowadays.<lb/>
I have tried to be brief, but finally I come to this: I listened with great interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, said about building bridges. I listened also to the noble Lord the Leader of the House and was a little surprised when he said he thought that the present Government's policies could not be called divisive. I will accept of course that he does not intend them to be, but they seem to me to have that sort of effect on a great many people.<lb/>
I believe that the Government's most important task&#x2014;and it would be the task of any other Government in power at this moment in our history&#x2014;is to unite the country in facing the difficulties that we are facing. I ask myself, "Can they, and are they, really trying to do that?" The noble Lord the Leader of the House said that he thought that there was much more common ground than sometimes appeared to be the case. I am all for that. If there is common ground let us get to it, because I am a little worried about the image which appears to be growing around the Prime Minister, of her as a strong woman. I do not much like strong women&#x2014;or strong men. I am not sexist about this. I do not know whether it is the image that she wants or whether it is being imposed upon her by the Press, but I do not find much joy out of her shaking her fist at the Russians or at the trade unions; and I think she does sometimes shake her fists at the trade union.<lb/>
I thought that the great mistake of the Heath Government when they came in was that before bringing in their Industrial Relations Bill they did not really try to get the Trade Union Congress, or the trade union movement, among whom there were many people who recognised that things

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01922"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Viscount would allow me to intervene? I am most grateful to him. I am not going to go over the ground covered by the Heath Government, but I can say that my department, my Secretary of State, has been prepared to consult, and indeed has consulted, at every single step of the way, but the unions have made their position clear, that they are opposed to any legislation of any kind in this field. We have made our position clear, that we think that some limited legislation is necessary, but there must come a point in consultation when it is recognised that there are real differences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01923"><member>Viscount SIMON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was going to say that in the earlier days I felt that Mr. Prior was being much more&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;not flexible, but at any rate agreeable to the trades unions, but that he had become rather sterile. The noble Earl says that this is simply because the trade unions turned him down flat, and I can understand that. It is an annoying thing to happen. At any rate, the point I want to make in conclusion is that I believe that the secret of successful democracy is not forcing measures through with the aid of a majority in Parliament but really trying, before the measures are prepared, to get as near a consensus as is possible, even between two parties which take different views. If the Government felt that that was something they could move towards, then I certainly hope that the Labour Party&#x2014;and I am fairly sure that the Liberal Party would be prepared to move also&#x2014;would be prepared to try to find a consensus on these things. That has the added advantage that once you have your legislation, if it is with a reasonable consensus, then you have a reasonable hope that it will not be turned out next time there is a change of Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01925"><member>Lord ROBERTHALL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate has already gone on rather a long time and I hope to be brief, although one always finds on rising to one's feet that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0479"/>
<col>941</col>
one tends to speak rather longer than anticipated. I wish to say at the beginning how adorned the debate has been by the extremely good maiden speeches, and I am sorry that time will not permit me to say anything about, especially, the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, and the noble Lord, Lord Lever of Manchester&#x2014;I much enjoyed Lord Lever's speech&#x2014;but perhaps I can say a little about Lord Stewart's speech.<lb/>
The debate began with the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, to whom we are grateful, outlining the gloomy state of the country&#x2014;the high unemployment, high inflation, low production and low exports&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Soames, underlined that in calling attention to what to me is the most dangerous and difficult of all the problems at present, and that is the extent of import penetration; that sums up our troubles. Our economic troubles are mainly I think in two places, that of inflation and that of low growth, and I will comment briefly on both. As everyone knows, the biggest change in our whole system of recent years has been the growth of trade union power, and that is partly because of changes in the law and partly I think by the escalation of wages, which has forced a number of unions which would not have thought about industrial action into it to protect themselves, and one must sympathise with them; we can all look down our noses at postal workers, hospital workers, firemen and civil servants, but what can they do? The unions which we used to think were stronger get a big increase, and because the State will not protect them, they have to stick up for themselves; but in the process they too have learned that they have this great power.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, said he thought that when people got too much power events would intervene and take it away. I am not sure I altogether agree with that optimistic view; I do not see the Russians, for instance, taking away the power now enjoyed by the Communist Party. But the present position of the unions is extraordinary in one way. Everybody in the State who gets power in his hands uses it for its own benefit, and you cannot blame them for that. The difficulty about the present situation is that in my view trade union power is
<col>942</col>
exercised not for the benefit of the workers but against them.<lb/>
Almost everybody will agree&#x2014;I think even Lord Harris considers that this has something to do with it&#x2014;that the main trouble about inflation is the high wage claims so far in excess of productivity and that these are enforced by trade union power. The first one in the round gets an increase. How does he get it? He gets it at the cost of all the others who have to pay a little more for his product. Then the next one comes in, he strikes a little against the first but mostly against the mass&#x2014;and so it goes on. In the end who will the postmen, civil servants and firemen strike against? It is not the employers. They go on just the same; they will get their little bit back from the first people in the round.<lb/>
Equally, low productivity, which in my view stems to a very large extent indeed from the wide prevalence of restrictive practices. The point has been made time and again in the debate that we will not get a higher social product and more expansion unless we get more productivity, yet&#x2014;of course this does not apply to all unions&#x2014;you only have to read the papers on any day to get a collection of accounts of disruptions; unions will not have a plant closed&#x2014;why do you close a plant if not to make better use of the labour?&#x2014;and soon.<lb/>
What are we going to do about it? The present Government's policy, as I understand it, is to adopt mainly fiscal and monetary policy, and like the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, I hope very much they succeed, but I suppose those who know me and my long advocacy of incomes policy will know that I feel grave doubts about the use of monetary and fiscal policy, at any rate as the primary instrument, partly because monetary policy is a much blunter weapon than its advocates think it is, and of course we do not know how long it will go on, and one cannot help feeling afraid lest there will be a great deal of social and industrial unrest and disturbance.<lb/>
What is the alternative? I suppose that temperamentally I incline to the view put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham. I think that he gave an admirable account of the need for productivity. He made the best speech of the debate about productivity. But,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0480"/>
<col>943</col>
at the end, he said he thought that we must go more gently in our aproach to the unions. Of course there is an obvious answer to this; it was given by the noble Lord, Lord Vernon. One sees it if one looks back at our history since 1944 (over the last 35 years) that began with the coalition White Paper&#x2014;the coalition White Paper, mind you!&#x2014;on full employment. That stressed very strongly the need for both restraint in wages and the end of restrictive practices and that sort of thing. Since then almost all Chancellors of the Exchequer have made similar statements in their Budget speeches. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, did not mention it, but I expect that I slipped a bit in all the same about the need for restraint on wages and for an increase in productivity.<lb/>
There have been any number of statements on behalf of various parties. I was thinking to myself, what is the policy of trade unions, and I found this document that I have here. It is the joint statement by the TUC and the Government made in February of this year entitled <i>The Economy, the Government and Trade Union Responsibilities.</i> I expect that everyone has forgotten about it by now. It is an admirable document. There is only one statement in it which I think is disingenuous, and that is that experience showed that
<quote>" legalistic intervention in the conduct of industrial relations is harmful ".</quote>
They ought to have added to that,
<quote>unless it is for the benefit of the unions ".</quote>
I say this because I think we all know that the unions are as much against the taking away of any of their present privileges as they are in favour of having more if they can get them. Well, that is by the way.<lb/>
I return to the two points that I mentioned, thinking particularly now about inflation. This White Paper is full of admirable statements about being against inflation. It says:
<quote>" we must set ourselves the task of aligning our inflation rate to that of our main overseas competitors, and that means getting our annual rate, within three years from now, down below 5 per cent. and holding it there.&#x2026; The TUC&#x2026;is as committed to reducing inflation as to any other of the policies adopted by Congress&#x2026;".</quote>
And so on. That is all fine stuff, but what has happened? As the noble Lord, Lord Vernon, pointed out, the trade unions then kicked the Government in the teeth.
<col>944</col>
That was why they lost the election, I do not doubt&#x2014;because of the transport workers.<lb/>
Coming back to productivity, there is an admirable statement about demarcation disputes, but anyone who heard the short debate on Monday about Hunterston will know how much we are still troubled by them. There are lots of good statements about productivity:
<quote>" we firmly believe in the adaptability and skills of our people which will be a principal factor in determining our economic fortunes "&#x2014;</quote>
adaptability, mind you!<lb/>
<quote>" One fundamental factor is the need to increase productivity&#x2014;of both capital and labour ".</quote>
But what has happened to that? I doubt that our growth is now even 1 per cent. a year, which is the figure that someone has mentioned.<lb/>
The fact is that in this sphere things are getting worse and worse. Why is it? It is because at present the TUC is not able to deliver the goods. It can sign marvellous statements such as this. I suppose that most of the leaders of the TUC feel as we all do about this, but they cannot get the troops to march, or perhaps to refrain from marching. The only suggestion that I have to make in this field is that, if there are any more discussions of this sort&#x2014;which I think is the way that we ought to move&#x2014;they must be much more in the form of tough bargaining, saying, "All right, you want us to do this. We want you to do that. Can you carry it out?"<lb/>
After the Social Contract was announced I said in this House that I thought it was a mistake to give everything away at the beginning, in the hope that the other side would deliver&#x2014;and how right I was! So it seems to me that either we are going to go ahead and have a great deal of industrial difficulty or we are going to have to try once more to tread this long and weary path, along which we have so far had no results at all. But it will not do any good unless the TUC itself can say what it is able to do, and whether it can or cannot implement policies which it appears to agree are desirable.</membercontribution></p>

<col>945</col>
Irving of Dartford, and, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, because all these noble Lords have achieved great distinction in public life, certainly far greater distinction than I myself ever hope to achieve. I was particularly intrigued by the speech of Lord Harris and the speech which immediately followed it, that of my noble friend Lord Kaldor, most of which I understood; but, as one who gave up his study of the dismal science at A-level for the sake of his own sanity, I look forward to the future exchanges, which I am sure we shall all enjoy, between Lord Harris and Lord Kaldor.<lb/>
Last Thursday I asked the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, whether the Government had any plans to protect the vulnerable against those local authorities which could not be relied upon to implement the Government cuts in a humane manner. I am bound to say to the noble Earl, with the greatest respect, that I found his answer wholly unconvincing&#x2014;not surprisingly; there was, I suppose, no other answer he could give, because, as the White Paper tells us, the Government have no direct control over local government spending. So I am able to say to your Lordships that, having listened to almost every word in this debate&#x2014;and it has gone on for many hours&#x2014;I shall, I think, not be repeating anything that has been said earlier. However, before I begin may I say that when I saw the list of speakers&#x2014;I think there are 28 names on the list, which is just about the number of obstacles that the horses have to encounter in the Grand National&#x2014;and found myself 25th on that list, I had some idea what those poor animals must be thinking as they set off on that 4&#x00BD;-mile journey.<lb/>
My Lords, where will these cuts fall? Instead of living in dreamland, as some of the speakers opposite appear to have been doing, I wonder whether they have seen the document (I am sure they have, because it was produced for the benefit of the Government) by the Association of County Councils and the recommendations in that document to the Government as to where they felt cuts could be made. Indeed, the document is styled:
<quote>" Statutory obligations on local authorities which might be abolished in favour of discretionary powers ".</quote>
I was a member of the ACC for a number of years, and when I read those words they
<col>946</col>
struck fear in my heart, because in the ACC I dealt with the Conservatives and, believe me, they are the most hardhearted bunch of freebooters I have ever encountered in my political life. I am sure the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, will never forgive me for saying so, but I find him and his colleagues on the Front Bench opposite somewhat civilised, and if I could be assured that these cuts were going to be implemented by the Government Front Bench then perhaps I would not have the fears that I have.<lb/>
Let me tell your Lordships exactly what happens in real life. What I am going to say could be referred to as anecdotal evidence, but I assure your Lordships that it is what happens out in the field. I am a relatively newcomer to local government so that I was able to view it with a somewhat more subjective view than many of my colleagues who had spent a great many distinguished years of public service in local government. In 1971 or 1972, just after I arrived in local government, I attended a meeting of the board of governors of my local comprehensive school. We were having a debate on truancy. To my surprise, I was told that even some of our more academically bright children were playing truant. It did not seem right to me. I should have thought that academically bright children like to go to school, that they enjoy their lessons. I discovered that they had to go to other schools for their sixth form education.<lb/>
We won the election following local government reorganisation&#x2014;a rather unusual thing in my part of the world; but we did. I made some inquiries and I found that there were only four schools which did not have sixth forms. And where do you think they were? Without exception, all were in the working-class areas&#x2014;all of them, on the council estates and in the working-class areas. We put that right immediately.<lb/>
I give that illustration to your Lordships to give an indication where these cuts are going to fall. Indeed, let me spell out some of the suggestions that the ACC has made to the Government. They want standards laid down for school buildings and playing fields to be scrapped so that cheaper buildings and smaller playing fields can be provided; they want permission sought for charges to be levied for
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0482"/>
<col>947</col>
nursery education, for borrowing of library books and refuse disposal facilities They want the statutory school age to be restricted, the starting age to be six years and the leaving age to be 15. They want to stop new regulations for the protection of old people's homes under the 1971 Fire Precautions Act, to relax the fire protection controls on hotels and to charge for advice on fire prevention matters. They want also to scrap the duty to provide services under Section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, and they want to remove the duty of liaison between the health services and the social services. They want freedom to cut the pocket money allowed to residents of old people's homes; they want to cut back on social work reports to the courts and on community homes with education; and they want to reduce public participation requirements in planning. I could read the whole document and it would take an hour. But the warning signs are there. If the Government have no direct control over local government&#x2014;and I am not suggesting for a moment that they should&#x2014;the Government's eyes should be open to what is actually going to happen.<lb/>
If I may continue with some more of this anecdotal evidence, many years ago (or perhaps not so many) in the early 1960s I read Galbraith's <i>The Affluent Society,</i> which was a book received with a great deal of praise but also with a great deal of criticism from his fellow economists; largely, I think, because Galbraith was one of those rare economists who can write in terms that ordinary people can understand. I think that he was giving the mystery away; and that was probably why he was attacked by his fellow-economists, or certain of them. In that book he wrote somewhere that there was more socialism in America than in any other country in the Western World; but it was socialism for the rich. He went on to illustrate how it was the more affluent in the American society who benefited most from public expenditure and here. I am just about to give one or two illustrations.<lb/>
As a result of remembering that comment of Galbraith, I set in train a simple exercise and asked a team of brilliant researchers to discover who benefited from the money that we were spending&#x2014;a simple enough exercise.
<col>948</col>
Although I have some notes, I have not all the detailed evidence with me. I assure your Lordships that my memory is excellent. We discovered that with the transport supplementary grant which the county was giving to the district transport undertaking in the three affluent areas that were picked out the population was getting &#x00A3;700 per thousand of the population. In the working class areas&#x2014;the areas where the public transport was most used&#x2014;it was something like &#x00A3;180 per thousand of the population. We discovered that there was a greater turnover of teachers in the poorer areas than the more affluent areas; we found that by all the poverty indicators the poorer areas were benefiting least from public expenditure.<lb/>
Governments very rarely have the opportunity to sit back and think about these very serious problems. One of the charges which can be made against the Government, and which can be made to stick, is what they have done is not necessarily wrong&#x2014;although we think it is&#x2014;but they have acted too hastily. They have not sat down and thought about the consequences of their actions. Sometimes I think to myself that what is happening is that the poor people of Scotland, Wales, and the North of England are being punished for voting Labour. One of the previous speakers said that many ordinary people voted Conservative. If one looks at a map in class terms&#x2014;if we have to use them&#x2014;it is clear that the basic working class loyalties to the Labour Party are as strong as ever they were.<lb/>
Many of my trade union colleagues agree with me that what happened was this: many, many trade unionists said: "We want more money". They said to the Labour Government: "You are not going to give it to us; she has promised us more so we are going to vote for her". I think my noble friend Lord Murray of Gravesend read out the list of denials that were made during the General Election. So in many respects the Government were elected, if not on a false prospectus, certainly in many areas by the statements of the present Prime Minister and her colleagues which misled the people.<lb/>
The areas to which I have referred in the United Kingdom, in Scotland, the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0483"/>
<col>949</col>
North of England and in Wales depend so much on public expenditure. This figure staggered me somewhat: 60 per cent. of the people working in Wales rely on public expenditure for their jobs. That is not because we are necessarily beggars, because we are not. It so happens that many of the publicly-owned industries and utilities&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

Is the noble Lord aware that, whatever the rights and wrongs of the way that we are proceeding, public expenditure in this country has this year been increased on the expenditure of last year, when the Government which the noble Lord supports were in power. We must stop consistently misleading ourselves and others with talk of reductions in public expenditure. Public expenditure this year&#x2014;many of my noble friends think regrettably&#x2014;has been increased on last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01929"><member>Lord BROOKS of TREMORFA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, but I did say earlier that the indictment of the Government's policies is the speed at which they have arrived at them. The noble Earl seems to be implying in his intervention that nobody has been affected and that there are no cuts. If that is so, what on earth have local government been engaged upon in the last few months? I see the noble Earl wants to intervene again. I have given way once. I think I should be allowed to make my point. The fact is that in my county alone &#x00A3;2.3 million has been cut from current expenditure, from present plans which were arrived at over six months ago. The impression that the noble Earl is trying to give is that there are no cuts. If there are no cuts, what on earth have we got a White Paper for?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01930"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to intervene my Lords, but I did not say there were no cuts. I am saying that public expenditure has increased over the last year. That is a different matter. We can have an argument about where the public expenditure distribution falls, and that is quite right: but the noble Lord was giving the clear impression that public expenditure is falling. It is not; it is rising.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01933"><member>Lord BROOKS of TREMORFA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in any case I should have thought that the burden of my message is not so much that there are going to be cuts in Government expenditure but that there are poor wretches on whom these cuts are going to fall. That is what I was getting at. One noble Lord in this debate said that he did not want to finish on a pessimistic note. Neither do I. Somebody wrote somewhere that each nation has its secret collective dread. In America it is Communism; in France it is revolution; in Germany it is inflation and in Britain it is unemployment.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition in another place, James Callaghan, said the other night that the deferential society has gone&#x2014;it has left us. My Lords, it has. Young people will not put up with what their parents put up with in the 'thirties. We have this underlying secret dread ; it is there. And I want to say this to many of your Lordships, and particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, who I am sorry was unable to stay: If he and those who have been attacking the trade unions understood how deep th ehistory of those years goes into people who are living and working today, they would also understand that they cannot erase froj their minds some of the things that were done for them.<lb/>
I have not one ounce of personal bitterness about my experiences, but I will say that there were many years in the 'thirties when I never saw my father; he was away looking for work. That was the experience of so many people who, as I say, are still alive and still working. This secret dread is there. If unemployment grows to the level that the Government are complacently anticipating, coupled with the twin evil of Germany's secret dread, inflation, what kind of prospect is there for us? I think the complacency with which this Government are approaching our economic problems whatever the merits of the means they are using to attempt to solve them, is something that must be condemned.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0484"/>

My Lords, it has been a long day and I shall take no more time. I think I have already taken too long. I am grateful for the opportunity of speaking in this debate, and I hope that more wide-ranging Motions of this sort are put to us in order that we can express our views in the way they have been expressed today. </membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01935"><member>Lord MOTTISTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it really is a most interesting opportunity to follow the noble Lord, Lords Brooks of Tremorfa, which I have not had the privilege of doing before, because it seems to me that he absolutely epitomises in his own speeches, and so do other noble Lords opposite, the difficulties that my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft asked us to look at. The difficulties are that noble Lords opposite, and their supporters outside this place, do not seem to be able to learn from past experience; do not seem to be able to realise that the way in which they attempted to run this country when they provided the Government, during the last 35 years, has not worked. It is as simple as that. Every time they have tried with the very best of intentions. I shall always credit them with good intentions, and I shall not add any other points to that. But the fact is that it is extremely difficult to run everything, if you do not have the resources.<lb/>
It is all very well grumbling, "There is not enough of this and that in the way of money for the local authorities and, therefore, there has to be a cut "; and," Is it a cut, or is it as my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter said, a so-called cut "? That is not the point. The point is that we do not have the resources and we do not have them because, as a country, we have not been earning the money. And we have not been earning the money because people have been misled&#x2014;perhaps "misled" is the correct word&#x2014;into thinking that you can get money without having to work for it. The key to the matter is productivity. I am sorry, my Lords, but we do not have the money. The reason for not having the money is another matter. The point is that we do not have the money for doing the kind of things that noble Lords opposite wanted to do. I do not blame them for wanting to do them, but we just do not have the money.<lb/>
<col>952</col>
It is not the least bit surprising that my noble friends on the Front Bench have had to do what they have done. There are several of us who would say that they have not done enough, and I think that the country will suffer therefrom. But be that as it may, the difficulty is that people are not prepared to change their attitudes, notwithstanding the fact that all the evidence shows that they should. This is very hard for the country, because the country is suffering and there are many people&#x2014;people such as those the noble Lord, Lord Brooks of Tremorfa, has been talking about&#x2014;who are in the local areas around the country and who perhaps do not fully understand what either Party is trying to say to them.<lb/>
They are the people who are being misled. They are the people who are thinking that, somehow, if you take certain kinds of actions you will get certain kinds of results. For example, you may think that if you take industrial action you and your mates will improve your standard of living and that everything will be better than it was before. On the whole, that is not the case and has not been in the last 30 years. It is tragic that people should be so misled, and I am very sorry that noble Lords opposite&#x2014;and there are not many left&#x2014;should have this fixation about the kind of arguments that they have been putting forward. This is extremely important&#x2014;Hooray! The noble Lord, Lord Murray, has come to join us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01936"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: There are not so many noble Lords over there, either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01937"><member>Lord MOTTISTONE</member><membercontribution>: But the most important difficulty that we have as a country, forgetting the Government, is the fact that the message of the past that has been drummed home to us by fact&#x2014;also, if you like, by the IMF and by other kinds of bodies&#x2014;has not been hoisted in by noble Lords opposite. That is the difficulty. The opportunity is there, if only we can get latched on to the need for this country&#x2014;for every country, for that matter&#x2014;to give a free rein to freedom and enterprise. That is the key to success. If we endeavour, so far as is possible, to give individuals throughout the country freedom to get on, freedom to develop and freedom to use their bright ideas, and the opportunity
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0485"/>
<col>953</col>
to use their enterprise, then the country as a whole will prosper. It is only in that way that the country will prosper. It is all very well for learned&#x2014;" learned" is not the word because "learned" is applied to certain sorts of Lords; it is all very well for Lords who are well versed in economics to shake their heads. The fact of the matter is that one needs to talk about people rather than about figures. People respond to different sorts of pressures.<lb/>
Another point which might be worth mentioning in passing is this. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, spoke earlier about the wickedness of tax evasion. I support him entirely. Tax evasion demonstrates itself in many ways, but I am sure that the noble Lord was thinking of it in terms of the beastly capitalists who are evading tax. The noble Lord may put it that way, but one of the great worries at the moment is what people have called the black economy.<lb/>
I heard only two days ago of a company that has a 12 per cent. absenteeism rate. Companies are now beginning to find that people work a rota. For instance, three chaps will work a rota between them. Two of them will come in on a particular day, while the third will be absent "moonlighting"; he will be engaged in some activity on which he does not pay any tax. The others will get overtime because they are covering for him. Later on they all shift round one; and they take it in turns to do that. Noble Lords opposite may laugh, but this is the way in which people react to excessive intervention in their lives by what they see as the great "they"&#x2014;which includes all of us and the people in Whitehall.<lb/>
As anybody who has ever had anything to do with fighting in wars will know, people who find that the pressures of officialdom are more than they can stand discover ways of getting round it. I do not blame people who "moonlight" or who evade taxes of the sort I am speaking about, because they are oppressed by central Government mechanisms which they find oppressive. However, the fact of the matter is that when this sort of thing happens you cannot put it right by increasing the amount of pressure, by getting more money out of the ordinary citizen in order to pay for more types of

local government expenditure, or whatever it may he. There is a limit to what people can stand.<lb/>
My noble friends have tried to take the first faltering steps towards putting that sort of thing right. It may be that they have not done it well enough. It may be that the immediate effects do not look nice to certain kinds of people. However, the fact is that they are working in the right sort of direction. They are trying to give the opportunity&#x2014;I come back to Lord Thorneycroft's Motion&#x2014;to the rest of us to get on and earn the money which the country needs so that the welfare, which the country also needs, can be paid for. It must go forward like this. My noble friends must be given every encouragement. They must not be subjected to carping criticism from people who do not seem to be able to learn from their past mistakes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01938"><member>Lord KALDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down may I ask him one question. He thinks that provided we return to the 19th century, provided government is driven back and the Welfare State abolished, provided everybody is after himself, with the maximum rein given to free competition, this country will return to a prosperous condition. Does the noble Lord realise that that period, the late Victorian period and the period preceding the First World War&#x2014;when there were all the incentives in the world, there was no progressive taxation, no unemployment benefit, nothing&#x2014;were more depressed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01939"><member>Lord MOTTISTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may answer the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor. If I may say so, he is making another speech rather than asking me a question. I can certainly answer his question. I am looking forwards, not backwards; I am not looking to put this country back to the 19th century. I am looking forward to an environment in which we can develop forwards. The fact of the matter is that the experiments we have made&#x2014;and I have supported many of them&#x2014;in order to try to sort out our problems during the last 50 years have not all worked.<lb/>
Everybody would agree that some parts of the Welfare State are absolutely essential and nobody would quarrel with them, but the fact of the matter is that the basic
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0486"/>
<col>955</col>
over-control from the centre has been carried too far; it does not work, it does not produce the right results and it does not get the right reactions from the individuals whom it is supposed to benefit. Let us forget the 19th century and, for Gods' sake!, let us forget the first three-quarters of this century. Let us look
<col>956</col>
forwards rather than backwards and let us for Heaven's sake get ourselves going and give ourselves the opportunity. En this country we have all sorts of skills, interests, and energy. Give us the chance to do this, but do not tell us that we only have to respond to what Auntie Government sitting in Whitehall tells us to do. That is disaster.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01941"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of the most attractive features in this debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, has been the four outstanding maiden speeches that we have had. Other noble Lords who have been in the House longer than I have will know whether this has been so on other occasions, but I should have thought that this occasion was probably unique. My very old friend the noble Lord, Lord Lever of Manchester, gave us a brilliant dissertation on exchange controls which has made me decide that perhaps I will not mention them again (because I do not quite agree with him about it), and also on general Government policy. My noble friend Lord Stewart of Fulham without a single note made a most felicitous speech. I had the feeling that if it had not been a maiden speech he might have taken rather a harder line, certainly on the question of the education cuts. My noble friend Lord Irving of Dartford concentrated particularly on the micro-chip industry and what was happening there, and it was so interesting that one did not have to go through the formality of offering empty thanks. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, made an extremely witty speech. His economic feelings showed, of course, but we know them and, since his recreation is conjuring and devising spells against over-government, we shall evidently hear quite a lot from him about that in the future.<lb/>
I want to deal with the Paper that came out last week, <i>Government Expenditure Plans 1980&#x2013;81.</i> I do not mind whether people continue to call them the so-called cuts or a particular sort of tax. I really wonder where some of the Members opposite have been during this last week; to whom they have been talking and who they have met. The noble Lord the Leader of the House expressed the hope that we would not look at it as a programme of savage cuts. The noble Viscount, Lord Simon, was much more to the point when he pointed out how divisive it was. If one is speaking to people outside and not necessarily to people who support the Labour Party, there is tremendous concern and anxiety about this, and also about the indiscriminate nature of the cuts. This broad brush approach has ended in
<col>958</col>
what it may not have been intended to be a brutality and cruelty in approach but, frankly, I find it absolutely amazing.<lb/>
The Government are in fact, in trying to face the 'eighties, pulling us back to the 'thirties; although I think my noble friend Lord Kaldor, who many years ago tried to teach me economic theory at the London School of Economics, said "back to the 19th century". Acknowledgment of economic realities which dictate the need to slim down expenditure and excise waste does not disguise the enormous philosophic gap between the Labour Party and the Conservatives. The Budget and now this White Paper have rolled back the carefully constructed carpet of social development with a complacency that I really find tragic, and I am not here making any political digs; I just find it quite amazing.<lb/>
My noble friends Lord Peart, Lord Murray and Lord Castle, and I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, on the other side, mentioned the cuts in education. Apart from all the humane reasons against the way this is being done, as was mentioned in a Question earlier today &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;5,000 fees will now be paid by overseas students, except students from Europe; incidentally we stand alone in fee charging, with the exception of Belgium which only charges in the case of medical students. This is an investment for the future and when we are talking about investment in this country we are not only talking about money or machinery, we really are talking about human beings as well, and among them are the children. I am not going to expand any further on education because so many of my noble friends have dealt with it so well.<lb/>
The housing cuts, which the White Paper says reflect change in local authorities' priorities, mean less housing. We have also heard, from the Prime Minister yesterday, that it is very unlikely that the Government will be able to help with the likely increase in mortgage rates. The housing situation, it seems to me, will probably get worse, certainly for those who are less well off rather than for those who are better off.<lb/>
We have had a considerable amount of discussion with regard to health, and my
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0488"/>
<col>959</col>
noble friend Lord Peart made a great many telling points on that and discussed our anxieties. They say more money is being put into the Health Service, while at the same time wards are being closed and hospitals are on the brink at the moment; the anxiety in the professional services and among people, many of whom have no particular love for the Labour Party, needs to be heard, and then noble Lords opposite would know what the real response to this is. With inflation at 17 per cent. and possibly getting higher, it is quite impossible to say that there will not be a short-fall, and until we know what the cash limits are going to be it may mean that there will be further cuts.<lb/>
In the social services, another area which my noble friends have touched on with considerable feeling as well as practical knowledge, the White Paper says the Government want to develop policies which help people to help themselves and others by collaboration with the voluntary sector. I am a great supporter, not just theoretically but in practice, of the voluntary sector: but with all the goodwill in the world there is a very severe limit to what volunteers can do without skilled social workers today, when there is so much specialisation and very much more sophisticated treatment and help to people, and also without resources and without local authority grants.<lb/>
To what extent will the pinched authority feel that it can make grants to voluntary bodies when it cannot even carry out its own work? It is pie in the sky. Again, with the increase of the over-75s in our population by more than 2 per cent. per year&#x2014;the projection for 1996 is something like 3 per cent. to 4 per cent.&#x2014;more and not less residential care is needed; more and not fewer home helps are needed; and more visits and more mobile meals are needed. At present, there are long queues for old people's residential care, and that takes in voluntary homes as well as local authority and central government homes. Once again there is not only a human aspect, hut an economic one as well. The decline in services for the elderly will not only reduce their quality of life, which is had enough, but will put more pressure on
<col>960</col>
the health services. Surely that is an extremely foolish economy.<lb/>
Similarly, families with problems, and children tipping over into delinquency will suffer, and the savings will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. So, a great deal of the law and order expenditure will be robbing social services "Peter", on the one hand, to pay penal services "Paul on the other. What a Monty Python's Circus this is! If we add to that the Government's expected 300,000 increase in unemployment&#x2014;that is not a true figure as it does not include the school-leavers who are a very important and sensitive section of the unemployed&#x2014;what do we get? We get a cut-down in preventive action and increased unemployment and unemployment benefits, which will not be covered by the social security cuts. Or, are these benefits&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014;hovering in the social wings waiting for the next Government chop?<lb/>
In our debate last week on the family and the Government's policy, it was most extraordinary that there was the Sherlock Holmes' dog that did not bark in the night. In other words, there was a debate on the family, a matter about which the Government and the Members who support the Government are always talking, and to which they attach great importance. However, only one Back-Bencher spoke in support of the Government. When our side of the House were in Government and I was a Minister, I know that certainly our Back-Benchers were not slow in coming forward and telling Ministers where they thought the Government were going wrong. Sometimes it was rather annoying, but often it was very helpful because it strengthened one's own arm if one was not always in agreement with one's more senior colleagues about aspects of policy. However, it was quite amazing and to me it seemed to show&#x2014;I do not say a lack of interest because I do not think that that applies to the individuals&#x2014;a lack of communal compassion and real concern about what is being done, even if the people doing it felt that they had to do so.<lb/>
There is another strange anomaly which threads its way through the Government's
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0489"/>
<col>961</col>
expenditure plans. We have the first woman Prime Minister that this country has ever had. Yet this package will make women's lives much harder. Let us take as an example the nursery schools. Who will the cut-back in the nursery schools hit?&#x2014;the children and their working mothers. Restrictions on school meals will add to the stress of mothers as well as detracting from their children's wellbeing. Who will the 70p prescription charges harm most?&#x2014;they will harm the wives and mothers of the family, the type of women who, before the creation of the National Health Service, were always the last to go to their doctors because they had to pay. Who will some of the other severe social cuts hit?&#x2014;mothers of disabled or handicapped children and daughters of frail elderly parents, usually mothers who are widows.<lb/>
The debate last week was splendidly opened by my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell who raised some points which he had read in the <i>Guardian.</i> The noble Baroness, Lady Young, when replying referred to him asking:
<quote>"&#x2026; whether the Government intended, as the <i>Guardian</i> leaks suggest, to&#x2026; abolish maternity and death grants; delay women's pensions until 65"</quote>
among some other things which apply not only to women but to men as well. On his her answer was:
<quote>" On all those matters I can only tell him that reports have recently appeared in the Press that the Secretary of State for Social Services is considering whether to achieve the necessary cuts in public expenditure by one or more of a range of options. The responsible Ministers have to explore the whole range of theoretical possibilities for savings, to assess what is involved."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24/10/79; col. 173.]</quote>
We do not know what the next lot of cuts will involve when the cash estimates are being worked out. This, together with sex discrimination against British wives with foreign husbands, which arose earlier today, makes up a real anti-feminist package. Therefore, women have had a very bad deal out of a package from a Government which is headed by a woman. It seems a pity, does it not?<lb/>
A great deal has been said about taxation and it has been examined pretty thoroughly. We have said one thing and the Government, on the whole, have said something else. But what worries me is that the Government's priorities are so
<col>962</col>
bizarre. For a long time the Government's war cry has been to cut taxation, and so it was when they were in Opposition. To cut taxation is perfectly all right if, first, you make it equitable and, secondly, you can do it without having the results too heavily weighted on the side of indirect taxation. For instance, we should certainly have had to raise VAT, but the Government raised it to 15 per cent. which was not expected and was not in the Conservatives' Manifesto for the last election, so people did not vote for a 15 per cent. rate of VAT.<lb/>
It is the less well-off who are worse off and the better-off who are even better off. The taxation reductions cost around &#x00A3;4.5 million. Noble Lords opposite have asked, what would we have done? One thing we would not have done was to cut taxation in that way and to that extent. In any case massive cuts in income tax will not produce increased growth, as the Government have acknowledged.<lb/>
So what do we see today? After six months of this Government&#x2014;and I shall be fair and say that that is a comparatively short time, but during that time they have been very active&#x2014;there is no sign of an incentive motivation. This is worrying for the country, not simply because we have a Conservative Government. In fact, business confidence is falling, as the report published by the CBI a few weeks ago pointed out. In addition, industrial production is falling, investment is falling, the pound is falling, inflation is rising and many small businessmen face bankruptcy due to tight monetary policies.<lb/>
On my way to the House today I heard on the radio that more support is being given to small businessmen by the Government. In mentioning small businessmen, I must point out that it was my noble friend Lord Lever of Manchester who, during the last Labour Government, was responsible for initiating the schemes and getting help and action under way for small businesses. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, raised this matter. On exchange controls&#x2014;a piece of ice on which I tread very warily&#x2014;I would rather support the view that we should relax controls. The total removal of such controls worries me rather,
despite my noble friend's brilliant exposition.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0490"/>
<col>963</col>
I think we would have cut defence and certainly not increased it&#x2014;I believe that my noble friend Lord Kaldor is right over that. It is disproportionate, in the same way as our contribution to the Common Market&#x2014;and here I speak as a pro-Common Marketeer&#x2014;is quite out of proportion to our resources and compared with what other people are paying. It is depressing to see in the White Paper that the sum put in for the EEC contribution is &#x00A3;1,000 million when we are all hoping that that will be brought down quite considerably, and that the Prime Minister will manage to do that.<lb/>
At a time of recession, and certainly not forgetting the world recession which has been mentioned by many noble Lords, we could find another billion pounds on the borrowing requirement and in that way save some of the cuts. This is something over which there is often disagreement, but there is certainly a view today&#x2014;and even in the Government's own party&#x2014;that that is one of the viable alternatives. Cutting down the Manpower Services Commission and ending the short-term employment subsidy and job release scheme seems to me extraordinary with rising unemployment. The noble Earl shakes his head, but this is what paragraph 24 says:
<quote>" The provision for 1980&#x2013;81 for measures operated by the Manpower Services Commission is held broadly at the reduced level for 1979&#x2013;80. No provision is made for the extension of the Small Firms Employment Subsidy, the Job Release Scheme, or the Temporary Short-Time Working Scheme which are due to close for applications in March 1980. The statutory short-time working scheme proposed by the previous Government has been dropped."</quote>
I do not know whether the noble Earl saw last week's <i>Spectator,</i> which is not a periodical which supports the Labour Party. It says:
<quote>" The removal of subsidies received from the Manpower Services Commission provides two albeit small examples of an unthinking meanness on the part of government which is also directly contrary to Conservative principles of self-sufficiency."</quote>
At this time of night I shall not go into it any further, but they give some interesting examples of a workshop for offenders which is going to lose its subsidy, and also a number of Asians in Leicestershire who have been receiving a subsidy to enable them to grow vegetables and herbs in greenhouses which they are then able to
<col>964</col>
sell. This is an excellent example of private enterprise that is going by the board altogether because it is evidently in the wrong area. Work for unemployed is surely more productive than greater expenditure on law and order&#x2014;about which the Government have really made a song and dance&#x2014;when so many young people are out of work, idle, and disenchanted. I think my noble friends have pointed out that this is the time when vandalism and crime breaks out. What more do you need than having them unemployed&#x2014;even though these alternatives may have been stopgaps&#x2014;to make them more anti-social?<lb/>
A great deal has been said about over-manning. Of course over-manning is not justified. I would be the first to agree that there must be room for cutting down staffs. There must be room for eliminating waste. I know that there is. But the reorganisation of local government, the reorganisation of the National Health Service enacted by the last Conservative Government, gave birth to brigades of bureaucrats. It set up structures which did this very thing. In fact, when we were in Government I personally was in favour of starting again: of throwing out these reorganisation Acts and having a simpler and more economic system. We have been either chivvied by some for not making cuts, or told by other noble Lords that we did make cuts. We did make cuts and imposed cash limits, this is true. But what we did not do, and what we could never do from this side of the House, is to slash the human services in what I can only call a clumsy, callous, indiscriminate manner, which has also not been very well thought out. Everybody will have to go back to the drawing board, if they are going to continue with this policy, and think it out further.<lb/>
As has been said, inflation really is public enemy No. 1. In six months it has risen from 8 per cent. to around 17 per cent.&#x2014;certainly not the time to abolish the Price Commission, which the Tories insisted on doing almost immediately on their arrival in office and which we strongly opposed and still oppose. The whole question of productivity, which is the essential card in the economic pack, has become quite a circular argument and, as my noble friend Lord Jacques said, Britain could be a prosperous country,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0491"/>
<col>965</col>
but not if there is a free-for-all. I am anxious not to delay the House further. We have the problem of management and trade unions and the whole problem of how one gets productivity; and whereas we all bemoan the lack of it I do not think anybody has come up with a miracle way of achieving it.<lb/>
These financial slashes, cuts or whatever one calls them, will take the quality out of our lives and environment at a time when the Labour Government were enhancing it&#x2014;too slowly for my taste, but not for that of the Treasury. I support the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, and others who criticised the proposed &#x00A3;2 million off the BBC external services. There seems to have been such stupidity and pettiness over this whole matter, which makes me say that so many of these things have not been well thought out. Originally the cut was to be &#x00A3;4 million; then it was dropped to &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;7 million, and now we are given to understand that it may be worked out in a different way.<lb/>
The resurrection and aesthetic improvement of inner urban areas will decline so that the decaying teeth of dereliction in our cities will remain. In their struggle with the mainstream of physical existence, I fear that authorities will cut down the cultural nourishment which feeds our eyes, ears and souls&#x2014;the arts, libraries and museums. In sacrificing the quality of life, historic buildings, conservation areas and town schemes will, I feel, not be exempt. Again, strong central support is necessary to encourage local authorities to spend money. This is an area I know personally, where many local authorities have been starting to take an interest, realising that they can find other uses for old buildings and at the same time enhance their towns and cities. There is no mention of this in the White Paper. Perhaps the noble Earl will write to me about it. I am also concerned by how much the figure for the arts, libraries and museums will be reduced by their contribution to the National Heritage Fund&#x2014;this is in the White Paper&#x2014;since this is a new departure as the Land Fund came from the Treasury and not off the arts budget. Perhaps the Minister will write to me on those two points.<lb/>
There is a case for making public expenditure efficient but there is no case for this vicious and retrograde reduction
<col>966</col>
in vital services. Underlying it all I feel there is a fundamental dislike of public expenditure except in those areas where even the most conservative of Conservative Governments cannot do a U-turn. The Government's expenditure plans cannot, I am afraid, be seen as a short-term economic expedient but, rather, as I fear, a deep and dangerous assault on our social and national values. </membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01942">10.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01943"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of EMPLOYMENT (The Earl of Gowrie)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order to save public expenditure, would your Lordships please fasten your seat belts because I am going to go rather fast as I am sure you are all anxious to get the lights turned off and go home. I certainly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, that the most distinctive feature of our debate has been the quality of the maiden speeches. It is the convention here to be very effusive about maiden speeches, but I have never heard four better ones in a batch; it was remarkable.<lb/>
We welcome of course the arrival in this House of the noble Lord, Lord Lever of Manchester, not least because since his appearance we tend to win the bridge game. I remember that when the noble Lord was a mere Privy Councillor he wandered into this House and was not aware that it was on the steps of the Throne that he was supposed to sit and he started meandering in towards this part of the Chamber. Your Lordships, ever vigilant for any breaches of procedure, shouted "Order!" at him, but I shouted, "Not yet". I am glad I was in the right on that occasion.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, gave us a pure breath of air in his analysis. Certainly some of the countervailing emphases in economics have changed slightly in recent years, perhaps out of ideology, perhaps because they have been forced upon Governments in this country. But it is rather pleasant to us to experience in the noble Lord, Lord Harris, the clear ear of someone who thinks that people do want extra wages, and that if they get extra wages, they may indeed be prepared to pay for some of their services directly.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0492"/>
<col>967</col>
In the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, we heard his exceptional and famous clarity, and we hope that he will address us very often. He perhaps strayed a little into the area of controversy for a maiden speech, but we acquit him of that because I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Lever, who revised the standing rule and said that the violent expression of antipathetic views, or something like that, is not allowed in a maiden speech, but a certain amount of controversy is. In the voice of the noble Lord, Lord Irving of Dartford, we heard the Labour Party&#x2014;if I may put it this way&#x2014;at its best: rational, compassionate, but also spending some attention to the costing of whatever rationality or compassion it requires from the economy.<lb/>
As I have said, I shall have to deal with the individual questions as fast as I can, but not so fast that I do not pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft, not only for his contribution in giving me the rather nervous and doubtful honour of addressing your Lordships at 10.20 in the evening but also of course for the fact that his is really a remarkable public career. The steps taken by my noble friend in 1958 have now made him a very considerable intellectual hero in all sections of the Conservative Party. This is really remarkable, and we are glad to pay our tribute to him.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peart&#x2014;and for brevity's sake may I include in these remarks some of the issues put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Castle&#x2014;spoke about regional aid being cut, and about what the position is. The position is, of course, that this Government are maintaining the very massive intervention in all sectors of the economy on a regional basis that has been relative consensus between the parties since the war. Now whether we are right to do so only the development over the next few years will tell. Nevertheless our analysis is that the participation of Government in what my noble friend Lord Soames called the vasty deeps of the economy now being over 50 per cent. means that a massive or unthinking withdrawal is simply not to be contemplated.<lb/>
Where there is a difference is in the emphasis on the regions. The last Government's regional aid was dispersed
<col>968</col>
over 43 per cent. of the population. Aberdeen, which I had the honour to visit last week, and which must be one of the most prosperous places in the whole of Europe, let alone in the world, was covered by some of the last Government's regional development programmes. So we are trying to concentrate on the areas of real unemployment and need, and we are doing this by population.<lb/>
What else we can do&#x2014;and this covers a number of points that have been raised in the debate&#x2014;depends of course on the reversal of our industrial decline, which in our estimation requires stabilisation of public sector expenditure until we can reverse the decline of wealth-creating sectors which we inherited, and which in previous times no doubt we bear our own responsibility for creating. I think that the real difference between ourselves and the other side of the House is not on the issues of compassion or public expenditure, but simply on how you increase the wealth in order to increase the tax base, in order to maintain and expand these services. I consider that the wisest words that I heard on this came from my noble friend Lord Soames when he said that we are entitled to ask the Opposition to cost their criticisms every penny of the way. We expect the criticisms, but we expect them to be costed.<lb/>
My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Peart, the noble Lord, Lord Castle, and others put to me questions about cuts in education. We are trying to save &#x00A3;280 million over 1978&#x2013;79 and 1980&#x2013;81. We have found that we can save &#x00A3;250 million of these &#x00A3;280 million, the overwhelming majority, through school meals, school milk and transport. I have no doubt that noble Lords opposite cherish very dearly school meals and free transport and milk, and I do not cast any doubts on their motives for doing so. Nevertheless, it seems to me that we are at least right to ask ourselves whether it is the major function of the great education service to be involved in catering and transport to that degree. I should have thought that that was, or should be, relatively uncontroversial. We have decided that the emphasis of expenditure should be on what education is fundamentally designed to do.<lb/>
As to the question of spending in the National Health Service I think I can do
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0493"/>
<col>969</col>
no more than repeat the words of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Services. He said:
<quote>" Spending in the NHS in the coming year, as I have repeatedly promised, will remain at the previously planned level."</quote>
Here again is a stabilisation rather than a cuts programme. He went on:
<quote>" Though there has been a tight squeeze this year because of cash limits and the economic situation, the planned volume of spending for next year is in line with last year's White Paper, that is a 3 per cent. increase over the latest estimate for this year."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01944"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt so late, but, very quickly, on school transport, it is essential in the rural areas. How are the children to get to school? They will probably have to go about six miles by bus. This is the pattern in the rural areas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01945"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no doubt that it is essential. The question is, Who pays for it? That is what is being discussed. No one is arguing that it is not essential. We are saying that we think that the public can make a greater contribution in that area in order to preserve the services elsewhere. As part of the reduction the Government are seeking in local spending generally, it is unavoidable, of course, that there has to be some curtailment of expenditure in the personal social services. Yet, despite this, as I said in an intervention when the noble Lord, Lord Brooks, was speaking, social security expenditure will in fact rise by about 1 per cent., &#x00A3;230 million, in the next financial year; and that point was covered by my noble friend Lord Soames.<lb/>
My Lords, remarks were made about prescription charges. I certainly would regret the increase of any charges to the public. Ideally, one would like not to preside over charges of any kind whatsoever, but I would point out that, in real terms, prescription charges are only about 2 or 3 per cent. up on their level in 1971; and, again, our analysis is that people are perfectly able and willing to bear them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01946"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: But, my Lords, why did not the Government say this during the election campaign? There was an absolute denial by Mrs. Thatcher that she would increase prescription charges. Now we find they
<col>970</col>
are being increased twice within 12 months of the election of a Conservative Government. That is what is so disreputable about the whole thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01947"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must say I cast very grave doubts on whether my right honourable friend made any such forward commitment in the context which the noble Lord has mentioned. The other thing I would point out to the noble Lord is that I am here to speak for the Government. I am not talking about what was said in a totally different context in an election campaign. If my right honourable friend made a remark which the noble Lord contests or which he thinks was unfair or out of court, I suggest he writes to her. He will get a very rapid reply.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Castle, I think raised the prescription charge issue, school meals and transport, with which I have tried to deal. As to the question of merging overseas development into the Foreign Office, I think it is a little cynical to be so critical of it or to assume that aid would fall consistently. As my noble friend Lord Soames said in his remarks, the provision of aid that we can make to other countries obviously has an influence on getting down our rate of inflation and on our being able to expand our services, including that one. I do not think that that kind of amalgamation is necessarily as gloomy as the noble Lord allowed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, and my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, as well as the noble Lord, Lord Roberthall, really gave the message that I would like to underline on the trade unions issues. I do not think it was fair to say that there were attacks from this side of the House on trades union affairs. What we were trying to point out to the union movement is that whatever has gone wrong, wherever the fault lies, whether with the Government, with the management or with the unions, the brutal fact is that workers in this country, who are more protected in law and have more powerful bodies to protect and look after their interests than in any other country in the Western industrial world, are, in fact, worse off And this share of wealth (if you like) is decreasing rather than increasing. That is something that we feel may have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0494"/>
<col>971</col>
something to do with the balance of power between management and the unions. I must say that all the information and research that we have done and all the information that we have suggests that this view is shared by an overwhelming majority of trades union members themselves, including many of those who do not support us politically.<lb/>
I agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, in his excellent maiden speech, about mobility. It is a great worry; and we in the Department of Employment are looking for ways of improving it. But we do not think, with great respect, that the housing policies of the outgoing Administration were burning incentives to mobility. The noble Lord said that he thought there was a provocative element&#x2014;and I recognise that he tried to be uncontroversial&#x2014;about the upper rates of tax; although I still think that 60 per cent. is pretty high, I would say to him that the standard rate went down as well.<lb/>
On the curtailment of the National Enterprise Board, again we have no doctrinaire objection to Governments funding programmes in the public sector or in industry. As my noble friend said, we are involved in over 50 per cent. of the economy. It is a question of choosing the most efficient location and of trying to find what we can afford. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, I have already mentioned. His message was that we should not always confuse Governments with the people they govern. Often, there are conflicts of interest between them.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, gave a fascinating speech. He said privately to me&#x2014;and I hope he will forgive me for mentioning this&#x2014;that perhaps he should have sent it to me a little earlier so that we could see what exactly he was asking us to do. If I got his points aright, he said he was critical of the fact that the White Paper says public expenditure growth is the cause of inflation. It also shows that the public expenditure planning fell by 2&#x00BD; per cent. between 1974&#x2013;75 and 1978&#x2013;79. The White Paper says that high taxation and high Government borrowing fuelled inflation. I acknowledge that. I would have thought it a reasonably unexceptional statement. I would only
<col>972</col>
add to Lord Kaldor's figures that the inflation was also lower last year than in 1974&#x2013;75. It was half the level of 1974 and one-third of that of 1975.<lb/>
One of the reasons we believe that it was lower is because the last Administration courageously undertook not merely a stabilising exercise in public expenditure but the largest cut in one year in public expenditure&#x2014;one of &#x00A3;4,000 million&#x2014;that has happened since the war. We think they were on the right lines then and, in fairness to us, so do many of their outgoing Treasury Ministers. There has been evidence to this effect from Mr. Healey, from the noble Lord, Lord Lever, and from Mr. Joel Barnett. Also, we might put Lord Kaldor's question upside down. Does he think that greatly increased public expenditure and increased taxation would he a recipe for the kind of revival that we all want?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01948"><member>Lord KALDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. He did not mention that the last Government brought down the rate of inflation from 25 per cent. to 7 per cent. very largely as a result of incomes policy and nothing to do with cuts of Government expenditure, some of which happened as a result of the initiative of the International Monetary Fund, as he knows.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01949"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I could intervene and deal with that, my Lords. I know that that is the noble Lord's view; but it is not universally shared by the outgoing Administration. It has been of very great interest to me that the outgoing Administration&#x2014;the Opposition now&#x2014;is moving towards becoming a party which wants to give its experience and weight to incomes policies; and, if I may say so with every deference and humility, I think that is a wise and right move for the Labour Party to take. I have always argued that incomes policies are only workable if there is a massive degree of consent for them. It is also fair to say that this consent towards incomes policies does not exist in the present economy. It is not, as my noble friend said, on offer to this Government, and that might be because this Government is a Conservative Government. In fact, it was not on offer to the last Government, either.<lb/>
I suggest&#x2014;again with all humility&#x2014;that the expenditure programmes and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0495"/>
<col>973</col>
monetary controls which the last Government introduced under the wing of the IMF, if you like, my Lords, or to their courageous benefit, if you prefer to put it that way, did the trick much more effectively. The difficulty about incomes policies is in a sense that they depend on a permanent political coalition on pay issues. Until that is achieved, I do not think they have a chance. To quote the old First World War joke: "If you know of a better hole, go to it". But, at the moment, we are trying to maintain continuity with the previous Government's more effective efforts to get down the rate of inflation.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Irving of Dartford, talked about road improvements in Kent. As one who had the privilege of living in Kent for some years, I share that view. He said that was a need to hold back expenditure, and money supply is important for any Government. But he then moved on to the same incomes policy point. I repeat that this would have more conviction if noble Lords opposite and the Opposition party in another place would tell us how they are going to obtain consent in this economy for a permanent incomes policy.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford made the point that the cuts which are being contemplated as a result of our stabilising public expenditure, and having to increase it in our judgment in certain key areas, such as defence and law and order, are not even 50 per cent. of the 1976 cuts of the Labour Government. I am not criticising them for making those cuts; I am saying that the association of savage cuts with this Government may or may not prove to be an effective piece of political propaganda; but I hope that noble Lords opposite are wise enough not to start believing it as anything other than propaganda.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Jacques, mentioned the incomes policy point, and I think that I have dealt with that. What I would say about social services&#x2014;in which he has a long and distinguished interest&#x2014;is that the provision of social services next year depends to a very large degree on what happens in the wage round this year. If I may say this with respect to the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, she did not, when talking about where we
<col>974</col>
were focusing our stabilising or reductions of expenditure, mention the wage factor in this equation. If people, let us say, in local government wish to take 70 per cent. or more of the rate support grant monies given by any Government&#x2014;given by the Government of which she was a distinguished member, and a member in local government areas&#x2014;in terms of wages, that leaves, obviously, much less for certain kinds of services. No one has worked out how one can distribute money in terms of wages and services simultaneously.<lb/>
I would warn noble Lords, on my own side as well as opposite, that if local government expenditure continues to be absorbed by wages at the rate which has applied recently, because it is quite clear that there is not public or political tolerance for great rises in local taxation, the only way in which these wages can be met is by the reduction of services.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Murray of Gravesend, made a good roustabout political speech, much of which I enjoyed, and especially the bit where he said he was not fighting the last election over again. There will be many occasions for me, as a Minister concerned with employment, to return to him on the question of union legislation and our union proposals. He must not consider that the <i>Daily Mail</i> is the voice of the Conservative Party. There are many different emphases in the Conservative Party and, in fact, if we are swapping stories about journalism, one of the things that surprised and pleased me was that the most complimentary write-up of the Prime Minister's closing speech at the Tory Party Conference came in fact from the <i>Guardian</i> and was written by Mr. Peter Jenkins.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Spens and Lord Castle, mentioned micro-electronics. That, I think, is too vast a subject for me to go into now, but I would say I am personally very involved in this in our department. I hope we shall not take the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Spens, initiated an interesting debate earlier in the Government's tenure of office as meaning that we shall not hear some more. My department is bringing out a major study which was initiated by the last Government and, seeing that it is published, I can tell you that it is not nearly so gloomy about employment prospects as
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0496"/>
<col>975</col>
some of the remarks we have heard here this afternoon.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Spells, mentioned taxation issues in regard to small businesses. My noble friend Lord Selsdon talked about corporation tax issues. I would just say to the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, that of course inflation is an enormous form of tax on business; and if one can get down the rate of inflation, that is surely the way one can ease taxation on business. One must, as it were, mentally&#x2014;if we still have not an economy developed enough to do this actually&#x2014;index companies' profits, if they are to have any real meaning.<lb/>
I am grateful to my noble friend Lord De La Warr for bringing us a message from the CBI Conference in Birmingham. It did not escape him, nor will it escape the rest of the House, that the CBI want us to go a great deal further on the closed shop than we are at present proposing. We will, of course, listen to what they have to say, but our instinct is that we wish to proceed at the same rate as we are suggesting in our Manifesto. We would not outlaw the closed shop, which many industrialists accept as being a way of continuing good industrial relations in this country, but we want to protect people who suffer as a result of its abuse. In that, we seem to be very near to the trade unions' own suggestions to the outgoing Government, though I acknowledge they would not like to see it enshrined in legislation. We think that is essential.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, was critical of management in respect of the loss of the motor-cycle industry. I think management was reasonably good in domestic terms, but what has gone wrong since the war is that the domestic market, as my noble friend Lord Soames pointed out, has not been enough to maintain the very costly high technology investment that modern industries need. In a sense, it is certainly management's and not the workers' fault that world markets in the motor-cycle industry were not picked up. I would agree with him there. He talked about failure to invest in manufacturing industry. I would point out to him the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Lever&#x2014;I apologise for continuing to praise him in this way&#x2014;namely, that there s no difficulty in getting money for invest-
<col>976</col>
ment in this economy; the difficulty is to find profitable ventures for the money to grow in.<lb/>
Coming to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Vernon, he said the philosophy of our Manifesto was broadly expected and accepted by the electorate, and I certainly do not disagree with that. He also pointed out that Mr. Healey and outgoing Ministers would have had to make cuts in their expenditure as well; and I endorse that also.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Simon, echoed the question put to me the other day by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear&#x2014;a Liberal Party view. It is certainly the case that we must take measures in order to see that local authorities who try to retract their spending are not penalised against local authorities who do not. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment will be making an announcement to that effect quite shortly.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Brooks, asked me how the Government would ensure that the vulnerable do not suffer, because the Government cannot impose their own priorities on local government. He made the case forcefully, but slightly weakened it, if I may say so, by saying that he did not want the Government, or any Government, to tell local authorities exactly what they should do. But as the White Paper recognises, individual local authorities&#x2014;as I am sure he would agree&#x2014;must have freedom to decide how best they should achieve savings in the light of local needs and conditions, and I would add to that local lobbying and local pressures.<lb/>
I think the task which we have set local government must be kept in some perspective. The authorities in England and Wales have been asked to reduce their current expenditure by 2&#x00BD; per cent. over the two-year period from now to 1981. Two and a half per cent. is what we are asking to come off there. But the key, as I said earlier, is wages. If local government cannot resist wages, then they may have to cut services. I think, therefore, that it has been a very useful debate. The difficulty to us of the contributions from the other side is not a wide philosophical gulf, but that we feel that those points should really have been addressed to outgoing Ministers, who have suffered some of the same difficulties and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0497"/>
<col>977</col>
problems as we do; and we want them to cost their criticisms as they make them.<lb/>
To deal, finally and rapidly, with the points made to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, I will of course write to her about the arts issue. As I understand it&#x2014;and I say this provisionally&#x2014;the arts have come off quite well exactly because of the presence of the Heritage Fund. But I think that even she would agree that in a general atmosphere of expenditure stabilisation the arts could not expect to be exempt altogether.<lb/>
She put to me some points which particularly affect my department. Again, it is dull at this stage of the evening to swap figures, but the youth opportunities programme, of which I am in charge, and which has an excellent record for putting young people who are difficult to employ, and who are not getting employment, into real employment has, in fact, been expanded again and not cut. I regret, too, that the selective temporary employment programme, STEP, has had to be focused on the areas of greatest need. But the noble Baroness's Government, which set up STEP, designed it to deal with the long-term unemployed. Many of the STEP schemes that are going&#x2014;and we regret this&#x2014;are in areas with very small pockets indeed of longterm unemployed, and we are concentrating them in Merseyside and other places where long-term unemployed can be found.<lb/>
We are trying to get back, if you like, to reality. Perhaps it is our fault&#x2014;I do not know. Nevertheless, there seems to be a gap between the two sides of the House in this debate as to what is ideology and what is reality. I personally am not enormously interested in ideology. I rather like spending other people's money; it is one of the most enjoyable functions of a Minister's life. But I recognise that that money has to be earned. I also recognise that the only future for the kind of great public services which we admire in this country is that the wealth and tax basis, as my noble friend said, should increase; and until we can get it to increase we have no chances at all in this direction. </membercontribution></p>

<col>982</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01971">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01972">To ask Her Majesty's Government what further measures they plan to increase price competition in the manufacturing and marketing of spectacle frames.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01973"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no measures are planned to increase price competition among manufacturers. On marketing, the Price Commission found that the General Optical Council's rules on publicity limited the information available to the consumer and created a situation in which competition could not be promoted. My right honourable friends are considering whether any further measures may be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01974"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has my noble friend seen the report in the <i>Optician</i> dated 21st September that the General Optical Council's disciplinary committee has found one of its members guilty of displaying the price of spectacle frames in his window, and that, as a result of agreeing to remove this notice he has not been struck off the register? Would not my noble friend think that this is a case where, in order to encourage price competition in an area where spectacle frames are now costing up to &#x00A3;30 and even more, a measure of this sort should not be permitted, and should be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading with some sense of urgency?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01975"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fully understand my noble friend's anxiety on this subject. Some time ago the Price Commission investigated Dollond and Aitchison. The Commission made no recommendations about the company's prices, charges or margins, but included in the report to the previous Secretary of State a number of non-statutory observations, including one dealing with price display. The General Optical Council, however, declined to reconsider its present restrictions on publicity. I understand that the Director General of Fair Trading has had certain of the professional and commercial aspects of opticians' activities under review but has not completed his consideration of this question.</membercontribution></p>

I fully appreciate the point of the noble Lord's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01978"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord whether he would ask his right honourable friend to have a look at the present range of frames, which many of us feel could be considerably improved at really no extra cost?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01979"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord referring to NHS frames? I think there is work going on on this matter at the moment, and there is consultation between officials and industry with a view to increasing the range. Unfortunately it will mean quite substantial cost, and it is unlikely that any action will be taken just at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01980"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that hundreds of people are taking their prescriptions abroad when they go on holiday because the prices of frames are so much cheaper abroad? Indeed, on a holiday myself on the tiny island of Gozo, the one and only optician reported that he had 500 pairs previously ordered. The lenses were ordered from England and came from there, but the frames were one third and one half of the price of comparable frames here.</membercontribution></p>

There is really no purpose in doing away with resale price maintenance when a self-appointed body can make it illegal to display the prices in the window. This does not make sense and it does not protect the consumer, and I hope some urgent action will be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01985"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the views that my noble friend has expressed are, I know, widely shared, and in general the Government favour the encouragement of competition in preference to control, but they have not yet decided whether specific action can yet be taken.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INSULATION GRANTS: LOFT ACCESSIBILITY</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-01987"><member>Lord AIREDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01988">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01989">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, since a number of the 5 million dwellings without loft insulation have no practical means of access to a loft, they will authorise grants up to the same &#x00A3;50 maximum for other approved means of insulation of such dwellings</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01990"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, the most cost-effective use of our limited resources is to secure the insulation of lofts and hot water tanks, wherever this is practicable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01991"><member>Lord AIREDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord, but is not this rather cold comfort for the people who live in these houses? If a householder is prepared to pay very much more out of his own resources towards, for instance, double glazing in the living room, provided he can have a &#x00A3;50 grant to start him off, is that not &#x00A3;50 very well spent?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01992"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take the noble Lord's point and it is a point I shall bring to my right honourable friend's attention. Basically,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0501"/>
<col>985</col>
as the noble Lord and the House are aware, heat is lost through the ceiling, and I quite agree that there is quite a large element of draughts. But it is the cost-effectiveness which is the important point. There are some 2 million houses, such as the noble Lord described, without loft accessibility. There are still 3 million which have accessibility for lofts which have not yet been insulated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01993"><member>Lord STRABOLGI</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are the Government aware that very often when a householder spends a lot of money on putting in insulation in order to conserve energy, the rating authorities then come along and increase the rateable value? May I ask the noble Lord whether he will try to do something about this? In the Department of Energy there was great concern, but we were not able to do anything with his department. Can he try to have more success than I had?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01994"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord in his last sentence answered the question. I shall certainly advise my right honourable friends and they will note what he said, but I expect the same answer will come back.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01995"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, even with the incentive of the &#x00A3;50 grant, is it not taking an inordinately long time, as shown by the figure given by the Minister&#x2014;of 3 million houses remaining uninsulated&#x2014;for this work to be carried out? Would the Minister consider making it mandatory on local authorities to install roof insulation and giving them the power to recover the capital expenditure in the form of a small increase in rents which would allow those capital charges to be met?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01996"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was only a week ago today that the Government started a new scheme allowing people in public authority housing to have this right to insulate their lofts. As from that date, a week ago today, we have started a large advertising campaign, especially in areas in the Midlands where previously the take-up of the grant was not as great as we would have wished, and we are strongly advising all local authorities to give every access possible. Furthermore, for older and poorer people the new rules will allow people to get
<col>986</col>
the &#x00A3;50 grant without having to show a paid receipt. I think this will be a help in the take-up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01997"><member>Lord AIREDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the argument being relied on is that not all the grants available are being taken up for loft insulation, may I ask the noble Lord if this is not an argument in favour of widening the scheme slightly so as to enable other people to have other forms of approved insulation grant-aided?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01998"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure whether the noble Lord is not back on his original Question. He is pushing at an open door if he wants to know what our wishes are; we would wish everyone to live in as perfect a house as possible, but what we are trying to do with our limited resources is to make sure that they get the best use possible of those limited resources.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-01999"><member>Lord GLENAMARA</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord to say whether the new rules change a very silly part of the old rules whereby a householder who had done a very small part of the insulation himself was ineligible for grant? Surely it was a ridiculous state of affairs that people who helped themselves could get no grant?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02000"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has always been said that individual cases do not necessarily make good law. One feels sad at these cases, but the rules have always been there and they must apply before one can get something.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARAB BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02001">3.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02002"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02003">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02004">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they have taken to combat the Arab boycott of Israel.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02005"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government have consistently and clearly stated their opposition to the boycott and have expressed the wish that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0502"/>
<col>987</col>
firms should take their attitude into account when deciding whether or how far to comply with boycott requirements. Both our posts overseas and the Department of Trade are willing to give all the help and advice they can to exporters who encounter problems. Your Lordships may have seen my Written Answer of 5th November to a Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, which related to the authentication of certificates of negative origin.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02006"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for what he said, may I ask if he would not agree that we are really succumbing to blackmail&#x2014;which I call "blackmail"&#x2014;against a people, the Israeli people, with whom a favourable balance of trade has continued for many years? Are we not treating that customer, an old customer, shamefully? Will the noble Lord please study what the Dutch Government have done in regard to these certificates? Will he be good enough to explain to those who approach him with a view to succumbing to that form of "blackmoil" that the United States have passed anti-boycott laws, yet trade with the Arab countries concerned has increased vastly in spite of it? Why cannot we do the same?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02007"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot answer for the United States, my Lords. We have to judge this matter from our own British interests and we judge our interests presently anyway, that we should continue with the procedures that we have been following for the last year or so, with the minor change I announced the other day. As for the Dutch position to which the noble Lord referred, it is true that a number of resolutions have passed through the Dutch Parliament recently, but these have not yet been brought into law by the Dutch Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02008"><member>Lord BYERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister accept that in many quarters his Written Answer is regarded as purely cosmetic? When will the Government take the decision to end the discriminatory operation of validating these negative certificates of origin?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02009"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we will do that when we judge it in our interest to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<col>988</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02010"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Government confirm and agree that recent indications in certain Arab quarters of a desire to help to induce a more rational attitude in Iran towards the West gives some hope that the Government, in concert with others, possibly in the European Community, might now approach the Arab community with a request that they should revise their policy of boycott against Israel?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02011"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we would certainly be ready to discuss this question in the European forum should it be raised, but we know of no desire that it should be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02012"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does that mean that the United Kingdom representation in Europe would not raise it themselves but wait for somebody else to raise it? Surely this is a very worthwhile initiative that our own Government should take in Brussels?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02013"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: We have no plans to raise it at present, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02014"><member>Lord BYERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, remembers telling the House that the British Government&#x2014;that is, the last Government&#x2014;would never want to be seen ahead of the pack? If that is so, is it not time this Government changed that policy and got ahead of the pack in the European Community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02015"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can go no further than I did before when I said that we will do that only when we judge it to be in our interests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02016"><member>Lord REDCLIFFE-MAUD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that in the Select Committee, which was drawn from all parts of the House and of which Lord Caccia was a member, there was unanimity in rejecting the evidence of the Foreign Office, given that the authentication was merely of the signature and did not imply any approval of the boycott document? Is he aware that we felt very strongly in that committee that the Government should get out of the boycott process in which they are now involved and will continue to be involved until they cease this authentication process?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0503"/>
<col>989</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02017"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the authentication process, as the noble Lord and the members of that committee will know, is only the authentication of the signature to the document; it has no relation to the content or accuracy of the document itself. We have recently taken steps, as I announecd the other day, to make that doubly clear to those who use this service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02018"><member>Lord PAGET of NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as in the case earlier in regard to Nigeria, are we not here concerned with what is a British interest because open trade with. Israel is as much a British interest as it is an Israeli interest? Is this not just another instance of the weak-kneed attitude of the Foreign Office in defending the interests of this country whenever they are challenged by any crackpot regimes throughout the world?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02019"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: Certainly not, my Lords. British interest in terms of trade with the Arab countries is just as important as trade with Israel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02020"><member>Lord JANNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I put a last question to the noble Lord? Will he be good enough to study the position with regard to the American situation? Is he aware that none of the fears that were expressed when the anti-boycott legislation was under consideration have been justified and that, instead, trade has increased very considerably? Is he further aware that at the present time most of the Arab world is not included in the boycott and that we have nothing to fear from blackmail any more?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02021"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said earlier, I cannot answer for the Government of the United States. We have to judge our interests as we find them, and the American Government must do likewise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02022"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord whether he will clarify one point? Is he in fact saying that the Government will support the Arab boycott of Israel if it is in the financial interest of this country to do so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02023"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. The Government oppose all boycotts which lack international sanction and authority. We deplore the limitations
<col>990</col>
which the Arab boycott imposes on the commercial freedom of our firms and the extraneous political considerations it introduces into the conduct of our economic and commercial relations with Israel and the Arab States.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02024"><member>Lord JACQUES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that eight months ago from the place where he is now sitting I gave exactly the same answers as he has given? There is at least one thing on which we are agreed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02025"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am interested to hear that, and it confirms my view that our predecessors were just as anxious as we are to maintain British interests.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02038"><member>Lord BIRKETT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a third time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02039">Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Birkett.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02040"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill touches upon a very narrow point inasmuch as it implements recommendation No. 219 of the Royal Commission on Gambling, and what it does is to remove from Parliament powers to decide the amount of money that could be won at the game of linked bingo, and in future, if the Bill receives the Royal Assent, that power would be vested in the Home Secretary, who can make an order by regulation. I supported the Bill on Second Reading, and I do not dissent from it now; but of course it has an added importance in view of the debate in another place on the 29th of last month, from which it seems that the report of the Royal Commission on Gambling is to go the way of all the other reports of Royal Commissions since the end of the war. In other words, it is going to be swept under the carpet. The little bits that peep out are those that are inescapable&#x2014;they just cannot be hidden. This one is of some importance because linked bingo is tied up with a game which both the Royal Commission and the Home Secretary regard as a neighbourly occupation; so it is, in just the same way as racing taking place at Cartmel or Plumpton
<col>992</col>
is also racing. But racing at those two small and very agreeable courses is not the same thing as racing at Epsom, York, or Ascot. It is in some way rather different, and it has to be treated on a different basis.<lb/>
What has happened is this. The figure of &#x00A3;1,000 mentioned in the gaming Act of 1968 has lost all contact with reality. It is perfectly true that the majority of those who play bingo&#x2014;housey! housey! in my days in the Army&#x2014;do it on a neighbourly basis. But it is kept alive, in just the same way as Ascot, Epsom and York races are kept alive, because it is a great event; and those who go to smaller meetings pay some attention. Therefore linked bingo&#x2014;the possibility of going along one night in the week and winning an astronomical sum&#x2014;is an inducement or encouragement to people to maintain an interest in what I should regard as a somewhat boring pursuit if pursued every night of the week for ever and ever. But the amount that can be won must have a marked effect upon the interest that is maintained in that game. Both the present Administration and the previous Administration paid lip service to it in as much as there was an interdepartmental report on gambling&#x2014;a report of the Home Office, may I say. They shied away from the recommendations because there was a recommendation to put a limit on football pools. Once you put a limit on football pools, the interest in that subject would quickly wane, with a marked loss to the Revenue. So that one, too, was shelved.<lb/>
The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead replied&#x2014;and I do not in any way condemn this; it is a difficult subject; he was new in office, and I was cautious&#x2014;and he accepted in toto the recommendation of the Royal Commission. That is to say, they recommended that in future the matter should be dealt with by regulation, being taken away from the Act. But they went a little further. What they said was that the new figure should take account only of the future rate of inflation, and should not take into account past inflation. Again, I do not dissent from that. I was heartened by the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, in his reply said that the Gaming Board would be consulted. May I say that the reason for my joy on that was that I have every confidence in the Gaming Board and no
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0505"/>
<col>993</col>
confidence at all in the Home Office advisers. So the fact that the Gaming Board was going to be consulted cheered me up no end. But when the Secretary of State replied the other night he did not say the same thing. He said that he recommended the recommendation of the Royal Commission which of course, as I say, limits the increase to be given to the board of &#x00A3;1,000 for future inflation. But he went on to say that not all the inflationary tendencies would be taken into account. In other words, whereas Lord Belstead, when he was replying, said he stood foursquare on the recommendations of the Royal Commission, the Home Secretary used the word "all"&#x2014;and the use of the word "all" means it must be part of it&#x2014;and hinted that the new figure is going to be in excess. I tell your Lordships, Lord Belstead and the Home Office that what they have decided has created a sense of grievance in the associations concerned with the playing of bingo, because all the other activities which are similar in character have had an increase which has taken into full account the inflationary increases. I presume that in fact the &#x00A3;1,000 would be several thousand pounds if that factor was taken into account.<lb/>
My Lords, what one wants to do is to try to find a way round this with the least possible friction. I would not ask Lord Belstead, when he replies today, to make a definitive statement; that would be quite unfair. What I would ask him to do is to go away, see what the Home Secretary said and what he himself said, talk the matter over with the Gaming Board and then see what needs to be done. In other words, I do not in any way detract from the conclusion that the Home Secretary should make up his mind in consultation with the Gaming Board, but I think it would be quite wrong here to just say "&#x00A3;1,000". May I say that the Royal Commission, when they were deciding, used the word "present". When does "present" mean? Does it mean when they came to that conclusion, before the Royal Commission's report was printed, or does it mean the 12th July last year, when the Royal Commission's report was published?<lb/>
Anyway, I do not want to stress this point, because I do not want to detain your Lordships too long on this subject;
<col>994</col>
but it has an importance because there is no subject which your Lordships consider in any Parliamentary Session which makes a greater impact on the lives of ordinary people than does this subject. Your Lordships may feel that that should not he so, and perhaps it should not. But there is an estimate given by the research unit of the Home Office itself which shows that 80 per cent. of the adult population of this country gambled during the course of the year, and the figure given by the Home Secretary in another place ran into many thousand million pounds. So what is done in this respect is of paramount importance. It is also of paramount importance, may l say, to the Revenue, for this reason. It is very hard that the Labour Party never shouts from the mountain tops about the things it achieves, but, in this field, when it came into office in 1964 there was a total revenue from gambling of &#x00A3;33 million, whereas now it is touching the &#x00A3;400 million mark, which is a very considerable sum of money indeed.<lb/>
The Royal Commission's terms of reference required that they should pay attention to the need to help British sport as a whole, and they were asked subsequently to present an interim report, which they did. They came up with what was virtually a coconut. They said, "National lottery". On this particular point, the Home Secretary has said, "No decision on this". Of course he does not take a decision on it, because politically this is very awkward indeed. I say that because if you have a national lottery you are going to cut very heavily into the activities of the pools, and, of course, not only is that very important from the Revenue's point of view, it also has its repercussions through the ballot box. So, as with the interdepartmental report, it is severely left alone. But one of the things that astonishes me more than anything else is the way in which the Home Secretary brushes on one side not only what the Royal Commision has to say but what the Home Office's own research unit says in the course of a preface to a document, which your Lordships can obtain from the Vote Office, entitled <i>Gambling&#x2014;A review of the literature.</i>It is interesting that this research unit was operating before the Royal Commission, yet the Royal Commission was never told of its existence; and only at a later date did they see the report in draft.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0506"/>
<col>995</col>
What we find in this preface is the statement that information about this subject&#x2014;which, as I say, touches the majority of adults in this country, produces a vast revenue and can be open to the greatest abuses&#x2014;is very poor indeed. In the case of the Royal Commission, in Recommendation 4.5 they said:
<quote>"The conclusion is inescapable, both from the work of this Royal Commission and from that of the Home Office, that there is a serious shortage of reliable and accessible information about gambling in the United Kingdom".</quote>
They went on, in Recommendation 25.7, to say:
<quote>"We found an almost total absence of information about the financial state of the industry and its component parts".</quote>
In Recommendation I they said:
<quote>"The Government should establish a gambling research unit to monitor and study the incidence, sociology and psychology of gambling";</quote>
and Recommendation 2 of the Royal Commission was that the unit should be funded by the Home Office.<lb/>
I do not complain that the Home Office turned that recommendation down. Although they have a responsibility to this House and to the country, the fact is that they turned it down. Well and good. I have no complaint that they turned down the setting up of a research unit into the sociology and psychology of gambling: but I do think it should be brought to your Lordships' attention, or to somebody's attention&#x2014;perhaps a future Gibbon, when he comes to write <i>The Decline and Fall of Great Britain</i>&#x2014;that, in relation to this subject, even the merest attempts to understand the facts of the situation are thrust on one side, and they are left, I would suggest, to fester, as they have festered in the past, to produce a very grave social evil.<lb/>
This is not the only point. Again, I do not want to detain your Lordships too long, but this is the only opportunity one will have to deal with this matter because, judging by past experience, apart from (I must keep in order) a not very useful debate in another place, that will be the end of it; and, as far as I am concerned, I certainly do not want to take part in any debate in which no attempt is made to understand the basic facts.<lb/>
My Lords, let me deal with one particular point, again of some importance.
<col>996</col>
The Home Secretary, in the course of his speech, referred to what he regarded as a recommendation of the Royal Commission on what he described as "avoidance". He referred to avoidance on a massive scale of the impact of the levy; and reference is made to the Royal Commission's recommendation in this respect. There could not be a greater confusion, because the Home Secretary then goes on to say that he would be prepared to introduce a Government measure if he could be assured there would be no opposition; but in the absence of that, he would welcome and would give support to a Private Member's Bill to deal with this subject.<lb/>
But the trouble which has arisen&#x2014;and I want to invite your Lordships' attention, particularly the attention of members of the Labour Party, to how it has come about&#x2014;has arisen from totally different circumstances. If the Home Secretary says, "I am in fact going to adhere first to Lord Birkett's Bill" and says what he understands is going to happen in another place, then, if we are going to get another Private Member's Bill, or even a Government measure, we ought to know how that has come about. It has come about because the Levy Board has run out of money, and it has run out of money because of this avoidance clause, which in fact has nothing to do with it at all. The avoidance, which was dealt with by the Royal Commission in some detail, arises where a group of companies can be restructured just before 1st April in such a way as to avoid what are regarded as their lawful liabilities.<lb/>
The real difficulty arises because the Levy Board, with the approval of the Home Office, has loaned &#x00A3;2,700,000, free of interest, to the Duke of Richmond to rebuild Goodwood at a time when we are very hard up. Again, racing is conducted in such a way that a yearling can be sold for &#x00A3;650,000. An average of more than &#x00A3;30,000 could be obtained for each horse. Astronomical sums of money are to be made because of lax administration. The result is that advantage is taken of that and the money is not available simply because the Levy Board, in order to deal, itself and without consultation with the Home Office, with the difficulties thrown up by restructuring, chose to do so by making the levy payable
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0507"/>
<col>997</col>
not on the previous year's turnover, as has happened ever since the legislation was introduced, but on the current year's turnover. Therefore, as they can make only one assessment, they are without the means of collecting the money until the end of the year. So they spend in advance money that they have not got and run into difficulties. The Home Office, without regard at all to the consequences, propose to sponsor it, or to give it their blessing.<lb/>
I am not saying that these matters should not be dealt with; but I am saying that, before dealing with them, we need to take into account the effect of the Government's lack of interest in the problems thrown up by the Royal Commission as a whole. Unless they do that, the most serious results are going to follow for British sport as a whole. One of the purposes of the Royal Commission&#x2014;and they requested an interim report&#x2014;was that British sport should benefit; but, as a result of local government cuts last week and of the fact that the Home Secretary has tended to ignore it or has indicated that there is no opportunity for legislation, British sport, as we know it, as it is carried on on the village green through voluntary organisations, is going virtually to come to an end. Some &#x00A3;50 million is going to be taken off it through local government cuts and any prospect of help from central Government is just not a starter. I am talking of all that range of sporting activities for which our nation in the past has been famous. It is said that there are 64 of them. The Home Secretary last week touched only on three; he touched on those three only very ineffectively. The result is going to be that the voluntary spirit, the voluntary efforts, are going to come to nothing.<lb/>
I could weary your Lordships by giving more examples. I well understand that these are boring matters for those who do not want to listen. But so long a I am in this place I intend to take the opportunities to speak on them. It will be the only opportunity of expressing my views on the way this problem is going to be handled. So far as I am concerned, I do not want my opinions to be foisted upon anyone&#x2014;even to the point of boring. But there is one difference between me and the

Government. I do my homework before and not after. That is the claim I make and it is one that I can substantiate.<lb/>
I have been right on previous occasions. I came along on my own, opposed the Private Member's Bill and said that it ought to be a Government measure. We have had the piddling 1976 Act. The only reward that I get for that and will get on this occasion is to be able to say "I told you so". I am telling your Lordships again now that British sport through voluntary efforts, be it racing, football, greyhound racing, is all going to suffer&#x2014;and needlessly, not through lack of cash but through lack of interest; and because people will not do their homework or, when somebody else does it, they will not listen. They get bored. I am sorry that I bored your Lordships but I do not apologise.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord did not bore me at all, but he has mystified me slightly. On Monday in this House I was asked a Question by the noble Lord and, as I understood it, he was seeking an assurance that gaming and the Gaming Board were in no way related to horse racing. Here we are, having enjoyed some 20 minutes of the noble Lord in which he has been at pains to show that on a Gaming Bill it is appropriate to talk about betting and the Levy Board. However, I leave that on one side.<lb/>
The noble Lord made one specific point so far as this Bill is concerned. He suggested that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary in making a speech in another place on 29th October had contradicted words that I had ventured to put to your Lordships on the Second Reading of Lord Birkett's Bill. I should like to assure your Lordships and the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, that on 29th October my right honourable friend in no way intended to modify in any way what I said on the Second Reading of the Bill. The references to my right honourable friend's words are to be found (I think I am right) in cols. 853 and 854 of the House of Commons <i>Official Report</i>on 29th October.<lb/>

May I add only that I had not intended to intervene on this Bill because on Second Reading the Government made it plain that they supported Lord Birkett's Bill, that they would have liked themselves to have legislated on the subject. but that in this Session there was no legislative time for a major Bill on gaming. Therefore, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Birkett for introducing the Bill which has its Third Reading today.</membercontribution></p>

For one wild moment I wondered whether my next task should be to withdraw my Motion for Papers, but I recalled myself and instead will humbly beg your Lordships to agree to the Motion that this Bill be now read a third time.<lb/>

<title>BILL OF RIGHTS BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02044">3.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02045"><member>Lord WADE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. In recent years there has been a groundswell of opinion in favour of some form of Bill of Rights. I think that there are a number of reasons. There is growing unease as to whether we enjoy adequate protection against encroachments on individual liberties. Then there is a belief that our Parliamentary system is not entirely satisfactory. For example, Governments may, and often do, come into power not representing a majority of the electors. They may nevertheless claim to have a mandate and introduce legislation to which perhaps the majority of the electors are opposed. There are no special safeguards, apart from public opinion, against measures affecting what some would regard as their basic liberties.<lb/>
Turning to international obligations, it is true that the United Kingdom has signed and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Yet to some this seems remote
<col>1000</col>
and the procedures are undoubtedly slow. Also there is one other relevant consideration: whereas on the whole I think Britain has a good record on human rights&#x2014;I think we have reason to be thankful&#x2014;nevertheless, there is damaging publicity which often follows when cases are taken to the Human Rights Court and Britain is in the dock. It may be unfair: certainly it is at times exasperating and harmful. If we look around the world, scarecely a week passes when we do not hear of some breach of human rights which we deplore. I think we are justified in joining in protests against these breaches when they occur. Nevertheless, critics of Britain do not miss an opportunity of using reports of cases at the Human Rights Court to discredit Britain and to minimise the effects of the protests that we may wish to make against what occurs in other parts of the world. That is the background.<lb/>
This Bill, the object of which is to incorporate the provisions of the European Convention into our domestic law, will not solve all these problems. It is a step, but I think an important step. In view of the ground already covered, I do not think one should attempt to go over all the matters; we have had a number of debates on the subject and valuable information from the Select Committee, and the evidence taken by the Select Committee. Therefore, I will not attempt to start from the beginning of the story.<lb/>
It is fair to add that when the convention was drawn up and signed it was not foreseen quite how many occasions there would be when complaints arose which resulted in a case being taken to the Human Rights Court. I do not think it was expected that there would be gaps&#x2014;even if a few&#x2014;in our law which had to be filed. I think it is now recognised that the number of complaints is considerable and that the queue is growing. I also think that it is fair to add, because there has been some misunderstanding on this, that rights already enjoyed would not be diminished by a Bill of this nature. They might be enlarged. The convention could not be interpreted as limiting the rights which we enjoy.<lb/>
In introducing the Second Reading, may I say a few words about the history of this matter. I have introduced a Bill on these lines on three occasions. The first time
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0509"/>
<col>1001</col>
I secured a Second Reading but time did not permit of its proceeding further. On the second occasion, we had a most valuable and interesting debate. The noble and learned Lord who is now the Lord Chancellor will remember this very well because it was then that he moved an amendment to the effect that the Second Reading should be granted on condition that the subject was taken to a Select Committee instead of proceeding on the Floor of the House. I fully agreed with that proposal. I thought that it was a good idea because it widened the whole range of examination and enabled us to take evidence, which we did. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, as your Lordships know, was appointed chairman. I should like to pay my tribute to the conscientious chairmanship which the committee enjoyed during the fairly lengthy discussions of that Select Committee.<lb/>
The conclusions were briefly two-fold: one was that if there was to be a Bill of Rights, it should be along the lines of the Bill that I put forward, with some amendment. Secondly, as to whether there should be a Bill of Rights at all, the Select Committee was divided. The majority was a narrow majority of one, but it was in favour of proceeding with the Bill. However, quite properly, the Committee reported to the House and there was a debate on this report of the Select Committee. That was on 27th November last year. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, presented the report and I moved an amendment the effect of which was that the Bill should proceed with some appropriate amendment. The amendment which I moved was carried by 56 votes to 30.<lb/>
After that, as your Lordships know, there was a General Election and a new Government came into office. I felt that some reasonable time must be allowed to lapse for the Government to consider their position. However, in July I introduced a new Bill and this is the Bill which is now before your Lordships. I am therefore in the unusual position of moving the Second Reading of this Bill for the third time. Whether this can he put down to fate or obstinacy it is a little difficult to say; perhaps it is a combination of the two. As to the time factor and the very full discussion by the Select Committee, I have no regrets. I think
<col>1002</col>
it was very useful that this lengthy examination should take place. The Bill itself is short. I think that there is merit in brevity. I think it is easier to add than to subtract but I recognise that some additional wording might be justified.<lb/>
Looking at the Bill, may I make these few comments. As your Lordships will see from the Long Title, the object is to render the provisions of the European Convention enforceable in the courts of the United Kingdom. May I point out&#x2014;and this is already well known to your Lordships&#x2014;that we are bound by a treaty by the ratification of this convention but ratification of a treaty does not mean that an individual has a right of action in the courts here. That requires an Act of Parliament. That is why it is necessary to be discussing an Act of Parliament.<lb/>
The first clause provides&#x2014;and I am summarising&#x2014;that the convention together with such protocols as shall have been ratified by the Government of the United Kingdom, shall be enforceable by action in the courts of the United Kingdom. In the Bill which was attached to the Select Committee report, which was the Bill before the Committee at that time, certain words were, in the context of that Bill, appropriate. They were:
<quote>"Without any reservations".</quote>
In the new context of this clause, as slightly altered, those words are not appropriate; at any rate, they might give rise to misunderstanding. At the Committee stage I suggest that the words
<quote>"without any reservations"</quote>
should be omitted and replaced with the words
<quote>"subject to any reservations thereto".</quote>
I apologise for entering into details of drafting, but I say this here and now in case anyone has misunderstood the wording of this Clause 1.<lb/>
The second clause deals with the conflict between existing law and the convention and protocols that we ratified, and it provides that the convention and protocols, which we have already agreed to accept by treaty, shall be treated as prevailing if there is a conflict. But under the third clause, which deals primarily with legislation after the passing of this Act, the Bill reads as follows:
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0510"/>
<col>1003</col>
<quote>"In case of conflict &#x2026; any &#x2026; enactment passed after the passing of this Act shall be deemed to be subject to the provisions of the said Convention and Protocols and shall be so construed unless such subsequent enactment provides otherwise or does not admit of any construction compatible with the provisions of this Act".</quote>
I will, if I may, come back to that in a few moments.<lb/>
In the first clause there is one major difference between this Bill and the previous Bill. In the former Bill, the whole of the convention was set out in a schedule. The reason for this was primarily for the convenience of the House, so that anyone who wished could refer to wording of the convention. The question was discussed by the Select Committee as to whether the whole of the convention should be included, namely, all parts of the convention, including those aspects of it which dealt with procedure such as appeals to the Human Rights Court, although of course not parts not ratified or subject to reservations.<lb/>
The Select Committee, after discussing this, were inclined to favour including the whole of the convention and protocols, with the exceptions I have mentioned. If that be so, then I think there is a case for presenting the Bill in this form without setting out the convention and protocols in full in a schedule. It certainly simplifies the Bill, but I am open to advice on the matter and also to the decision of the House.<lb/>
To summarise, in any event the important part to which incorporation is intended to apply is that concerning "rights and freedoms" defined in Section 1 of Schedule 1 of the convention, together with Articles 1 to 3 of Protocol No. 1, subject to the reservation made to Article No. 2 of that first protocol, which relates to education. I am sorry if, without reference to all the articles and protocols this perhaps sounds a little puzzling. I think on reading it, it will appear clear.<lb/>
I turn briefly now to derogation, which the Select Committee mentioned. Article 15 provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation, any high contracting party may take measures derogating from its obligations under the Convention".</quote>
The article goes on to explain what is implied by "derogation". If, as is
<col>1004</col>
proposed, Article 15 is to be treated as if it were enforceable as part of our law&#x2014;in other words, incorporated&#x2014;it does not seem necessary to refer to derogation specifically in the Bill.<lb/>
I now come to the words "enforceable by action"&#x2014;against whom? It is the high contracting parties who, by the convention, undertook to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms referred to: in our case that means the United Kingdom. A claim would therefore lie against the United Kingdom Government. As to the nature of the action. I doubt myself whether any special new remedy would be required. Occasions might arise where the interpretation of the law might rest upon the wording of the Convention. Cases might arise where some complainant might wish to bring forward a specific point, in which case I think he would probably be advised to take out the appropriate writ or ask for a declaration, or perhaps apply for an injunction. In Scotland that would be an interdict. I think these measures would suffice.<lb/>
So far as a declaration is concerned, I do not think the advantage of this is always fully appreciated. I think it might prove to be very effective. If there were a breach of a provision of the European Convention and some high court declared that was so, I think any Government would hesitate to defy it. In the last resort, of course, if the Government did defy it there might be a case to take to the Human Rights Court. As to Clause 2, there are one or two minor points which can be left to the Committee stage, but the principle is important: namely, that in a case of existing law we must assume that the terms of the convention would prevail.<lb/>
The main argument in the Committee and outside the House has been over Clause 3. The reason for the original wording which I drafted was to lessen the chance of inadvertent breaches of the articles of the convention in future legislation, but I have to admit that the original clause, as the Select committee pointed out, raised a question as to whether it amounted to an attempt by one Parliament to bind future Parliaments. The Select Committee felt that they were bound to keep within the existing constitution and therefore could not, even if they wished, introduce entrenched clauses.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0511"/>
<col>1005</col>
The new wording takes this into account. Under this Bill, Parliament is not asked to make provisions which future Parliaments could not revise. I think we must accept that so long as we keep to our existing constitution. On the other hand, the Bill assumes that Parliament would not wish to flout a convention which it has ratified as a treaty.<lb/>
My Lords, I foresee some representations on the last few words of this Clause 3, which are as follows:
<quote>"or does not admit of any construction compatible with the provisions of this Act".</quote>
That is a subject which is very topical at the moment. I am thinking of certain recent cases which have been drawn to my attention on this subject of fulfilling treaties and interpretation. My attention has been drawn to the case of <i>Macarthys Ltd.</i> v <i>Smith</i> of 1979, on which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, had some important comments to make and which has been reported. There is another case of <i>Worrington</i> v <i>Lloyds Bank Ltd.</i> of this year which, so far as I can ascertain, has not been reported. I certainly do not intend to embark on a discussion of these cases. I mention them because it is contended that the observations that were made in those cases support the practicability of Clause 3 of my Bill. However, so far as the last phrase is concerned, which reads
<quote>"&#x2026; or does not admit of any construction compatible with the provisions of this Act",</quote>
I would not wish to fight or die in the last ditch in an attempt to retain those words. I have had no opportunity of discussing this point with others who support the Bill, and I can only give my personal opinion, but I myself would not press them if it were felt desirable to remove them. Again I think that it is appropriate for Committee.<lb/>
It is never easy to outline a Bill, clause by clause, without boring the House and I have tried not to do so. But I would conclude with a few general observations. I accept that there are some political implications in observing the provisions of the convention. That flows from ratifying the convention, rather than from attempting to incorporate it. I could give a few examples of cases which have political implications, though I think it wiser to take hypothetical cases. There are two actual cases at the moment
<col>1006</col>
relating to the closed shop which are before the Commission, possibly with a view to going to the Human Rights Court, but I do not think it would be proper for me to discuss cases which are already before the Commission.<lb/>
But as a hypothetical example, I can see that if there were&#x2014;I am not saying that there is&#x2014;a case of a closed shop with no clause at all for conscientious objections, and as a result some individual was unable to obtain employment, it might be difficult to reconcile that with Article 11. Or to take one other hypothetical case, if, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, the present Government took a U-turn and decided to renationalise parts of industry without compensation, a question might arise as to whether&#x2014;it could be a serious point&#x2014;that could be reconciled with Article 1 of the first protocol. But I think that most cases would arise because some individual felt that he was suffering from some hardship or injustice, which was contrary to one or some of the articles of the European Convention, and he wanted the matter to be put right and wished to bring it in a British court. To help him do so is one of the objects of the Bill.<lb/>
I can sum up by saying that the underlying objects of the Bill are twofold. One is to assist individuals in the manner that I have suggested, and the second is, at the same time, to strengthen the concept of adherence to internationally agreed principles relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02046">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014; (<i>Lord Wade.</i>)</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02048"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the House will wish me to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Wade, first, on his devotion to human rights, which I think we all share, but, secondly, on his persistence in his campaign in respect of incorporating the Convention into our law. I have forgotten whether it was the Bellman in <i>The Hunting of the Shark</i> who said, "What I say three times is true". It may well be that the noble Lord has reached that state of mind by now. But, alas! such is the many-sidedness of truth, that it may well be that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0512"/>
<col>1007</col>
on this occasion, again, there will be differences of opinion; and looking at the list of speakers it seems very likely that that will be so.<lb/>
Most of us whose names appear on the list of speakers have been around this course earlier, if that is an appropriate metaphor to use&#x2014;no, my Lords, not in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Wigg. I am quite safe and he is not here; regretfully, no doubt. But as I was saying when I interrupted myself, we have been around this course before, and I do not intend to take too much of your Lordships' time today. It may well be that, unfortunately, I shall not he able to be here till the end of the debate. If so, I apologise in advance.<lb/>
On the occasion when previously I spoke from a different position in the House, I regret that it was in opposition to the views of the noble Lord, Lord Wade. It is the case that men of goodwill differ in their views on this difficult matter, as indeed the splendid report by the Select Committee, which was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, so clearly indicated. I think that the argument is pretty evenly balanced, but I am still inclined to favour the view of the minority of five against six in the Select Committee's report, supporting the reasons which are set out in paragraph 33 of the report for rejecting what the noble Lord, Lord Wade, proposes. As I see it, what is really at issue between us is more a question of machinery than of objective; more a question of means than of ends.<lb/>
But the fact of primary importance in considering the operation of the Convention is the basic fundamental decision of the Labour Government, which has been continued by subsequent Administrations, to allow our citizens the right to petition to the Commission of Human Rights and to the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The existence of the convention, in itself, is of course a major step in international law and international relations, which was taken after the last war with the object of guarding Europe against any recrudescence of Nazism. It was a similar motivation which led to the earlier Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.<lb/>
<col>1008</col>
The great difference between the two declarations of principle is, of course, that the European Convention provided means of enforcement of the terms of the convention by giving the individual citizen, as well as State Governments themselves, the right of petition and the remedy that ought, in the normal course of events, to follow a decision of the Court, to which one would expect governments to give effect, either by administrative means, which is usually the method of dealing with it, or if necessary by legislation. But this development of the right of petition is of major importance in the history of human rights, because of the unique development that it created in international law by providing the individual citizen, in any country ratifying it, with the possibility of bringing a complaint against his own government in a foreign court, before an international body in international proceedings&#x2014;a major change, a major development.<lb/>
It was once said&#x2014;I think these are the words of Professor Lauterpacht&#x2014;that the individual citizen used to be the object of compassion; now he is the subject of rights. The British citizen is given by the convention and the act of giving a right of petition this new standing as an individual and this new strength to assert his rights. That exists now. Incorporation of the law would make no difference, I submit, to that, except that it would enable our courts to give effect to the principles of the convention. I shall say a word or two about that.<lb/>
I had the great pleasure last week, on the invitation of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, to represent our judiciary at Strasbourg in the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the setting up of the Commission of Human Rights and the Court itself. One heard of the impressive record of case work that has evolved there. I think it is appropriate that I should pay tribute to the outstanding contribution of British lawyers. Of course it is very much a team and an international job, but the work of Sir Humphrey Waldock as president of the Court was outstanding. Additionally, a distinguished lawyer, James Fawcett, is the president of the Commission of Human Rights.<lb/>
I was very interested to learn that Mr. Fawcett, the chairman of the Commission,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0513"/>
<col>1009</col>
himself sees grave difficulties in writing the convention into our law. He made an interesting contribution in a BBC broadcast discussion of the matter on 28th October, in which the noble and learned Lord and I each took part. By way of illustration of the difficulties which arise he mentioned some of the applications which have come to the Commission on the question whether the machinery of the Commission and the European Court is really appropriate to deal with some of the questions that arise, or whether or not it would be preferable that they should be dealt with domestically by way of parliamentary action&#x2014;by legislation.<lb/>
Mr. Fawcett cited compulsory sex education in schools&#x2014;whether that was against one of the fundamental principles&#x2014;the closed shop, abortion law. There was a reference to the Danish sex education case, where the question that the court was asked to deliberate upon was whether the State was interfering with parental rights when it imposed sex education in schools. Seven of the learned judges said yes, seven said no&#x2014;again, no doubt, another illustration of the many sidedness of truth. The crucial question which he asked was whether these matters are really to be left to the courts to say what is right and what is wrong. In my view, the nature of those broad issues of public policy ought to be dealt with by legislative means.<lb/>
As noble Lords well know, the convention is set out in terms of statements of general principles of public policy in very wide areas: the right to life, the right to privacy, freedom of schooling, freedom of education, freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, the question of forms of punishment&#x2014;all major issues of public policy which, I venture to submit and certainly think, are issues appropriate to be dealt with by Parliament and not by the judiciary.<lb/>
Of course it is the case that the judiciary in our country, through their creation of the common law&#x2014;judiciary law as, I think, Bentham described it&#x2014;have played a vital role in the progressively changing shape of our law to keep pace with the changing needs of the community and of society: by, for instance, extending the concept of natural justice. However, under the common law they have developed legal principles slowly and empirically from case to case. If the convention were
<col>1010</col>
incorporated, they would start with statutory principles of the widest generality&#x2014;I have indicated what sort of ground would be covered&#x2014;and they would have a free hand to decide how those principles operated in the cases that came before them.<lb/>
The Convention would acquire a domestic internal significance which might well result in developments quite different from the jurisprudence of Strasbourg itself. The result of incorporation, as I think the report of the Select Committee put it, would graft on to our law an Act of Parliament in form and content totally at variance with any existing legislation and at variance with future laws that need to come forward. I heard with interest the speech of the Chief Justice of Australia, Chief Justice Barwick, on this matter in his address to the Benson Club earlier this year, when he said:
<quote>"It is worth saying that the legislature, notwithstanding its burden of party politics, is better fitted to ascertain and express the common will, the common consent of the realm&#x2014;to use the language of the great charters&#x2014;than is the judiciary, which does not have at its command the information required to decide upon a new rule or the acceptability of an existing rule in times of change. As well, these days the legislature is served by law reforming commissions"&#x2014;</quote>
&#x2014;as we are admirably served here&#x2014;
<quote>"able to present the various facets of the problem of what the law should be".</quote>
In dealing with that point I should add that Parliament has certainly not been slow during my time in Parliament to legislate in new areas where fresh social problems have arisen&#x2014;for instance, on race relations, sex discrimination and matters of that kind.<lb/>
One of the broad issues which we discussed previously was the view that was expressed by learned Lords of Appeal. I am glad to see present the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, who is as doughty in his fight on this cause as is the noble Lord, Lord Wade. But some of his colleagues in the Appellate Committee did not share his view on the matter. They expressed concern that the broad terms of the Convention setting out rights absolute in terms but subject to elaborate derogations would result in a variety of interpretations which would introduce a substantial element of uncertainty into our law. When the, alas! late Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest debated this matter he said:
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0514"/>
<col>1011</col>
<quote>"To enact this Bill would involve and introduce a parade of uncertainties".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 29/11/78; col. 1376.]</quote>
It was characteristic language of a dear, lamented noble friend.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Diplock, expressed his anxieties in his customary vigorous language in our debate on the Select Committee's report, when he said at col. 1366:
<quote>"If this Bill becomes law in its present form, it will be open to every fanatic, every crackpot, to challenge any law they disagree with and which they think&#x2014;indeed can verily suggest&#x2014;detracts little or anything at all from the absolute right conferred by the first sentence in each article".</quote>
He deplored, as did others, the effect of the impact of incorporation and the decision-making which would fall upon the judges if the convention became part of our law. He said (col. 1367):
<quote>"The administration of justice in our country depends upon the respect which all people of all political views feel for the judges, and in my opinion that respect depends very much upon keeping judges out of politics. To pass this Bill of Rights cannot but have the tendency to bring judges more and more into politics. That seems to me to be a sufficient disadvantage, and so far as I am concerned, when it is put into the balance, it tips it down upon the side of not passing a Bill in the form of that which is proposed".</quote>
I am bound to say I greatly fear that this uncertainty and the broadness of the terms may well result in a great increase of litigation in our courts if these provisions became part of our law.<lb/>
My Lords, I promised that I would not take up too much of your Lordships' time on this occasion as you have been very forbearing with me before, but I should just like to say this: The convention exists as a great international instrument. We have ratified it, and we have given our citizens powers under it, and I do not think there is any reason to believe that Parliament and Government in this country are likely to act in ignorance of our treaty commitments. I cannot now recollect whether it is a breach of the Official Secrets Acts to mention the existence of the Legislation Committee, but I venture the risk of doing so on this occasion, enjoying of course the protection of the privileges of this House to a Member; but certainly my recollection is&#x2014;and I have little doubt that it will be happening again under the eagle eye of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, who, it may be, is a member of the Legislation Committee&#x2014;who knows?</membercontribution></p>

Therefore the conclusion that I have come to is this, that I am afraid I cannot myself give my support to the Bill. I am certainly not dogmatic in the views that I have sought to express about it. I do not expect that my noble friend who will be winding up the debate will be inviting your Lordships to divide upon the matter, and I have little doubt that in the fullness of time we shall have further opportunity of finding out whether what the noble Lord, Lord Wade, has said for the third time really is true.</membercontribution></p>

For the last 10 years or so I have found myself in growing concern about the need for constitutional reform in this country and it is in that context that I wish to support the noble Lord's Bill. Reference has been made to the very fine balance of opinion about the value of a Bill of Rights that was shown on our Select Committee, and I must admit that there was a fine balance of opinion in my own mind. I answer it in favour of the Bill; but I have to say to the noble Lord that although I genuinely wish to support the Bill, I cannot hold out very high hopes that, on its own, it will supply what I think is necessary to allay the concern which I and a growing number of your Lordships, and certainly many other people outside this House, probably
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0515"/>
<col>1013</col>
feel about the workings of our constitution at the moment.<lb/>
May I say with respect to the noble and learned Lord who lately sat upon the Woolsack that I am afraid that his speech tipped me rather more in favour of the Bill than before, for one reason: he expressed at one time that he was doubtful about the appropriateness of asking learned judges in this or any other country to decide about the pros and cons of the merits of great general issues. As he said, truth is many-sided: seven learned judges may think one way and another seven may think the opposite way. The noble and learned Lord said that he preferred Parliament; but I am bound to say that having been a Member of Parliament for nearly 30 years&#x2014;26 of them in another place&#x2014;I cannot really have much faith in Parliament as we know it today dealing properly with these general issues. It might be different with Parliament in a reconstituted form. It seems to me altogether too arbitrary and too "chancy" as to whether it does get down to these subjects. I have no doubt that it can get down to them but, to put it mildly, there seems to be no guarantee that it will do so.<lb/>
Those who object to a Bill of Rights on those grounds perhaps do not do enough justice to the feeling of many citizens of the importance of being certain of being able to have a libertarian grievance made subject to an impartial review. The outcome of that review itself may not be clear: seven judges may decide one way and seven the other, so the outcome may not be clear. Truth is not always one-sided and clear, but nevertheless there is satisfaction, there is relief in knowing that at least a grievance can be subject to a review and is not subject to the "chanciness" of whether Parliament will, in one's own lifetime, get round to it.<lb/>
So while on balance I support this Bill, I do not wish to argue my support on the basis of the pros and cons of its legal efficacy but more to put it in the general context of my concern for constitutional reform. My real cause for concern, which has grown very strongly indeed, is that our democratic institutions in this country as they are now functioning have really ceased to provide the effective checks and balances which I believe
<col>1014</col>
are essential for the safeguarding of democratic freedom in this or indeed in any other country. The power of a majority in the House of Commons has now in fact become absolute. That might be all right, my Lords, if the majority in the House of Commons were a representative majority, but of course under our present electoral system, it is not. An overall party majority can be, and usually is, obtained by a party which has won the votes only of a minority of the electorate.<lb/>
That too may not have mattered too much in the past in this country, when the major contesting parties shared a great deal of common ground about the nature of our society which they wished to see and the nature of its economy. Rightly or wrongly, in my view, unfortunately, political beliefs have polarised enormously during my active political lifetime, and now one has the position that a party commanding an absolute majority in the House of Commons, however small, can enact fundamental changes which may often also be irreversible changes; and no one can stop them from doing so, even though those changes may be desired by only a minority even of the party in power and definitely feared and opposed by a majority of the electorate as a whole. This seems to me the basic position of which we have to take notice. It is, as my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor described, I think for the first time, in those vivid words, the state of an elective dictatorship. I do not believe that is a situation which we should be content to see continue.<lb/>
If one takes that view, there really are only four effective ways of protecting ourselves against the danger of this elective dictatorship. First there is electoral reform of the House of Commons itself, some form of proportional representation. Secondly, there is reform of your Lordships' House so that it may acquire natural authority&#x2014;which may be even more important than increasing its formal powers&#x2014;and once again become an effective check and balance on our constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02053"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will allow me to intervene, is he saying that we are now enjoying the privilege of an elective dictatorship?</membercontribution></p>

<col>1015</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02054"><member>Lord CARR of HADLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will deal with that in a moment if the noble and learned Lord wishes, but perhaps I may pursue this point for a moment. The third way is the one which is before us today, the enactment of a Bill of Rights. And the fourth, I suppose, is the adoption, as in some other countries, of a written constitution. What I want to submit is that we need at the very least one of these measures, and in my view preferably not less than two of them.<lb/>
My personal first choice is a form of proportional representation for another place. I think that is the most effective, most fundamental, and in the long run the indispensable single reform which would put this matter right. I have bewailed, in Parliament and out, the fact that the last Labour Government when they first attained office did have an absolute majority in another place, did enact fundamental changes, some of which were very close to being irreversible, in spite of the fact that they had won their absolute majority with the votes of only 28 per cent. of the electorate or 38 per cent. of those who voted. Of course, I take the point that that is not the only case. The present Government, which I am proud to support, even with its much larger majority in the House of Commons still has the vote of less than 50 per cent. of those who voted.<lb/>
It is some time since I did this research, but I believe I am right in saying that it is as long ago as 1900 that a party standing on its own actually came to office in this country with an overall majority of those who voted in the general election which returned it to power. That, strangely enough, was the Conservative victory in 1900. Although there was a much smaller parliamentary majority in the so-called Liberal landslide of 1906, nevertheless the Conservative victory of 1900 was I believe the last occasion on which a Government in this country came to office on the strength of the votes of the majority of those who voted in the election. Indeed, it has never happened since we have had universal suffrage.<lb/>
I really do not believe that this is a satisfactory state of affairs, as long as the other place has this absolute power. As I say, my first choice would be to change things in another place. My second choice would be reform of your Lordships'
<col>1016</col>
House. My third choice is the one before us today; namely, a Bill of Rights. But for this to be effective it seems to me to be necessary to couple it with the fourth option, namely, a written constitution. I must say that of all the four choices this is the one I like the least. I do not say I oppose it, but I approach it with certain qualms and uncertainty. It is certainly the most foreign to the very long established British tradition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02055"><member>Lord WADE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order that noble Lords may be quite clear in their minds, the noble Lord is referring to the fourth option, namely, a written constitution, which is a very controversial matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02056"><member>Lord CARR of HADLEY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, that is the fourth, and I hope I have made clear to your Lordships that I have considerable reservations about that. But what we are considering today is the third, namely, the Bill of Rights, and I do support it, I repeat, but I think it is the least effective of all those four. Although standing on its own it is better than nothing&#x2014;and that is why I wish to see the noble Lord, Lord Wade, successful&#x2014;I cannot believe that its efficacy will be sufficient to meet all that is needed to allay my own growing concern, which I suspect is shared by many people inside and outside Parliament. So in conclusion, I wish to appeal to my noble and learned friend&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02057"><member>Lord FOOT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord concludes perhaps he would allow me to ask a question. He has drawn attention to the three ways in which he thinks that the evil of an elective dictatorship could be avoided. Would he agree that, so far as this Bill of Rights is concerned, it does not provide any safeguard against an elected majority in the other place carrying through a measure which intrudes upon the rights of the subject, because of course it is provided under Clause 3 of this Bill that if there is a conflict between subsequent legislation and the provisions of the convention then, unless they can be reconciled, the subsequent legislation must prevail?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02058"><member>Lord CARR of HADLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do agree, and this, of course, is one of the reasons why, although I welcome this Bill, I am bound to say that it is the least of all the measures that I think necessary.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0517"/>
<col>1017</col>
So may I conclude by appealing to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. We have noticed that one noble and learned Lord moved from a position on my left to a position opposite me while maintaining the position he held the last time this Bill was debated. I remember with pleasure and vividness how, when he was on the Opposition Front Bench, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor came out in support of this Bill; and I hope that we might hear the same from him tonight. May I just say this to the noble and learned Lord. I certainly realise, as I am sure all noble Lords realise, that he is in a position of greater constraint than he was when this matter last came before the House. But I am sure all your Lordships know that, whatever constraints he may be under at any particular time, he is a doughty and effective fighter for the cause of dealing with this problem of an elective dictatorship in this country. I do hope that, whatever the Cabinet of which he is a member may have decided about the view they must take about this Bill, he will assure us that he will use his maximum strength within that Cabinet to convince them of the importance which your Lordships attach to the need for constitutional reform in one form or another.<lb/>
We may each have our preferences, and I would not wish to be dogmatic or to die in the last ditch for any one of them. What I would really feel let down by would be if this Government which I support went through its term of office without addressing itself to the need for constitutional reform in some fundamental way. They may not opt, and I fear they will not opt, for my own first choice, but I hope they will do something. Otherwise they will not be being true to the basic precepts and principles of the party to which I belong, and of which they are the representative Government; namely, that the maintenance of our institutions should be the first objective of the Tory Party. It seems to me that our party is a constitutional party, and when I look at our institutions today I feel that in the last decade or so I have seen them decaying in front of my eyes from lack of proper maintenance. So I beg my noble and learned friend to use all his influence to ensure that, even if it is not my preferred form of maintenance, some effective form of maintenance and
<col>1018</col>
modernisation is brought to bear on the building of our constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02059">4.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02060"><member>Lord REDCLIFFE-MAUD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first I should like to say that I personally, in welcoming what the noble Lord, Lord Wade, has done for us for the third time, must assure my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley that I do not believe that the passing of this Bill will do anything to change the constitution in the way in which the noble Lord has suggested he thinks it needs changing.<lb/>
It is important that we should be clear in our minds about what it is that is before us. I remind your Lordships that the Select Committee consisted of people drawn from all parts of the House, including two Independents who disagreed with each other. The first witness was the noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack. It was he who first started my conversion to the position in which I now stand in support of the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Wade.<lb/>
I entered that committee feeling that I distrusted profoundly Bills of Rights and I did not think that this would help&#x2014;it would merely throw a spanner in the works of the legal system and give a great deal more money to lawyers, which I did not mind. We heard evidence on both sides, from not only those who supported the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Wade, but from those who opposed it. As the evidence accumulated I found myself becoming convinced of one thing and one thing only&#x2014;namely, that on balance, having signed and ratified the convention; having therefore since 1950 committed ourselves as a country regardless of party in that respect; and having gone further (as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, reminded us) and allowed the subject to go and complain against his own country in the Strasbourg Court, we did not do what we should have done, which was at the same time to make this a part of the law of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I do not want to weary the House with the reasons for that, which were clearly set out in the Select Committee's report and which are probably familiar to all noble Lords. The "Golder" road to Samarkand&#x2014;it took Mr. Golder five years to reach Strasbourg and to get his
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0518"/>
<col>1019</col>
decision&#x2014;is not in my opinion a crucial point. Moreover, to be quite honest, it is not to help the Golders of this world that I am particularly concerned in supporting this Bill. However, I think that what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, told us about his celebration of the 25th birthday of the Strasbourg Commission and Court, which culminated in this picture of the court dividing seven for, and seven against, confirms my feeling that, noble and distinguished though the Strasbourg Court I am sure is, and particularly distinguished in view of the contributions of Waldock, Fawcett and others from this country, I do not regard that as a suitable court of first instance for the citizen in this country who knows his convention and thinks that he has been aggrieved.<lb/>
From the nature of the pattern, the Strasbourg Court is designed as a court of appeal. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and others on the committee who disagreed with the noble Lord, Lord Wade, were at pains to point out the different technique, which did not require appeal to our own courts, for the convention to have its perfect way. Frankly, it was at that point that I became convinced that they were wrong and that nothing can get away from the fact that, if the Bill receives not only a Second Reading&#x2014;as I hope very much it will this afternoon&#x2014;but a Third Reading, and is passed in due course by this House (whatever may happen in another place) what will really matter is that then the courts of this country can start absorbing the content of that convention and making the best of it, the common law and statute law of this country. That is the process which I believe will he encouraged if their Lordships in our own courts, and the other parts of the judiciary, are told that that is something that they must do.<lb/>
I do not think that we are being honest to our own citizens so long as we deprive them of the help of our own courts in deciding what, if anything, is the relevance of this international convention to the common law and statute law of this country. It is partly as an educational experiment that the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Wade, is valuable.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, mentioned that the Legislation
<col>1020</col>
Committee and members of the Cabinet are advised&#x2014;as of course we know they are&#x2014;by their able civil servants, how far any particular part of a Bill may contravene the convention. Of course, Ministers know and so do the particular top civil servants know, as the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, has always known. But do not let us kid ourselves. That is not true of Whitehall as a whole. I speak with shame as one who was head or so-called permanent head&#x2014;acting or otherwise&#x2014;of live departments at various times who had never heard of this convention or had read it until he became a member of your Lordships' Select Committee. I do not say that that is characteristic because many of my colleagues are much better behaved than that. However, it is simply not true that the people of this country know anything about this convention&#x2014;that it was signed in 1950; that it was ratified; and that they have a right to go to the Court and Commission at Strasbourg.<lb/>
I believe that if one of those terrible questionnaires were sent out and a great deal of money paid to the expert pollsters to tell us how many people know about this, and their answers to questions which I could set them about the convention, I am convinced that the result would be deplorably depressing to those of us who think that this is a statement of human rights which the people of this country share with most of Europe; which they share with large parts of the British Commonwealth; and which they should share&#x2014;and please God! one day will share&#x2014;with people behind the Iron Curtain. That, in its international aspect, is something that I find particularly attractive in the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Wade. Here, of course, we are only dealing with what, to my mind, is the narrow point of whether we should allow, or indeed insist, that the courts of this country should be involved as they will be if the Bill is passed.<lb/>
However, there is a wider aspect. Human rights is a cause which I believe should be on the agenda of every civilised country in the 1980s. It will take time. But here is a place where we overstep the bounds of nation statehood and think first, as this convention does, of those in Europe who have signed it, and also of the citizens of the world. It is not simply a statement that the citizens of this country
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0519"/>
<col>1021</col>
have human rights, which no Government of whatever party should infringe except in the protection of rights of other individuals. It is not a bare defence of individual freedom. It is a defence of the rights of each individual not only to have the rights but to surrender those rights when that is necessary for the rights of his fellow-citizens in this country, in Europe and in the world. That is what particularly appeals to me and I think to the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, who opened his speech by saying that it is not the mere passing of this Bill that is at stake, but that it is part of a movement and that we must start at home.<lb/>
I believe that we have waited far too long. Your Lordships have done a service&#x2014;and no one more than the noble Lord, Lord Wade&#x2014;in insisting that we go on and on talking about this. Even if we reached agreement here, it would not meet my point about the need for civil servants and local government officers to be informed of the attitude which, by international treaty, they are committed to adopt with every client with whom they deal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02061">5.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02062"><member>Lord LLOYD of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had a long series of debates on this subject, plus a report from a Select Committee composed of Members of this House. One might well be pardoned if one takes the view that there is nothing more to be said on this subject&#x2014;at least in this House&#x2014;although it is fair to say that the other place has been, if not notably silent, at any rate very quiet on the subject, which perhaps in itself is of significance. On previous occasions I have ventured to point out&#x2014;and I repeat it now&#x2014;that, notwithstanding some of the emotive if not emotional arguments that one sometimes hears put forward, there appears to be no demand by the public for this Bill at all. On the last occasion when we debated this I mentioned the complete lack of interest of the national Press in the subject matter of our Select Committee report when it was published, and the fact that only one member of the Press turned up at an arranged Press meeting&#x2014;that one member being a gentleman who is known for his passionate interest in this subject.<lb/>
Recently I was interested to hear a BBC programme in the "You, the Jury" series. After a careful presentation of
<col>1022</col>
arguments by both sides, with the calling of eminent witnesses who were cross-examined during the proceedings, a vote was taken of those present, and about 70 per cent. of those present were against the existence of a written constitution with a Bill of Rights. Therefore, the idea of there being a sense of need on the part of the public has not manifested itself at all. Nor, as my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones pointed out, is there any great principle at stake here because we are all in favour of human rights. The only difference is whether it is an appropriate procedural step to take to incorporate the terms of the convention into our law.<lb/>
It seems to me that many of the people who favour this step rely on what may be regarded as a rather emotional viewpoint, stirred up by their passion for human rights, which we who oppose it equally share. On the other hand, there are those who support this Bill but in a very lukewarm spirit. I am sorry to see that the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, is not now in his seat, but in his speech the noble Lord appeared to have very lukewarm enthusiasm for the Bill and thought that there were many other better ways in which we could achieve the result; but as an ultimate <i>pis aller,</i> so to speak, he was prepared to support the Bill.<lb/>
However, when one looks at the arguments against the Bill and the disadvantages which it would occasion, one would have thought that any careful scrutiny of them would show that they are a very great force indeed. I shall not reiterate arguments that have been dealt with at great length in previous debates. But it is necessary to say shortly that those arguments fall under two headings. One is the immense uncertainty that it would occasion to our legal system. Here one has only to look at the provisions of Clause 2 of the Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Wade, has already read to us, which provides in substance that where there is a conflict the provisions of the convention and its protocols will prevail. What does that mean? It means that the whole of our existing law is subject to these provisions. Therefore, it is open to argument, and it possibly may be held in many cases that in such a conflict the previous law is overruled.<lb/>
Therefore, a huge area of uncertainty will be created. Anyone who doubts
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0520"/>
<col>1023</col>
that should read&#x2014;if he has not already done so&#x2014;the detailed expos&#x00E9; of this matter put before the Select Committee by Sir Henry Fisher, a former and eminent High Court judge who is now the President of Wolfson College, Oxford. At pages 213 to 215 of the <i>Minutes of Evidence</i> taken before the Select Committee he gave a full account of all the areas of uncertainty which would be created by a Bill of this kind. It was detailed evidence which, to my knowledge, has never been controverted.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones referred to the observations in our previous debate of the late and most lamented Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest when he expressed his vigorous opposition to a Bill in this form and indicated the absurdity of enacting into our law such general propositions as, for instance, everyone has the right to freedom of expression, everyone has the right to life, and so forth; statutory law should be as clear and certain as possible, and this would produce&#x2014;as my noble and learned friend has quoted&#x2014;a parade of uncertainties and would, indeed, create endless opportunities for litigation.<lb/>
I was rather surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, dismiss the argument that Parliament is the appropriate place to judge public policy of importance, rather than the judges. He seemed to think that the argument in favour of Parliament was disposed of by pointing out the imperfections of Parliament and the extent to which it does not reflect a precise mathematical representation of the electorate. Surely, in a democratic system the reason why Parliament is to be preferred as the source of public policy as against judges is that Parliament is democratically elected and is accountable to the electorate. Judges, however eminent and however distinguished, are appointed by the Government&#x2014;though of course they are completely independent; nobody disputes that. Very properly, they are not elected. They should not be elected. Nothing would be worse in my opinion than a judiciary who are elected. That is not the nature of the judiciary. But they are appointed and, having been appointed, they are not accountable, and therefore they are not a
<col>1024</col>
democratic source of political policy. It is for that reason that Parliament is to be preferred as a source of public policy, and the judges are inherently an unsuitable forum for this kind of decision.<lb/>
This leads one to the second fundamental objection to the incorporation of this sort of convention into our law&#x2014;that it will fundamentally change the role of the judiciary and the tradition of the common law. I know that no less a distinguished judge than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, has argued strongly in favour of extending the judicial role in this way, and has spoken in his evidence to the select committee of freshening up the principles of the common law. Indeed, in the last debate which took place in this House he rather dismissed my opposition to a Bill of this nature as merely an example of complacency. I do not feel that I can justly be accused of complacency on this issue. On the whole my interest, as I think he will be the first to admit, in law reform has been manifest for many years. But I believe&#x2014;and I hope that this is not complacent&#x2014;that we should be slow to tamper with institutions, which have served us well for a long period, for somewhat illusory benefits.<lb/>
In this connection I would venture to refer to the recent address&#x2014;and my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones also referred to it&#x2014;of Sir Garfield Barwick, the Chief Justice of Australia; one of the most distinguished judges in the whole Commonwealth, as is universally agreed. He delivered a recent address in London on the subject of judiciary law, and he pointed out firmly the dangers of putting our judiciary in the role of law makers. He saw an antipathy, as he put it, between the spirit of the common law and a declaration of rights. He particularly referred&#x2014;and this is a matter of considerable interest&#x2014;to "a tendency in some quarters to look longingly across the Atlantic to the greater freedom of the United States judiciary". He then went on to point out that, in a community with a lively parliamentary responsiveness, judicial activism of this sort is really unnecessary and indeed indesirable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02063"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the noble Lord see a certain paradox in Sir Garfield Barwick's remark, seeing that he has spent his entire

legal life under one of the most rigid written constitutions at present existent in the world?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02064"><member>Lord LLOYD of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for his intervention, but with great respect I cannot see that because Sir Garfield may have operated under a statutory constitution&#x2014;which incidentally is entirely different from the American type of Bill of Rights constitution&#x2014;that in any way disqualifies him from expressing views on the subject of judicial activism, with which he is as familiar, I would venture to think, as any other common law judge.<lb/>
What is often not realised is that in the United States itself, which is of course the prototype of this type of Bill of Rights constitution, there is at present a very deep disquiet felt at the way in which the judicial role is developing on legislative lines. May I quote one learned writer who wrote recently:
<quote>"All too many federal judges have been induced to view themselves as holding roving commissions as problem solvers".</quote>
Another learned writer said:
<quote>"There is unease at judicial authority striking down laws enacted by democratically elected legislatures. Where, after all, is the accountability of life tenured judges?"</quote>
This is precisely the point that I was making in regard to Lord Carr of Hadley's preference for judges as against Parliament in the making of public policy.<lb/>
Indeed, in the United States at the present day, there is a substantial critical literature on this subject expressing in great detail doubts as to whether the judges, whatever judicial skills they naturally possess, nevertheless possess the right skilled training and expertise to give competent decisions on broad matters of policy. Indeed, one wonders why there is this enthusiasm for American style constitutions at the present day in certain quarters in this country. In many ways it is very arguable that the American constitution is at present proving to be far less workable than our own both in a political and a legal sense, but to develop this would take me too far afield.<lb/>
I should, in conclusion, like to comment briefly on the view that the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, expressed when he linked this Bill of Rights argument with
<col>1026</col>
the question of a dictatorship&#x2014;a parliamentary dictatorship&#x2014;and suggested that however inadequate, this might have some possible means of control. But he was the first to admit that this was likely to be pretty ineffective, as indeed emerged from Lord Foot's very effective intervention towards the end of his speech.<lb/>
The fact of the matter is, as a learned writer in a recent issue of the <i>Modern Law Review</i> pointed out, that the law cannot be a substitute for politics. The political decisions must be taken by politicians. In a society like ours that means by people who are removable. There is in the background of all this argument&#x2014;perhaps it has not become very clear in your Lordships' debates, though the argument has sometimes been pursued more vigorously outside this House&#x2014;a certain feeling that in this way, through the intervention of the judiciary, it might be possible to restrain certain kinds of Left Wing, or socialist legislation. That seems to me a perilous course and a perilous argument. If what we fear is political tyranny, then we must seek to control that by political means. To try to bring the judiciary into this sort of contest can only have one effect, and that is to destroy the standing of the judiciary in the eyes of the people as a whole.<lb/>
It is for that reason among others that I remain unrepentant in the belief that the European Convention is best left not as a court of first instance as the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud, would wish to see it, but as an international long-stop, where it is of some value, though perhaps of minimal value, and that if we go further and seek to import it into the fabric of our law, that will prove a grave error and one which might inflict lasting and irreparable harm on the working of our whole legal system.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord may not accept my argument but I hope he appreciates that it is the nature of the view put forward by those like Sir Henry Fisher who oppose the structure of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02067"><member>Baroness GAITSKELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord recall what Sir Henry Fisher said&#x2014;namely, that however bad the law is the judges must support it? I think anyone who says that is not living in the world today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02068"><member>Lord LLOYD of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention, but if I attempted to answer it we might get into a very broad field and one which might bring our present Master of the Rolls speeding to these Benches to intervene. I will therefore refrain from attempting a detailed reply.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02070"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Wade, for hearing only the last part of his speech. Believe it or not, my train from Kent was four hours late. It got stuck on the hill coming up from Rochester, with a freight train in front. I suggested to the driver that we should try to give it a push but he replied that such a course was irregular. However, in the end we did give it a push and, very slowly, we got it going. My Lords, I shall be brief because I am surrounded by eminent lawyers and I am no lawyer. However, I wish to make it clear at the outset that I support the Bill and hope that the old adage "Third time lucky" proves to be the case for the noble Lord, Lord Wade. After watching events over the years I feel that the individual in this country has been losing his individual freedom. We have had innumerable statutory instruments, enabling legislation and an avalanche of regulations; in many respects the individual is having his freedom taken from him. At one time
<col>1028</col>
Britain was in the forefront of freedom for the individual, and I have always believed that freedom of the individual was the most important freedom, perhaps even more important than freedom of the State.<lb/>
Indeed, one can say that an Englishman's home is no longer his castle. I read somewhere of the great number, in fact thousands, of officials who have the right to enter anybody's home. And when one goes outside one's home there are all the various Government bodies, commissions and boards such as the Forestry Commission and the Highlands and Islands Development Board, with compulsory powers; I agree that they use those powers carefully, but nevertheless they have them and that is another reason why a Bill of Rights is essential. As my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley said, this is especially so as we have no written constitution. An unwritten constitution has served us well in the past, but times have changed and&#x2014;who knows?&#x2014;we might have a lot of wild men in power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02071"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Might have?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02072"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: We may already have had a few, my Lords. In any event, it could be dangerous without a written constitution. I was reading a report on SLADE, the artists and writers union; perhaps other noble Lords have read it. The report had some strong criticism for some of SLADE'S members. Referring to recruiting people into the union it said:
<quote>"without any regard whatsoever to the interests or welfare of the respective recruits".</quote>
I have with me a newspaper cutting on the SLADE report in connection with a man named Marriner who runs an art studio in London. Apparently he is all for having unions but believes membership should be optional, and I quote from the cutting:
<quote>"One evening two men arrived at my works and asked if they could see my staff. The staff declined an invitation to drinks with the two men, who turned out to be SLADE officials. A few weeks later Mr. Marriner was accosted by one of the two men, who said he wanted to organise the staff into SLADE. Despite objections from the staff, the SLADE official"&#x2014;</quote>
apparently the national organiser, Mr. Martin&#x2014;
<quote>"said, ' Unless everybody joins within 14 days we will close you down. We will block everything you produce'."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0523"/>
<col>1029</col>
Everybody in the studio joined after that, except for one man, and he had to leave. Do we not require a Bill of Rights? It is an appalling situation. I think the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, said that, after all, we have ratified the convention, and all that, and that any man who feels himself aggrieved in this country can appeal to the Strasbourg Court. Well, of course, that is quite true. But, my Lords, it is a very expensive process, and I doubt very much that many people realise that they can do that. I also feel that, if there are a lot of people from this country who consider that they have been unjustly treated and they go and appeal at Strasbourg, that will not do our prestige much good. There was a case involving three railway workers. I think that British Rail dismissed 56, or, it may have been, 54 men for not joining the appropriate railway union, and three of them appealed to the Strasbourg Court, at great expense. I understand that their appeal has been upheld, and presumably they are due quite a lot of compensation from British Rail. That is the only example I know of. It was presumably very expensive for them; I suppose they were backed financially.<lb/>
But how much better it would be if we enshrined the European Convention on Human Rights into our own law. I cannot understand the objections against doing that; they do not seem logical to me. I can understand the behind-the-scenes fear of so doing. I do not want to introduce any party feeling into this&#x2014;though I cannot avoid a little&#x2014;but obviously it could be rather unpleasant for the unions. But I am not going to dwell on that. I will not speak any longer because I have said quite enough, and I am surrounded by many eminent lawyers who are far more able than I am to deal with this matter. But I should like to say again how heartily I support the noble Lord, Lord Wade, in his Bill, and I hope it has success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02073">5.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02074"><member>Lord SCARMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Wade, on his persistence in the noble cause of human rights inside and outside this House. Like the noble Viscount who preceded me, I hope that third time will be lucky, and whatever may happen to the Bill in another place, I earnestly beseech this House to
<col>1030</col>
give it a Second Reading, to study it in Committee, and let it go on its way to another place. It is sad in a way that this modest little Bill&#x2014;to which I shall be returning from the constitutional flights on which some noble Lords have taken us&#x2014;should excite such interest in constitutional and political questions. Those who have supported the Bill have done so on broad constitutional grounds with which the Bill is only remotely linked. Those who have opposed it have in some ways queered my pitch, talking of judicial activists, judges entering politics. I began to wonder whether, as a professional judge who has already earned his pension, I could conceivably rise and address your Lordships on this Bill. I decided that I could because my pension is already safe.<lb/>
Let us look at the Bill&#x2014;only three clauses of it. I commend the two principles to be found in the Bill. The first principle is that the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms should be incorporated into our law and should be enforceable in the ordinary courts of the country. The second principle is that if Parliament wills&#x2014;and this is a matter for Parliament, not for judges&#x2014;that this Bill of Rights should become part of its statute law, then so long as it is part of the statute law of the Kingdom, it shall enjoy pre-eminence over other statutes. That does not mean that it will be entrenched and Parliament cannot amend or repeal it. It merely means that, so long as it is on the statute book, it shall enjoy pre-eminence.<lb/>
Surely in a civilised society such as ours we should be not only prepared, but eager, to ensure that a statute, whose duty it was to protect our human rights and fundamental freedoms, should have preeminence. It is really no good paying the slightest attention to the siren, sweet voices of some noble and learned Lords whom we have heard this afternoon, and say that this will create uncertainty; it is completely inimical to the legal traditions of our country. Not at all! Magna Carta has always enjoyed, and still enjoys, the sort of pre-eminence that this Bill suggests the European Convention should have. We have a Bill of Rights almost 300 years old. Since it was enacted it has always enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy, so long as it remains on the statute book, pre-eminence over other statutes, and indeed over the common law.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0524"/>
<col>1031</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02075"><member>Lord Lloyd of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord permit me to put one question to him on this point?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02076"><member>Lord SCARMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord will please allow me for the moment to develop my theme. I wanted to point out that the preeminence of the 1689 Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement is such that our parliamentary Sovereignty and the independence of the judges both depend upon it. The European Communities Act of 1972, as long as it remains on our statute book, will enjoy the sort of pre-eminence that I am discussing.<lb/>
I cannot believe that we would be prepared not to give a Bill of Rights the sort of pre-eminence proposed in Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill, if we were prepared, as I suggest we should be prepared, to incorporate it into our law and to make it enforceable. The argument against incorporating it into our law can take many forms. One form that is commonly taken is this. It is quite unnecessary to introduce the European Convention or a Bill of Rights into our law because our law already secures to us the various rights and freedoms which are set out in the convention. Well, the European Court of Human Rights does not think so. We have already had from the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud, a reference to the <i>Golder</i> case. There was the recent <i>Sunday Times</i> case dealing with the freedom of speech.<lb/>
There are question marks in the minds of most lawyers over the right of privacy in our law; and one could enumerate other vital human rights and fundamental freedoms protected by the European Convention which are certainly doubtfully protected, and, one would think, not wholly protected, by English law. So there is a case for saying that this convention is necessary because we are failing in our duty&#x2014;and it is a duty imposed upon us internationally by Article 1 of the convention&#x2014;to secure to persons within our jurisdiction the rights and freedoms set out in the convention.<lb/>
Then, surely, my Lords, there is a great advantage in having these rights and freedoms, which we recognise it is the duty of our State to secure to our citizens,
<col>1032</col>
enforceable in the ordinary courts of our country. It is really absurd, I would suggest, to say that the enforcing of those rights by our judges under a statute enacted by Parliament&#x2014;because that is what this Bill will be if it is passed&#x2014;would be bringing the judges face to face with political, non-justiciable issues. European judges at Strasbourg have been handling these matters perfectly well for a very long time. There are our colleagues, fellow members of the Council of Europe, who have signed and ratified the European Convention, who have incorporated it into their law and who, so far as I know, are having no difficulties with their judges and no difficulties with the substance of their law. In fact, to use for a moment one of the European languages recognised by the European Convention, I know of no judge in any State which has ratified the convention who has been led to behave, because of the convention, <i>au-dessus de sa gare</i>&#x2014;not one. I would suggest to your Lordships that these fears can be set upon one side.<lb/>
Now, let us look just for a moment at some of the objections which have been developed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and others in the course of the debate this afternoon. I would summarise them (I hope not incorrectly) as threefold: first, that there would be the risk of a flood of litigation from crackpots and others; secondly, that the judges would be led into politics and would become powerful in areas where they should exercise no power; and, thirdly, the uncertainty of the law. Of course, there would be more litigation. The litigation would be, not all the time, that of crackpots and fanatics&#x2014;there are plenty of those litigating in the Strand at the moment. It would be litigation arising from minority groups, from individuals and others who have no political clout, who have grievances and who would then be able to turn to our courts seeking judicial redress. If litigation in this country is swollen by the addition to litigants of immigrants, convicted prisoners and other minorities and individuals without political clout because they have grievances which they think constitute infringements of their human rights or fundamental freedoms and they want them adjudicated upon by judges, why ever not? What is there to fear in that? Is there not very much to welcome in it?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0525"/>
<col>1033</col>
My Lords, this alarm about floods of litigation might be said to be no more than a respectable facade for suppressing that type of litigation. Why should those people without any political clout have to go to Strasbourg to get justice? And, if judges in Strasbourg can give them justice, what is the sense of the argument that if an English judge, administering and interpreting an Act of Parliament&#x2014;because that is what he would be doing&#x2014;should dare to give him justice, that English judge is going beyond forensic bounds and is moving into the area of politics? I beg to suggest to your Lordships that that objection is nonsense.<lb/>
Now, let us look at the next objection&#x2014;that of the overpowerful judge. As long as a judge is applying either the common law or a statute enacted by Parliament, and is called upon, when applying the statute law, to interpret it, he is performing a judicial function. He will be doing no more than that if called upon. as Strasbourg judges are regularly called upon, to interpret a statutory Bill of Rights. It is said by the lawyers; Oh!, but this convention is in too broad terms. This convention is declaring matters which should be the subject of Parliamentary redress, not judicial redress". Of course, as long as the convention remains on the periphery of our law, poking its nose in occasionally when some bold judge in the Court of Appeal or elsewhere thinks it valuable to take a look at it, as long as it remains in that no-man's land on the frontiers of our law, then it is somewhat political to start looking at it: but, if we bring it respectably and legitimately into the law by a statute enacted by Parliament, what is there then in the principles so introduced which is so dangerous that a judge cannot read them, understand them, interpret them and apply them?<lb/>
Finally, there is the uncertainty argument&#x2014;the uncertainty of the law. We have heard a lot about that, but let me tell your Lordships what I heard on Radio 4 the other night. It was a programme entitled "Talking Law", and my noble and learned friend Lord Denning, who unfortunately is not here this evening&#x2014;he has deserted the Floor of the House for the stage of Lincoln's Inn, where I am told he is giving a performance&#x2014;was asked whether he advocated the introduction and incorporation of the
<col>1034</col>
European Convention into our law. "No", he said; "I like it where it is. When I want to use it, I can". My Lords, that is uncertainty. Either my noble and learned friend sitting judicially should be required by law, where it is relevant, to pay attention to the European Convention, or he should not. At the moment I have every sympathy with my noble and learned friend and, indeed, with other judges in handling the European Convention.<lb/>
When I sat, as I was privileged to do for a number of years, with the Master of the Rolls in the Court of Appeal, from time to time, particularly in immigrant cases, we referred to the European Convention, because we were concerned to keep our administration of the immigration laws in line with the convention. But it was a tentative business and, of course, anything that we did could not in the slightest degree affect or guide the development of the human rights jurisprudence that is developing in respect of this convention at Strasbourg and elsewhere. That is a great loss to Europe as well as to this country.<lb/>
It is really hopeless to talk about uncertainty when the European Convention in its present limbo is creating uncertainty in our law. There is another little opening of uncertainty in regard to the convention. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which administers, as we all know, the Common Market law, has declared that when a question of human rights comes before it in the course of its jurisdiction it will apply the European Convention. I need not tell your Lordships&#x2014;I have said it before&#x2014;that, of course, the Luxembourg Court is the only constitutional court that we have. It is a constitutional court by virtue of the European Communities Act 1972 and its decisions are such that in the area of Common Market law we have to follow it. So there we are. In this little area of law covered by the Common Market the convention must be followed.<lb/>
But when one is dealing with minority groups, when one is dealing with individuals, who cannot get their grievances handled in Parliament, we deny the convention to them. But when the commercial men are fighting their cases in the Common Market law, the Luxembourg Court which we must follow is applying
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0526"/>
<col>1035</col>
the convention. This limbo should not be allowed to continue. We can end it by taking our courage in our hands and incorporating the convention and making it enforceable at law.<lb/>
My Lords, I have spoken for too long but I wish to end with a reference to Northern Ireland. There was a very moving debate in this House last week&#x2014;and I was privileged to listen to it&#x2014;on the condition of Northern Ireland; the need for a political or constitutional initiative, the need for stability in administration and local government and the need to breed in the minority population of Northern Ireland a sense of confidence in British law and British administration. It is no accident that perhaps the best document produced in this country on the European Convention and the Bill of Rights was presented to Parliament in 1977 by the Northern Irish Standing Commission on Human Rights. It was a unanimous report that Northern Ireland required a Bill of Rights. A majority wanted it as part and parcel of a United Kingdom Bill of Rights, taking the European Convention as the Bill of Rights. One dissentient said, "Let us have it whether those people on the other side of the water have it or not". And that in a community where Her Majesty's Government have considered it necessary from time to time to file notice of derogation under the European Convention in Strasbourg. I suggest that that is food for thought.<lb/>
Of course, the law is no panacea for social, political and economic troubles; but it can help. And if there are remedies available according to a law which is universally understood, acknowledged and upheld according to principles which people can see, understand and accept and which they know the courts are going to accept, then, within those limits, the law will help. And it is within those limits that the European Convention will play a very important part. If this becomes law, the European Convention will be a guide to legislators, to administrators and to judges that Parliament requires these principles to be observed in all aspects of our public life when the State, whether administratively, judicially or legislatively, is dealing with the subject. It is for that reason that I most fervently support this Bill, and it is for that reason
<col>1036</col>
that I thank the noble Lord, Lord Wade, for introducing it for a third time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02077">5.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02078"><member>Baroness GAITSKELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a privilege for me to follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, and, as on the last occasion that we debated this Bill of Rights, his speech gave me great pleasure. As a matter of fact, I should like to tear up the speech that I have here except that part of it where I say that I support the noble Lord, Lord Wade, and I would read out&#x2014;declaim, in fact&#x2014;the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud. I should like to do that because it was he who really showed what the whole business in individual petitions (when it was introduced in the United Nations when I was there) really mean to the whole of the world; and the importance of it, of which very few people in this country have the least understanding.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wade, once again initiates a debate on a Bill of Rights. I hope that it will not become a hardy annual We have had three. Perhaps we will get somewhere with this one. I remain somewhat conservative (with a small "c") in my approach towards a Bill of Rights, as I think is already known. I am not a lawyer and I do not feel competent enough to go further than to plead for the incorporation of the European Convention into our domstic law. That seems to me to go a long way, since there is no threat to the sovereignty of Parliament. My views have been influenced by my experience during the years when I was the United Kingdom delegate in the European Rights Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It was there that I learned that human rights were the increasing concern of the international judiciary as well as the national Governments. The main point made by the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffc-Maud, which struck me so forcefully, was that the law, and not war, was the solution to human rights violations.<lb/>
Reading once again the report of the Select Committee on a Bill of Rights, and turning to the chapters reflecting the judgments of those who were against a Bill of Rights, I could only construe them, from my own point of view, as being for such a Bill. I will give a few of these: one, the interpretation of race relations;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0527"/>
<col>1037</col>
two, freedom of speech; three, education; four, punishment, <i>et cetera.</i> Great play had been made about the dangers of incorporating the European Convention into our domestic law because this would flood our domestic law with uncertainty. But I believe that uncertainty is the prelude to change, and surely there are areas where improvement is desirable. So I remain unrepentant and I believe that to incorporate the articles of the European Convention into our domestic law is not beyond the ingenuity of our legal profession. Surely this must be true, as the present situation in the United Kingdom is in accord with the original philosophy of the European Convention. Of course, there might be conflicts but surely these can be put right when the United Kingdom law at this time happens to fall short of the standards of the European Convention.<lb/>
As I am not a lawyer, as I said before, I am unable to think of the law as an immaculate conception. Surely, it must constantly regenerate itself in tune with the political changes of our time&#x2014;and the changes come thick and fast today. I believe that the time has come when Parliament should exercise its power by legally incorporating the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights into our law. Parliament now has a duty to incorporate the European Convention&#x2014;for instance the provisions under Article 13&#x2014;to have effective remedies for any violations of human rights in this country. If European judges can have effective remedies for such violations, why cannot English judges too have the same power to give effect to these rights? Why can German, Dutch and Italian judges exercise these rights? Today English judges must take the long, slow trip to Strasbourg. It seems to me that the European Convention is not only good for our own judges, it is also good for our civil servants, for our Members of Parliament, for all our people in fact. We agree with the moral and legal values set up by the European Convention, surely this should now have the blessing of our courts. They appear very simple rights, but they are often abused. I will give a few examples, such as the right to marry and have a family and the guaranteed right not to be discriminated against. We have all heard about the Conservative Government's new law to deprive a group of United Kingdom women of the right
<col>1038</col>
of genuine marriage with foreign men. This is but one instance of a violation of these guarantees. Let us think of telephone tapping, violating the right of privacy in Article 8. There are no legal safeguards against the misuse of the power of the police to tap telephones. The case of Mr. Malone, lost in the English court, has now gone to Strasbourg. There is the interference with the right of prisoners to communicate with the outside world following a Home Office standing order&#x2014;that is, without being passed by Parliament&#x2014;so that, if this is allowed, there is no legal redress. These are but a very few things that incorporation of the convention would allow to be dealt with in our own courts.<lb/>
May I ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for reassurance that individuals will be able to go to Strasbourg for individual petitions, and that this will be renewed up to 1981? I would add one final sentence in favour of incorporation of the European Convention into our domestic law. This can only benefit our own laws; it does not take anything away and so can only strengthen and widen our law. It is a unique right that we are acquiring with an international Bill of Rights.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02079">6.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02080"><member>The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Lord Soames)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House and for the convenience of the House, I should like to make a Statement on the business for next week. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Wade, for interrupting his debate and also to the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan, who is to speak next.<lb/>
Yesterday I said in my Statement on the proposed arrangements for the Southern Rhodesia Bill that it was expected that the Bill would reach this House in time to be taken through all its stages on Monday. I have now to tell the House that the Bill will still be being considered in another place on Monday. The Official Opposition have, however, given an undertaking that it will reach this House when it sits, to be taken through all its stages on
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0528"/>
<col>1039</col>
Tuesday, with a view to the Bill receiving Royal Assent on Wednesday. Consequently, this House will not sit on Monday and the Motions for approval of statutory instruments which are on the Order Paper for Tuesday will be postponed until Thursday. I regret the inconvenience which may be caused to the House by this change but I hope that the House will recognise both the business complexities involved and the unusual importance at an international level of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02081"><member>Lord PEART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will wish to thank the noble Lord for making that business Statement. We of course understand that the other place should have as much time as possible to deal with a Bill so important as this one. This means that your Lordships' House will have only one day for discussion, but we on this side will use our best endeavours to achieve completion of all stages of the Bill that day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02082"><member>Lord WADE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join with the noble Lord in thanking the noble Lord the Leader of the House for making that Statement. We said from these Benches yesterday that we would be happy to consider the Bill, and consider it very carefully in one d ay on Monday. We see no reason why we should not do so in one day on Tuesday. We realise that a change of business causes a great deal of inconvenience for noble Lords, but we feel sure the House will wish to co-operate as far as possible in clearing the ground for a possible settlement in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02083"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lords from the Opposition and the Liberal Party for what they have said and for the understanding that they have shown in these difficult circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02084"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming the Statement of the Leader of the House, which indicates a much more seemly attitude on the part of the Government towards this very important Bill&#x2014;and particularly during the visit of President Kaunda&#x2014;may I ask one simple and indeed simplistic question? A number of us have put
<col>1040</col>
Starred Questions down for Monday. What now happens to those?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02085"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret this. I would not have thought that it was advisable for the House to meet just for Starred Questions. I can only apologise for the difficulties involved for noble Lords who have put down Questions. A possible answer, given these difficulties, is for the Questions to be withdrawn and put down for another day, or they may be left and they will receive Written Answers, whichever noble Lords prefer.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BILL OF RIGHTS BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02086">Second Reading debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02087">6.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02088"><member>Lord O'HAGAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that so many of your Lordships have come to hear about the Bill of Rights, and I welcome the interest which this House continues to take in this important subject. May we now return from Rhodesia to Strasbourg. I returned from Strasbourg, leaving at 4 o'clock this morning, in order to take part in this debate, so I hope your Lordships will excuse some of the incoherence of my remarks. I should like to sympathise very much with the noble Baroness, Lady Gaitskell. I, too, came with various proposed speeches, all of which I have now abandoned because the deeper principles, which those of us on the Committee who agreed that this Bill should be incorporated into domestic British law share, have all been dealt with, in particular in two remarkable speeches by the noble Lord. Lord Redcliffe-Maud, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman.<lb/>
I should therefore like to make a few comments merely in the margin&#x2014;a few "scribbles at the top of the chapter"&#x2014;but before embarking on my own small commentary on the passage of this Bill I should like to thank all my colleagues on the Select Committee for having contributed to my further education in these matters. Your Lordships' House has a special role in the constitutional development of this country and I think this Select Committee can be an example of how this House, in its present form, can contribute to the solution of the constitutional
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0529"/>
<col>1041</col>
difficulties which my noble friend Lord Carr discussed in his most important speech. Like every other participant in this debate, I must thank most of all the noble Lord, Lord Wade, for his persistence in bringing this matter to your Lordships' attention. I hope he will not need to persist for too much longer.<lb/>
I was alarmed&#x2014;I am sorry that the noble and learned Lord has gone&#x2014;by the nature of the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, as well as by some of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, not because they sit on the opposite side of the House, since the difference between their views and mine is not essentially of a Party political nature; but it seems to me that the arguments they advanced and the arguments we heard advanced throughout the proceedings of the Committee are really, if closely analysed, arguments against ever having signed the convention in the first place, or arguments against continuing to be a signatory to it, having signed it.<lb/>
These arguments are based on a deep and introverted view of the nature of law and Parliament. They are arguments which reject any relevance of an internationally binding convention of any sort, if taken <i>ad absurdum,</i> because the arguments they were putting forward are of a sort which lead one, taken to their fullest conclusion, to be opposed to the idea of having binding conventions of this sort. That, my Lords, is the starting point of my own education. I will not go through all the rest of the stages in your Lordships' House tonight. We sat for a long time in the Select Committee and, like many other members, I began as a doubter. It was this, as it seemed to me, slightly emotional attitude of some of the opponents towards incorporation that started to raise questions in my mind which led in the end to my being one of the majority of eight in favour of incorporation.<lb/>
I wish to leave the legal arguments to others, not out of cowardice but because there are others who will deal with them better. I should like to return to the nub of the argument of the noble and learned Lord. Lord Elwyn-Jones. He was arguing for a very rigid demarcation line and for a very firm and stern barrier between the judiciary and Parliament. I agree that
<col>1042</col>
that line must be firm and must be stern. I also agree, to use his words, that:
<quote>"Parliament is the place for the discussion of broad issues of public policy".</quote>
Of course it is, and of course it must remain so; but all elected bodies tend towards the tyranny of the temporary majority. I have just joined a new elected body without traditions. I am a member of a temporary majority of the Centre Right in the European Parliament. It is very annoying in committee when independent members of the libertarian Left lie on the floor or cut off all the microphones. It is extremely infuriating when those of us who wish to work are prevented from so doing because somebody else tables 5,000 amendments to a particular report. But concern about getting on with the job must not turn into tyranny of the temporary majority&#x2014;and Parliaments can turn tyrannical. I would ask your Lordships to look at what happened during the French Revolution and to remember the lessons of Cromwell. So I think there are deeper considerations than a purely reverential attitude towards the role of Parliament in these matters. We must remember that Parliament itself can be an instrument of tyranny if it is not restrained, and this is the place of the European Convention in helping towards the restraint of the tyranny of the temporary majority.<lb/>
Some noble and learned Lords&#x2014; not in this debate but in other debates on previous incarnations of this Bill&#x2014;have cast aspersions on the mental agility and deductiveability of the British judiciary. Other Members of this House&#x2014;not I&#x2014; have said they would be incapable of ever applying this Convention. I doubt this myself. I do not know, but I suspect that most judges are capable of judging on a wide variety of evidence. I am also concerned, to use the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, at the emotional tone in which this sort of comment is made. There is a place for emotion in these discussions because noble Lords are talking about what each of us believes in deeply and how it can he protected. Of course there is a place for proper emotion, because we feel deeply about these matters; but we cannot let feelings allow us to cut off the possibility of adaption. The emotional tone of some of these comments about the incapability of judges to adapt themselves to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0530"/>
<col>1043</col>
interpreting the European Convention, as if they were tender, ignorant and innocent people who must somehow be protected from pollution by these dangerous and libertarian ideas, is something that I find reprehensible.<lb/>
I think the British people, of all different races and parts, especially Wales&#x2014;I see the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, and his views are well known&#x2014;have a genius for taking things from abroad, adapting them and developing them into something specifically British: look at architecture, music, Christianity or the Monarchy. All those ideas are not ours alone but we have developed them into something which is specially ours. Are judges somehow so foolish and so wayward as not to be able to adapt the European Convention in such a way that they can make use of it here to protect those categories of people mentioned by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman?<lb/>
I conclude by saying that there are three major anxieties which preoccupy me about the downward path of this country. One is constitutional decay. I share the concern of my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley and I implore my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to use his influence to make sure that this Government help to prop up the British constitution and develop it and advance it wherever they can.<lb/>
I am concerned also about the decline in the respect for the law generally. The incorporation of this Bill into our own domestic law would be a minor and modest step in showing that we would obey our international obligations and make the law more accessible to the individual. But especially as a European Parliamentarian, I am concerned about our increasing tendency towards narrow introversion and the kind of backward-lookingness which is restrictive and not proud of tradition. Of course, anybody who forgets his past cannot build a secure future and that applies to any country. But if we allow the perspectives to become so narrow that we look at the rest of the world through nothing but a telescope made in Britain, then we are in danger. Some of the concern, some of the opposition and some of the anxieties about this Bill are of that narrow introverted nature, and it is that kind of narrow introverted view of our future that led to
<col>1044</col>
our staying out of the Community for far too long, and has led to our not ratifying this international obligation in domestic law for too long.<lb/>
I conclude&#x2014;I said that earlier, but I mean it this time&#x2014;with a plea to my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack, to whose difficulties I do not wish to add. Conservatives on the Select Committee, I suspect&#x2014;there was not a Whip&#x2014;all went in doubtful. They all voted for incorporation in the end. I think this illustrates that it is now becoming an essential part of the obligation of those who are concerned about the modern interpretation of the principles and roots of the Conservative Party, that constitutional issues, once relegated to the textbook, the federalist and the lecturer, are now becoming part of day-to-day politics and of active concern to those who wish the country to continue and to continue united.<lb/>
Of course, this is not a special prerogative of this Party or this House, but I believe that this Government now have a special duty to use the veneration for continuity and tradition, of which the Conservative Party is an embodiment as well as an exponent, to make sure that the British constitution works and works for everyone. This little Bill, which must, I hope, proceed through your Lordships' House quickly, is a minor part in that rather larger task. I hope that the Bill receives a Second Reading and a speedy Committee, Report and Third Reading in your Lordships' House before going to another place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02090"><member>Lord PLANT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, want to thank the noble Lord, Lord Wade, for his persistence in pursuing this issue and for tabling this Bill. It is a long saga. I just want to remind your Lordships that, when the Kilbrandon Commission was considering constitutional issues in Northern Ireland, a special document was prepared by the Government of the day which said:
<quote>"Many of the subjects likely to be dealt with in a Bill of Rights are subjects which it is proposed should be devolved to Scotland and Wales (and might also be within the competence of some future Northern Ireland legislature)"</quote>
In January, 1957, the committee of my noble and learned friend Lord Gardiner recommended that,<lb/>
<quote>"consideration should be given to the enactment of a Bill of Rights".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0531"/>
<col>1045</col>
Then, still with a Northern Ireland flavour, in June, 1975, my right honourable friend Merlyn Rees said in another place,
<quote>"A Bill of Rights or legislation covering the human rights law, will be part of the next constitutional legislation for Northern Ireland".</quote>
Twelve months later, my right honourable friend informed the other place,
<quote>"The Government acknowledge the consensus in the Report"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the Constitutional Convention&#x2014;
<quote>"that there should be further legislation on human rights. It will consider how best to make appropriate statutory provision in the light of the detailed study currently being undertaken by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland".</quote>
I had the good fortune to be chairman of that Commission and we produced a document which finally recommended a Bill of Rights for the whole of the United Kingdom. We could not see how there could he a Bill of Rights for part of the United Kingdom; that is, Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish TUC came out very strongly in their evidence in favour of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. The British TUC has recently gone on record as supporting a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. I can only say that a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland would not stop violence and I am quite unrepentant, having looked at this issue most carefully over a long period, in believing that a Bill of Rights for the whole of the United Kingdom is now necessary, because modern conditions and the march of events point to the need for such a Bill.<lb/>
For example, we contrast with other countries in not having fundamental rights guaranteed. This is more important than ever, given our accession to the European Economic Community and the proposed accession of the Community to the European Convention on Human Rights. Your Lordships' Sub-Committee on Law now has before it the document from the EEC and it will he interesting to see its conclusions. It would be better to make a conscious decision about a Bill of Rights, rather than wait for the European Court in Luxembourg to start making decisions about what ought to happen in our domestic law.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Carr, said, there have to be adequate constitutional
<col>1046</col>
powers to prevent the abuse of power by Government or Parliament. There is no modern and coherent system of administrative law enabling citizens to obtain prompt, speedy and adequate legal redress for the misuse of administrative powers by public authorities. The number of cases going to Strasbourg is growing, and it would be an advantage, in terms of access to our own courts and a saving in cost to members of the public, if we had the European Convention incorporated into our laws. The noble Viscount, Lord Massereene and Ferrard, made the point that we ought to reduce the cost to individuals of endeavouring to obtain redress.<lb/>
We must look to the future. A Bill of Rights would face up to the problems which we can only vaguely foresee. We live in a very complex industrial society and the scope and impact of new technology on employment, education and economy is quite fantastic. But these changes and advantages will somehow have to be controlled, and it would be helpful if, under Article 8 of the European Convention&#x2014;which reads,
<quote>" Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence"&#x2014;</quote>
persons concerned about privacy could raise in a court the implications of the technological change, if they so wished.<lb/>
The point here is that in a stable society existing legal institutions can "apply the law", but we are experiencing rapid technological changes and it is vital, when change is the order of the day, that there is a meaningful way of gaining an answer as to what should or should not happen, and how the change should proceed or should be controlled. Whatever the imperfections of the European Convention, at the very least it is a valuable and worthwhile starting point. Improvements to it could be introduced, but in conjunction with our partners in Europe. The articulation of rights in the European Convention&#x2014;Article 60 mentions this&#x2014;in a Bill of Rights in the United Kingdom would not detract from the existing rights provided under the statute or the common law of England. Article 60 reads:
<quote>"Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as limiting or derogating from any of the human rights and fundamental freedoms which may he ensured under the laws of any High Contracting Party or under any other agreement to which it is a Party".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0532"/>
<col>1047</col>
Many of the people who argue against the incorporation of the convention into our laws seem to omit consideration of that issue.<lb/>
We are aware that over the years there have been many measures to try to protect the civil liberties of citizens and to ensure that the convention is understood only as 'a minimum standard. The alleged difficulties for a judiciary are over-emphasised. It is entirely possible for the judges to adapt their practices and interpretations to read existing law in terms of the European Convention, and some already feel that as an international obligation they must already do so. This has been emphasised in the penetrating speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman. May I say how persuasive was the speech made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, and how delighted I was to learn today that the noble and learned Lord will be delivering the Lord Mac-dermott Lecture at Queen's University, Belfast, next April and that he will also be undertaking a task for the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland, since he is to address a symposium on a Rill of Rights.<lb/>
There is an anxiety as to whether the entire convention and protocols should be incorporated, or only the substantive provisions. The argument in favour of the former is to avoid confusion by tinkering with the convention as drafted. The argument in favour of the latter is not to clutter up a Bill of Rights statute with procedural material which would additionally dilute the effect of a clear statement of guaranteed rights. There should be a positive statement of the rights guaranteed under law. There is an educative effect and value of a positive statement of rights. It would be useful if there were a schedule setting out the substantive provisions of the statute. Whether this should be Articles 1 to 14 or Articles I to 18 is not really crucial. However, it should be set out somewhere for all to see the basic and fundamental rights which must and will be guaranteed by law.<lb/>
Some people say that it is impossible, under Motions of parliamentary sovereignty, to entrench any statute so that the provisions are superior to other statutory
<col>1048</col>
provisions, while other people say that a Bill of Rights must be entrenched and have superior validity. I am convinced that as a matter of politics the point is not very strong. If you announced a guaranteed list of rights, then it would be an extremely courageous Government which ever tried to detract from them. In other words, a Bill of Rights would be clung on to by the public.<lb/>
Stating Articles Ito 14 and the protocols would be useful. In addition, however, it is essential that Article 60 should be respected, whether by incorporation in the Bill or otherwise. The whole point of Article 60 is to make it plain that the convention only guarantees some basic rights and is not exhaustive and does not cut down under the other rights and privileges allowed under the domestic law of any of the high contracting parties. It would be wise in any Bill of Rights statutes made in the United Kingdom to understand that other rights are not disparaged or denied in any way.<lb/>
The important element before your Lordships' House is to have support in favour of the principle of Lord Wade's Bill. There will be detailed amendments in committee and I have indicated some of those which might possibly materialise. Our discussions are a continuing source of parliamentary education about the values of a democratic society. Like my noble friend Lady Gaitskell, I hope that the discussions will very soon be brought to a successful and fruitful conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02091">6.36 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02092"><member>Lord ALLEN of ABBEYDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise with some diffidence at this stage of the debate, but having totted up the number of speakers who have spoken in favour of the Bill it is perhaps time for a voice to be heard briefly expressing a rather different view. May I begin by saying that for reasons of which the noble Lord, Lord Wade, is aware I was unable to be present for the first part of his speech, and to my regret I missed the comments which I understand he was kind enough to make about the Select Committee. This was indeed a fascinating and, as I found it, educative experience.<lb/>
One of the things I learned on the Select Committee was that the United Kingdom is the only signatory of the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0533"/>
<col>1049</col>
European Convention which has neither incorporated the convention into its domestic law nor evolved a charter of fundamental rights as part of a written constitution. I am bound to go on and say that I have never seen this as being conclusive on the question whether we should now legislate. However, when we last discussed these issues there was some doubt about whether a recent and rather complicated judgment of the Strasbourg Court&#x2014;in the case, as I recall, of <i>Klass and Others</i>&#x2014;has some bearing on whether there was an obligation upon a signatory to embody the convention into its domestic law.<lb/>
I am not sure whether those doubts have been resolved. However, on the assumption that this judgment of the Court does not put a firm obligation on us, I am bound to say that notwithstanding the eloquent arguments we have heard today&#x2014;notably from the Cross-Benches&#x2014;I remain unrepentant in keeping to the conclusion I reached on the Select Committee. And may I say to the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan. that I reached in an unemotional way the conclusion that the case for incorporating the convention into our domestic law has not been made out.<lb/>
Like other speakers, I do not want to go over ground that we have already trodden several times. However, I should like to say that one of the considerations which appeals to me is the question of uncertainty. I am afraid that the explanation today of my noble and learned friend Lord Scarman has not removed all my doubts. The problem, as I see it, is this: the effect of Clause 2 of the Bill would be that principles of wide generality, as set out in the convention, would override our existing legislation which is drafted in a very different way. The problem of assessing the precise effect of the general on the particular, and therefore of knowing exactly what the law was in important areas, would introduce real doubt and uncertainly&#x2014;doubt and uncertainty which could be removed only slowly, either by fresh legislation or by decisions over the years by judges on the accident of the cases which happened to come before them.<lb/>
I cannot see any analogy here with the functioning of the justices of the United States Supreme Court, for a variety of reasons, obviously including the fact that
<col>1050</col>
there is a written constitution in the USA; nor do I think there is a very good analogy with the function which our judges have always had under the common law. But these are issues which we have discussed several times before, and having stated my own view I do not propose to pursue them any further this evening.<lb/>
However, the second of the two points I want to make relates to the form of the Bill, if we are to have a Bill at all. If we are, as I think everyone has agreed, the incorporation of the convention with all its defects and absence of areas which it covers, is clearly the right course. I also welcome the new version of Clause 3, for the reasons which I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Wade, explained earlier today. There is, however, one small problem under that clause which has made me wonder a little and that is the position in relation to consolidation Acts, which appear before this House in a steady stream, passed after the Bill of Rights came into force. These Acts would simply repeat the existing law in a more convenient form and without any changes of substance, but the actual date of enactment would be such that it seems to me that they would then be caught by Clause 3 rather than by Clause 2. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Wade, commented upon this problem when he opened this debate hut, if not, he may like to consider commenting upon it when he comes to wind up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02093"><member>Lord SCARMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord is absolutely right. A consolidation Bill enacted after the enactment of a Bill of Rights would be caught by Clause 3.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02094"><member>Lord ALLEN of ABBEYDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. It is nice to have a judicial ruling so promptly. There are a number of other points, most of them discussed by the Select Committee, which make me wonder whether this short Bill, if it is to go ahead, does go quite far enough. If I may mention them briefly, it seems to me that they are rather more than being cosmetic amendments suitable to be raised only at the Committee stage. The first point is that the Select Committee thought that the convention ought to be set out in full in the Bill, and although I
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0534"/>
<col>1051</col>
did not hear the explanation given by the noble Lord for his decision not to include the convention in this latest version, I am bound to say that I think it is rather a pity that it is not included. If these provisions are to be of such concern, not only to the courts and to Parliament but to society as a whole, it seems to me that they ought to be readily available on the statute book. Incidentally, I cannot help thinking that if an amendment were tabled at Committee stage to add the convention and all the protocols it would probably be one of the longest amendments ever moved in the history of Parliament&#x2014;but no matter.<lb/>
I am also somewhat uneasy about the provisions of Clause I in relation to the protocols which the United Kingdom has not accepted. I am not at all sure that the clause would bite if we withdrew our reservations at some future date. I think there should be a specific power in the Bill to make Orders-in-Council to deal with such eventualities, and perhaps also to deal with future amendments of the convention itself&#x2014;and we all know that the convention is very much in need of amendment. I think one ought to be able to do this without having to legislate afresh each time. I think there should be a specific power in the Bill for the Government to be able to make a declaration of derogation in time of war or emergency. It is somewhat unrealistic to leave it to the judges to come to a leisurely decision under Article 15 after hearing argument on whether we are in such a state of grave emergency that we ought to derogate from our acceptance of the convention. Perhaps more important, I am inclined to think that the Bill ought to make some provision for remedies and I know that my noble and learned friend Lord Scarman had some sympathy with this view when he met the Select Committee, although I know too that this would take us into pretty deep water.<lb/>
References to the closed shop remind me that one point for consideration is whether the Bill ought to provide specifically that its provisions can be invoked against non-governmental organisations and private parties: and I think, too, that there is something in the conclusion which the Select Committee came to, that the Bill itself should make provision
<col>1052</col>
requiring the courts to have regard to the jurisprudence at Strasbourg, although certainly not making it binding upon them. That is quite a formidable list of points on which this short Bill is silent and if some of them were adopted at later stages the Bill could end up by looking quite different from the document we have been considering today.<lb/>
One final comment before I sit down, my Lords. Reading again the previous reports and debates on this topic, and without in the slightest wishing to minimise its importance, it still seems to me that there is some risk of attaching too much importance to whether or not we have a Bill of Rights. A society which is contemptuous of the values embodied in legislation of this kind, as we know only too well, looking round the world, is not made virtuous by changing the law. It seems to me that more important are a country's political climate and its traditions and whether there are enough responsible persons and a responsible Press&#x2014;and perhaps I may end by quoting, I hope accurately, something which is not usually quoted in full&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02095">6.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02096"><member>Lord FOOT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, l wonder whether it would be permitted for me, although I have not put my name down on the list of speakers, just to intervene for a few moments: and I promise your Lordships that I shall occupy your time for no longer than that. I had the privilege, with others who have spoken in the debate this afternoon, of being on the Select Committee and, unhappily, I differed from my noble friend Lord Wade upon this issue. On the last occasion when we discussed this matter in this House I did not have the opportunity to make any contribution and I should like briefly to indicate one reason at any rate why I found myself in the position of differing from him.<lb/>
It is never agreeable to me to find myself differing from my noble friends, and in particular from the noble Lord. Lord Wade, but I fortify myself with the thought that there is no difference between us about the immense importance of this general issue of constitutional reform in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0535"/>
<col>1053</col>
this country, and the arguments for and against the setting up of a Bill of Rights. There is no disagreement about that. And similarly there is no disagreement between us about the importance which we attach to the freedom of the individual and to civil rights.<lb/>
Having said that, I do not want to do anything more this evening&#x2014;because so much has been said, and very happily said, on both sides of the House upon this issue&#x2014;than deal with one single issue; that is the issue to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, paid particular attention, and which has been perhaps the most important point of controversy during the course of this debate. It is the question as to whether incorporation of the European Convention into the domestic law of this country would in fact involve and include and import into our whole legal system an unacceptable degree of uncertainty.<lb/>
If I may say so to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman&#x2014;and indeed I address anything to him with the greatest possible hesitation because my admiration for the noble and learned Lord over the years has never fallen short of idolatry; it is highly idolatrous, and therefore I hesitate to make any comment upon what he has had to say&#x2014;I do not think that he has given due justice to the anxieties which not only I and others but many of his judicial colleagues have expressed about the uncertainty which this incorporation might introduce. It is not, I would suggest, a mere theoretical objection to introducing theoretical uncertainty into our legal system. It is much more specific; it is the fear that we will introduce uncertainty as to what are the human rights in this country.<lb/>
This is the cause of my anxiety, and what I should like to do is to seek to illustrate the reason why I take that view by reference to one particular civil right which is one of the subject matters of the European Convention. It is a commonplace, of course, certainly for lawyers, that in this country the way in which we have defined individual rights in the past has not been by engaging in generalised solemn pronouncements about the virtues of freedom of expression and freedom of speech and the like. The way we have gone about it, for better or for worse, under our constitution, is that we have sought to establish remedies available to the individual if his
<col>1054</col>
civil rights are in fact infringed. The way we have defined civil rights in this country is not by engaging in wide pronouncements but rather by providing remedies, so that if somebody's rights are infringed he has a remedy and he has a court to which he can go to obtain that remedy. The great virtue of that, I suggest, is that it means that the citizen can be reasonably certain of, and can reasonably ascertain, what his rights are. The danger that we see in the import of the convention into our law is that it will introduce, and indeed gratuitously introduce, a new element of uncertainty.<lb/>
May I explain to your Lordships very briefly how I suggest that that arises. Let me take one element in the business of human rights, the law of defamation, the question of freedom of expression. As your Lordships will all know, over the years in this country, through the common law and partly through statutes, we have developed a law on defamation which is at the same time sophisticated and complicated. It involves a lot of rather esoteric concepts such as the concept of absolute privilege, the concept of qualified privilege, the concept of fair comment, and the effect of malice upon the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege and the like. Over the years we have built up this system of law which defines precisely, or as precisely perhaps as one can do in human affairs, what are the limits upon the right of one man to write or say about another. That is the system which we have at the moment.<lb/>
Supposing, however, that you incorporate the European Convention into our system of law. You will be incorporating among many other things Article 10, which is the one that begins by saying that everyone has the right to freedom of expression. When one turns to the second paragraph of that article one finds these words&#x2014;I may say in passing that I am going to leave out words which are relevant to matters other than defamation:
<quote>"The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others".</quote>
Now, my Lords, what happens when we incorporate that in our law and we provide, as this Bill does under Clause 2, that:
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0536"/>
<col>1055</col>
<quote>"In case of conflict between any enactment prior to the passing of this Act and the provisions of the said Convention and Protocols, shall prevail"?</quote>
I should like to ask this question: Whenever anybody brings an action for defamation, libel or slander it will be open, will it not, to either party to question whether our domestic law as it has developed up till now has in fact been superseded by the Convention on Human Rights? That point would inevitably arise. It will not be a matter of crackpots bringing the matter up; it will be a matter raised on every occasion. The judge and the court will have to ask themselves whether the law as it existed before the passage of this Bill has in fact been superseded. Then the court or the judge will have to go on to ask whether the law as we have it today is "necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others".<lb/>
My Lords, why should a court, or why should a judge, be invited and required to engage upon a speculation of that kind? It opens the door, of course, to caprice and arbitrariness. One of the most evil features of so-called justice under so many of the totalitarian regimes of this world is that judges decide cases having regard to the interests of the State. Is every judge who sits upon a libel case, or indeed upon an issue which involves privacy or an issue which involves official secrets, always to ask himself, "Is the law that I am administering something which is necessary in a democratic State?" I suggest that that is a judgment that no judge or court ought to be called upon to make and a judgment that should be made by the representatives of the people&#x2014;by Parliament. It is for Parliament to make that decision.<lb/>
That is all that I wish to say. Unfortunately I still believe that this measure, as presented before us today, is one that will not be advantageous. However, I should have liked to say to the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, had he been present, that I entirely agree that, if we once start upon a major constitutional reform, then it may well be&#x2014;as has been said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone, so often on previous occasions&#x2014;that the case for a written constitution and a Bill of Rights, is made out.<lb/>

I was sorry not to be able to be present when your Lordships last debated this subject on 29th November 1978 in the debate on the Report of the Select Committee on a Bill of Rights. I happened to have been attending the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, helping to deal with human rights matters, among others, as a member of the United Kingdom delegation and, if I may say so, trying to emulate the high standard which had been set there over many years by my noble friend Lady Gaitskell. I should like to add how much I enjoyed her speech tonight.<lb/>
However, I have read the report of the debate of last November and, as a member of the Select Committee, perhaps I could add my warm tribute&#x2014;belatedly, but this is the first opportunity that I have had&#x2014;to the outstanding and genial chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, and the excellent service we all received from our clerk, Mr. Valiance White, and our specialist adviser Mr. Rippengal. Perhaps also it is not inappropriate to add that we all valued all of the evidence that we received, not least from the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland, chaired by my noble friend Lord Plant, who also made a valuable contribution in his speech tonight.<lb/>
There is another matter which was touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord Foot, and on which I hope that we are all agreed&#x2014;namely, that none of us, whether we are in favour of the Bill or against it, has a monopoly of enthusiasm
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0537"/>
<col>1057</col>
for promoting human rights and no one on the one side will say of anyone on the other side that he is wanting when it comes to furthering those aims. Indeed, it might be worth recalling a significant paragraph in the Select Committee's report, where it states in paragraph 6 at page 20:
<quote>"The Committee feel it is of great importance to emphasise that, although some of the members favour incorporation of the Convention into United Kingdom law and some oppose it, there was unanimity of view on the need to protect and advance human rights and unanimous recognition that both sides were wholly committed to the promotion of human rights".</quote>
I emphasise that, because, although it is most unlikely to happen here in your Lordships' House, it might be all too easy for some people outside to claim that those of us who do not support the Bill, do not care enough about human rights. I am also sure that, when the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan, in his interesting speech tonight referred to my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones and my noble friend Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, and rather suggested that perhaps they were casting cold water upon the whole idea of the convention, he was not charging them with anything of the kind. Indeed, as he knows, my noble friend, Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, was a member of the committee and we all shared with the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan, a passionate feeling in favour of human rights and so too with my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones. Indeed, as regards my noble and learned friend, I cannot think of anyone who has shown a more enthusiastic, long-standing and passionate support throughout his life for the cause of human rights. Having said that, I share the enthusiasm for human rights which was expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud, and by my noble friend Lady Gaitskell.<lb/>
As our debates in your Lordship's House have revealed, there are differing views within all the main parties, in your Lordships' House and indeed on the Cross-Benches as well. Therefore, I certainly cannot speak for everyone on my side of the House, let alone anywhere else. I was among those members of the Select Committee who voted against incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into our law. I should like to mention two or three of the main reasons for taking that view. Although some of
<col>1058</col>
those have been referred to in our debates in your Lordships' House in the past, I am encouraged to take this course by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud, because it' after some 30 years of the convention he can say that there are very many people&#x2014;indeed an overwhelmingly majority&#x2014;who do not know anything about that convention, I venture to fear that there may well be a similar number of people who still have not taken in the arguments against, or indeed it may well be for, the Bill of Rights of the noble Lord, Lord Wade. and the arguments about the incorporation of this convention. Of course, this is, in fact, the first opportunity that I have had to give my own view to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
One of the most fundamental objections to incorporation is that it would&#x2014;as the committee's report observed in stating the arguments against incorporation of the convention&#x2014;graft on to the existing law an Act of Parliament in a form totally at variance with any existing legislation, and in a way which would be incompatible with such legislation. Among those who have referred to this problem is my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones.<lb/>
It has long been accepted in our constitution that Parliament legislates in a specific form and that the role of the courts is to interpret that legislation. If we took the course proposed and incorporated the convention, we would be opening up a wide variety of legislative policies in a very general way and handing them over to the judiciary for detailed development&#x2014;not just interpretation, but detailed development&#x2014;on such subjects as race relations; freedom of speech; freedom of the Press; privacy; education; forms of punishment and so on. Yet, those are all matters which, under our constitution, have been the province of the legislature.<lb/>
I share the view of those who say that, under a Bill of Rights, it would not be the case that the role of the courts would be no more than the type of role they have always had at common law. For at common law the development of legal principles has been a slow process&#x2014;and that is something which has been referred to in the course of our debate tonight&#x2014;evolving, as has been emphasised, from case to case. But, under the Bill, they would start off with a set of broad
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0538"/>
<col>1059</col>
principles and would then have a free hand to decide how to apply those principles to the individual cases coming before them.<lb/>
In your Lordships debate last November the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, whose wise council and geniality we miss very deeply on so many matters in your Lordships' House, put the matter in the following way at column 1373 of the <i>Official Report</i>:
<quote>"Before we put a measure on the statute book must we not he quite certain that there is a need and that a need has been proved to legislate in the proposed terms? Very often legislation comes about as a result of some strong demands, often vigorously expressed. We have not, I think, experienced such processes. However, my opposition to the suggested legislation does not rest on my view that no substantial advantage has been shown to result from the passing of the Bill, but rather on my view that there would be positive and serious disadvantages.</quote>
<quote>"The legislation would be in a form quite different from the accepted style of legislation in this country. It would always be possible to change our scheme of things; it would always be possible to legislate and to lay down some precept or good intention and then to say, ' Now we leave it to the judges to work it out '. I should be wholly opposed to any such system. In my view, it would be quite undesirable for Parliament partly to legislate and then to hand over the matter to the judges and require them to legislate as to the remainder. I am quite sure that Her Majesty's judges will do whatever they are asked to do by Parliament. But I am also sure that they would not ask to have powers put upon them to make decisions which really are decisions as to the content of legislation".</quote>
So the noble and learned Lord endorsed that major argument against incorporation.<lb/>
As was pointed out in the committee's report, Parliament has repeatedly demonstrated that it is ready to move into new areas of law-making, where the need has been shown to meet fresh social problems. It is far better for Parliament to enact detailed legislation, as it has, on such matters as sex discrimination and race relations, than to leave it to the unelected judges, who are not there in any representative capacity, to develop policies and work out how they should be applied. Indeed, as we all know, a legislative role is given to some of Her Majesty's judges here in this very House, where part of their very function is to play a full and immensely valuable part in the statute law-making process. However, in my submission it is here that they are meant to fill this particular role, not elsewhere.<lb/>
<col>1060</col>
Another matter of great concern which has been referred to by a number of noble Lords who opposed the Bill tonight&#x2014;including the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, my noble friend Lord Lloyd of Hampstead and the noble Lord, Lord Foot&#x2014;is the uncertainty in the law which we foresee arising. Surely we would all agree that, so far as possible, the law should be clear and certain. After all, that is one of our principal roles as legislators. But if the European Convention were made part of our domestic law&#x2014;a convention which is couched in broad terms proclaiming wide generalisations open to a variety of interpretations&#x2014;it would introduce a vast area of uncertainty into our law. I agree with those who draw the conclusion that it would become much more difficult for individual people as well as companies and other bodies to get confident advice about their rights and obligations, their powers and their liabilities. As the Select Committee's report put it when noting this objection:
<quote>"The uncertainty thus brought into our law would itself afford opportunity for exploiting endless challenges in the courts or before any tribunal to the validity of the existing laws. No one would know where he stood until each question had been tested afresh, and the least that can be said is that there is the prospect of a very great extension of litigation in the courts".</quote>
To put it in less elegant language, it would indeed he lucrative for lawyers; a soft option for soliticors; indeed a bonanza for the Bar. Therefore, not for the first time in your Lordships' House I find myself, as a lawyer, advocating policies against more income and work for my profession. It is fair to say that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, in his fascinating survey conceded that there would, indeed, be more litigation arising.<lb/>
It is also noteworthy that the Law Society came out strongly against the Bill in its evidence to the Select Committee and in a note by its Law Reform Committee published after the Select Committee's report. Among the Law Society's strongest objections to incorporating the Convention, it mentioned the problem of the uncertainties that it said would arise in our law. Of course, other arguments against the Bill have also been raised; some are noted in the report and some have been mentioned tonight by noble Lords.<lb/>
I return to the main fundamental objections of those of us who oppose the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0539"/>
<col>1061</col>
Bill and the questions that those objections raise. This is not to venture into the nevertheless interesting constitutional implications that arise out of a survey of this whole matter, which, for example, have been mentioned tonight by the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley. However, the questions that do arise are, for example: Who should be responsible for reforming and developing our laws? Whose responsibility is it to legislate? In whom should power reside? Whose task should it be to intervene in new areas of law reform and who should formulate and introduce new, detailed measures? Should it be Parliament, with its representative democratic elements, or should it be the non-elected judges?<lb/>
I believe that part at least of this argument is about power, where power resides and should reside in our democracy and under our constitution. I am sorry to differ on this point from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, whose evidence on this to the Select Committee we all very much enjoyed. We are considering here matters of the highest constitutional significance.<lb/>
When the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#x2014;for, if I may say so with respect, whose views on legal matters I have the highest regard and, therefore, it pains me to differ from him on a matter of this kind&#x2014;spoke in the debate in your Lordships' House last November he raised a number of objections to opposition to the Bill. I was not there, in fact, to hear them, but in part the noble and learned Lord said that those who were against the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Wade, were saying that our own judges are too stupid or too biased to do what we have deliberately put into the hands of the judges abroad as justiciable. As I say, I was not present to hear the noble and learned Lord make his speech and I, therefore, do not know what was the expression on his face when he delivered those words or whether, partly at any rate, he delivered them with tongue in check. But I should like to assure the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that that is certainly no part of my argument and I believe it to be no part of the argument of those who are opposed to this Bill.<lb/>
Our judges are able people, perfectly capable of doing whatever Parliament asks them to do, as Lord Morris said last year.
<col>1062</col>
But in my submission it is a question of what Parliament should empower them to do, not a question of what they are capable of doing. The judges are powerful, and rightly so. Their power derives from the statutory authority that Parliament gives, from the common law and, on a more personal basis, from their own qualifications and intellectual qualities. It is true that the power they possess through the common law is considerable. To develop the law through interpretation and the gradual process of reform has, indeed, brought immense benefits over the centuries. This power has come down to them over the centuries.<lb/>
In my submission, it is one thing to draw benefits from those gradual developments, which have taken place over the centuries, but it is quite another suddenly to give that gradual common law process of interpretation and development a significant, if not vast, new role and purpose&#x2014;in fact, one might almost say a new statutory basis for the common law itself. It is a change quite unlike any change it has undergone before. Those who are against this Bill are certainly not saying, "Don't let us reform the law". On the contrary, we are saying, "Let us continue to urge Parliament to bring in the necessary reforms".<lb/>
In my submission the objections are not least that the uncertainties people would face in seeking legal advice would be too high a price to pay for the flexibility claimed by supporters of the Bill, and answer the claim that the individual citizen could not on any footing be worse off with a Bill of Rights. I am afraid that I cannot support this Bill, but I would just add that in view of the importance of the subject matter that it raises, neither I nor my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones would feel able to urge your Lordships to resist a Second Reading of this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02099">7.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02100"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I deliberately did not come into this Chamber with a prepared speech. I hope that my judgment in not doing so will be justified in the event, but one is always running a risk when one takes this course. Clearly I have a delicate task to perform. On the one hand I have to declare the attitude of the Government,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0540"/>
<col>1063</col>
as I understand it to be, as a member of that Government without disloyalty in any way to my colleagues. Secondly, I do so in the knowledge that I have gone on record, I should think not less than a dozen times, in favour of Lord Wade's Bill in one of its variant forms. I have spoken in favour of it in this Chamber at least three times. I gave evidence to the Select Committee once under the chairmanship of Lord Allen of Abbeydale, and I also gave evidence to the Northern Irish one under the chairmanship of Lord Plant. If anybody thinks that I am going to unsay a word of what I said on those various occasions when I was free to speak without constraint, I can only say he has misjudged me seriously. I am not going to unsay a word of it.<lb/>
I must say first of all on behalf of the Government that this Bill is one in which there shall be at every stage, so far as I can judge, a free vote. That is to say, I am free to vote for it and I should if there was a Division&#x2014;I rather gather that there will not be&#x2014;and so is every other member of the Government, free to vote against it if that is what they feel. It is a genuinely free vote. Secondly, I must say&#x2014;and I hope that this will not be too disappointing to the noble Lord, Lord Wade, because I gave him fair warning that he was likely to get at any rate this douche of cold water&#x2014;that having made what inquiries I could about the state of business below the corridor, I cannot see the smallest chance of an icicle in June of the thing getting on to the statute book this Session. Especially as although there are no party politics in this in one sense, my belief is that the Liberal Party, in spite of the noble Lord, Lord Foot. is 99.9 per cent. in favour, the Conservative Party I would think is about 70 per cent. in favour, and the Labour Party is probably about 70 per cent. against. The opportunities for the consumption of parliamentary time during this Session that this would present are, I think, an insuperable obstacle against the chances of its seeing the Royal Assent this Session.<lb/>
The third thing that I say, and I say it as a member of the Government, is that if noble Lords refer to the Conservative Party Manifesto at the last general election, they will see that we proposed constitutional talks. I was going to write to my colleagues in the Government and to
<col>1064</col>
either the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, or the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, whichever they prefer, and indeed to the noble Lord, Lord Wade. to try to find out what are the prospects of party talks on this subject of incorporation. We are ready to hold them. I am personally anxious to hold them, but I do not want to swim in treacle for about six months and then find that we get nowhere. So I want a candid answer&#x2014;not now, but in answer to a letter which I shall try to compose&#x2014;to the question of exactly where the constitutional talks that we said we were ready to have would get if we were to invite people to them, and of the form in which anyone thinks that useful talks can be held. I should like to see something like this on the statute book, and I know very well that I am not going to get it on the statute book simply on the basis of a main Government programme Bill opposed by the Labour Party. It is not realistic and it is no good pretending that I think it is.<lb/>
That brings me to the actual merits, or demerits according to which way you look at it, of the Bill itself, and of the arguments which have been deployed. When I was appointed Lord Chancellor this time my noble friend Lord Boyle of Handsworth&#x2014;I hope he will not mind me, without leave, quoting his verdict of me&#x2014;said that I had got an extraordinarily long experience. Indeed, I am the only surviving member of Mr. Churchill's coalition during the war who is still in active operation. So I have a very long experience. He said that I had a longer experience than anybody except Mr. Churchill himself.<lb/>
I am left, I must tell the House, with a growing sense of despair and exasperation at the appalling conservatism of the legal profession of which I am a proud member. It is no coincidence at all that those who have opposed this Bill&#x2014;whether it is the noble Lord, Lord Foot, or the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, or the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elywn-Jones, or the Law Society, or all the rest of them&#x2014;have all been professional lawyers, and they have all said, "Well, it will give a legal bonanza. There is so much uncertainty. It is a new pattern of legislation, and we really cannot face learning a lot of new law".<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0541"/>
<col>1065</col>
The other thing which has exasperated me in a long life has been the appalling inertia of this political machine, of which we are all part, in anything which is in the nature of structural change. It has been with a growing sense of despair that I have seen the gradual grinding to a halt of what I believe to be the effective working parts of our constitution. I have said that in opposition and I should be less than true to myself if I did not say it now individually as a member of the Government.<lb/>
To listen, for instance, to the noble Lord, Lord Foot, or to listen, for instance, to the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, about the role of the judiciary&#x2014;and I am coining back to that again and again in the few remarks I want to make&#x2014;one really would think that one would not have realised to the full that by signing this convention we have handed over to foreign judges the very role which they say we cannot hand over to our own. That is what I meant. I did not have my tongue in my cheek when I said those words. It annoyed the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, when he was sitting there more than I can say because he thought I was insulting him. But the fact is that I really meant that if you sign a convention in these terms the time to object, to put this sort of argument forward, was when we were handing over these very problems to foreign judges.<lb/>
When the noble Lord, Lord Foot, says, "What about the law of defamation?" he is making a perfectly valid point. It raises difficult questions. But it will raise them sooner or later in Strasbourg, because the foreign judges will have to sort it all out then and say whether our law of defamation is compatible with the European Convention, just as they had the other day to sort out the question whether our law of contempt was against the European Convention.<lb/>
This is where I take up what was said in an extremely eloquent speech by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman: by denying our judges a right to play a part in this debate they are adding to the uncertainty, they are compounding the uncertainty, because the court in Strasbourg&#x2014;and I have just visited it myself, just as Lord Elwyn-Jones did at my invitation; I thought it right that on rather different
<col>1066</col>
occasions we should go there&#x2014;is far from perfect. It would do a great deal to that Court if there was a jurisprudence in this country fitting the law of defamation&#x2014;fitting the various bits of the common law and statute law which we have inherited from our forefathers&#x2014;into the European Convention, as we are bound to do.<lb/>
If we listened only to the speeches against the Bill today, I think we should be surprised to recall that in every case (not in some or the majority but in every case) when we have given independence to a former colony we have not only given to the judges of that colony the right to decide the very subjects in the very way in which we are told we should be doing&#x2014;I quote from memory, "lasting and irreparable harm", as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, put it, to our own constitution if we gave it to our own judges&#x2014;not only have we given those very powers to the judges of every colony to whom we have given independence since 1945, but we have actually entrenched it in a written constitution so that they cannot be repealed.<lb/>
It is in this context that I feel like <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass</i> listening to my legal friends deriding the possibility that we might incorporate these things into our law when we have solemnly, and as a great benefit, conferred on them and given in every independent colony just that role to the judges. I say to Lord Elwyn-Jones, to whom I always defer with very great respect and love: I wholly disagree with him, and I disagree with the lawyers, when they say, "The judges have one role, Parliament has another, and one is better than the other and one must stand above the other". No one doubts that Parliament is sovereign&#x2014;that is what this Bill is about&#x2014;but if you ask whether judge-made law is better than or inferior to parliamentary law, I would answer that they ought to work, as they have worked for 350 years at least, in concert with one another, the one supplementing the other; each has its virtue and each has its disadvantage.<lb/>
Sometimes when I read the judgments of, say, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, I only wish that before he formed such radical conclusions he had the kind of evidence from numerous parties that is possessed by a Select Committee or Royal Commission. Sometimes in reading the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0542"/>
<col>1067</col>
particularity of the parliamentary draftsmen, whose esoteric art is accepted almost without question in both Houses of Parliament, I wish that they had sometimes tried to sit in judgment in a case in which their own work was being scrutinised after the event and see how many gaps they had left in it.<lb/>
That brings me back to the argument on the Bill and to what Lord Scarman said. If you sat, as I have been sitting now for the best part of 10 years on and off, on the Appellate Committee of this House, you would notice that nine cases out of 10 are concerned solely with the question of what on earth Parliament meant by certain unintelligible words. delivered a judgment in this House this very morning in which this question, fortunately with the concurrence of four colleagues, was debated, but it is not always that such debates arrive at unanimity. Oh dear no! In a judgment which we are going to deliver, I hope some time in the next two weeks, there is a long history of litigation about the same words going back to 1963 in which the House of Lords divided 2&#x2013;2 on one occasion, with the casting vote cast on a different point&#x2014;so that the case actually had an end result&#x2014;and certainly two of them had got it wrong.<lb/>
We are being told&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, says with great pride that this is an entirely new pattern of legislation which we are imposing on our poor judges&#x2014;to try to apply general principles to a concrete set of facts. I beg him to believe that I regard that as a virtue. I really believe there would be less uncertainty if the rules of construction&#x2014;and I am talking now only about the Bill of Rights but about the whole pattern of appellate litigation in this country&#x2014;which the courts after centuries have found themselves constrained to apply to statute under our present system&#x2014;could be properly tidied up.<lb/>
I believe it is only because the subject is so obscure and so little understood by anybody outside the profession that the thing is not a crying scandal. The thing is a shambles. I could give dozens of examples where different courts, differently composed, have been applying different sets of rules. Do you look at the mischief of the Act or how far are you bound by the actual literal grammatical interpretation?
<col>1068</col>
Sometimes you will find one judge apparently applying a different set of rules in one case from what he has done in another. And if you go to the magistrates' courts and the county courts of this Realm and see what is actually going on&#x2014;if you try to read one of the text books like <i>Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statututes</i>&#x2014;you will realise that there is growing uncertainty. Do you look at blue books? Can you consider the report of a commission? Nobody really knows the answer; some judges do one and some judges do the other. And I noticed a very remarkable judgment of the Master of the Rolls reported in this week's <i>All England Reports </i> in which he said, and I quote almost verbatim,
<quote>"We cannot look at <i>Hansard</i> to see what these words mean, but you can",</quote>
and he gave the reference as House of Commons <i>Hansard,</i> column so-and-so and such-and-such a date, and added for good measure,
<quote>"It was carried by a very small majority".</quote>
I should like to see the interpretation of statutes put on a more solid basis. It is a very difficult and thorny subject, but the Law Commission made a report in 1969 which I think deserves rather careful consideration. I know that there are great difficulties and I am not going to commit either the Government or myself to it, but all that this little Bill is&#x2014;and I accept Lord Seaman's description of it as a modest little Bill&#x2014;is a rule for the interpretation of statutes. If a certain section of the Law Commission's Report in 1969 had been accepted, it would be totally unnecessary, because that Section said, almost in the words of Lord Wade's Bill&#x2014;although it did not refer specifically to the European Convention&#x2014;that, in construing statutes, the courts ought to pay attention to the international obligations which Her Majesty's Government had undertaken and ratified.<lb/>
At the end of the day I cannot give the smallest hope that the Bill will become law&#x2014;not this Session anyway. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Wade, to weigh very carefully what I might call the series of committee points made by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. I do not want to rule or pontificate upon them, but I thought that most of them had some substance, and if ever we do incorporate the European Convention into our municipal law we shall have to pay very
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0543"/>
<col>1069</col>
great attention to the kind of questions which the noble Lord, Lord Allen, was raising. They cannot just quietly be brushed aside. The parliamentary draftsmen, the Departments of State, will have to come to some conclusion upon them.<lb/>
It is for the noble Lord, Lord Wade, to make up his mind in the end what he wants to do with the Bill. I shall vote for it on Second Reading&#x2014;except that I do not think that a vote will be taken&#x2014;and I shall give it as fair a wind as I can. But there must come a point&#x2014;I do not know when it will be&#x2014;when the noble Lord, Lord Wade, must ask himself whether he wants to go through the entire process of Committee, Report, Third Reading, and "the Bill do now pass", and so send it down to the House of Commons where it will undoubtedly founder if it goes down this Session, or whether he would prefer to adopt the other line of country adopted by, for instance, the noble Earl, Lord Longford, in connection with his Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill.<lb/>
I do not want in the least to unsay a word that I said in favour of the Bill. Everything that I would have liked to say at greater length was said better by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, or by the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud, or by my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley, with whom I agreed <i>in tato,</i> except that I did not agree with what he said about proportional representation. Having said that, I hope that I have told the House what the Government's attitude is, without any loss of personal integrity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02101">7.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02102"><member>Lord WADE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like very sincerely to thank all those who have taken part. It has been a very important debate, and the subject matter has been as distinguished as those who have taken part. I have made copious notes with the intention of making appropriate comments on each speech, but there comes a time when one has to assess what it is wise to do. I feel that the House will forgive me if I do not make those appropriate remarks and utter words of thanks in regard to the speeches that have been made. I am awfully tempted to start thanking the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, for his first point, with which the noble and
<col>1070</col>
learned Lord the Lord Chancellor disagrees. I am most tempted to encourage the noble Lord, Lord Carr; but I will not do that.<lb/>
I must make some observations in reply to the remarks of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor at the end of the debate. Of course I am aware of the situation; of course I have to consider very carefully what is the proper thing to do. After hearing the speeches of, just for example, the noble Lord, Lord Redcliffe-Maud, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, and the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan, I could not possibly not attempt to get the Bill through the House of Lords. It is not only because of the Members of this House. I do not want to be presumptuous, but a number of bodies are anxious to know what we decide. They want to know what kind of Bill we have produced. After all, we have been discussing this for several years. We have had a Select Committee; we have sat for over a year. If those of us who agree with the Bill cannot get through a Committee stage and produce a Bill, I am afraid that it will not&#x2014;I hope I am not disrespectful&#x2014;help the prestige of this House. There are points to be raised on Committee, and I would agree that some of these points require amendment.<lb/>
I think the only difference I detected among supporters of the Bill is the question of whether the whole of the convention should be incorporated, or only those parts that set out the rights and liberties. That I see as a fine point of argument, and I hope that it would not take up a lot of time. I would do my utmost to ensure that the Committee stage was carried through as expeditiously as possible. I do not think that it should involve an inordinate amount of time for the reason that the main difference is whether there should be a Bill or not. Quite clearly those who say "not" are going to flood us with amendments. I think that the points will be serious ones on the question of whether the Bill is worded in the most appropriate way so that we can get it through this House.<lb/>
As to what happens after that, I am not in a position to say. My jurisdiction does not extend to another place. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has given some indication that the

prospects are not exceedingly bright in this Session. But it is certainly my duty to do my best&#x2014;I have an obligation to my colleagues who are supporting me&#x2014;to try to get the Bill, in the best form possible, through this House, and I hope that we shall succeed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS UP-RATING (AMENDMENT) ORDER 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02104">7.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02105"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating (Amendment) Order 1979, which was laid before your Lordships' House on 23rd October, be approved. I think that it may be for the convenience of the House if we take at the same time the draft Family Income Supplements (Computation) (No. 2) Regulations 1979, the draft Social Security (Earnings-Related Addition to Widows' Allowance (Special Provisions) Regulations 1979, and the draft Social Security (Maximum Additional Component) Amendment Regulations 1979. These three Instruments were also laid before the House on 23rd October.<lb/>
The purpose of the draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating (Amendment) Order 1979, is to maintain at &#x00A3;45 the earnings limit for the dependent wives of certain pensioners. Your Lordships may recall that the Pensioners Payments and Social Security Act 1979 removed from my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Services the duty of reviewing and, where appropriate, increasing the amount of this earnings limit. As my right honourable friend said in another place on 14th June, it has become common ground between the parties that different considerations apply to the earnings limit for these wives and those which apply to the earnings limit for retirement pensioners. It has become apparent that, as a test of dependency, the wives' earnings limit is already too high. Currently, the joint rate of basic
<col>1072</col>
pension for a man and his dependent wife is &#x00A3;31.20, and it goes up to &#x00A3;37.30 later this month. A wife earning &#x00A3;45 a week after deduction of work expenses is thus already supporting her husband, rather than the other way round, and some dependency benefit is still payable at present if the wife earns &#x00A3;58 a week. Power was taken, through the Pensioners Payments and Social Security Act, to hold back on up-rating the earnings limit for those wives until it reaches a more realistic level.<lb/>
With the Bill on its way to Royal Assent, the main up-rating order, which was laid on 4th July, made no provision for increasing the wives' earnings limit. What was not made clear at that time&#x2014;indeed, it was overlooked in presenting the order&#x2014;was that what the up-rating order did was to leave the options entirely open by repealing the 1978 order, which had fixed the wives' earnings limit at &#x00A3;45. From that point we could have moved forward to &#x00A3;52 had the Bill not received Royal Assent, or back to &#x00A3;45 when, as of course happened, it did receive Royal Assent. This Amendment order therefore concludes the matter by retaining the &#x00A3;45 earnings limit from the old 1978 order, so that the limit which applies at the moment will continue to apply. In accordance with the provisions of Section 124 of the Social Security Act 1975, a copy of a report by the Government Actuary was laid with the draft order.<lb/>
I turn now to the family income supplements (known as "FIS") regulations. Here, I am in the unusual position of having to ask your Lordships to agree a further increase in FIS before another, already approved by Parliament, has taken effect. What we are proposing is an extra &#x00A3;1 a week for FIS families to help them pay their fuel bills this winter. Most families on FIS will get the extra &#x00A3;1 by the &#x00A3;2 increase in the FIS prescribed amounts. This is because the amount of FIS a family gets is half the difference between their income and the FIS prescribed amount, which depends on the number of children in the family. The increase in the prescribed amounts will not benefit families who would already be getting maximum FIS payments, and, for them, the regulations therefore provide an additional &#x00A3;1 in the FIS maximum payments. Raising the prescribed amounts has the effect of bringing some more
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0545"/>
<col>1073</col>
families into FIS who would not be entitled to it under the rates earlier agreed by your Lordships. Families who benefit from this windfall will in most cases get less than &#x00A3;1 FIS a week in total. They will, however, gain from the FIS passport&#x2014;the automatic entitlement to other means-tested benefits, such as relief from NHS charges, which FIS brings with it.<lb/>
When the Government's intention to propose the FIS increases was announced on 22nd October, they were explained as part of a package with measures to be taken by the Supplementary Benefits Commission. Householders on supplementary benefit with a child under 5 will all be given the 95p a week standard rate of heating addition if they are not getting it already. Wider coverage of the FIS families is appropriate because, unlike supplementary benefit, the FIS scheme makes no other special provision for extra help with fuel bills. Your Lordships may like to be reminded that the Supplementary Benefits Commission will also be paying the 95p heating addition to supplementary pensioner householders who are over 75, or who have a dependant who is over 75, if they are not already getting it. Looked at as a whole, the package is a mark of the Government's determination to help poorer families and maintain work incentives. The extra &#x00A3;1 a week will benefit around 85,000 families on FIS, and will cost about &#x00A3;5 million in the year up to November, 1980. The extra &#x00A3;1 represents a permanent improvement in the value of FIS: it will not be withdrawn at the end of winter, or have its value whittled down in future up-ratings. I am sure your Lordships will agree that this is an improvement which it is well worth making.<lb/>
My Lords, I turn now to the draft Social Security (Earnings-Related Addition to Widow's Allowance) (Special Provisions) Regulations 1979, the purpose of which is to correct an anomaly in relation to widow's allowance for certain women widowed on or after 6th January 1980. If a widow's husband had reckon-able earnings as an employed person in the relevant past period, she may also be able to receive an earnings-related addition on top of her widow's allowance. Under the existing statutory provisions, this addition is calculated by reference to
<col>1074</col>
contributions paid in the relevant period by her husband, which will have been related to his earnings. However, since April 1978 employed people over pension age have not been liable for contributions. An unforeseen effect of this change is that where the husband is over pension age, but not retired, and dies after 5th January 1980, it will no longer be possible to calculate an earnings-related addition for his widow in the normal way by reference to his contributions. From 6th January the relevant year for the calculation of earnings-related addition will he that which started in April 1978.<lb/>
The draft regulations rectify the position by providing that in these cases the earnings-related addition shall be calculated by reference, not to the husband's contributions but to his actual relevant earnings. These regulations have been submitted to the National Insurance Advisory Committee, whose report, recommending that they should be made, was laid with the regulations. I feel sure that noble Lords will agree that, in future, this small group of widows should be able to receive their benefit which widows in a similar position have been able to receive up to now. I commend these draft regulations to your Lordships.<lb/>
Finally, I turn to the Social Security (Maximum Additional Component) Amendment Regulations. These regulations correct a defect in the principal regulations&#x2014;the Social Security (Maximum Additional Component) Regulations 1978. If left uncorrected, this would result in certain widows and widowers who deferred their retirement beyond the end of the current tax year becoming entitled to more benefit than was intended. A person cannot receive more than one retirement pension, but Section 9 of the Pensions Act enables a surviving spouse, in appropriate cases, to receive a higher retirement pension (both basic and earnings-related additional component) by combining the pensions on the contributions of himself and his spouse.<lb/>
The provisions relating to basic pension cause no problems; the maximum combined pension is the standard flat-rate pension for a single person. In relation to the additional component, Section 9
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0546"/>
<col>1075</col>
of the Pensions Act, together with the principal regulations, provides that a surviving spouse can receive the additional component on his or her own contributions plus additional component on the late spouse's contributions, but only up to a prescribed maximum. It was intended that the prescribed maximum should be what one person could have earned had he paid maximum contributions in all the tax years relevant to the calculation of his additional component. The defect relates to the time when that maximum is to be calculated.<lb/>
As they stand, the principal regulations would enable a surviving spouse who defers his or her retirement beyond pensionable age to achieve a maximum additional component appropriate to a date up to five years after pensionable age (or the date of death)&#x2014;several pounds a week more than was intended. These amending regulations correct that defect. Regulation 2(b) of the principal regulations, which provided for the up-rating of maximum additional components, has been deleted as unnecessary. The up-rating provisions of the Pensions Act already provide for this. I am confident that your Lordships will accept the four instruments now before the House and I beg to move the first of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02106">Moved, That the draft order, laid before the House on 23rd October, be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Cullen of Ashbourne.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02107">8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02108"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cullen, for moving these regulations and the order and particularly for being so brief and clear at this hour. I do not imagine that there will be any problem over your Lordships approving these regulations but, because of the hour, I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Banks, and I did not meet beforehand to arrange some kind of division of labour. I am proposing to deal with only one of them and I have a feeling that he will deal with the rest.<lb/>
We must face the fact that we cannot look a gift horse in the mouth. Bearing in mind that the Government's tax cuts
<col>1076</col>
gave the richest 7 per cent. of the people 34 per cent. of the tax cuts and the poorest 10 per cent. of the community only 2 per cent., we should feel grateful for these further crumbs from the Government.<lb/>
As I understand the position, about 85,000 people who are in receipt of family income supplement will benefit to the extent of &#x00A3;1 a week or less to help them with their heating bills at a cost of about &#x00A3;4&#x00BD;million in a year. As I understand it, the Government are providing something like &#x00A3;162 million in new money. My first question is this. Is the balance to be used to defray the cost of paying the 95 pence heating addition to supplementary benefit households who are over 75 years of age and to those who have a dependant over 75 and to those with a child under the age of five? In other words, where is the balance going? I gather that it will only be paid if they are not already getting a heating allowance.<lb/>
I find this rather difficult to understand. Surely, all persons receiving supplementary benefit because of the low rate of benefit will be eligible for one of the existing three heating allowances and the 95 pence is not likely to apply in very many cases. If I am right in thinking that, I would ask the noble Lord how many, if any, will be eligible for the 95 pence heating addition and what is the total number who will benefit from the Government's present scheme? I imagine that the total number will be about 400,000 people. If that is so, I would remind the noble Lord that the previous Government's scheme resulted in about 4 million people benefiting, and that nothing like that number will benefit under the present Government's scheme.<lb/>
The Government in the other place claimed that the scheme was designed to help those most in need. The noble Lord will know that within the last few days the Government have released figures showing that there are something like 200,000 families living below the supplementary benefit level and, on this showing, the Government will be helping only about 85,000 of these. I want to ask: what about the remainder? The Labour Government's schemes were, I concede, a little cumbersome; but the Government did then spend something like &#x00A3;38 million in 1979 in helping poor families with their fuel bills.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0547"/>
<col>1077</col>
The last point that I want to make is this. I know that the Government have said in another place that the whole purpose of this was to try to restrict it to cover the really needy people who wanted help with their heating bills. This is why they put in the above-75s. But are the Government really doing this? Are they really helping the most vulnerable? As the noble Lord will know, quite recently a very serious survey was done about hypothermia. It shows that over half of those who are vulnerable and at risk so far as hypothermia goes are under the age of 75. While I feel that the scheme is really not meeting the needs of a very large number of people, I accept that it is going to meet the needs of a fair number. I am sorry that it has not been possible for the Government to do something tangible and to spread it over a much larger number of people who are obviously just as much in need.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02109"><member>Lord BANKS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cullen, for his very clear explanation of these regulations and the order. I think that if the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, and I had had a meeting before this short debate we might not have found it so easy to agree, because I wanted to say a word about the one that he picked on: the Family Income Supplements (Computation) (No 2) Regulations. Perhaps I can say a brief word about the others before I do so. The Social Security Benefits Up-rating (Amendment) Order is necessary to bring about the situation which we thought had been brought about by the previous order; and we debated the issue at that time. That order, I am sure, is acceptable to the House. It is clear too that the second order is required because a widow's late husband, over 65 and not retired at the time of death, would have no earnings factor because no contributions were payable after 65 and it would not be possible to calculate an earnings-related addition in relation to contributions. As a result, actual earnings are to be used. Again, I am sure that that is a very non-controversial proposal.<lb/>
As far as The Social Security (Maximum Additional Component) Amendment Regulations are concerned, I imagine that many Members of the House will have come across the rhyme in the days of their youth:
<col>1078</col>
<quote>"Brothers and sisters have I none, But this man's father is my father's son".</quote>
They would then have spent many frustrating minutes trying to work out who is talking about whom. I had a similar experience when I first approached this order. I spent some time with a wet towel around my head trying to sort out everything that had happened on all the events of this remarkable day when the person specified in line 5 reaches pensionable age, retires and dies and that person's spouse, if he or she also retires on that day, becomes, but for the double entitlement rule, entitled to two pensions. A very full day indeed for all concerned. I came to the conclusion in the long run that it does do what the noble Lord says that it does.<lb/>
But I am left with another small question. Ought not Paragraph 2(a) to begin "he or she"? And in 2(b), ought it not to read "he or she had had an earnings factor"? I ask this because "he or she" is used with reference to the surviving spouse at line 12. If the surviving spouse can be male or female, it follows that the deceased spouse can be male or female, as well. I do not think that the support of the House for that particular regulation will depend on the noble Lord's answer to that question.<lb/>
I should like to say a word about the Family Income Supplements (Computation) (No. 2) Regulations. Like the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, I welcome the &#x00A3;1 a week increase which these regulations provide for all those on family incomes supplement. It is, as the noble Lord explained, only one-half of the Government's plan to help the poorest with their fuel costs and it must be judged in that context. The other half is the provision of the 95p heating addition to be paid automatically to those families with children under 5 and to people over 75. The two together replace the electricity discount scheme. As the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, said, that scheme was cumbersome. It was not ideal and was restricted to one fuel; but it helped 3 million people at a cost of &#x00A3;38 million, as the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell explained. Therefore, there has been a substantial cut in financial help with fuel bills, from &#x00A3;38 million to &#x00A3;16&#x00BD; million and a substantial cut in the number of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0548"/>
<col>1079</col>
people helped from 3 million to 345,000. Again, as the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, pointed out, many now eligible for supplementary benefit heating addition automatically under this new provision are already getting it, since more than half of the supplementary benefit beneficiaries are already receiving a heating addition.<lb/>
However, those who are helped are helped on average more substantially, approximately &#x00A3;50 per year per head on average as opposed to &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;50p. In this respect, those on family income supplement are particularly helped. Under the old scheme, if one had an electricity bill of &#x00A3;40 and was receiving supplementary benefit at the lowest rate of heating addition, one received &#x00A3;54&#x00B7;20p per annum. If one received family income supplement, one only received &#x00A3;10. That will now be increased to &#x00A3;52 for most people on family income supplement, and that undoubtedly is good.<lb/>
But what about the person on rent or rate rebate who received &#x00A3;5 before and now gets nothing? Those who were included before and are now left out must total about 2&#x00BD; million, and they include pensioners on rent and rate rebates (because they are not on supplementary benefit) and pensioners aged between 65 and 75 who will not get any automatic payment, although of course they will be able to claim. But they are a group very vulnerable to hypothermia as the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, said. There are families with children over five on supplementary benefit. They may claim heating addition but they will not get it automatically as the people now on family income supplement in similar circumstances will. I am concerned that the range of beneficiaries is not wide enough. I am concerned that the cut in the amount of money available from &#x00A3;38 million to &#x00A3;16&#x00BD; million should be so drastic. It is a cut of 56 per cent.<lb/>
If the Government had tackled the problem through the benefit system but with a wider range of beneficiaries on similar lines as they have suggested but on a wider range, and with more money available&#x2014;on the scale provided last year&#x2014;then there would be less criticism of their proposals than there is. Though
<col>1080</col>
I say they should use the benefit system, I have a reservation about the use of family income supplement because of its effect on the poverty trap being means-tested benefit, and because of the take-up which is 75 per cent.<lb/>
Under the tax credit scheme, which we on these Benches would like to see established, it would be possible to have either a fuel credit for a limited range of beneficiaries but wider than the Government now propose, or an element of fuel costs included in the personal credits, which would be paid to everyone. This would be to provide, in one way or another, a fuel benefit rather like child benefit; and like child benefit it would not be means-tested and since the object of a tax credit scheme is to get away from means tests and lift the great number of people off supplementary benefit who are on it at the moment, that would be an important point. Like the child benefit, it would help the poorest most.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02110">8.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02111"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for what they have said. There has been some criticism but, on the whole, acceptance of the regulations. The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, asked me who really gets this benefit, apart from the 85,000 families on FIS. He is quite right: the cost for those 85,000 families is about &#x00A3;5 million a year. We estimate that about 110,000 pensioners will receive it, also at a cost of about &#x00A3;5 million, and 150,000 beneficiaries with young children will benefit. That will cost about &#x00A3;6&#x00BD; million. That is how the balance is made up.<lb/>
So far as the criticism of the FIS scheme is concerned, it does take the place of the previous Government's electricity discount scheme, which as the noble Lord, Lord Banks, said, did run into a fair amount of criticism. Five pounds was given to a lot of people who in point of fact did not deserve to have it&#x2014;children living at home over a certain age who did not have any fuel bills to pay, and so on. I think that everybody realises that that scheme, although costly, was spread very thinly and did not altogether go to the most needy people. Again, as the noble Lord, Lord Banks, said, the average receipt
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0549"/>
<col>1081</col>
was about &#x00A3;7.50p. We have a different scheme which is to give about &#x00A3;50 to the most needy people. There are always lots of needy people, and, unfortunately, in these days, we cannot give all we should like to give to all the people who would like to have it, and who perhaps really do need it.<lb/>
There is another criticism of that other scheme, and that is that it cost &#x00A3;4 million to administer. Our scheme, which, admittedly, only comes to &#x00A3;16 million or &#x00A3;17 million as opposed to &#x00A3;38 million, will only cost &#x00A3;400,000. That I think is undoubtedly in its favour.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Banks, asked perhaps a slightly jocular question about "he or she". There is probably a good deal in what the noble Lord has said. "Person" seems quite a reasonable word. It applies to "he or she", and I think that the draftsman probably found it difficult to think of a better word than "person". It may well be that "he or she" would have been better. I doubt if the noble Lord will wish&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02112"><member>Lord BANKS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, very briefly, it was not that I was objecting to the word "person", but the text just said "he" in the two places to which I referred. I felt it should say "he or she" because it was, as I understand it, referring to a man or a woman. Further down in the order that distinction is made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02113"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is certainly substance in that, but I doubt if the noble Lord would wish to have it changed.

They are in the course of negotiating such agreements with Fiji, Malaysia and the Philippines. The agreements already concluded guarantee that British investors will receive the same treatment as national investors or other foreign investors and that they will receive prompt, adequate and effective compensation in the event of expropriation. It would not be practical to link the conclusion of such agreements with the grant of aid to developing countries. The new Lom&#x00E9; Treaty signed on 31st October has attached to it a joint declaration about the non-discriminatory treatment of investments from Member States of the EEC.</p>

<title>TELEPHONE BILL LEAFLET</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02162"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02163">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02164">To ask Her Majesty's Government to how many premises not provided with telephones has the Post Office sent a letter explaining why a telephone bill has not been sent to these premises; and what will be the cost of this operation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02165"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the leaflet to which the noble Lord refers was sent to approximately 7&#x00BC; million addresses without telephones, as well as some 15 million dwellings with telephones. The cost was approximately &#x00A3;500,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02166"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the Post Office be better engaged at attempting to halt the decline in the standard of its services and the increasing charge for them rather than indulging in action of this kind, which must cause quite a lot of alarm and despondency to all sorts of humble people who have not the faintest idea what it is all about?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02167"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Post Office is all the time attempting to increase its standards of productivity and the noble Lord will, I am sure, accept the fact that this leaflet was sent out to allay alarm which had been felt by many of the customers of the Post Office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02168"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: But can my noble friend explain, my Lords, how the delivery of this leaflet at a house which does not have a telephone can allay rather than generate alarm?</membercontribution></p>
<col>1090</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02169"><member>Lord LYELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps it would benefit the House and help my noble friend if I were to explain that the method used for the delivery of this leaflet was the Post Office's household delivery service, which was both the quickest and cheapest method of providing this information to telephone customers. There was a considerable cost saving in both money and time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02170"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister to ask his noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter how it is possible for alarm and despondency to prevail under a Conservative Government?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02173">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02174">To ask Her Majesty's Government what action is being taken to get normal work resumed in Her Majesty's Royal Dockyards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02175"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of DEFENCE(Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the major interruptions in recent months to normal working in the Royal Dockyards resulted mainly from industrial action in pursuit of national pay claims. Now that the claim in respect of the Professional and Technology Group has gone to arbitration and other claims have been settled, these major interruptions have ceased. There continues to be a number of local disputes, in particular relating to the refitting of nuclear submarines at Devonport.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02176"><member>Baroness VICKERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that reply, may I ask him to consider the following: General managers of the dockyard should have powers delegated to them so that they do not have to take orders from Bath and London. Would he also consider giving powers to them to run the dockyards like a managing director of a private sector enterprise? Will he look into the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0554"/>
<col>1091</col>
question of salaries and wages to see that they are competitive with outside industry and that the four yards have the same system?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02177"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should, first, remind my noble friend that a study group is in existence under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Navy, and the question of delegated powers will undoubtedly be a matter which the study group will be investigating. I agree with my noble friend that the delegation of powers is a desirable objective, but, for example in respect of pay, it is very far from simple when the present system, which is not easy to alter, involves another Civil Service department in pay negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02178"><member>Baroness VICKERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that further reply, may I ask whether he is aware that I happen to have with me the Answer to a Question which I asked in 1956 which contains exactly the same comment as in the latter part of his answer today? Does he think that perhaps we could make a little progress now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02179"><member>Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT ROYAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I assure my noble friend that we shall be doing our best in the next few months and hope to report in the spring.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02182">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02183">To ask Her Majesty's Government what change they forecast for gross national product over the next 12 months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02184"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, TREASURY(Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would ask the House to await the publication of the next Industry Act forecast.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02185"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in the last five years of the Labour Government the
<col>1092</col>
average annual national growth was 0.3 per cent. and that, despite this experience, the last Government set a target of a 3 per cent. growth this year and all their plans of public expenditure were adjusted to an ambitious target which they had never succeeded in getting within one-tenth of in practice? Is this not a very unwise way of running the economy?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02186"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend does well to draw attention to these matters. One of the greatest problems we face is the low growth in the last five years and the fact that the previous Administration based so many of their plans on a projected rate of growth which was not and could not be achieved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02187"><member>Lord LEATHERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the Minister noticed that since June of this year production has gone down by 8 points for all industry and by 11 points for manufacturing industry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02188"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the problems we face at the moment are the result of the high rate of inflation which we inherited from the previous Administration, and there is the absolute&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02192"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister care to tell the House what the rate of inflation was when the Government came into office, and what it is today? If not, perhaps I could remind him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02193"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need no reminding by the noble Baroness. The underlying rate of inflation in May exceeded 12 per cent. The latest figure for the RPI is somewhat over 16 per cent.; of that, 3&#x00BD; per cent. is a once-and-for-all change due to the increase in the rate of VAT, which was introduced partly to finance the reductions in the level of direct taxation which were so sorely needed, as well as to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement, which was
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0555"/>
<col>1093</col>
running at a level far in excess of that which had been set by the previous Administration as their target.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02194"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that it is not so much the problem of low growth which is crucial to the people of Britain, but the fueling of unrealistic expectations by the forecasts such as the noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, originally referred to? Is he further aware that there is a school of thought which maintains that to continue the policy of indefinite economic growth is unrealistic and is doomed to failure because of constraints such as the availability of raw materials, and that we would do much better to consider the redistribution of resources, such as the cancellation of the Government's programme to replace the Polaris missile fleet with a new fleet costing &#x00A3;10,000 million, which could be devoted to the social services?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02195"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02196">Several noble Lords: Answer, answer!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02197"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was very interested indeed to listen to the speech by the noble Lord, which would require a speech to answer it, but in so far as he made one point which is relevant to the Question on the Order Paper&#x2014;namely, that referring to the publication of unrealistic forecasts which then fuel expectations which cannot be achieved&#x2014;I entirely agree with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02198"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend continue with the Government's policy of clearing the obstacles and increasing the incentives so that real national wealth can be created under this Government?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02201"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02202">The Question was as follows:</p>
<col>1094</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02203">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have made any representations to Bishop Muzorewa concerning his r&#x00E9;gime's ban on the transport of maize to Zambia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02204"><member>The SECRETARY of STATE for FOREIGN and COMMON WEALTH AFFAIRS(Lord Carrington)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have made it abundantly clear on a number of occasions that we regret the damage caused in Rhodesia and in neighbouring countries as a result of the war. That is why we are trying so hard to get a settlement at Lancaster House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02205"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that this action has nothing whatsoever to do with the war, and would he agree that the country of Zambia has, to its own detriment, played a very noble part, at the request of successive British Governments, in the application of sanctions? Is he really telling the House that, when he is discussing matters with the leader of the illegal r&#x00E9;gime in Salisbury, he is making no reference to this attempt at economic boycott of a Commonwealth country which is friendly to Britain?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02206"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that settlements are better than representations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02207"><member>Lord MOYNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask whether it would not help towards conciliation and the alleviation of suffering if Bishop Muzorewa were to suspend his embargo for, say, 10 days in anticipation of peace? Could not the embargo easily be reimposed if the so-called Patriotic Front will not soon agree to a cease-fire?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02208"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as soon as there is a settlement in Rhodesia none of these things will happen. The Bill before your Lordships this afternoon is designed to aid and to help that situation, and I hope that both the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, and my noble friend behind me will do their best to expedite the proceedings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02209"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order to facilitate the passage of this legislation through the House, and with a view to creating an atmosphere of good will in Zimbabwe itself, would not the noble
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0556"/>
<col>1095</col>
Lord the Foreign Secretary at the very least draw the attention of the bishop to the expressions of concern over this boycott which have emanated from all parts of the House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02210"><member>Lord CAR RINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I will do that. One has to remember, though&#x2014;and the noble Lord will be aware of this&#x2014;that at the beginning of the Lancaster House conference, before it ever started, I appealed to both sides for a cease-fire. Bishop Muzorewa accepted it and the Patriotic Front did not; and a great many of the results which all your Lordships will deplore have flowed from that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02211"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: But, my Lords, would the noble Lord not agree that this particular measure is designed to starve the people of Zambia, and if, as he claims, the British Government are responsible for the colony of Rhodesia, will he not please assure this House that he will use his best offices with Bishop Muzorewa to stop this attempt to starve people in Zambia? It has nothing to do with the guerrillas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02212"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the Bill which your Lordships are being asked to pass this afternoon becomes law and a governor goes to Rhodesia, then the matter becomes a British responsibility and of course this will stop.</membercontribution></p>

My Lords, I beg leave to move that the Southern Rhodesia Bill be now read a second time. The Bill which is now before your Lordships will enable the Government to take steps which lead towards the goal of legal independence for Rhodesia
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0557"/>
<col>1097</col>
with a constitution which guarantees genuine majority rule. That is a goal which all Governments, of whatever complexion, have striven to achieve for almost 14 years to the day. The history of the Rhodesia question is well known to your Lordships, and many Members of this House have played an active part in making it. I have tried, through my Statements on 7th November and on 24th October, and earlier, to keep your Lordships closely informed of the progress of the constitutional conference at Lancaster House. A summary of the independence constitution, which has been agreed by all the parties at the constitutional conference subject to satisfactory interim arrangements, has been laid before Parliament in a Command Paper. The proposals tabled by the Government at the conference for the pre-independence period have been placed in the Library of the House.<lb/>
Rhodesia has no parallel among the problems which have arisen as part of the legacy of Empire. Even the legal procedures necessary to bring Rhodesia to independence are different. The Bill before your Lordships will not bring Rhodesia to independence. That will require a separate Act of Parliament, and a Bill will be introduced for this in due course. The purpose of this Bill is to grant the Government powers which they do not at present have under any other legislation in force to make an independence constitution for Rhodesia and to bring sections of it into force before independence to allow new elections to be held. It also provides the Government with powers to appoint a governor to exercise authority over Rhodesia in the period before independence.<lb/>
Before describing to your Lordships the detailed provisions of the Bill, it may be helpful to explain the reasons why the Government chose to put the Bill before Parliament now and to ask both Houses to deal with it with unusual haste. I very much regret the inconvenience which this procedure has entailed for the House, but there are good reasons for dealing with the Bill in this way. In the first place, the Government have realised for some time that further powers would be required to implement a settlement. But we could properly, I think, have been criticised had we presented this Bill to Parliament before the parties themselves had been
<col>1098</col>
given time to consider and discuss our proposals, not only for the constitution but also for the interim period.<lb/>
I do not believe that can be said now. There is conditional agreement on the constitution; and there is agreement on certain important principles concerning the interim period. The points which require decision are clear. The need to move on to discussion of the cease-fire and the monitoring of it is pressing. In these circumstances, the Government must be in a position to implement an agreement without delay, and must have the powers necessary to do so. The Bill should give both sides at the conference confidence in the Government's determination to implement an agreement as soon as possible&#x2014;an agreement which will undoubtedly be of benefit to all the people of Rhodesia. If agreement is reached, momentum must be sustained, so that the progress towards independence is uninterrupted. I have thought it right to explain the reasons why the Government have asked both Houses of Parliament to agree to unusual procedures for this Bill. I turn now to its principal provisions.<lb/>
Clause 1 of the Bill will enable the Government to provide an independence constitution for Zimbabwe. This constitution, because it will be a constitution which has been agreed upon as a consequence of negotiations, will be made by Order in Council, which will not itself be subject to parliamentary resolutions. It will be laid before Parliament before the independence Bill is introduced. I should add that the text in the White Paper before your Lordships is the summary agreed at the conference. It is the Government's responsibility to draft the full text, and this will be completed shortly.<lb/>
Clause 2 of the Bill makes it possible to bring certain provisions of the new constitution into operation before independence. This will, among other things, enable elections to be held for the House of Assembly which will be established under the constitution. This provision, again, is peculiar to Rhodesia. In other cases where a territory is being brought to independence there has already been in existence a constitution under which the independence Parliament can be elected. In the case of Rhodesia, this is not so.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0558"/>
<col>1099</col>
Before independence other provisions of the constitution will need to be brought into operation to permit Parliament to be constituted under the provisions of the new constitution and a Government to be formed after the elections. These parts of the constitution will be brought into force by Orders in Council, which will be laid before Parliament and expire at the end of 28 days unless previously approved by a resolution of each House. This clause also provides for temporary modifications to be made to such parts of the constitution as are brought into effect before independence. I should make it clear to your Lordships that this power will be used only in relation to the proposals for the pre-independence period which the Government have put forward.<lb/>
Clause 3 provides for the making of Orders in Council for the Government of Rhodesia during the period up to independence. This clause will enable provision to be made for a governor and to authorise him to take the necessary action to organise free and fair elections. It is not the Government's intention that the governor should make changes in Rhodesian legislation other than for the temporary purposes of his administration. It will be for the newly-elected Government, which will decide which measures it wishes to perpetuate and which to repeal or amend.<lb/>
This clause will also give the Government the power to deal with the consequences of our decision not to renew Section 2 of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965. As I explained on 7th November, the lapse of Section 2 does not yet mean the end of sanctions. Clause 3 of the present Bill will give the Government sufficient powers to reimpose those sanctions at present in effect under Section 2 of the 1965 Act should there be unforeseen developments, unlikely as I think them to be, and the bulk of sanctions&#x2014;those affecting direct trade between the United Kingdom and Rhodesia and exchange controls&#x2014;will remain in force under other legislation for the time being.<lb/>
Positive action will therefore be needed before these sanctions can be lifted. That action will be taken when Rhodesia returns to legality with the arrival of a British governor and acceptance of his
<col>1100</col>
authority. I envisage that the period of time before we are in a position to lift sanctions will be very short. It would not have made sense to renew those sanctions which stem from Section 2 of the 1965 Act for such a period. Nor would it have made sense in the context of the progress made at the constitutional conference.<lb/>
The Salisbury delegation have accepted the British Government's constitutional proposals. They have accepted genuine majority rule and the abolition of the white blocking mechanism. They have accepted the conditions for a return to legality, including the appointment of a British governor and the holding of fresh elections. To have taken positive steps to renew Section 2 sanctions would, it seems to me, have been not only a churlish and petty act on our part, but an extraordinary way to acknowledge this progress and these concessions. We wish to encourage the delegations to make progress, not to impose fresh penalties on those who have done so. We wish to encourage them to look forward to the lifting of all sanctions. This we have done.<lb/>
Other orders made under Section 2 of the 1965 Act covering constitutional, matrimonial and nationality matters and immunity for persons attending meetings and consultations will be continued by the Bill. The matrimonial and nationality orders minimise the hardships undergone by individuals as a result of UDI. They have already been approved by resolution of each House. The immunity order was introduced to enable consultations, and the present constitutional conference, to take place. It would not have been possible for the leaders of both sides to assemble in London and discuss a settlement if they had been exposed to the hazards of private prosecutions. Parliament has not yet had the opportunity to consider the immunity order. Your Lordships will have that opportunity in the course of this debate. These orders, which have been saved from the 1965 Act, will not be subject to further parliamentary control. But any order made in future under Clause 3 will lapse unless approved within 28 days.<lb/>
It will be apparent that the Bill grants the Government broad powers. These will be necessary if we arc to exercise effectively the very considerable responsi-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0559"/>
<col>1101</col>
bilities which are ours and which are recognised to be ours by the international community. If your Lordships are to form a judgment on whether these powers are needed and will be wisely used, it is important that they and those outside this House should understand the Government's approach to the negotiations with the parties and the position which has now been reached in those negotiations.<lb/>
The Government's policy has been, and remains, to reach a settlement of the Rhodesia problem in which all the parties can participate. The conference has already yielded important progress which your Lordships have from time to time recognised. The greater part of the objectives set out in the communiqu&#x00E9; of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Lusaka have already been achieved. The white community have agreed to relinquish their blocking power in Parliament. The armed forces and the public service will be brought fully under the control of the elected Government. Agreement has been reached, subject to satisfactory arrangements for implementing it, on an independence constitution which in these and other respects guarantees majority rule. That removes the principal causes of the war.<lb/>
Bishop Muzorewa's delegation have accepted the full proposals for the interim period which the Government tabled on 2nd November. The Patriotic Front have accepted the principles of elections and a British governor but have not yet accepted other aspects of our proposals. I recognise that these are difficult decisions for the Patriotic Front to take. They require compromise and flexibility. But it has been no less difficult for Bishop Muzorewa and his delegation to agree to put the position which they established in April to the test of a further election only a few months later. It was a courageous and positive decision by the bishop to do so. I very much hope to have an equally positive response from the Patriotic Front very soon.<lb/>
The British Government too have had to take some difficult decisions, not least in undertaking to appoint a British governor with legislative and executive authority. Britain has never before been directly responsible in this way for the administration of Rhodesia. But the Government took this step because they
<col>1102</col>
had become convinced that only in this way could all the parties feel confidence in the impartiality of the administration in the interim. This is clear evidence of our determination to find a fair and honourable settlement. I do not believe that any other viable basis for agreement exists. It is too easily forgotten, if I may say so, that these are negotiations between three parties.<lb/>
The proposals which the Government have laid down before the conference represent what we believe to be fair to all the participants, to be just, and, above all, to be workable. Because one side has accepted them does not mean that the bargaining should now start once more to shift the balance to a point halfway between the proposals now on the table and the position taken by the Patriotic Front. That would represent, if I may say so, a fundamental miscalculation of the nature of these negotiations.<lb/>
My Lords, as I have said, the fundamental cause of the war in Rhodesia&#x2014;failure to agree on a constitution providing for genuine majority rule&#x2014;has been removed. The question at issue now is: who is to exercise power after independence? The position of Her Majesty's Government is clear. We intend to transfer power to a Government which has been chosen by the people of Rhodesia in fair elections supervised, as was agreed at Lusaka, under our authority. We have undertaken to appoint a governor with full executive and legislative powers to enable elections to be held in which all the parties can participate on an equal footing. We believe that a short and simple process is required. There is an urgent need for an end to political uncertainty in Rhodesia. We believe that a period of two months will be fully adequate for a fair election campaign. This period will commence from the date on which a cease-fire comes into effect.<lb/>
As I told the House and the noble and learned Lord opposite on 7th November, the governor will go out to Rhodesia as soon as a cease-fire is arranged. Naturally, if an agreement is not reached, the Government will have to reconsider the position in the light of what has happened in the conference and of the responsibility for the deadlock.<lb/>
Our approach to the question of authority during the interim is, as your
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0560"/>
<col>1103</col>
Lordships will see, emphatically different from that of the previous Government. The power-sharing arrangements they proposed were never accepted by either side and, in my judgment, were unnegotiable and would have led to paralysis even if they had been negotiable. It is for this reason that we have proposed that none of the political parties should play any role in the administration of the country during the period leading to elections.<lb/>
This responsibility will rest with the governor, who will of course be accessible to any political leader. The elections themselves will be supervised by a distinguished and experienced British official as election commissioner, with a full supporting staff. If the Patriotic Front, like the internal parties, are prepared to put their political support to the test in elections held under our authority on the basis which I have described, we shall move on quickly to negotiation of a cease-fire.<lb/>
The Government will propose that there should be a cease-fire commission on which the military commanders of both sides would be represented, under the chairmanship of the governor's military adviser. The forces on both sides would be equally responsible to the governor for the observance of the cease-fire and would come under his authority. In addition, in conjunction with some other Commonwealth Governments, we are prepared to establish a monitoring force to help reassure all parties that the observance of the cease-fire will be impartially assessed and controlled. That force could also serve to have a stabilising effect when the result of the election is declared and before the new Government is established and independence granted. It will not, however, be an intervention force which could find itself in conflict with the parties. I would pay tribute to the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, all of whom have announced that they are prepared to contribute to such a force.<lb/>
I regard this as a most important demonstration of the determination of the Government and of the other Governments concerned to contribute towards the transition to independence and a peaceful settlement.<lb/>
Whatever the proposals which the Government make, there will be no certain
<col>1104</col>
end to the war unless both sides are prepared to seek a political solution and put their political support to the test in elections. A heavy responsibility will lie on any party which refuses to submit its claims to this test and persists in seeking power by other means.<lb/>
At every stage of the constitutional conference we have explained our proposals in detail to the African Governments most closely in touch with the parties. We took the opportunity of President Kaunda's visit to London last week to clarify important aspects of our proposals for the pre-independence arrangements; as we pointed out to President Kaunda our proposals contain provisions&#x2014;for example, those I have mentioned relating to the election Council, the cease-fire commission, and monitoring&#x2014;which we hope the Patriotic Front and the front-line States will acknowledge as constructive measures to meet points of concern to them. I regret that nevertheless we have yet to receive a positive answer from the Patriotic Front to these proposals.<lb/>
Our ability to bring Rhodesia to legal independence on the basis of elections in which all parties take part now depends on the Patriotic Front's reply to the proposals which I have put before the conference. With agreement already reached on genuine majority rule and an end to the rebellion against Britain's authority, there can be no turning back.<lb/>
There will be no resolution of the problem if we accept that any party which refuses to put its electoral support to the test in elections held under our authority can decide unilaterally that Rhodesia should remain in a state of illegality; that the people of Rhodesia should continue to be subject to sanctions; and that they should not be given an opportunity to proceed to independence. We want, and shall continue to strive for, a settlement involving all the parties. This would be the surest guarantee of an immediate end to the war. But, if that is not attainable, we cannot allow the best to become the enemy of the good.<lb/>
The constitutional conference has therefore reached a critical point. I would be misleading your Lordships if I suggested that any useful purpose would be served by delaying the moment of decision. The Government, I think, have shown much patience and flexibility in the interests of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0561"/>
<col>1105</col>
securing a comprehensive settlement and we have by no means given up hope of achieving it. But we have not got as far as we have by postponing awkward decisions. The pre-independence arrangements have now been discussed exhaustively and over a number of weeks in the conference. The preferred solutions of all the parties have been explained over and over and over again and are well known. In the end, my Lords, the British Government have to make a decision on what they believe to be a just and effective course. The time has now come when we must know whether this course is generally accepted.<lb/>
Some may suggest that if we wait more days, more weeks, a settlement will emerge of its own accord. But, my Lords, I must tell you that after my experience of these last months it is my considered judgment that no question will be answered unless the British Government&#x2014;after the fullest and most patient discussion&#x2014;require an answer.<lb/>
We have made a good offer to the parties. It is an offer which we are willing to back with the British Government's authority&#x2014;the offer of peace, and of a fairly contested election: an offer we can fulfil. It is the best offer we can negotiate. Prevarication and postponement will not improve it. Indeed, the achievements of the conference so far will be jeopardised if its present momentum is lost.<lb/>
And these achievements are not inconsiderable. It has been widely recognised throughout the world, by Governments of different persuasions and sympathises, that we have moved a very long way towards a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Rhodesian problem. If we cannot complete the last part of the journey towards what I am sure all in this House would regard as the best possible solution for Rhodesia, it will not be or have been through lack of effort or determination on the part of the British Government.<lb/>
We have got this far because the Government have been prepared to exercise their responsibilities as the constitutional authority for Rhodesia. We are determined to carry out our responsibilities to the people of Rhodesia in full, and to bring them to legal independence at the earliest possible date
<col>1106</col>
and in the best possible conditions. This Bill will help us to do so by providing the necessary powers, and I beg to move its Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02226"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member> rose to move, as an amendment to the Motion for the Second Reading, at end to insert ("but this House regrets the failure of Her Majesty's Government to retain Section 2 of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 during the transitional period"). The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in moving this Amendment, I do so with full awareness of the importance that nothing should be said in the course of this debate, by me or by anyone else, that could prejudice the possibility of reaching an agreement with all the parties to the Lancaster House negotiations. They are still taking place and, indeed, perhaps have reached their most critical stage. Despite the warning note struck by the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary, which I trust did not indicate a state of despair and already the contemplation of a second-best solution&#x2014;a bilateral deal with the Muzorewa r&#x00E9;gime&#x2014;I hope greatly that the negotiations will continue and that the hope of that settlement will be reached.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02227">We do not forget that the negotiations are, of course, taking place in the most remarkable and unhappy conditions&#x2014;a bitter civil war still going on between the parties who are now in converse at Lancaster House; a war being conducted with armed forces trained and drilled, and with backers providing arms and help from outside the country. There is a vital national and international interest in ensuring that the Lancaster House negotiations should succeed. Failure would have grim consequences, above all for the unfortunate people of Rhodesia, whatever the colour of their skin. It would also have wider consequences, I fear, in worsening race relations everywhere&#x2014;in Southern Africa; even perhaps here in Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02228">I heard the President of Kenya saying a few weeks ago that Africa was a bleeding continent. It is a sad statement of fact. That bloodshed will increase if we fail to reach an agreement which involves all
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0562"/>
<col>1107</col>
the parties to the conference for, as the Lord Privy Seal said in another place, only a solution that involves all the parties will offer a sure prospect of an end to the war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02229">That was his statement. We on this side of the House have sought to be as encouraging and as helpful as possible during the course of the negotiations and we of course recognise that much has been accomplished; above all the agreement to the draft constitution and the other matters which were referred to by the noble Lord. But as the Lord Privy Seal, again, said in another place, agreement as to the constitution by the Patriotic Front is contingent on agreement on the rest of the package. He put it in this way:
<quote>"I&#x2026;confirm&#x2026;that the Patriotic Front's agreement to the constitution is contingent on agreement to the rest of the package, just as the agreement, which I hope will soon be forthcoming, to the interim arrangements will be contingent on agreement to a ceasefire".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 7/11/79; col. 419.]</quote>
I take it that that still represents the view of the Government; that the final and essential pre-condition is a cease-fire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02230">I was gratified to note that the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, said today what, in effect, he said on 7th November. But the matter has been put in some doubt in another place, whether because of the excitement and pressure of the other place I do not know, so I think it essential that we should have the matter clearly on the record. In column 833 of the <i>Official Report,</i> on 7th November, the noble Lord said here:
<quote>"Sanctions will be taken off when the governor takes over in Salisbury".</quote>
Some of the sanctions have apparently been taken off already, or they will be tomorrow. The noble Lord continued:
<quote>"and he will take over when a cease-fire has been agreed".&#x2014;[Col. 834.]</quote>
That has been repeated today. Then:
<quote>"I would not say that all the shooting will have stopped, but not until the cease-fire is agreed will he take over. Then, at that point there is, of course, legality".</quote>
Then, in a further answer the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, said:
<quote>"&#x2026;if there is to be an agreement between all the parties at the conference, between the Patriotic Front and the Salisbury delegation, it is essential that there should be a cease-fire, because if there are to be elections in which everybody takes part
<col>1108</col>
it is not possible to have them until there is a cease-fire. Consequently a cease-fire is necessary. In the context that we are talking about, it will obviously be necessary for a cease-fire and for the governor to go as soon as it is arranged "&#x2014;[Col. 835.]</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02231">Are we to understand, therefore, from those words that there is no risk of a governor being sent out while the civil war is continuing, he being placed, by virtue of his authority as governor, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and having to take some part in the continuance of the civil war? That would be a wholly intolerable situation. It would be a situation where the armed forces of this country would not be available to come to his aid. I feel entitled to press those matters. if need be, for further clarification, if there is any doubt about words that, to us on this side of the House, seem absolutely fundamental and very clear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02232">The tragedy is that up to this point in time, at any rate, the pre-conditions for an agreed settlement have not been achieved, and the Bill which we are now discussing is being presented to us before the pre-conditions for giving effect to the Bill&#x2014;the pre-conditions basically being an agreed settlement&#x2014;have been accomplished. Parliament is, in effect, being asked to approve enabling legislation which gives the Government broad powers before agreement is reached, with wide discretion not only on sanctions but on action to be taken, with the strength of the powers that we shall be giving the Government in the event of a breakdown in negotiations. One would have expected that the ordinary course would have been to come to Parliament when agreement had been arrived at. There would then have been no difficulty. Steps could have been taken quickly&#x2014;Parliament can move very fast in an emergency situation&#x2014;to give the interim and other powers that are sought. Bringing forward this Bill at this point of time, when, perhaps, the most critical part of the negotiations has not been accomplished, is putting a great deal indeed upon Parliament. The situation becomes very serious because one has now detected for the first time, after the patience of the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary over nine weeks, that a mood of impatience, of haste, of hurry, seems to be descending upon the scene. I am glad to see the noble Lord and the Leader of the House shake their head,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0563"/>
<col>1109</col>
but there was a slight impression of impatience towards the end of the noble Lord's speech today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02233">The noble Lord referred to the visit of President Kaunda, whose interest in the achievement of a peaceful settlement is very great indeed. His country is in the front line and is suffering appalling and continuing damage. President Kaunda achieved, happily, an excellent relationship of goodwill between himself and the Prime Minister during the Lusaka conference, but the House will have noted that he expressed concern about the pressures for an immediate, quick solution before negotiations had been finalised. He made a statement in which he said that he would ask Lord Carrington to continue to exercise his patience.
<quote>"This problem has been with us"&#x2014;</quote>
he said&#x2014;
<quote>"for the last 14 years. A little more patience might just do the trick".</quote>
I would venture to remind the noble Lord of the words of Sir Winston Churchill:
<quote>"Jaw, jaw, jaw, is better than war, war, war".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02234">However, it is to something else to which President Kaunda referred that the amendment which I am moving is certainly in part directed; namely, the action taken in regard to sanctions. In respect of the action which the Government have taken under Section 2 President Kaunda took the Government severely to task, and I think that the House might well like to know what discussion on that matter took place between the Government and President Kaunda when he was here. In a statement at a Press conference he called the decision on Section 2 "an unfortunate and incorrect decision" and said that it was mis-timed and would undermine the operation of the United Nations sanctions blockade in Salisbury. He added:
<quote>"The British Government says that 80 per cent. of the sanctions will remain, despite the ending of the Section 2 order".</quote>
But then he said this:
<quote>"But once you say the principle is being removed, then there is nothing to stop other countries trading with Rhodesia, whatever this Government may say".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02235">I do not think it is a sufficient answer for the Government to say that for the time being they are keeping in existence the sanctions imposed in compliance with the United Nations order. The fact is
<col>1110</col>
that the renewal of Section 2 sanctions orders, year by year, has been seen as a symbol of our determination to restore Rhodesia to legality. It is significant that in another place one supporter of the Government proudly described the non-renewal of Section 2 as "an act of great symbolism". As we all know, in politics symbols are often as important as realities. Another Member of the other place, also supporting the Government, described Section 2 as "the psychological core of sanctions". So this decision means that we arc touching on the sensitive nerve of action taken in the attempt to restore legality.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02236">Another anxiety which we feel is that, so far as the success of the Lancaster House conference is concerned, the very concession on sanctions to Bishop Muzorewa's side cannot escape at any rate giving the impression that the Government have departed from their stance of impartiality and of being even-handed. In this matter of sanctions we have a special, indeed a primary, responsibility to the United Nations. The sanctions resolution of 1968 affirmed the primary responsibility of the Government of the United Kingdom to enable the people of Southern Rhodesia to achieve self-determination and independence, and in particular their responsibility for dealing with the prevailing situation. It was that resolution which set up the areas of sanctions which were to be carried out and which were made the basis of our sanctions order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02237">I should like to ask the Government what action they are taking, or will take, at the United Nations in respect of their unilateral decision to waive an important part of the sanctions&#x2014;important not only because of their content but also, as I have said, because of the symbolism of Section 2. The United Nations still regard this country and the British Government as the administrative power in Rhodesia. This Government will be required to report to the Security Council any action which Parliament takes&#x2014;and the action which the Government take, for that matter&#x2014;on permitting some of the sanctions to lapse. The House will want to know what explanation the Government will give for ending some of the sanctions before the crucial settlement agreement between the parties at the conference has been achieved. I
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0564"/>
<col>1111</col>
ask the Government whether they think they have any reasonable prospect at the United Nations of carrying the Security Council with them unless agreement is accomplished at Lancaster House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02238">Much is at stake here. Our reputation for carrying out our obligations to the United Nations and our standing in Africa among African countries are at stake because, as we see it, of unwise actions which may do much damage in the effort to achieve an agreement. One wonders again why that was done. One can only hope that it was not any limited party consideration or party difficulty which was at the root of this highly unadvised proceeding.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02239">My noble friends and I have put down a number of amendments which we shall consider in the event of the House giving the Bill a Second Reading. The primary matter, to which I have already referred but which we shall need to consider, is the need to provide that this Bill shall operate only after agreement has been reached by all parties represented at the constitutional conference. That we see as a condition precedent to the granting of approval to the Bill itself. Then we see the necessity to make orders under the Bill dependent upon, as the Foreign Secretary has agreed should be the case, a cease-fire having been agreed. Those preliminary conditions for handing over these wide powers at this time to the Government we regard as fundamental, and it is for that reason that I beg to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper.</p>

I have listened with close attention to the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary and have much appreciated his very thorough explanation of the purpose of this Bill, and I should like to make certain things clear at the outset. We on these Benches fully support the initiative taken by the Government in calling a conference to seek general agreement on the future of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia.<lb/>
Secondly, we warmly congratulate the Government on the agreement which has so far been obtained, particularly with regard to the constitution. The features of the constitution at present in operation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia which prevented world opinion from regarding it as genuine majority rule have been removed and that would not have happened if, as some noble Lords wanted, the Government had proceeded&#x2014;as seemed likely at one time&#x2014;to recognise the Muzorewa Government following the elections earlier this year. So far as the transitional arrangements for the pre-independence period are concerned, it has been much more difficult for those not actually involved in the negotiations to know how near agreement really is, and I think that difficulty is illustrated by two quotations from yesterday's <i>Guardian.</i> The leading article in the <i>Guardian</i> yesterday began with these words:
<quote>"It needs a rigorous search to find any great issue of principle on which the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian talks can now founder. The Constitution has been agreed. The outline of a transitional r&#x00E9;gime is conceded. A British and Commonwealth observer force is ready to take the field. No one disputes, at least in public, that there must be a cease-fire. All close onlookers and most participants want a settlement as soon as possible".</quote>
Those were the optimistic words of the leading article, but on the front page of the same paper a report by James McManus concluded with these words:
<quote>"Thus, after 2&#x00BD; months, the conference has returned to the prospects with which it began: A London-Salisbury deal which will infuriate the Commonwealth, alienate much of black Africa, and legalise Bishop Muzorewa's Government".</quote>
It is against that background of uncertainty that we have had to consider the Bill now before us. We on these Benches have been anxious to co-operate but I am bound to state that we have four reservations about the Bill which seem to us to be very important indeed. First, we question the need for an enabling Bill before a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0565"/>
<col>1113</col>
settlement is reached. It has been explained&#x2014;and explained again this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington&#x2014;that it is essential to have this Bill before an agreement is actually arrived at in order to prevent delay, in order that we shall not lose the momentum. Certainly I agree that it is important not to lose the momentum but I should have thought that legislation could be passed extremely quickly and with less argument and discussion than is now taking place if it followed on an agreement to which all parties contributed. Having the enabling Bill before there is an agreement means that we have to debate this whole question of relations with Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, covering, as it inevitably must, some very controversial matters and we must debate these at a delicate and critical time (as we have been told) in the considerations of the conference.<lb/>
It has been argued by some that the reason why it has been felt necessary to have an enabling Bill before a settlement, is to avoid any difficulty within the party opposite about renewing the sanctions order this week, and no doubt there is some truth in that. Another suggestion has been that it is being done in order to put pressure on the Patriotic Front, in order to let them see that the process of legalisation will proceed whether they agree or not, and no doubt there is some truth in that. I do not believe there is any truth in the suggestion which has been made that the Government are putting on the pressure now to get agreement&#x2014;or no agreement, whatever the outcome is to be&#x2014;in these last few days because from the beginning they really wanted a one-sided agreement with the Muzorewa Government. I do not believe that is true. I believe that, as the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary has said this afternoon, the Government have been perfectly sincere in trying to get agreement between all three parties. But if a one-sided agreement does not come by design it may well come by default.<lb/>
That bring me to the second reservation which we on these Benches have, which is the refusal to say that the Bill will not be operated unless there is a three-party agreement. At this point the Government bring in the argument about the veto. They say it was agreed at Lusaka that no party should be given a veto on the result of the conference and that if they
<col>1114</col>
were to say that the Bill would not be operated unless there was a three-party agreement that would be to give a veto to one or other of the parties involved. But against that argument we have to consider the dangers of a one-sided settlement. The war would clearly continue, we would be involved directly during the pre-independence period and no doubt morally&#x2014;and flowing from that, physically&#x2014;after independence was established, and we have to consider the effect of all this on African and world opinion.<lb/>
In those circumstances it might well be right to proceed with a one-sided agreement in spite of the dangers, but such a course would be fraught with such difficulties and dangers that before embarking upon it the Government should surely come back to Parliament for approval. Of course I shall be reminded that this is not an independence Bill and that in any event the Government would have to present an independence Bill. But there is power under this legislation to proceed to the brink of independence with the installation of a governor and the holding of elections.<lb/>
Our third reservation deals with the partial lifting of sanctions to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, referred in the course of his speech. It seems to us that this will be seen by people in some quarters as recognition of the Muzorewa Government. We feel that sanctions should be maintained, as indeed the noble and learned Lord said, until the governor arrives in Salisbury. Therefore, I am very sympathetic to the terms of the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord. I do not see these sanctions as being fresh penalties, as the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary said. They seem to me to be penalties which have been enforced over the years and which should be withdrawn, logically and morally, at the point of time when independence is established.<lb/>
The fourth and last of the reservations we want to make is a reservation which relates perhaps more to the arrangements for the pre-independence period than to the Bill itself; that is, over the question of the time which is to elapse before the elections are to be held. I cannot feel that two months is enough. I under-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0566"/>
<col>1115</col>
stand why the Government want to limit the time and I appreciate the difficulties of maintaining a cease-fire, but I wonder whether, for example, it would be so much more difficult to maintain it for a period of four months than one of two months.<lb/>
To sum up what I have been saying, I welcome the progress which has been made; I congratulate the Government on the agreement reached on the constitution and on other matters. We on these Benches profoundly hope that a settlement involving all three parties will be achieved. But we have these four important reservations about the presentation of the Bill at this time: reservations about the need for an enabling Bill before an agreement, about the refusal to say that the Bill will not be operated unless there is a three-party agreement, about the partial lifting of sanctions, and about the length of time which is to elapse before the election is held. We feel the House would do well to ponder these reservations which we have put forward, even while we welcome such progress as has been made and hope that the eventual outcome will be a settlement to which all the parties agree.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02246"><member>Lord WALSTON</member><membercontribution>: But, my Lords, whether or not the speeches which follow will be of that sort, there is no point in closing our eyes to the fact that throughout the country as a whole feelings are running very high about Rhodesia and there is inevitably a natural inclination to look for the angels and the devils, the good and the bad, and to pinpoint on one person all that is good or all that is bad. That is a fatal error to fall into. I am not suggesting for a moment that the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, is doing
<col>1116</col>
so or has done so, but one must not forget the influence of general public opinion on those who are carrying out delicate political negotiations of this sort.<lb/>
Just looking briefly at the protagonists in this conference, we have first, I suppose, although he is not here for the moment, Mr. Smith. I make no secret of the fact that I deplore and have always deplored his actions. After all, it is he who is responsible for the situation in which we are today and that must lie very heavily on his conscience. But for all that, I believe that Mr. Smith is, according to his lights, an honourable man, and acted, according to his lights, from the best motives for his country, however mistaken he may have been. The bishop, Bishop Muzorewa, and Mr. Sithole, about whom we now hear so little, they, too, are honourable men who are doing what they believe to be in the best interests of their country. It must have been very hard indeed for them to make that effort of joining in a coalition government with those who had been oppressing them individually and their people as a whole. They did it and their motives, I know, were good ones. And the same applies to Mr. Nkomo and to Mr. Mugabe. Unfortunately, too many people, the Press helping them, have castigated these two men as villains, as murderers, as assassins, and specifically now Robert Mugabe is cast in that role.<lb/>
We must not forget that in Rhodesia it is a civil war. All wars are bloody; civil wars are more bloody than any others. And, of course, there are horrors and beastliness on the side of the Patriotic Front, and there are similar horrors and similar beastliness&#x2014;and no one can say whether greater or lesser&#x2014;on the other side too. Some of your Lordships may have read in the <i>Observer</i> that terrifying, heartrending diary of a young Englishman, formerly in the Royal Marines, his experience in fighting against the Patriotic Front and his slipping from decency into this horrendous beastliness. I recommend any of your Lordships who have not read it to do so because it will show you, I hope, and will help you to understand, the feelings which are engendered on both sides in a war of this kind.<lb/>
Let us not forget the attitudes that many people took at the time of the Mau-Mau disturbances, the horrible things that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0567"/>
<col>1117</col>
happened in Kenya, the horrible actions that took place, and the remarks that were made then about the leaders of Mau-Mau. May I remind your Lordships that in 1960 Sir Patrick Rennison, governor of Kenya at the time, three years before independence, spoke of Kenyatta and called him "the leader under darkness and death". And yet there is no need to remind your Lordships of the eulogies rightly coming from the lips of our leaders and in the Press of this country when that "leader in darkness and death" eventually himself died, the saviour of his country, the great statesman of Africa, well deserved. So when we talk of the present leaders in Rhodesia, in Zimbabwe, of the Partiotic Front, let us remember some of those other things too. That, I think, will help us in arriving at a just and a decent form of settlement.<lb/>
As it appears, from the Press in particular, and to a certain extent from what the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, has said, that the leader of (shall I call it?) the difficult faction in these talks is Robert Mugabe, may I just spend a short time trying to put across what I believe to be some of his problems, some of his reservations. It is surely hardly surprising that he does not have complete confidence in the goodwill of the British Government&#x2014;not only this Government but previous Governments too; both sides must share the blame for that&#x2014;and in their good intentions. After all, he himself was in prison and suffered for many years in Rhodesia and we did not go to his help or the help of his people. We said&#x2014;some of us felt it was mistaken; most of us did not feel that it was mistaken&#x2014;that we were powerless to intervene. We did not intervene and that is the fact of the matter.<lb/>
Then the Patriotic Front started their action, very slowly in a small way, and it is only because of their successes and the build-up of their forces, however much we may regret it, that these talks are taking place now. So the feelings of those who started the struggle and now lead it must be, surely, that very grave thought must be given and very grave support eventually must be given to their ideas and to their wishes in this, as being the people primarily responsible for bringing these talks about in the first place.<lb/>
<col>1118</col>
Quite frankly, I believe that Robert Mugabe's mistrust of the motives of the noble Lord are completely unfounded. I do not believe that he or his colleagues favour one side or the other, although I know that there are many supporters of his party who undoubtedly would have preferred to have seen Mr. Smith remain in power and who, still more, would prefer today to see Bishop Muzorewa win an election. But, for all that, I say without any hesitation that I believe that the noble Lord has carried out his functions as chairman of the conference in an impeccable manner and with no bias whatsoever. I hope that that will not only continue, but will be seen by all those concerned to continue. However, I must say that the introduction of this Bill is making that task more difficult. I shall not repeat the argument which my noble and learned friend put so eloquently in his speech, but there is no doubt whatsoever that there are many, on both sides of the argument, who look on the Bill as being an encouragement to Bishop Muzorewa and his friends and a discouragement to the Patriotic Front and its supporters.<lb/>
To my mind there seem to be four outstanding points that must be dealt with before there can be a satisfactory outcome to this conference. Some of them have already been met, or at least met in part, but I would hope that they could be met in a somewhat more positive and categorical manner so that there can be no gainsaying what has actually been agreed. There must be complete incorporation on an equal basis of the troops who are operating under the command of Salisbury and the troops who are operating under the command of the Patriotic Front so that, whatever numbers those troops may eventually comprise, the numbers from each side are equal. Moreover, they must be under the command of somebody who not only is, but who manifestly is for all to see, a completely unbiased commander. I shall say no more about what type of person he should be or from where he should come.<lb/>
Following on from that, the second point is the question of the civil service and police. We all know in this country how very important such people are in organising elections, controlling elections and ensuring that there is no intimidation
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0568"/>
<col>1119</col>
&#x2014;something which we in this country now take completely for granted. However, we must remember that the people who will operate at the grass roots&#x2014;the police and civil servants at the lowest levels&#x2014;who really will have contact with the voters, are all men who, for the past 14 years, have been loyal servants of an illegal r&#x00E9;gime. It is straining goodwill to the utmost to expect that the Patriotic Front can now accept that those same people will change their loyalties, will change their inbuilt desires and prejudices, and will become completely objective and unbiased guardians of fair play and of the peace. I do not know how that can be overcome and it is not for me to offer suggestions as regards that matter. But I do believe that it is a real problem which must be dealt with satisfactorily if one is to have wholehearted acceptance by the Patriotic Front of any form of cease-fire election. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, has said, all parties must submit to a political test. But that test must be seen by all&#x2014;parties and individuals&#x2014;to be a fair one.<lb/>
Thirdly&#x2014;and in this connection I shall say no more than that I support the arguments of my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones and the noble Lord, Lord Banks&#x2014;sanctions in all their forms must be maintained until agreement is reached and the British governor is actually in Salisbury. However unimportant the sanctions may be in fact, symbolically, as my noble and learned friend said, they are of enormous importance. As a sign, if only of goodwill and lack of bias on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, I very much hope that he will, even at this late stage, have second thoughts on the removal of sanctions.<lb/>
Fourthly, there is the question which the noble Lord, Lord Banks, so rightly mentioned&#x2014;namely, the period of two months for an election. My Lords, that must be too short. It cannot be seriously considered that, in a country where law and order has broken down and which has been subjected for years to bloody slaughter and detentions of all kinds with protected villages and so on, within two months parties can organise themselves, select their candidates and conduct an election campaign. It just is not possible. The situation has been going on for 14 years. We are asking only for two
<col>1120</col>
months more and that surely is not too great a request to make.<lb/>
Last Sunday we celebrated Remembrance Day in this country and had brought back to us the horrors of two world wars. They are a long way in the past and there are many people in this country who know of them only by hearsay. However, as regards the Rhodesian situation there is a risk that, just as the events in Sarajevo started the First World War, and the invasion of Poland started the Second World War, a failure to reach a settlement in Rhodesia could eventually be seen by historians as the spark which set off a third world war. Some may think that that is alarmist talk, but if these talks break down&#x2014;and, I repeat, "if" they break down&#x2014;three things inevitably will happen. First, the fighting will continue and it will escalate. Secondly, the Patriotic Front will be driven, however unwillingly, to seek allies elsewhere. We know that the Soviet Union is already offering its services&#x2014;how long can they be refused?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02250"><member>Lord WALSTON</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend calls it "nonsense". He should go and look for himself and see the situation. The third thing that will happen is that the Commonwealth may well break up. The Commonwealth has shown its strength during these last months as an enormous factor in bringing together the disputants in this cause. I think it is right to say that without the Commonwealth this conference would never have taken place. If it breaks down now I hate to think what the future of the Commonwealth will be.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Carrington, has, if I may say so, dealt with all these difficult problems with admirable skill, tact, patience and restraint. He has got closer to a solution than has any of his predecessors from either party. A false move now, impatience, lack of understanding or talk of ultimatum could wreck all this
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0569"/>
<col>1121</col>
good work. However, patience and understanding could crown the work with success. I hope that he may have those qualities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02251">4.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02252"><member>Lord COLYTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by asking for the indulgence of your Lordships&#x2014;especially for the indulgence of my noble friend the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;if I have to absent myself later in the debate. My wife has just come out of hospital and I have to rejoin her.<lb/>
I do not intend to detain your Lordships for more than a few minutes, and then only on one specific point. This is not the time to delve into the past. Those of us&#x2014;and there are several still here today&#x2014;who nearly 30 years ago believed profoundly in the conception of a Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland as the foundation for a genuine multiracial society such as we are now trying to build in this country, must not waste our time on what might have been. We must welcome the advances which have been made at long last at Lancaster House as a new and, we hope, successful step, not only towards a lasting peace but towards our old ideal.<lb/>
I am full of admiration for the achievements of my noble friend the Foreign Secretary, whose pertinacity and courage have led us so far along this precarious path. Naturally, we cannot all approve of everything that has been conceded in the process. By nature, I am a gradualist in these matters and I should have infinitely preferred to see the blocking power of the white minority in the Assembly maintained during these first difficult years. These are the years during which the whole economic future of the country of Zimbabwe will depend almost entirely on the skills, the goodwill and the confidence of the white community.<lb/>
After all, the proposals of Sir Harold Wilson, and of my noble friend Sir Alec Douglas-Home, as he was then, were all based on the fine balance of a blocking European vote for a limited period. However, I well understand that so far as militant African opinion and indeed the support of the neighbouring Commonwealth States are concerned, the abandonment of this concept made the acceptance of the proposals in the constitution very much easier. Therefore, I
<col>1122</col>
accept the broad strategy adopted by my noble friend towards the innumerable difficulties presented by this problem. Although much will turn on good planning and good faith, in the last resort everything will depend on the goodwill of every member of the community, whether he be black or white.<lb/>
I hope that we shall arrive at satisfactory arrangements for the maintenance of law and order during the interim period. We shall, I am sure, work out efficient plans for holding the elections. We may even&#x2014;but with far more difficulty&#x2014;evolve some sort of scheme for mixing the oil and water of the violently conflicting elements who are still at one another's throats. The formalities of the elections could, in fact, with good management, be fairly and efficiently carried out.<lb/>
But lying behind all this is intimidation. In the darkness and loneliness of the villages of the Tribal Trust territories I fear that the perennial threat of intimidation&#x2014;from whatever quarter it may come&#x2014;will be rife. The ugly pressure of three or four strangers who arrive by stealth at dead of night, who talk quietly to a few known sympathisers, who whisper fearful threats into the ears of others and who perhaps even sometimes toss a petrol bomb into the headman's hut is what I fear most. These are the people&#x2014;and I repeat, they may come from any quarter&#x2014;who, on the eve of elections, could totally destroy the possibility of fair and impartial voting at the polling booths in the following days. I know from experience the terrifying effects of such tactics in Rhodesia. I have talked to some of the victims myself.<lb/>
It is not only in the villages that this can happen. In the African suburbs of Salisbury and Bulawayo, such as Highfield, Harari and Pomona, the same thing can occur in less secret ways, as indeed has often happened in the past. It can occur also in the compound of a European farm. I understand that the electoral commissioner is to have a full and competent staff capable of carrying out the electoral process with exemplary efficiency. But I beg my noble friend to ensure that the most stringent measures possible are taken. It will be far from easy to anticipate and to thwart the terrifying threats of intimidation which may be exerted upon every African voter. This must be
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0570"/>
<col>1123</col>
one of the primary tasks of the electoral commissioner and his men; indeed, in my judgment it must be in the forefront of the thinking of the British governor himself. It will be a most difficult task, but I pray that with foresight the difficulties may be overcome and that the elections may be carried out in such a way as to return a Parliament which will represent the real views of all the people and lead to a united advance towards majority rule and democracy, with the co-operation of all races and parties in this new nation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02254"><member>Lord STEWART of FULHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join most readily in the congratulations that have been offered by those who spoke earlier to the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary. As we have studied the progress at Lancaster House, I think that we have all admired the skill and patience that he has shown. We should also pay tribute to what all parties at that conference have done, including what the front-line Presidents have done, in the way of being ready to make concessions and to allow the conference to proceed. So far, so good.<lb/>
However, to us on these Benches the introduction of this Bill at this time seems to be out of character with the noble Lord's previous handling of the problem. I can understand the argument that the moment one has a settlement, one wants to be able to proceed to implement it without delay. But let us look at the two possibilities. If agreement among all the three parties at Lancaster House is reached, no one&#x2014;either in this House or in another place&#x2014;would have a word to say or make any reservations or difficulties about a Bill of this kind. It could be passed while the delegates at Lancaster House were still packing their bags and getting in and out of aeroplanes. There would be no difficulty there at all.<lb/>
On the other hand, what will be the position if agreement is not reached? What becomes of this Bill then? It is painfully clear that if agreement is not reached at Lancaster House, there will be no cease-fire. I understand&#x2014;and like my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, I hope the Government will make this a little clearer&#x2014;that the Government's position is that until a cease-fire is agreed,
<col>1124</col>
a governor will not be sent out. Therefore, much of the Bill will not come into operation at all. The other possibility, that we send out a governor charged with the nominal task of keeping order when there is no cease-fire, is even more alarming&#x2014;no agreement, no cease-fire and presumably, therefore, no governor to be sent out, and the government parts of this Bill not to operate. Surely then it is entirely reasonable&#x2014;and we shall hope to argue this further on the first of the amendments when we reach Committee stage&#x2014;to be quite clear that this Bill will begin to operate when agreement is reached at Lancaster House. One might add also that if no governor is sent out and there is no cease-fire, then there is no return to legality, and therefore there ought to be no lifting of sanctions.<lb/>
I am afraid that one of the reasons for the speed with which this Bill has been put through is that the Government wanted to avoid the embarrassment of having to renew sanctions. We have all had experience of embarrassment inside our own parties, and I can see that a Motion to renew sanctions would create embarrassment in the party opposite. But surely it is wildly out of proportion to give weight to that minor matter when we consider the issues involved, as, I am afraid, it is inescapable that allowing sanctions to lapse in the way they are going to be allowed to lapse is not going to help win the confidence of the Patriotic Front or make the achieving of agreement at Lancaster House any easier. So far as it has any effect, it is bound to make it more difficult.<lb/>
I would say in passing about sanctions that many different opinions have been advanced as to how effective they have been, and at one time I was closely in touch with the working of them. But although, as compared with what I hoped, they limped, I never believed them to be ineffectual. One thing that convinced me of their importance was the passionate desire of Ian Smith's friends in this country to get them lifted, and the fact that Ian Smith himself, at the outset of the present chapter in the history of Rhodesia, made it clear that there were two factors, the guerrilla campaign and sanctions, which had obliged him to go for what was called the "interim agreement".<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0571"/>
<col>1125</col>
I suggest, therefore, that the Government are really getting things the wrong way round. They ought to continue their efforts to get real agreement, three-party agreement, at Lancaster House. Then they would whisk a Bill of this kind through Parliament without objection from anyone, and the sanctions could be raised without creating any difficulties either in Africa or at the United Nations. That is the way it ought to have been done. Although I have listened most carefully to what has been said from the Front Bench, I have not yet heard any convincing argument as to why it is not done that way round, except the argument that it saves the Conservative Party the embarrassment of having to renew sanctions, and I do not give that as much weight as perhaps it is given on the other side of the House.<lb/>
The other point I want to make is this: I think the Foreign Secretary was right to argue that it would be weak-minded and silly to go on and on having a conference just for the sake of having a conference if it were quite clear that one of the parties was not going to agree. He said several times in a different form of words that you could not go on forever; the British Government had responsibility, and so on, to reach decisions. If the situation really were that one of the parties was being wholly intransigent I could understand that, but so far we have not been provided with any evidence that that is so. All three parties have had their moments of concession and their moments of stubbornness as the conference has gone on. That happens in all conferences. But what is it that now seems to be in the way? What is it that now worries the Patriotic Front?<lb/>
I would say first of all that we must be willing to pay attention to any anxieties they have because, as they see it, Bishop Muzorewa's Government is "the man in possession". If elections are held it is they who have to start from the beginning building up an electoral organisation, and they have to do it in an atmosphere knowing that all the State apparatus, and all the instruments of power, have been in the hands of the party they will be fighting at the election. Allowing for that, we ought surely to say that these people have reason on their side when they express misgivings, and their remarks must be listened to with patience and attention.<lb/>
<col>1126</col>
It seems to me that there are two things they are chiefly concerned about. The first is time. I am bound to say that I have not found a single person with whom I have discussed this who thought that two months was a reasonable period for the holding of the elections and the campaign. I cannot think that the Foreign Secretary himself really thinks so. If he put it forward as a barganing counter at the beginning of the negotiations, in view of his previous skill I would not criticise him for that; but if he were to stick out to the point of wrecking the conference on whether it should to two, four, or six months, then that could not be defended for a moment.<lb/>
The other matter they are concerned about is force; the actual organisation of the instruments of power, police and armed forces, while the election is going on. I need not develop that because it was done so eloquently by my noble friend Lord Walston a little while ago. I believe that the Patriotic Front have themselves made proposals&#x2014;I think it is not public knowledge exactly what they are&#x2014;as to how that situation could be dealt with. There could be a kind of joint force. If the Foreign Secretary finds those proposals unacceptable, it is up to him to devise some alternative which will go a long way to allay the quite genuine anxieties that the Patriotic Front arc bound to have about conducting an election in a situation where the instruments of power are in the hands of their opponents.<lb/>
I believe, judging on the record, that the Foreign Secretary has the skill and the imagination to be able to do that; to allay those anxieties, and to surmount the difficulties. What we all beg him from this side of the House is to understand that we are not asking him to go on and on procrastinating forever, but to continue in the same spirit, and much at the same rate as he has already done with such considerable success. If he will continue to handle the matter that way without the unwise impetuousness that has crept in at the last minute, then I believe that this dreadful story of blood and suffering can be brought to an end, over which we can rejoice.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1127</col>
I have the opportunity now, which I failed to secure last week through absence from the House, to congratulate him on his maiden speech, which I enjoyed reading. He has now reinforced that impression by the fluent way in which he has presented his thoughts to this House. He has naturally indulged in a keen analysis of the position. It is not difficult to seize points which can well emphasise the conditional status on which much of the progress has been reached.<lb/>
I think I have spoken every year against the sanctions order. I suppose now it is about 12 times. I feel it only natural that I should take the opportunity of expressing the pleasure one feels that is has now been dropped. When this Bill becomes law it will prescribe that with the assumption of power by the governor the remaining coverage of sanctions will be removed. Surely that is essential for the credibility of Bishop Muzorewa, which we must all wish to support on his return to Rhodesia. The position has changed from longstanding perplexity and anxiety to acceptance of the proposed settlement as the best one that can be obtained. It has received the acceptance of Bishop Muzorewa and Ian Smith. It has certainly been devised with skill and persistance, and I am among those who, having had misgivings, am now satisfied that the moment has arrived when this Bill should have full support.<lb/>
Implementation now falls squarely on the governor's plate with expectations that completion will produce an effective constitutional multiracial government which will result in an end to the fighting. As for the former misgivings and disappointments that have been generated over the years among many of us on this side of the House in the frequent talks that have taken place, we regard all those as water over the dam, and we can now apply ourselves with enthusiasm to supporting this Bill. We therefore congratulate the Foreign Secretary on his patience, sagacity and persistence; in short, he has achieved what many of us have consistently thought unlikely, and I salute him with jubilation.<lb/>
But the cease-fire must be effective, and that means the withdrawal of directions from the Russians to the terrorists that they must continue fighting. Alas, the Russian direction and financing of SWAPO in South West Africa in the present setting raises doubts about Russia.
<col>1128</col>
Their aim in South-West Africa is surely to delay and produce continuous chaos.<lb/>
I raise three points. First, completion of the elections should take place within two months. We all recollect the misfortunes in a previous case of procrastination. Secondly, surely it is possible for some form to be reached&#x2014;I realise the difficulty of indicating it&#x2014;whereby Her Majesty's Government would assume some part in assurances on pensions, because that is vital to the re-engagement of both civil servants and military personnel without whose services there would be great peril for any Administration in Rhodesia. However, I hope the amendment to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Grindley, will help to deal with that. Thirdly, what are the lines along which it is hoped will come the inflow of investment without which the reconstruction of the economy will not be possible?<lb/>
Regarding Zambia, I have for a long time decried the deferential manner in which successive British Governments have seen fit to seek counsel from that badly administered country which is approaching bankruptcy and which has an unstable dictatorship. By frequently presenting the begging bowl, they have, since independence, received, from the British taxpayer &#x00A3;167 million, but meanwhile have maintained on their territory a number of savage alien terrorists to invade what this Bill clearly sets out is British territory.<lb/>
I conclude by anticipating the passage of this Bill&#x2014;we must be confident that the arrangements that have been made will come to fruition&#x2014;and, as I said, I congratulate the Foreign Secretary, our former Leader on this side of the House. I have sat with him in this House and admired his career for approaching 40 years. I wish to tell him that we are indeed enthusiastic about the fact that, after exercising all his patience and skill, he has produced a settlement in this situation which has for so long defeated all other attempts at a solution&#x2014;an interval during which there has been a sad loss of life and destruction of the economy. A settlement will come (I am going to be optimistic and accept the assurances) with recognition, the dropping of sanctions, the end of fighting and, hopefully, a commencement of the rebuilding of the economy of Zimbabwe-

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02258"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure why I am frequently listed to speak following the noble Lord, Lord Barnby. Perhaps it is because it is known that I feel a very deep affection for him, as I am sure the whole House does. However, in my case I agreed with not a single word he uttered on this subject.<lb/>
We have a common responsibility for the situation we are debating today. There are those of us who, when I first visited Rhodesia 30 years ago, were unable to foster multiracial and indeed non-racial organisations like the Southern Rhodesia Labour Party of that time, and we allowed it to disappear. There were those who, I believe mistakenly, put together those disparate units as the Central African Federation and, equally, those of us who failed to oppose that disastrous experiment. There were those of us who were unable at the time of the break-up of the federation to see far enough ahead to recognise the difficulties, the problems, the dangers, and the disasters which have since followed in Rhodesia. And I would say that, above all, there have been those on both sides of the House who over the last 14 years have encouraged the misguided men and women in Rhodesia who rebelled against the Crown and British authority in 1965&#x2014;and who have encouraged them to go along an utterly disastrous path. I would just remind those Members who have given comfort and support to the rebel r&#x00E9;gime of that period that around them in Kenya only this week, in Zambia, and in Tanzania there have been clear examples of how a non-racial society can work; of how a European and an Asian can be elected in free elections by Africans; of how in Kenya, in Zambia, and in Tanzania Governments have included men and women of European descent&#x2014;once race was taken out of politics.<lb/>
We have heard this afternoon that the conference (which we are now discussing) to try to close this disastrous chapter in the history of Southern Rhodesia has gone on for a long time. Nine weeks is not a long time in debating and discussing the intricate problems of the last 90 years. It is not a long time in terms
<col>1130</col>
of any international conference. It is certainly not a long time in comparison with the 10 years that have been taken out of the lives of a number of men who are now sitting round that conference table, who spent that time in detention.<lb/>
Since the beginning of the conference I have been trying to imagine myself in the position of the Foreign Secretary, from Lusaka onwards, and I have been trying to imagine what would be my responsibility as Foreign Secretary of this country; and I think that I have come to two conclusions. It would be the responsibility of the Foreign Secretary, first, to devise a constitution which is comparable to those given to previous British colonies, as has been stated as one of the objectives of the Lusaka Conference; and, secondly, to devise a system of free and fair elections within that constitution to allow a fully representative Government of that country to be elected. If the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary wants experience of the comparability of such constitutions I suggest that he consults his noble friend, the noble Viscount, Lord Boyd of Merton, because Lord Boyd and I have spent many hours in Lancaster House at previous constitutional conferences. I quite realise that this is different, and that therefore the word must be comparable", not "identical".<lb/>
But there is one aspect of those previous conferences which I believe should be emphasised and which appears to me to have escaped the attention of the Foreign Secretary in his conduct of this conference. It is that on every previous occasion the constitution which we have devised for a colony approaching independence has been based upon the wishes of the people of that colony&#x2014;not on our wishes; not on the imposition of what we consider to be the instruments of that constitution, but on an attempt to draw out from the representatives of the colonial peoples themselves what they wish should be the form of their constitution. It has seemed to me that too often the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary has been telling the conference what it should do, telling the delegates what instruments should be involved and what form the constitution should take, instead of drawing out from the representative members of that conference what the Zimbabweans want,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0574"/>
<col>1131</col>
what is the highest common denominator of Zimbabwean opinion, irrespective of his own, or the Foreign Office's preconceptions.<lb/>
During the conference all sides have made certain compromises, although I believe that those of the British Government have been minimal. But I would pay my compliments to Bishop Muzorewa for making certain concessions during the course of the conference. I do not think that he has been helped when one member of his delegation, by name of Ian Smith, described his own leader, the bishop, as being "wet putty" in the hands of the British Government. Nevertheless, the bishop has made the concession of agreeing that he and his Ministers will resign during the interim or transitional period.<lb/>
I should like the noble Lord who is to wind up the debate to enlighten the House as to the exact meaning of the word "resign" in this context because I think that this will be a very important matter during the election period. When the bishop and his fellow Ministers resign will they leave their ministerial houses, will they discard their ministerial cars? I ask this because, as we know, this is obviously an important matter in a country when elections are held. If they are seen to be going about in their cars and inhabiting their ministerial houses, it will be thought by the electorate that they really remain there, that they are really the Government, and that the electorate is going to be asked merely whether or not to confirm them. And remember, my Lords, these are members of a r&#x00E9;gime which is still illegal, still in rebellion against the Crown. The Foreign Secretary said that the Ministers will not play any role during the election. I would ask the noble Lord to enlighten us upon this point because I believe that we, and indeed the conference itself, are entitled to know.<lb/>
It has been very widely disseminated among the media of this country and among political observers that it is the present r&#x00E9;gime that has been making all the concessions. It is not. The major concessions&#x2014;one has only to consult the documentation of the conference to see this&#x2014;on the original conference positions have been made by the Patriotic Front.
<col>1132</col>
On the constitution&#x2014;just to give three examples&#x2014;the Patriotic Front wanted an executive president. The Patriotic Front was opposed to racial representation. The Patriotic Front was against the entrenchment of the Bill of Rights so far as it applied to land holding. On all these matters they have given way&#x2014;and indeed on many others, too.<lb/>
Now we come to the issue of the present day, and I suggest that the proposals which are now being made by the Patriotic Front, and which apparently are being resisted by the British delegation, are proposals which the British delegation could very easily accept without in any way diminishing either their authority or their responsibility to ensure that the elections are held in a fair and just way. There is, first, the period of transition. The Government say that they cannot extend this period beyond two months. But what is the situation today? The Patriotic Front is banned in Rhodesia. Is that ban going to be removed? All we had in the British delegation's document of reply to the Patriotic Front was that there would be
<quote>"a review by the governor of the state of emergency".</quote>
Not a removal of the emergency laws under which the Patriotic Front is banned, not a removal of the laws under which Patriotic Front leaders in Rhodesia are in prison or in detention, but a review. That is the most that the British delegation is offering to the Patriotic Front.<lb/>
The Patriotic Front has to find the means of restoring its many thousands of refugees from half a dozen countries around the borders of Rhodesia. Above all, it has to create a political machine. Whereas so far its function has been to create and organise an army, it now has to create, virtually from scratch, a political machine. Registration has to take place&#x2014;and, please, my Lords, do not be deceived into the belief that you cannot register voters in Rhodesia. It was done in Zambia in six weeks. It can be done in Rhodesia, too. Registration is essential if there is to be the maximum protection against deception during the election itself. I remind noble Lords&#x2014;and, indeed, I am sure the noble Lord who preceded me will support me in this&#x2014;that the two months that the British Government are suggesting as the run-up time to the election is the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0575"/>
<col>1133</col>
rainy season in Rhodesia; and the rainy season in Rhodesia is not like a rainy day in London or in Newcastle. It is of monsoon proportions with unbridgeable rivers. Are you asking the respective parties in Rhodesia to organise an electoral campaign during those very two months when the country is most difficult to traverse?<lb/>
Secondly, on security, I should again like to ask the noble Lord who is to wind up to answer this question specifically: When it is said that there is going to be a cease-fire, on what respective bases are the two armies to be founded? Are the present r&#x00E9;gime's security forces to be considered the legitimate army of Rhodesia and the Patriotic Front's armies to be considered the rebels, or is there to be absolute equality on both sides? This extends beyond the armed forces to the police, because remember that the policeman in Rhodesia is not like the London "Bobby" The police force of Rhodesia, the British South African Police, is part of the combined operations force, which is a Government dominated, led and organised force for opposing the Patriotic Front. They are given military training. What is their attitude going to be to those members of the Patriotic Front that they have on their files as wanted men? Although we may forget, Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe will not forget the face of Patrice Lumumba, who, in a legal State, was murdered by the police and armed forces of his opponents in his own State.<lb/>
So I suggest, my Lords, on security, that if you are still wedded to the principle of free and fair elections you must answer these questions&#x2014;and I believe that the only answer to them is to return to the concept of the Anglo-American plan, in which there is an international security force. Whether the members of that force come from the United Nations or the Commonwealth I am not going to argue, but there should be an international security force which can be seen to be absolutely impartial, and an international police force. Because we must remember that the Patriotic Front also has a police force, and if you give the power to the present police force, to the police force governed by the present r&#x00E9;gime, you are discriminating in favour of one of the parties to the election.<lb/>
<col>1134</col>
Further, I believe that these international forces should start integrating the respective forces during the transitional period, because unless that integration is seen to be taking place during that period then people will not believe in reconciliation. If they do see integration taking place, then they will believe in reconciliation; and Lord Carver already had the outlines of a plan, so please do not say that it is impossible. More than that, have you thought beyond the election? If you freeze the two armies and the two police forces, what is going to happen after the election? Surely, beginning that integration with an international force there&#x2014;an international force of security men and an international police force&#x2014;is essential if you are going to prevent disaster once the election is over.<lb/>
Finally, I really do not understand&#x2014;and again I ask the noble Lord to pass on the request that the Foreign Secretary should consult his noble friend Lord Boyd&#x2014;why it is that the British delegation has consistently resisted the proposal that the governor should be aided by an advisory council drawn from both sides. This has always been done previously. I know the circumstances are different here, and I know that in other colonies executive councils gradually increased their authority and more and more drew in the indigenous people; but the principle is still the same. The principle that, before independence, an advisory council gains experience and is seen to be holding a fair balance between the contending parties surely makes it one of the most constructive suggestions which can be made at this conference and which can be applied during the interim period.<lb/>
This would also help to obviate one of the most dangerous underlying causes of discontent that my noble friend Lord Walston has already mentioned: the fact that, so far as one can gather, the British plan is that the present power structure shall remain there and conduct the elections; that the present public officials and the electoral officers, however many of them there may be, shall remain there and be in charge of the election and conduct the administration during the transitional period. With an advisory council drawn from both sides you have a joint control which prevents the accusation of partiality. My Lords, are these not reasonable suggestions? Are these not
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0576"/>
<col>1135</col>
suggestions to which Bishop Muzorewa would agree? If not, can we be told: Have they been put to the bishop? Can we be told wether the bishop objects to them, and, if so, why? They seem to me to be reasonable, constructive, constitutional proposals which could greatly help the transitional period and which could avoid a breakdown of the conference.<lb/>
So we come to the Bill. Really, my Lords, the very publication of this Bill has undermined trust in the conference. Last week, the publication of this Bill was greeted with alarm and despondency, not only in Rhodesia, not only in Lancaster House, but at the United Nations and throughout the Commonwealth. Obviously, the sanctions issue within that conference broke the pledge of the Government to remove sanctions only when there was a return to legality. That ignored the fact that sanctions are indivisible; you cannot say, "We will take 20 per cent. and 80 per cent." Sanctions are indivisible. Are the Government going to use the powers which they have in this Bill? Will the noble Lord answer that question when he winds up? The Government are taking powers to continue Section 2 of the 1965 Act when that section expires. Are the Government going to use their powers to continue that 20 per cent. of the sanctions that they talk about? If they are not, they will deeply offend international opinion, as has already been seen by the protest that has been made by the United Nations Security Council Sanctions Committee.<lb/>
Frankly, since this Bill was published the chances of the Government getting a genuine agreement&#x2014;that is, an agreement with all the parties to the conference&#x2014;have deteriorated. They have deteriorated because the delegations at Lancaster House have seen that one of the purposes of the Bill is to remove sanctions without having to go through the debate and Divisions which would have been forced in both Houses of Parliament if they had come openly and said: "We are not going to renew the sanctions order". Secondly, because it is believed that one of the purposes of taking these very wide powers which the Government are asking the House to grant is to be able to make a bilateral agreement with Bishop Muzorewa which, as my noble friend has pointed out, can lead only to an extension of the war,
<col>1136</col>
to an internationalising of the war, to the bringing in of South African troops to support the bishop on the one hand, with the inevitability of the Patriotic Front looking elsewhere, to the Communist forces, as in Angola, in order to prevent the South Africans from sustaining a r&#x00E9;gime in Salisbury which has not the confidence of the people.<lb/>
So the fact that this Bill was published last week has really made the task of Her Majesty's Government much more difficult. It is widely thought that they have put the domestic peace of the Conservative Party as an interest higher than securing agreement at Lancaster House. If the conference at Lancaster House fails, please do not blame the other participants. If that conference fails, it is a British failure; it is a failure to apply the principles of free and fair elections which were laid down at the Lusaka conference.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02260"><member>Lord HOME of the HIRSEL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, asked why his name was put down to follow the name of my noble friend Lord Barnby. I suppose that of all the noble Lords in this House none are more totally exposed in their form and more totally opposed in their views than these two, and therefore I am inclined to congratulate the "usual channels" on their placement. The noble Lord then went on&#x2014;and I listened to him with some interest&#x2014;to give advice to my noble friend the Foreign Secretary. He suggested that the right thing to do would be to go back to the Anglo-American plan, and be passed a good many strictures on this Bill.<lb/>
I allowed myself one passing and gentle reflection at that point. At the time when Bishop Muzorewa's Government brought in a constitution which installed an African as Prime Minister, brought in African majority rule and safeguards for all races in it, ensuring a multiracial state, the Government which the noble Lord supported at that time did nothing at all. They did nothing to help the bishop to remove the defects in his constitution. They did nothing to call together the disputing parties in a conference to end the war. I could not help thinking that with that record behind him and his Party, the noble Lord was in a somewhat poor position to criticise.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0577"/>
<col>1137</col>
By contrast, my noble friend has called together a conference of all the parties which is taking place in London now, and both the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and the noble Lords, Lord Stewart of Fulham and Lord Walston have acknowledged his skill and perseverance. He has obtained agreement on the form of a new constitution. That really is the foundation for everything, and my noble friend has achieved just that: an independence constitution accepting majority rule and all the conditions which successive Governments have asked for under the Six Principles. That was the first essential, and it is no mean achievement to have achieved that.<lb/>
My noble friend has exercised infinite patience, and rightly. I think it would be the consensus of the whole of this House that this is the last chance for a peaceful settlement. My noble friend said, "There is no other viable basis for negotiation" which he thinks exist at all. Therefore we are in a situation where this is the last chance of any settlement. I believe that to be true. My noble friend has taken a number of risks. I think they are great risks. There is one outstanding danger which I think the House will recognise as such in Africa today. It is the tribal rivalries which are fragmenting society in one African country after another. The intimidation which accompanies that situation in those countries is so effective and the external interference is part of it.<lb/>
Rhodesia has been remarkably free from these troubles. But now, my Lords, I see some ominous signs, the beginning of tribal rivalry, the beginning of intimidation and certainly external interference, because guerrillas outside Rhodesia are being supplied with Russian arms. The worst possible result of these years of search for settlement in Rhodesia would be the total collapse in authority of any Government and Administration in Salisbury. That may easily happen unless there is agreement now and unless my noble friend can achieve it in a comparatively short time. It would mean the end of multiracial co-operation in that country, and in such an event Rhodesia would begin to disintegrate. That would not only be a disaster in that country; it would have the gravest and most horrible consequences throughout the whole of South Africa and Southern Africa.<lb/>
<col>1138</col>
One cannot be fully aware of the balance of considerations round the conference table. I very much hope&#x2014;and so do all your Lordships&#x2014;that there will be an agreement between all the parties, even now at the last moment. But my instinct tells me most strongly that there is almost no more room for delay. I think the effect of further delay could be disastrous. This is essentially the plea of the noble and learned Lord and of the noble Lords, Lord Stewart and Lord Walston,&#x2014;that there should be some further delay: probably four months instead of two. I am bound to say I think that would be beset with very great dangers indeed. The noble and learned Lord recalled the words of Sir Winston Churchill:
<quote>"Better ' jaw-jaw ' than war-war '"</quote>
But, my Lords, we have both in this situation at the present time and that has been the trouble for a good many months now. In other words, supposing the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord were to be passed it would amount to this: a continuance of a veto by the Patriotic Front. That is the trouble; that is the essence of the matter, as I see it, that has been running on and on and on.<lb/>
So, although Bishop Muzorewa has fulfilled all the conditions of the Six Principles and although he has modified his constitution as the Foreign Secretary has asked him to do until there is no question at all that it would be a proper constitution to underpin an independent Rhodesia, no advantage can be taken of it as long as the Patriotic Front maintain their veto. Therefore it seems to me that this situation must be brought to an end. We cannot allow it to continue for very much longer.<lb/>
My noble friend will have to make the judgment. Nobody else can do it; but I do hope he will not allow this conference to run on very much longer. The Patriotic Front were offered by Muzorewa a chance to come in from the start and take part in the formation of the new government for an independent Rhodesia. They have strung this situation on and on and on. It is too dangerous to allow that to continue for very much longer, and I hope therefore that this House will pass the Bill today with a decisive majority, because I believe it will help my noble friend in his negotiations.</membercontribution></p>

I want to concentrate my observations tonight on the aspect of democratic elections. As noble Lords know, there are very different views in Africa and in Europe about how democratically to express your wishes. In Europe we believe in the ballot box. In Central Africa they believe in the <i>ndaba.</i> The <i>ndaba</i> is a method by which those who are participating express their views freely and at length until the chief or the presiding officer sums up what he believes is the conclusion of the conference, and then the argument ends. In passing, it looked to me sometimes, reading the accounts of the Lancaster House conference, as though this was being treated as an <i>ndaba</i> and the participants were expressing their views freely and at length, waiting for the chairman to sum up the conference. This he has done, and this is the Bill: but that is by the way.<lb/>
<col>1140</col>
I What happened in Rhodesia was that in April 1979 Bishop Muzorewa, realising that he had somehow to justify and fulfil the Six Principles, organised a democratic election on European lines. The amazing thing really, in all this history of Rhodesia, was the result. There was a 64 per cent. poll. Here in Britain, where we have the Mother of Parliaments, when we had direct elections for Europe, in many constituencies not half that percentage voted. It was not 32 per cent. In a by-election recently the turnout was as low as 20 per cent.<lb/>
That does show, I think, how the Africans responded to that appeal to demonstrate their views. They now had a multiracial government and they wanted to show that they would fulfil their duty by voting at that election. All the observers, with the notable exception of the noble Lord, Lord Chitnis, said the voting was free and fair: yet every vote given at that election was in fact an act of courage. Every effort was made by terrorists to stop the electors from voting&#x2014;yet the villagers who had suffered from land-mines, from the beatings and maimings, the rapes and the massacres that had decimated their families, who had suffered from the closures of their schools and from the murder of 37 missionaries, turned out to vote and to give their support to the first really multiracial government in Rhodesia.<lb/>
Now this election is discarded as irrelevant. This is my real anxiety at the present time. There is to be a new election two months after the implementation of the cease-fire. I hope that my noble friend the Foreign Secretary will explain to the people of Rhodesia, the electors, the exact reason for this volte-face. Without an explanation, I think the voters will assume that they made a mistake last time and that they should pay heed to the intimidators and abstain from voting. This change, the discarding of the last election, will have invoked among ordinary voters the feeling that Britain has somehow not fulfilled her promise about the Six Principles. Undoubtedly, Bishop Muzorewa has lost a great deal of his credibility through that change, and by agreeing to it. Wonderful courage was shown by the voters at that time. The ordinary people of Rhodesia have given a sustained and prolonged demonstration of courage in the 14 years
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0579"/>
<col>1141</col>
since UDI. But now they expect an escalation of violence, with the increasing incursion of terrorists from neighbouring States.<lb/>
There is a danger in this House and in this country of thinking too much about how the Rhodesian problem and our attitude to it will affect our relations with other African States, or, indeed, of thinking in terms of the different ambitions of the various politicians in Rhodesia. Too little is thought of that large silent majority, the African voters, who have suffered so much during these last years. At the moment, all I hear in Rhodesia is that they are fearful of what they face. They believe that they are in grave danger, as my noble friend said just before me, of an outbreak of tribal violence in Rhodesia which, coming after those years when they suffered from the terrorists, gives them a very unhappy outlook for the future. I hope that when my noble friend the Leader of the House sums up this debate he will give some consolation, encouragement and explanation to those people in Rhodesia who now believe that they face a very unhappy future.</membercontribution></p>

Will it not immediately create suspicion among other nations in Africa as to the intent of the British Government, and are we now going to make it possible&#x2014;this is a question to which I do not know the answer&#x2014;for any country to trade with the Muzorewa r&#x00E9;gime, which forms only one side in the present negotiations? I can see the dilemma of this present Tory Government. Fundamentally, economically and strategically they must want a neo-colonial puppet government in Zimbabwe, allied to South Africa, and they thus want to block every conceivable chance of the Patriotic Front coming to power. All the Patriotic Front's arguments and criticisms must be brushed aside. Yet our Tory Government also must realise that no political settlement or peace can be achieved without the Patriotic Front.<lb/>
At the moment, the Patriotic Front is being offered participation in new elections under the control of its bitterest
<col>1142</col>
enemies&#x2014;General Walls' security forces. They are being asked to trust the armed forces, the police and the political structure which are loyal to Smith and Muzorewa. Surely, their objections to these points are understandable and reasonable. Yet it seems to me that our Government are simply brushing them aside as being of no importance whatever. Are those objections not reasonable? Unless the Patriotic Front agree to those terms as they stand, they will be betraying all those who laid down their lives in the struggle in the past seven years for the liberation of the Rhodesian people.<lb/>
Again, it is proposed that they negotiate for a ceasefire, draw up a register of voters, arrange the return of exiles and refugees and create a political organisation all within two months. Surely, they are reasonable when they stress the impossibility of this. Are not these points, to which we are insisting they agree, a long way from the points laid down by the Commonwealth, the members of which insisted that every party should have equal opportunities during the election period; that a third force must therefore take over to prevent security from being under the control of either party, and that there should be more time for the Patriotic Front to supervise a ceasefire and solve its other problems. Were not those the points put forward by the Commonwealth and why do we object to them? Why are the British Government insisting on such unreasonable terms?<lb/>
We do not get the Foreign Secretary's arguments in answer to the Patriotic Front's objections. Every day the Press tells us what the Patriotic Front is objecting to, but we never read, or are never able to study, the answers of the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, or what are his arguments. So that one begins to suspect that perhaps Her Majesty's Government are really doing all they can to get the Patriotic Front to give up, to walk out and to destroy the conference. But are not Britain's relations with the Patriotic Front very important for us, and for our relations with the whole of the rest of black Africa&#x2014;the whole of rapidly changing Africa?<lb/>
The Press and the media give only a very superficial surface picture of what the Lancaster House conference is all about,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0580"/>
<col>1143</col>
and of the forces below the surface. Could there be a third party looming huge&#x2014;South Africa? One would be very na&#x00EF;ve not to admit it. At Lancaster House, at the base of the conference, there are contradictions between the interests of the African people and of white neo-colonialism, and Zimbabwe is the key focus of this. South Africa is 100 per cent. behind white neo-colonialism, with its huge vested interests in South Africa and in what was Rhodesia. So everything must be done to stop the Patriotic Front. With this aim, South Africa subsidises in a big way the war against the Zimbabwe people and its black neighbouring border states. It is now increasing its war incursions as well as creating more and more economic difficulties for these black states. It hopes that if it turns the screw they will succumb to economic collapse and to war weariness. Muzorewa could not survive without his South African support. I repeat, deep down the tussle in the conference room at Lancaster House is about the combined military and economic offensive against the Patriotic Front and its black African allies&#x2014;on the one hand, white South Africa and the stooge for white interests in Zimbabwe and on the other black Africa emerging into a new, liberated society.<lb/>
Again I stress the hurried raising of sanctions and point out that it must raise suspicion throughout the whole of Africa. It will sharpen the relationship between Britain and the black front line states. Surely this relationship is of great long-term value to us. Is not this Bill, lifting sanctions, a blind, short-term policy? I urge Her Majesty's Government to delay the Bill until an agreed policy has been discussed and found. I do not believe that it will not be found if the discussions go on. I cannot see the argument for hurry and the argument about the waste of time over further discussion. We have to take into account the reasonable demands of the Patriotic Front. Again I ask this Government why they are not being reasonable. If they are not reasonable, the war will continue and it will not be the Patriotic Front but Britain which will appear to be the wrecker.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02268"><member>The Earl of ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Home of the Hirsel,
<col>1144</col>
commented on how the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, and the noble Lord, Lord Barnby, differ. I put it to your Lordships' House that Lord Onslow and the noble Lord, Lord Milford&#x2014;one an old Etonian Communist and the other an old Etonian Whig&#x2014;possibly differ even more. Africa, by its recent past and its pre-imperial history, has shown a savagery of an incompetent and vicious kind. Dingaan's smoking out of witch doctors, Bokassa and Amin's modern and better armed variants are examples. Menelik and Mengitsu are old and new practitioners of barbarism in the same Abyssinia. The Angolan squabbles ended in bloody shambles crossed with Russian imperialism. Mugabe's Marxism; the residual Shona resentment of Lobungula's Matebele overlordship, perhaps temporarily forgotten because of Ian Smith's more successful tribalism; Nkomo's ambition; Zessunu and Manyika rivalry; the total lack of trust between parties make it likely that any settlement agreed at Lancaster House, even if it is signed by all parties, will end in bloodshed. The ability of human beings to take the stupid and violent course when compromise and peace are possible never ceases to amaze me.<lb/>
Ian Smith failed to learn the lesson of generous treatment or compromise until it was forced upon him. Think how the internal settlement would have been agreed and greeted as an act of generous and farsighted statesmanship five years ago. It is now under terrible pressure. I suggest this pessimistic forecast is the probable outcome of the drama of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, but I should like to sketch a vignette which holds out a more hopeful and possibly even very exciting future, and beg all participants just to heed its possibilities.<lb/>
In this conference, for the first time since 1923, Great Britain has had power and above all the determination to use that power and to use it wisely. The Government of Bishop Muzorewa has shown an intelligent and helpful negotiating position. Let it also be said, in spite of some of their public announcements and postures, that the Patriotic Front has moved a long way from its original negotiating position. For this we must give them credit. Perhaps it shows that they mean to keep an agreement if it is reached and signed, otherwise they could have agreed to anything and then broken their word, once in power.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0581"/>
<col>1145</col>
One of the objects of the Bill is to enable sanctions to be lifted the moment there is a return to legality. We should all be very conscious of the importance of the return to legality. Therefore, I want to ponder upon the effect of that lifting of sanctions upon the future of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. One of the beneficial side effects of sanctions has been the creation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia of a strong, well trained, African artisan class and the beginnings of an African middle class. This has been caused by an inability to buy on foreign markets, together with the fact that as the blacks until recently were not conscripted and the whites were, large numbers of blacks had to be trained up to do those jobs faster than possibly people would have wished. I have seen them do it very efficiently and well.<lb/>
Popular myth says that all of the land is used up. This is wrong. Acres of land are available. Part of the trouble of agriculture in the tribal trust lands is the lack of a system of freehold or long leasehold, thus preventing investment in long-term improvement. Therefore, I suggest to your Lordships, and above all to the future Government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, that the compensation payable to European farmers for their land must be reinvested in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia&#x2014;not taken out. I hope that the Government will pay lower compensation if money is taken out, or will tax that compensation if it is expatriated.<lb/>
I have seen black African farms which are every bit as efficient as white farms in Rhodesia&#x2014;not very many, admittedly, but they are definitely there. There is ample water for irrigation. There are white Rhodesian tribesmen who regard Zimbabwe-Rhodesia totally as their country&#x2014;not the United Kingdom or anywhere else. These are factors which make it possible&#x2014;I say possible, not probable&#x2014;that there is an exciting future for a rich and prosperous Zimbabwe.<lb/>
The consequences of this are fascinating. If this projection comes off, then the effect on middle Africa will be dynamic. A capitalistic, multiracial, prosperous Zimbabwe-Rhodesia becomes a magnet and an example to Mozambique, Angola, Malawi and, of course, Zambia. Your Lordships will notice that I have left out South Africa from this list. If this success
<col>1146</col>
is shown, South Africa is isolated&#x2014;as are, above all, the Russians who are shown to be the imperial frauds that those of us who have seen the Berlin Wall know them to be.<lb/>
What this Bill does is to enable my noble friend Lord Carrington to continue his present policy. It is to give him the freedom to act as he deserves and it gives him one little extra help to produce the, unfortunately, less likely of my two possible forecasts. Anything that encourages the second at the expense of the first must be pursued with vigour. I have been to Rhodesia, as have several other members of your Lordships' House. I have found some of the older whites quite intolerably racial, quite intolerably tribalistic and quite intolerably bigoted, but the younger ones seem to have a different view. They are committed to Zimbabwe as their country. They were born there and they are loyal to it rather than loyal to their own tribe.<lb/>
Zimbabwe or Rhodesia, or call it what you will, is going to need these people the same as it is going to need those black artisans, that black middle-class and the good black farmers so that all may benefit. If these can pull together, if the whites can follow Rowan Cronje and not Ian Smith, if Nkomo and Mugabe can continue to show that there is an element of compromise in their make-up and, above all, if there can be not only maximum disarmament as well as cease-fire&#x2014;disarmament on both sides and by everybody because there are far too many guns about the place&#x2014;but also Taiwanese standard of economic growth in a world of economic recession, then the possibility of great success is there. But, my Lords, if&#x2014;if&#x2014;if&#x2014;if &#x2026; No one has even slightly to err, let alone blunder, because if they do then, to paraphrase Chamberlain, Zimbabwe will miss the bus.<lb/>
My Lords, as a final remark I dread to think of the row there would have been if Her Majesty's present loyal Opposition had been in power and the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, had tabled a similar amendment to the Second Reading of a Bill in your Lordships' House. I dread to think what the future noble Lord Skinner of Bolsover would have said. He would have screamed and yelped and he would have hurled abuse and the columns of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> would have
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0582"/>
<col>1147</col>
waxed lyrical on the undemocratic behaviour of your Lordships' House. For that reason, among others, I will certainly vote and give my noble friend the maximum support I can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02269">5.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02270"><member>Lord PAGET of NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was quite recently in Rhodesia with the noble Lord and there is certainly one point of his which I would agree with; it is that not all the tribalists in Rhodesia, or indeed in Africa, are black. We have lived through the dissolution of an empire&#x2014;an empire which I believe was a beneficial influence in world development. I have not found it a happy time. I do not think that we have much reason to be proud of the way in which we shed our responsbilities for those whom we governed. Indeed, of our successions I think there are only two that we can really look at with pride: they are Kenya and Malaya. In both of those we fought a savage war, saw it through and won it, and it was by winning those wars that we made those nations possible. In an odd way right through history war has been the midwife of nations. In every other one of our ex-colonies democracy has disappeared, dictatorship has replaced it, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened, civil rights are largely nonexistent, people who are rash enough to sue the Government are very rare, food supplies, despite the green revolution, are diminishing; starvation is present. It is not a happy sight for us to look at because all these areas are areas in which we abandoned our responsibilities.<lb/>
Indeed, our objections to the Rhodesian constitution on the grounds that it differs from constitutions which we have so freely handed out to the rest of Africa seems to me to be somewhat astonishing, considering that every one of those constitutions was torn up within a very short period. Within this period of decadence, it seems to me that there stood out one man and one people: that was Ian Smith in Rhodesia and I think we should look with clear eyes at the achievement of UDI. I think we should recognise its glory. Let us consider: Within that period of 10 years economically they produced the finest and most consistent growth rate in the world. Their birthrate sprang up
<col>1148</col>
because that, in a country such as that, is perhaps the unfortunate result, but they were able to feed, look after and bring health to those children. Half the population of Rhodesia is now under 13. They are literate and they are healthy. Nowhere else in Africa can compare with that performance.<lb/>
Public services are certainly the best outside South Africa. With regard to finance, inflation was most remarkably held throughout this great period of expansion; and morale, the spirit that makes a nation&#x2014;because a nation is an act of faith&#x2014;the improvement of the morale, the sense of nationhood, the sense of unity which I found on my recent visit as against the times of UDI when I was visiting that country, was as remarkable as the economic achievement.<lb/>
Then came the Portuguese collapse and the communist opportunity. I was glad to hear the communism spokesman in our Parliament, the noble Lord, Lord Milford, tell us that for the communists Rhodesia was their number one priority. That I believe to be true and they had something which was very easy to work on&#x2014;tribal war. Tribal war in Africa is old, and I do not entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Home of the Hirsel, that it has not been a menace in Rhodesia. When we first went to Rhodesia no Shona slept in his hut because the Matabele warriors blooded their spears on the Shona. They set fire to the huts and blooded their spears when they ran out. It was only under our rule that they could sleep in the huts.<lb/>
That was the kind of situation that existed. Rhodesia controlled it until the frontiers were opened and the communists set about creating tribal warfare. It is now loosed. It is not very surprising. People far more evolved than the Africans have regarded war as the only suitable occupation for a man. It was not so very long ago that we did. In Africa that is certainly the feeling: the warrior can look down on the farmer and the labourer and to these primitive people the opportunity to be warriors was wonderful. They did not turn out to be very good warriors, but they were armed, they were taken, they were equipped and then they were sent back with a modern gun and probably a grenade or two and they were tremendous chaps. They could eat and they could take their choice of the women without
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0583"/>
<col>1149</col>
having to work. Oh indeed! The warriors felt themselves to be the big chaps. That is a very easy thing to create and it is what communism has created. But it created a frontier pressure which Ian Smith had to face and I think he faced it with great courage. He needed international assistance to control the external forces of chaos and that was the basis of a new internal settlement which lie sought. There was an internal settlement negotiated strongly and fairly and created by Rhodesia for Rhodesia, and then it was affirmed in an election which many of us went to see. And that was real at least in one sense: it was real in establishing who was in control of Rhodesia. In spite of all the threats of the Patriotic Front, not one of the polling booths spread all over the country was closed even for six hours. And it was also right in establishing that the r&#x00E9;gime was acceptable to the people.<lb/>
I certainly thought at that time that I was witnessing a nation being born. My Lords, one cannot create nations for other people. It is a process that I have been watching all my life, with the dissolution of the Austrian Empire, the dissolution of the Turkish Empire, the whole proceedings of decolonialisation. None of these given nations has worked, been satisfactory. They have not created the faith, the mutual independence which is necessary to make a nation work. They have been a sorry spectacle. But here one found the act of faith, a certain fundamental acceptance of a common interest, a mutual trust. War, true, the struggle had been the midwife, sanctions and invasion. But there it was, and you had a government who were trusting each other, working together, establishing themselves in that very remarkable election.<lb/>
I believe that they should have been forthwith recognised, accepted, worked with and assisted. I think that was the Prime Minister's reaction ; it was what she wanted to do, but she was diverted by the Foreign Office, who came forward and said "What about the United Nations, what about the USA, what about our trade with various people in Africa, what about our oil supplies? All these things cannot be sacrificed to the interests of Rhodesia. Is success for Rhodesia more important to us than all these other considerations?" Realise
<col>1150</col>
this, that the one issue which has not been considered in this long drawn out conference has been the interests of Rhodesia. I am not saying that the Foreign Office have not displayed a brilliant exhibition of diplomatic gamesmanship. Nobody can fail to recognise how skilfully this has been done. The unity of the Rhodesian Government has been successfully undermined. Negotiated conditions to protect minorities have been upset. Men who came here trusting each other are now trusting each other no longer. Faith has been broken. The Rhodesian Government, instead of being self-reliant, is now a malleable instrument.<lb/>
For the internal settlement which was Rhodesian a bogus British settlement has been substituted, and I use that word "bogus" deliberately. Consider first cease-fire. What do we mean by ceasefire&#x2014;cease-fire between whom and when? You are not dealing with belligerent nations or indeed with a civil war in which there arc effective authorities competing. The civil war we are considering here is much more like a cease-fire between the police and the criminals. The terrorists are not under command. Many groups of armed warriors have moved in, and they have been sitting in Rhodesia for two years. As long as they are fed and get their girls they are not much of a nuisance. They are fed. They are hanging about the country. They are not in communication with their command. They are not advanced enough to be able to carry about radios or things like that. They have a very few elementary weapons which are not used very much. They do a certain amount of poaching. But does anybody seriously imagine that Mr. Mugabe or Mr. Nkomo can tell them to bring these precious guns back and stop firing? The idea that a cease-fire here is deliverable is nonsense. After all, what kind of fighting do they go in for? It is a very odd war in which you cannot point to one single engagement in which the terrorists have had a success or one single defended farm which they have taken. All they have done is casual murder. The only reaction which they have when our airborne strikes come up and parachutists jump is to run away. It is unrecorded that they have ever stood and fought. The only fighting in the sense of armed force fighting armed force has been with each other. There is a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0584"/>
<col>1151</col>
genuine and real fight when the Mugabe boys meet the Nkomo ones, when the Shona meet the Matabele. There have been real fights there. There have been no fights between these chaps and the Government. To talk about a cease-fire in those terms seems to me quite unreal.<lb/>
Then we come to the position of the British governor. He is to command the forces, he is to command the police, he is to be the Government, the Minister of Works and Prisons and everything. Pooh-Bah will not be in it. In fact he will command nobody and will have no real power at all. He will not have any of the instruments of power. He will be just a bogus appointment. The man who will operate the power, in my estimation, is Mr. Ian Smith, because white or black he is the one man in Rhodesia whom everybody trusts. With considerable nobility and much as he disapproves of this, he has gone back to Rhodesia to make it work and he will make it work. The difference between his statements and the kind of statements we have been hearing in this House and the other House from members of my party&#x2014;well, I will not comment.<lb/>
What about the election? The last election was on a real issue, something which had to be demonstrated and shown. What about this one? This is going to be an African election. Let me say this. No African election has ever yet been lost by a government, because that is not the way they think of elections in Africa. Does anybody in this House seriously imagine that a Mugabe victory is acceptable in this election? The judges have said quite frankly that they will bolt before he can catch them. What will be the position of the civil service, the army, the police and indeed of South Africa, which has made its position quite clear. This is a performance, not a reality. But one cannot for a moment deny the skill of the Foreign Office. The United Nations were all against us, the USA, the Commonwealth, the Presidents, the Bishop. They have all been pulled into this nonsense; they have all been successfully bamboozled. It is a splendid performance in these terms. But I wonder enormously whether it is worth while.<lb/>
<col>1152</col>
Would not one really, if looking for economies, better do without a Foreign Office? A Foreign Office is a fine thing for great powers. Theodore Roosevelt described his foreign policy simply in these words:
<quote>"I never express an objective unless I know that I am in a position to enforce it, by force if necessary".</quote>
Foreign politics are about power. Foreign politics without power&#x2014;and we have not got power now&#x2014;are an exercise in chicanery. We have been watching one at Lancaster House. Sweden and Switzerland had the sense to realise that&#x2014;they do without a foreign policy, but of course, there is consular representation. But foreign policy in the sense of trying to interfere with other people's policies when one does not have the power to enforce one's wishes is, I believe, an undignified and undesirable occupation.<lb/>
I am the only person who has spoken so far&#x2014;and I do not suppose that anyone else will say this&#x2014;who hopes that the negotiations break down. If they break down, the Rhodesian Government can be left to get on with their own business and win their own war. I believe that they can do so. What we and South Africa should do is to confine ourselves to exerting such power as we have to assert international law and to stop criminal intervention from outside Rhodesia's frontiers. If we do that for her, she can be left to look after herself.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02272"><member>Lord GRIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in September this year, at the invitation of the Public Services Association of Rhodesia, I was invited to Salisbury to address the members of that Association. Its membership comprises some 6,000 black and white Africans. They are not political: they have given an undertaking to serve loyally any Government elected in the future. It was arranged prior to my departure&#x2014;and I was out there during the first 10 days of the Lancaster House Conference&#x2014;that I would visit public servants in the security areas, and in addition to that, address public servants in Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. I travelled extensively by air during my journeys and daily over 14 days had many conversations with black and white Africans. I made a point of speaking to as many black Africans in the public service as
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0585"/>
<col>1153</col>
possible. At Miwera, an outstation which I reached by flying over the tribal trust lands, I found a young married girl on duty as a gazetted junior district officer. She had taken the place of a district commissioner killed by terrorists before my visit. It made no difference to her that she was pregnant. I found that attitude to duty by public servants in Rhodesia&#x2014;both black and white&#x2014;prevalent wherever I travelled. Duty came first, even if it meant the loss of life itself.<lb/>
At Victoria Falls I had a long conversation with about 20 black Africans who were public servants. They were immigration officers put on duty to watch the situation on the bridge which links Rhodesia with Zambia&#x2014;the bridge over the Zambesi. After a conversation with them which lasted about an hour and a half I found that they were more concerned for the future stability of their country than with giving any outward expression of the complexion of their future government. But wherever I went on my journeys and in the countless conversations which I had with white and black Africans&#x2014;by which description those public servants and others prefer to be known&#x2014;I found an overriding anxiety on the part of all of them about the future of their pensions. I shall say more of that when I move the amendment in my name during the Committee stage.<lb/>
However, I should like to say now, in order to save your Lordships' time, that when I move my amendment in Committee I do not envisage any guarantee whatsoever by Her Majesty's Government to underwrite the pensions of Rhodesia public servants. I wish to emphasise that. That must be, and to my knowledge has always been, the responsibility of the overseas country itself, in respect of all oerseas territories, at the inception of independence.<lb/>
What I seek by my amendment&#x2014;and I must speak to this now because it has a bearing on the Second Reading of this Bill&#x2014;is justice and stability for black and white Africans and for Africa generally. I seek justice and stability for blacks in an orderly transfer of power to themselves, which they must take when the new Government is appointed. I emphasise that that stability and the power which they ought to exercise&#x2014;and which we hope they all will exercise when they accede to a government of their own&#x2014;can all be lost if
<col>1154</col>
precipitately they were to lose white expertise in the early days of independence. I shall ask my noble friends in Government on this side of the Houe and my noble friends&#x2014;if I may respectfully refer to them in that way&#x2014;on the Opposition Benches who have played an honourable part in the saga of Rhodesia (indeed in all quarters of the House noble Lords have played their part) to understand what I am saying. I am not enunciating a racial proposition. It is absolutely vital that there should be co-operation between black and white and that white expertise should not leave the country precipitately.<lb/>
However, I respectfully suggest that it would help the situation if it were possibe for Her Majesty's Government to send to Rhodesia an expert from the pensions office at the Ministry of Overseas Development to advise the public servants in that country&#x2014;the Public Services Association and the Public Services Commission&#x2014;on how to bring their pension regulations up to modern conditions. The State Pensions Act for Rhodesia appears to have been conceived at a time when it was not envisaged that Rhodesia should be other than a self-governing colony&#x2014;in other words, that Rhodesians should not leave the country. There is no provision, for example, for when a Rhodesian officer might become Africanised early in his service, which is bound to happen. There is no provision under any of their laws for payment of the transfer by sea to some other country of himself, his wife or household effects. There are a number of other anomalies with which I will not weary your Lordships at present. I believe that if that could be done, and Her Majesty's Government were to consider this, it would assist the situation and the African Government when they come to power.<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like to make a few comments about what I have said to your Lordships. When I obtained a copy of the Bill on Thursday night from the Bill Office I took the precaution of telephoning Salisbury and speaking to the president of the Public Services Association in that country. I checked with him what I proposed to say to your Lordships. We could not have a great deal of conversation on the telephone and it was decided that he should come to England. He arrived on Sunday and spent Sunday night with me in my home in Somerset. We went through the points that I have put
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0586"/>
<col>1155</col>
before your Lordships today. Mr. Barry Lennox, the president of the Public Services Association, is listening in the gallery, and I think he would agree that I have depicted to your Lordships a correct account of the situation. I shall have more to say about this when we reach the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02273">6.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02274"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is beyond dispute that had not Mr. Ian Smith declared UDI some 14 years ago we should not be having this debate tonight. It is equally true that had not the Patriotic Front resisted by armed force the consequences that flowed as a result of Mr. Smith's act, we should not be discussing this conference. In turn, the conference would not have been convened had it not been for the cancelling out of metropolitan Portugal and the emergence of Mozambique. Therefore, there is no doubt whatever that we must regard UDI as an act of rebellion and treason, for which two of our fellow countrymen were executed. Mr. Smith, together with the Duke of Montrose, Mr. Van der Byl and others who supported them, undertook with enthusiasm treasonable activity, and they undertook that act hoping it would be successful. It has not been successful because of the action of the Patriotic Front and because of the events in Mozambique.<lb/>
If one listens to the alibis&#x2014;to those who seek to make the actions of Mr. Smith, his friends and supporters in this country acceptable&#x2014;one concludes that there is one easy alibi which we have heard put forward this afternoon. The noble Lords, Lord Home of the Hirsel, Lord Barnby and Lord Paget of Northampton, referred to it and it has often been repeated in another place. On my way to the House tonight I heard on my car radio a Conservative Member of Parliament explaining, in the usual objective way of the BBC, the influence of the Russians in Rhodesia. I make the point that the Russians and Russian arms have, without doubt, reached the hands of members of the Patriotic Front. However, they could easily be other arms because there is an international trade in arms. I have no doubt whatever that Soviet arms came in direct.<lb/>
<col>1156</col>
However, I have the advantage of a typescript of an interview given by SACEUR, by General Alexander Haig just before he gave up the Supreme Allied Command in Europe. He was questioned on the build-up of Russian arms in Africa and it was perfectly clear that, in his opinion, there was a massive build-up at the time of the Somali invasion of the Ogaden. I think that that is wholly true. It was a magnificent military performance logistically, because within a period of about three months some 2,000 million dollars-worth of ultra-sophisticated Russian equipment entered Ethiopia. At present the Ethiopian air force is perhaps the most militarily advanced force in black Africa; they have some 150 Mig 21s and more than a handful of "floggers", to give them their NATO name, which is the M.23, which could take out anything that we have, never mind what the Rhodesian air force possess.<lb/>
Therefore, we should thank our lucky stars that so far the Soviet Union has not been actively engaged in the support of Mozambique, although it has had plenty of excuses, quite apart from Rhodesia. There is no doubt whatever that the policy of South Africa is one of overall destabilisation. They were bombing last week in Angola; they have an active undercover force operating in Mozambique. But so far there has been no specific Russian commitment.<lb/>
In his wisdom the noble Lord, Lord Paget, hoped that the talks would collapse. If the talks collapse, we must face what we might be letting ourselves in for. We may find ourselves faced with an extension of the war on an international scale. Therefore, we need to be careful and perhaps do a little homework before we start talking glibly about Soviet intervention. So far I do not believe that that has taken place, but General Haig was quite clear about it. He envisaged the possibility of an Ethiopian intervention on a brigade-group scale, with air raids if the raids continued into Mozambique.<lb/>
That brings me to my next point concerning the exercise of power. With all respect to the noble Lord, Lord Home of the Hirsel, as Prime Minister he bore considerable responsibility for UDI. The noble Lord was Prime Minister in 1964 and during the Conservative Adminis-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0587"/>
<col>1157</col>
tration of 1961 to 1964 had Rhodesia not been supplied with Hunters, Canberras and Vampires, it could never have declared independence. It would have been quite impossible for land forces from this country actively to intervene. I had some ministerial responsibility at that time, and I would have resigned at once if there had been any pressure for us to use military force in Rhodesia. I do not play politics with other men's lives, although, as a serving soldier in the ranks of the Regular Army, it has often been done to me. Having been at the receiving end, I would never impose it upon anyone else.<lb/>
It is a fact that at that time Rhodesia had about 75 aircraft which enabled them effectively to control the country and to do what they wanted, because any outside intervention was impossible. I give no military secrets away, but an attempt was made by Mr. Wilson's Administration to get President Nyerere to accept as a first move a squadron of Lightnings in Tanzania. President Nyerere would not wear it. The Lightning is not a particularly effective aircraft because it is an interdictor, and in the circumstances a fighter attack aircraft was required.<lb/>
I must be as careful as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, in not contravening the laws of order, but last week in another place an ex-Conservative Cabinet Minister gave a description of the Bill, a description with which I wholly agree. He objected to it in principle and he objected to the way in which the Bill seeks to obtain its objectives. He went on to make a comparison. He said that the governor going out to Rhodesia, whoever he may be&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Paget, said much the same&#x2014;would go out with his plumes, his medals and his sword. The Member said that he thought the whole thing would become a farce, but equally, that it could become a tragedy, and possibly both. I simply do not believe that.<lb/>
I have considerable respect for the Member in another place. Certainly I have great respect for his logic. Historically, the comparison with Gordon going into Khartoum may be correct, but it is no more than that, because Gordon went to Khartoum when the Liberal Government of the day&#x2014;I shall not be objectionable&#x2014;in their wisdom had obtained a cease-fire from the Mandi.
<col>1158</col>
Gordon, however, went to Khartoum by dhow. The governor who goes to Rhodesia today will go by aircraft. He would control the air force. The Rhodesian air force consists of 65 aircraft. Many of the Hunters have gone; the Canberras have nearly all gone; there are still some Vampires and quite a number of helicopters; they have a fairly considerable counter-insurgency force. There are five airfields. At one stage they had three airfields. If he were to order them to put those aircraft onto two airfields, and put in one squadron only (two would be a luxury) of Phantoms, the F4H, Britain would control Rhodesia. That is what air power means.<lb/>
The Member in another place who was making the comparison with Gordon going to Khartoum was wrong in thinking that the Gordon of today would not have behind him the Government if the Government had the will. I would go a little further. I have listened to discussions between Members of your Lordships' House on that impartial instrument, the BBC, as to who should go. There were discussions about those whom I would regard as Foreign Office deadbeats, and those whom I would also regard as political deadbeats. The person who should be sent there is a Member of your Lordships' House. Send Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Elworthy, who commanded the force in Kuwait and who has considerable experience of commanding joint forces. He has the additional advantage of being a New Zealander. Furthermore, he has an intellect of the first order. If an Air Marshal of the Royal Air Force was put into Rhodesia and given one squadron&#x2014;a second one for luck&#x2014;in fact he would control the situation. Then, and only then, he could make his dispositions with the full knowledge that he had the power if he wished to exercise it.<lb/>
Now we are asked today to pass this Bill. Why? The seed of this Bill was planted on 2nd July in Sydney, when Mrs. Thatcher, going her strident way and pursuing the tactics which were so ably carried out by the Housewives' League, got up and said without a brief that sanctions would not be renewed. She was committed in advance to sanctions not being renewed. Of course this caused a storm. It caused a storm throughout
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0588"/>
<col>1159</col>
Africa, and the reverberations are still there. The actions of Her Majesty's Government are not trusted. What this House needs to realise is that we are not just a debating society. It is not just merely a question of political convenience of that side or this side, or who said what. What is on the line is Britain's integrity. Either we mean to stage a fair show in which there are going to be elections honestly conducted, or we have taken sanctions off. And why have we taken sanctions off?<lb/>
Well, may I again follow the careful example of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and mention no names beyond the fact that it was a Conservative supporter in another place who said that of course sanctions must not be renewed because Bishop Muzorewa must get back to Salisbury, and the fact that he had managed to bring about the end of sanctions would be a winning card in the election campaign.<lb/>
So we have first of all Mrs. Thatcher making her statement. She has to be bailed out. They are a loyal lot on the Government side, and they are engaged at this present moment in bailing her out, never mind what she says. But it will not be very long before a different tune will be called. But that will be called of course by the impact of facts and not arguments. Then we have the fact that, having gone as far as we have, the Bishop must be helped to win, because the object of the exercise is to get the Bishop to win. What then happened? They went to Lusaka. There they were bailed out by the Secretary-General, Mr. Ramphal. He bailed them out by getting the Commonwealth countries to agree to the proposal for a conference in this country, and so the conference was called.<lb/>
Then of course, the point was reached when Mr. Ramphal saw what was happening. The 16th October was a turning point. Mr. Ramphal made it perfectly clear, both in a considered statement which was published by the Commonwealth Office and in a Press statement, that what the Foreign Secretary had been doing, despite the eulogies poured on him for his integrity and competence, was something outside the letter and spirit of the Lusaka Agreement. So the situation had changed. Mr. Ramphal had performed his duty.
<col>1160</col>
The world, the Commonwealth, and Africa were alerted. Every step they take, every word they utter, is being watched. It is not going to be judged by what happens in the Division Lobby tonight, but by what comes out at the other end.<lb/>
Now we come to the Bill. I was glad indeed that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, helped me out in conscience because I do not like the Bill.I contemplated putting down an Amendment that this Bill should be read in six months' time, which would be an out and out rejection. If you examine Clause 1, this House is asked, as another place was asked, to give the Government a blank cheque to a constitution when it is agreed.<lb/>
It is said that this has always happened; this is common form in all decolonisation methods. As the noble Lord, Lord Soames, knows, he and I have had little arguments over the years. If I may say so respectfully, I have not always lost because, as last week on a racing debate, I do my homework. I can find no example whatever of any decolonisation proposals that were carried through in which the constitution was to be followed by elections in which there is no electoral register; there are no constituencies, and there is no knowledge at all of where the constituents are going to be. Does the noble Lord want to interrupt?</membercontribution></p>

What is the objective situation in which we find ourselves? According to my guesses&#x2014;and they are only guesses&#x2014;there are not less than 60,000 or 70,000 citizens of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia outside the borders of Zimbabwe in neighbouring countries. How are they to be polled? How are they to be got back? Furthermore, the elections presumably are to be carried through, as the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, says, supervised by the British

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02286"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: Of course he opposed martial law, my Lords, because they had it already. The noble Lord goes out to Rhodesia in a tame sort of way. He is a nice chap but the idea that he managed

to penetrate beneath the surface belongs to the realm of fairy stories. Of course he did not. This is a rough lot, and I have seen some rough lots in my time and I could mention other examples under Britain's authority where there have been some rough deals. This is a paramilitary force that is in no way comparable to any police force that has recognition in this country and it is going to supervise the polling, and of course it will not. What it will do is to maintain law and order on the methods it has employed in the past.<lb/>
We have got to the point when the Patriotic Front will not accept the arrangements which the Government are now seeking to impose on them by the use of an ultimatum&#x2014;when one starts talking in terms of hours&#x2014;unless they are satisfied that the elections will be fair. Thus, it is a prime condition that they should be fair, but at the present moment they do not trust the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, and neither do I&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02289">Several noble Lords: Twenty minutes!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02290"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: I know how long I have been speaking, my Lords. Let me give a couple of examples, three if noble Lords like. Last Thursday night the Patriotic Front was charged by Lord Carrington with an act of gross discourtesy. Let us see how it worked out. At 2.30 President Kaunda, having arrived on Thursday morning, saw the Sovereign. He, the President of Zambia, asked to see Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Nkomo at 3.30. Lord Carrington had called a plenary session for 3.30, so they very courteously got in touch with the Foreign Office and said, "Sorry, no plenary session", and that was that. Subsequently they heard from the Foreign Office that Lord Carrington refused to call off the plenary session. So they did not turn up and Lord Carrington lost his temper, as he has done frequently, and tried to treat them as if they are houseboys, and they are not, and charged them with being discourteous about something of which he and his office had full knowledge. Later, the High Commissioner of Zambia
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0590"/>
<col>1163</col>
talked with officials of the Foreign Office and said, I think rightly, that if there was any act of discourtesy and any lack of regard to the proprieties, they had been committed by Lord Carrington and not by the Patriotic Front. Those are the facts, and of course the media did not get the point, but never mind.<lb/>
Let me give another example. Lord Carrington got to what appeared to be a turning point, going back on what he had previously said and there was going to be a military force; it was to consist of New Zealanders, Australians and a force from Britain. Bishop Muzorewa was consulted and told about the proposals. The Patriotic Front read them in the newspapers. Those are the ways in which these negotiations have been so "competently and courteously" carried on, and this has gone on from the beginning. I ask noble Lords, if they want to, to look at the Press and see what happened. On 16th October we see the turning point. Up to that time it was made perfectly clear that there was option No. 1 and option No. 2, and option No. 2 was a unilateral agreement with Bishop Muzorewa and the Patriotic Front would go back to Africa. As I said, it was the intervention of M. Ramphal and the alerting of public opinion throughout the Commonwealth and the world that made the Foreign Secretary change his mind.<lb/>
Now we come to the present time. I believe, much as the noble Lord, Lord Paget, said, in the efficacy that on balance the British Commonwealth has been for the good of the world. I deplore the fact that the sacrifices of the British Army for the most part and those of the administrators have been dissipated following the wind-of-change policy. I was no party to it, and I regret it. But above all now there are issues of transcendental importance. If Lord Carrington goes ahead with his proposals and has an ultimatum, the ultimatum will result in no agreement and then, I should have thought, almost certainly, a deterioration in the situation and an internationalisation of the war. That would be tragic for Africa, for the world at large, and it would certainly be tragic for this country, not least because it would bring down on our heads the economic and political penalties of the overt hostility of the Commonwealth, not only in Africa but
<col>1164</col>
throughout the world, and that would be wholly regrettable.<lb/>
I am not a diplomatist. I notice that the Foreign Office, like <i>The Times,</i> has had an unbroken record of always being wrong on every major issue throughout the century. I excuse myself from any claim to diplomacy purely on the ground that when I have a bet I like to back a winner or two. But let us see where he has now got to. He has got himself into the position that, whereas I believe he was seeking up to 16th and 17th October of forcing the Patriotic Front to break it off and therefore bear the responsibility for having broken off the agreement, he has now boxed himself in because Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Nkomo are just as able as he is and they are not going to break it off; they are going to disagree with the proposals of the Government, and the responsibility for breaking it off will rest not with the Patriotic Front but with the British Government. That is the terrible price we have to pay for the incompetence and arrogance of a Foreign Secretary who has yet to learn his job, and the penalty will be paid not by him, not by the Conservative Party, but by Britain, and that is my excuse for detaining your Lordships tonight.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02292"><member>The Earl of LAUDERDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always a pleasure, for me at any rate, to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, because in a House which is apt to be somnolent he brings us to life; we had 28 minutes of good-hearted stuff from an old soldier and, surprisingly to myself, I found myself in agreement with him on one matter which he touched on, and I hope I understood him right. It was his reference to the need for air power in supporting the proposed British presence, but I will come back to that shortly.<lb/>
I believe he is mistaken, however, in his assertion that there have been no first elections in newly-independent Commonwealth countries without the compilation of a register. If my memory serves me right, there was no register for the first elections in Kenya. I may be wrong and it may have been Tanganyika, but at any rate there have been one or two precedents, though I need not detain the House on that.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0591"/>
<col>1165</col>
I think it important to take Lord Wigg up on one allegation; namely, that the police in Rhodesia may be likened in their methods to the SS. I believe that is an unworthy remark, and I say it is unworthy because while I do not know Africa and have been to Rhodesia only once, and that for a short time, whenever as a newspaperman&#x2014;and I was a newspaperman for 25 years&#x2014;I was sent to a country, place or situation I did not know, I always followed a simple rule. That was to try as quickly as possible to discover what I will call a fix in the situation, namely, some person or body of persons whose word could be trusted. When I went to Rhodesia I happened to have a number of contacts among missionaries&#x2014;some Roman Catholic, some non-RC, some for the r&#x00E9;gime, a good many more against it. I asked all of them particularly about the police. The story I got from both sides was very different from the impression conveyed by the noble Lord.<lb/>
Most speeches from the Opposition Benches have focussed on two areas. First, there has been the Patriotic Front case, and secondly, there has been the argument about speeding things up. As to the Patriotic Front case, frankly I can see no merit in trying to re-argue in your Lordships' House now, tonight, a case which has been stated over and over and over again, at Lancaster House and in the media as well. That is stale ground. As to the speed-up, there have been nine weeks which I, as an outsider, not involved in the conference, would say have amounted to a filibuster. When the point is raised: Why not a four months' transition period instead of two?&#x2014;the answer is that it would be twice as hard, twice as long, and twice as difficult. But these are short points.<lb/>
The question surely today is whether, and how, a settlement, if it is reached, between the Muzorewa Government, the terrorist leaders, and the United Kingdom Government can be made to work. I am quite sure that President Kaunda will be very glad to have Mr. Nkomo and his army off his back. I have little doubt that President Machel will be happy to see the back of Mr. Mugabe and his men. But is there really much likelihood that those who disdained to join, and who vowed and used military force to try to prevent the April elections, will now join in
<col>1166</col>
democratically and without terrorist intimidation?
<quote>"They politics like ours profess, the greater prey upon the rest";</quote>
and with Dr. Johnson I hope I shall never be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian.<lb/>
If the cease-fire comes, it is certain to be fragile; equally so, surely, the pretended restoration of British Sovereignty. I am afraid that I find it horribly like rhetoric without power. And this is the connection in which I find myself in agreement with what I understood to be a suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, that the introduction of air power could make all the difference. What is certain to me is that here is a very courageous, but my goodness! almighty, gamble. Its best hope, surely, is the situation already created by the internal settlement and left by Bishop Muzorewa and Mr. Smith.<lb/>
Had sanctions been lifted in May after the fulfilment of the Six Principles, I personally believe that a much more promising situation would have presented itself today. I beg your Lordships to remember that my noble friend Lord Carrington and the right honourable lady the Prime Minister have more than once proclaimed that we must build on the achievements of the Muzowera-Smith internal agreement and on the result of the April elections. The last time we debated Rhodesia in this House my noble friend Lord Home of the Hirsel urged that the Muzorewa Government should be given a fair chance, and the noble Viscount, Lord Boyd of Merton, with all his authority, having just returned from an extensive tour with a team of six very skilled and discerning observers, said as much also.<lb/>
Of course we hope that it is all going to work out. Maybe within a year or less judgments will be possible; judgments whether this is a magnificent triumph for political commonsense, or judgments whether the real interests of millions of simple people have been cast aside, and whether there has been a ghastly misjudgment, so that geopolitical interests vital to the Free World have been thrown away&#x2014;all that in the belief that you can talk your Marxist enemies out of anything. I hold my breath in wonder at the soldierly daring of my noble friend Lord Carrington,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0592"/>
<col>1167</col>
and in this I wholeheartedly agree with him&#x2014;any further delay could be madness, or worse.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02294"><member>Lord SAINT OSWALD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those of us who have counted ourselves for a good many years as close and admiring friends of the present Foreign Secretary must have had our friendship and admiration powerfully reinforced during the last nine weeks. A year ago in this House, in the sanctions debate, friendship did not prevent me from voting conscientiously against his advice. Nothing could deflect me tonight from voting on his advice, and for this Bill. It seems to me that for a man whose brain works at a tempo and with a reasoned assurance possessed by few, he has conducted these negotiations with a most remarkable patience&#x2014;more remarkable from him than it might have been from a more leisurely and hesitant personality.<lb/>
Due to this, timing has been calculated and stretched to snapping point. My noble friend Lord Home of the Hirsel speaking this afternoon with his immense authority, said that there is no more room for delay. I also picked up, as he did, the words quoted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones:
<quote>"Jaw, jaw is better than war, war"</quote>
and I am bound to say that they shocked me. Nobody who has been recently to Rhodesia, as I and others in the Chamber have, could have used those words in this context. Every day before solution costs innocent lives and inflicts heavy economic damage upon this deserving people.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Walton, with whom I should so much rather be in harmony than in dispute, said that two months was insufficient time for the parties to prepare their campaigns. But what sort of campaigns? My anxiety is that the misnamed Patriotic Front had been so plentifully provided not only with sophisticated arms and ammunition, but also with vehicles and radio equipment, that they will have an unfair advantage, but this is a disadvantage accepted by the present Government of Rhodesia. In fact when the so-called Patriotic Front refer to campaigns they are not talking about the same kind of campaigns, they are not talking about electoral campaigns,
<col>1168</col>
they are not talking about democratic procedures in which they do not believe. The noble Lord, Lord Walston, warned the House that under the present proposals war would continue and escalate. If so, it will be by the determination of the Patriotic Front, and to permit that front to prevent a resumption of legal status would be an appeasement comparable to Munich in moral weakness, if not in scale.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Walston, also said that it strained his credulity to suppose that the present security forces would be able to change their loyalties to the new governor. They have been loyal, as they have seen it. to their country. Did it, I wonder, strain anyone's credulity that they continued loyal to the Black majority rule of Bishop Muzorewa's Government? They did remain loyal.<lb/>
I was grateful to my noble friend Lord Carrington for paying tribute to the way in which Bishop Muzorewa and his delegation had surrendered the achievement of their own elections last year. At those elections I was an official observer from the European Parliament. Other observers were my noble friend Lord Onslow and the noble Lord, Lord Paget, who have both spoken in this debate. My own official report agreed very closely indeed&#x2014;almost identically&#x2014;with that of Lord Boyd's group. Under appalling conditions, totally unknown to this country or any other Western country, fair elections were carried out among a people who had never had an election before and did not know what an election meant. I met and talked to people who had walked 30 miles through the bush in order to vote, and some had been beaten up on the way.<lb/>
I must admit that I was slightly troubled by the implication contained in the words of my noble friend Lord Carrington that the British governor could not take up his post until there was a cease-fire. If that ground rule were operated literally, it seems to me, it would leave the terrorists with the tool of unlimited postponement in their hands. Later in his speech my noble friend balanced this interpretation by saying&#x2014;I am paraphrasing, but I hope accurately&#x2014;that no single element would be permitted unilaterally to delay, beyond a reasonable space, Rhodesia's return to legality. It is my trust in that assurance which commands my heartfelt support for this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02296"><member>Viscount MASSEREENE and FERRARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for coming so late on the list of speakers, but it was only at 12 o'clock that I put my name down to speak. I can assure your Lordships that I will speak for only four minutes; but, having always spoken on this subject whenever it has come before this House, I felt I ought to offer my congratulations to my noble friend the Foreign Secretary for being such a brilliant negotiator as to have got as far as he has. But, as the Foreign Secretary said, speed is the essence of this question; and, having some knowledge of Africa, I am quite convinced that if the negotiations were to drag on and on then the intimidation would be so great (in Africa we have many societies such as the Leopard men, who I have seen, and one or two others) that these proposals would suffer the same fate as that which befell the Pearce Commission's proposals. Therefore, I agree most heartily that speed is the essence and that these negotiations cannot drag on. It would be disastrous, I feel.<lb/>
What I do not understand are some aspects of the opinions of the party opposite. The party opposite appear to be completely unaware (and unless they wear blinkers I do not know how they are unaware) of the fact that if the Patriotic Front (I prefer to call them the Marxist terrorists) got their way then eventually Southern Africa would come into the Soviet orbit. The party opposite are, quite rightly, very concerned about the unemployment in this country. But if the West were denied the vast mineral resources of South of the Zambezi then, as I have said before in this House, unemployment in this country would not be 1&#x00BD; million, it would probably be 5 million, or even more. Therefore, I say that speed in the ending of these negotiations is essential.<lb/>
Various noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, have said, "Ah, but the Patriotic Front will not have time to set up an organisation for the elections". As we have heard today, Mr. Ian Smith and Bishop Muzorewa repeatedly asked them to take part in the elections, but they never did. The noble Lord, Lord Hatch, said that the Patriotic Front have given a lot of ground. They have given ground inasmuch as they have said they will not go for a Marxist dictator-
<col>1170</col>
ship straightaway, but they have not given all that amount of ground. They have not given nearly as much ground as the bishop. Therefore, I would merely repeat that it would be completely disastrous if the negotiations were to drag on. My Lords, I will not speak longer because we have several amendments coming after this Second Reading debate, but I sincerely hope that this Bill is passed. I do not know whether it will go to a Division, but if it does do so I hope it is passed by a very large majority.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02298"><member>Lord CHITNIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to intervene in this debate in what must seem to be an unscheduled way, but in fact I put my name down to speak but it was inadvertently missed off the list. I will none the less try to be as brief as I can. I must say that, despite all that has been said this afternoon, I cannot help feeling that it is still strange that there has been this hasty and, frankly, ill-timed introduction of the enabling Bill at this delicate stage of the Lancaster House negotiations. Frankly, I was not convinced by the explanation given by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington; and, while I sympathise with his desire to mollify those of his party who have consistently championed white supremacy in Rhodesia, the proposal to allow Section 2 sanctions to lapse before an agreement with all parties is concluded can only jeopardise the chances of achieving a lasting settlement, it seems to me, and is bound to be interpreted by some as a demonstration of bad faith.<lb/>
I am not going to talk about the obvious defects in the British proposals for a constitution since these seem now to have been conditionally accepted, albeit reluctantly, by the Patriotic Front, but I want of course to concentrate on the important issues relating to the transition which are still outstanding. I said in your Lordships' House in April that free and fair elections could not be held in Rhodesia unless there was a cease-fire and unless there was a neutral force to guarantee the end of hostilities and the freedom of the electoral process. I still see no reason to change my mind. Indeed, the continued escalation of the war since April has only strengthened my belief that, in the absence of the integration of the Rhodesian military and the armies of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0594"/>
<col>1171</col>
the Patriotic Front, such a force is a <i>sine qua non</i> of a free and fair election.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships to look at this objectively. I just happen to have come back from Poland, which is a country where we should all like to see a free and fair election. Suppose it was to be announced that there was to be one, but that it would be administered by the bureaucrats who currently control that r&#x00E9;gime and policed by the forces which currently control the population there. All your Lordships would be justifiably sceptical about the result. Indeed, in some ways the situation in Rhodesia is worse than it is in Poland. I am amazed to hear talk about apprehensions as to the possible breakdown of law and order. The law and order which Mr. Smith has always claimed so fervently to be maintaining does not in reality exist for the vast majority of people in Rhodesia. Rhodesia is in the grip of, not two but five armies, and the resultant situation is one of lawlessness and near anarchy.<lb/>
Of course, I do not believe that the Patriotic Front forces should be solely in charge of security during the transition; but neither do I believe that the existing security forces should be. The security forces, together with the so-called auxiliaries, taking advantage of the <i>carte blanche</i> afforded by the martial law which now blankets almost the entire country, are themselves responsible for much of the chaos. Punitive strikes, both on villages inside the country and on refugee and transit camps outside it, continue with increased ferocity and frequency. Little or no distinction is made by them between civilians and armed guerrillas, between curfew-breakers and guerrilla collaborators, or between innocent herdsmen and those people who steal cattle. Martial law is not just an item on the statute book. The sweeping powers which it affords are for the majority of people in Rhodesia an appalling reality. The use of torture appears to be standard practice there.<lb/>
In the last week I have been shown three petitions for clemency which were submitted to the President of Rhodesia in August this year. The cases concern three boys&#x2014;one aged 19 and two aged 16&#x2014;who have been convicted by special courts martial of collaborating with the guerrillas.<lb/>
<col>1172</col>
The convictions were based on the confessions of the three defendants. Two were sentenced to death and the other to life imprisonment. In all three cases the defendants allege that the confessions were extracted through prolonged and brutal torture&#x2014;beatings, near drownings, electric shock treatment and so forth. I do not at the moment know the result of these petitions for clemency, but, had it not been for an action in the Rhodesian High Court earlier this year, brought by the Commission for Justice and Peace in the face of fierce Government opposition, to ensure that those convicted of martial law offences should be granted the same right to the presidential prerogative of mercy as other detainees, it is unlikely that these cases would even have seen the light of day.<lb/>
No one can say with any certainty how many martial law detainees there are since they come within the jurisdiction of combined operations, and statistics are not published for "security" reasons. Nor do we know precisely how many people&#x2014;guilty or innocent&#x2014;have been sentenced to death by martial law kangaroo courts or who have been executed. Indeed during the current negotiations in London, on 1st November, martial law was again extended to cover prisons so that these now come directly under military control and the blanket of national security.<lb/>
What is certain is that, if a climate conducive to free and fair elections is to be created, martial law will have to be lifted, draconian security legislation, including the infamous Indemnity and Compensation Act, held in abeyance pending its repeal, and those currently held in detention, whether under the emergency regulations or martial law provisions, must be immediately released.<lb/>
In the light of what I have said, demands for a neutral peacekeeping force are unarguable, and I am glad that the British government has finally&#x2014;and in accordance with what they said they would do in Lusaka&#x2014;conceded this principle. But I question whether the British proposals&#x2014;at any rate as leaked to the Press this weekend&#x2014;go far enough to provide the kind of assurances needed for free and fair elections.<lb/>
I am not a military expert and I am not qualified to pronounce on the size of the force required; but, bearing in mind
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0595"/>
<col>1173</col>
that the activities of the Rhodesian military forces will have to cease to ensure that the harassment, intimidation and coercion practised by them during the April election is avoided, I would urge the government to reconsider whether 1,200 "military observers" bearing only light arms are sufficient for a country the size of Rhodesia.<lb/>
If the Rhodesian police force is to be responsible for the bulk of the policing during the transition, as I understand it is under the British proposals, it is of paramount importance that it be brought effectively under the control of the British governing authority.<lb/>
Again, in the absence of the integration of the forces of the Patriotic Front and the Rhodesian security forces, and particularly in view of the rejection of the Patriotic Front's proposals for a power-sharing executive during the transition, it is crucial that the commitment of the leaders to a cease-fire is maintained. For this to be achieved, the British governing authority must ensure the confidence of all parties. This precludes treating the Patriotic Front and their supporters as second-class citizens, and involves not only parity for the leadership of the Patriotic Front with the internal leaders but regarding their armed forces as equally legitimate. If one side of the conflict, the security forces are to be maintained on the State payroll during the transition, similar financial provisions should be made for the guerrilla forces. If one supposes that all guerrilla activity is to finish, the guerrillas too have to be fed, housed and clothed. Assuming that there are some 15,000 guerrillas, and assuming that they were paid the same as the auxiliaries are in Rhodesia now, the cost to the state would be roughly equivalent a month to the current cost of the war a day.<lb/>
In addition to the question of security during the period to independence there is the question that we have discussed about the length of the transitional period. I agree that once agreement between all parties is reached, the transition should be made as quickly as is possible; but the time-scale proposed by the British Government frankly seems absurd.<lb/>
The difficulties of arranging a cease-fire when the guerrillas have in the past been bombarded with propaganda, threats and
<col>1174</col>
false promises are considerable. Announcements in the government-controlled media are not going to be enough. Even given the means of communications at the Patriotic Front's disposal, including radio broadcasts from Lusaka and Maputo, guerrilla groups will have to be contacted by people they trust and assured that the cease-fire proposals are genuine. This is bound to take time, particularly when one remembers the fate of 183 of the Rev. Sithole's auxiliaries massacred in July this year by the security forces in a preemptive strike.<lb/>
Then there is the question of political organisation. As the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, said, the political parties of the Patriotic Front are banned in Rhodesia. The names of their leaders have in the past not even been able to be mentioned in the media; party supporters are liable to arbitrary arrest and indefinite detention, and the leaders and top ranking officials of the Patriotic Front have been out of circulation inside the country for many years.<lb/>
In the light of this, it is clear that the British proposals favour the internal parties who have existing party organisations, whose leaders and officials have been projected nationwide by an intense public relations campaign, who control Rhodesia's biased media and who, if they have no experience of competing in free and fair elections, have amply demonstrated their considerable expertise in mass mobilisation.<lb/>
The six months' transition period proposed by the Patriotic Front frankly does not seem at all unreasonable to me, and would ensure that all parties are given equal opportunities in the election campaign to put forward their programmes. In this regard, it is relevant to point out that a longer transition period would also enable the necessary restructuring in my opinion by outside personnel of Rhodesia's Press, radio and television to ensure not only equal access by all parties to the media, but to correct the current gross distortions of what is in effect a government propaganda machine.<lb/>
Also, as has been mentioned, such a period would allow for the registration of voters&#x2014;conspicuously lacking in April, when I also was at the election, and which led to a number of abuses. As has been
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0596"/>
<col>1175</col>
mentioned, there is the problem of the estimated 300,000 refugees in neighbouring Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique. In the April election of course these people were disenfranchised. A longer transitional period than that currently proposed by the government would at least allow provision to be made for some to return home and play their legitimate role in the election process. The refugees, who have lost everything in the war and who continue to be victims of Rhodesian raids and pre-emptive strikes, unarguably have a far greater stake in the future of their country than, say. the non-citizen contract or temporary workers, most of whom were enfranchised in April.<lb/>
In conclusion, I would strongly urge the government to reconsider its current negotiating tactic of precipitate action, threats, ultimatums and the use of the non-renewal of Section 2 sanctions as a weapon in the current talks. The Patriotic Front is not being obstinate, is not fili-bustering, as can be judged from the level of support for their position from the front-line States and the Commonwealth as a whole.<lb/>
The spirit of reconciliation which the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, has rightly urged on the participants at Lancaster House should also apply to the British Government, and I hope that over the next few days the Government will adopt a more sympathetic attitude to the not inconsiderable compromises which have been made by the Patriotic Front, and give more flexible attention to their legitimate demands. The so-called second-class solution&#x2014;proceeding on a bilateral basis with the internal leaders&#x2014;is no solution at all to the tragedy of Rhodesia&#x2014;neither for Britain nor, more importantly for the suffering people of Zimbabwe.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02300"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is very wide agreement in the country and in Parliament as to what we all want to see in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. We want to see a settlement which stops the fighting, adopts an agreed constitution, establishes genuine majority rule through free elections leading to a lawful government deriving its authority from those elections. It is agreed that there must be a transition period during which the neces-
<col>1176</col>
sary arrangements for the transfer of power should be conducted by a British nominated governor in whom there would be vested complete executive&#x2014;including military&#x2014;authority.Very considerable progress has been made towards these goals. I repeat that great credit is due to the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, for the skill and perseverance with which he has pursued these objectives; and also&#x2014;as I am sure he would agree&#x2014;to the leaders of the Patriotic Front and the front-line Presidents, all of whom from time to time have themselves made crucial concessions without which the negotiations would have broken down a long time ago. It is to the statesmanship of all concerned, including our African colleagues in Lancaster House, that we in this House address ourselves this evening.<lb/>
However, for that progress to be translated into a real and durable settlement, it simply must be acceptable to all the parties concerned in the negotiations. It must be acceptable to Africa as a whole, to the Commonwealth (without whose support the negotiations could hardly have got off the ground) and to world opinion. Such a settlement must be compatible with UN decisions by which we are bound, and many of which we ourselves initiated in New York.<lb/>
First, it must be effectively agreed in Lancaster House. The wider concurrence and support which will give durability to the settlement can only flow from that agreement. If we fail there, then it is no use our canvassing the possibility of African, world, Commonwealth and United Nations acquiescence and support. Unless we have that, this Bill is pointless and the policy which it represents can only lead to new dimensions of disaster in Rhodesia if it is persisted in. At least this Bill is pointless unless it is backed by that kind of agreement in its present form. The Bill is described as an enabling Bill, simply doing the sensible job of providing the Government with the means of implementing an agreement in the future as that agreement emerges. If it were such a Bill, then I am pretty sure we on this side of the House would not object to it: indeed we might support it. But it is not truly an enabling Bill. It contains within it certain elements which, regardless of whether or not there is an agreement, the Government intend to implement at once, immediately.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0597"/>
<col>1177</col>
In particular, in my view, it quite unnecessarily exempts Section 2 sanctions from the provisions which an enabling Bill would anticipate rather than tackle at once. Sanctions are a very sensitive issue. There are many in all parties, in this country and wider afield, who regard sanctions as a potential substitute for war, as an instrument of proper coercion still to be perfected, and certainly not to be cursorily treated, as I think they are in this Bill. In Rhodesia in particular, in Africa and in the coloured world, our maintenance of sanctions is seen as the acid test of British and Western good faith. The Government in their own Bill seem to think so. They tell us that only about 20 per cent. of sanctions are touched by this Bill. Eighty per cent. are carried on, regardless of this Bill. In that case, why remove even 20 per cent?<lb/>
The question has been asked, and answered, from this side of the House. Naturally, it has not been answered with any frankness from the other side of the House. It is true&#x2014;is it not?&#x2014;that this central mistake of spoiling what might be a very useful instrument for the orderly and coherent transition and transfer of power&#x2014;this fatal flaw&#x2014;has been included in order to buy off the extremists of the Conservative Party, particularly in the other House, and indeed to give the Salisbury r&#x00E9;gime a talking point at home that may help them in the elections. This is a fundamental mistake, because it is not going to help the Salisbury r&#x00E9;gime at all. The Africans are already defining this gesture to them for what it is worth: already it is a non-starter. It may certainly harden African suspicions about our own intentions and it may, if what I am told is true and Section 2 does in fact include matters subject to United Nations mandatory resolutions, land us in considerable difficulty in the Security Council and the General Assembly. So this is not an enabling Bill. If it were, I believe I would support it. I can see an enabling Bill, which prepares the ground but does not jump the fences, as a very useful and and indeed necessary instrument for the implementation of a proper agreement.<lb/>
Having made that point, I have only one or two other points to make. One of them includes the important practical question of the transition stage. The first point to make is that I am profoundly disappointed and surprised that the
<col>1178</col>
Government, although they have been pressed from all quarters by more than one party, and certainly from the African quarter, to extend the two months' period of transition, have remained obdurate. In African circles this is regarded as part of a stratagem somehow to rush the elections so that those now <i>in situ,</i> the Salisbury parties, will have a distinct advantage in organising their campaigns and appealing to the Rhodesian electorate. Whether or not that is true, if it is believed then it is a very cogent argument for extending the period.<lb/>
There are practical arguments for it, of course&#x2014;we have heard them over and over again&#x2014;in order to organise something like a comprehensive register and to lay down the basic regulations for the sharing of public media facilities, about which once more the non-Salisbury r&#x00E9;gime parties are profoundly suspicious. There is the practical argument that men who lead what we hope will be parliamentary parties taking part in the election&#x2014;the men who lead the new parties of the Patriotic Front and who have been exiled from their own country and indeed imprisoned for years and have not been able to go about and do anything as democratic as canvassing&#x2014;will find it very difficult indeed to make a credible, coherent appeal in a vast territory like Rhodesia to an electorate of at least 3 to 4 million.<lb/>
So we are profoundly disappointed that there is no move to meet this very reasonable demand for an extension of the period. Four months has been suggested: even three months would help to give credibility to the purpose of the Government in enabling elections to be held at all. It would help the governor when he gets there. He would not be beset by people complaining to him and saying: "There is no time; we have not been able to get this or that; we have not been able to file this form". Two months is a derisory period in which to hold the first democratic election&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02306"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: Secondly, we are still not clear about the timing of the arrival of the governor and his role when he gets there. These are serious points. They touch the point of legality and they also touch very closely indeed the point of efficacy once the governor is there. He will go to Zimbabwe as a plenipotentiary, vested with all executive power, including the military power. If he goes out with those powers backed by effective agreement from Lancaster House then his task, although one of monumental difficulty, will nevertheless be possible. But if he goes out&#x2014;and I repeat my noble friend's question as to the intentions of the Government&#x2014;without the backing of such an agreement but merely on the basis of a bilateral arrangement or contrivance with the Salisbury parties, then his task will not only prove to be impossible but it may lead to new dimensions of disaster, involving this country in an actual confrontation with the Patriotic Front and the front-line Presidents, with the OAU and with significant countries in that continent, such as Nigeria. He will take over from the Salisbury r&#x00E9;gime not only the civil administration, but the military and police power. Through him, as the only legal Government in the country, the United Kingdom will be governing Rhodesia and it will be responsible for law and order and for any threat to it, both from inside and from outside the country.<lb/>
There are possibilities of confrontation, not as now between the Muzorewa forces and the Patriotic Front, but between this country and its forces&#x2014;if they can get there&#x2014;and the insurgents. From where will he draw his military and police forces&#x2014;from Rhodesia, from the white led forces of the Salisbury r&#x00E9;gime, from the bishop's auxiliaries? Will they cooperate?&#x2014;they may. Will they perhaps be manoeuvring for a position in relation to each other, seeking points of power and advantage when, as they think, possibly,
<col>1180</col>
the governor will have failed and will have to be withdrawn? All that will not happen, if he goes there on the basis of a real agreement in Lancaster House. All that may well happen if he is sent there on the basis of a mere bilateral contrivance with the Salisbury r&#x00E9;gime. This is really the basic objection that we have to the policy of the Government as it has now evolved.<lb/>
We say once more that the negotiations have been conducted with skill. We have been very pleased to support in every way the progress of those negotiations, and we are surprised and alarmed at the sudden turn of events about a week ago when, as my noble friend pointed out, the patience of the previous nine weeks was substituted by the impatience of the last nine days. I cannot believe that the Government have fully thought out the implications of their sudden change of tempo, including the introduction of this Bill during the past few days. There is still time to adopt an alternative strategy, to amend this Bill this evening in this House so that it becomes truly an enabling Bill; to take away from it what spoils it&#x2014;the provision for dropping Section 2 sanctions and one or two other things that we have emobdied in a number of Amendments. In that way, the Government would be provided with the full powers of initiative, subject of course to coming to both Houses for Affirmative approval, which would not be delayed and would certainly not be withheld.<lb/>
It would not be a question of adding another week or two to the negotiations of the past nine weeks; it would be a question of adding a few days to the negotiations of the last 14 years, and it is well worth stating at this late hour that the agreed constitution&#x2014;and I agree so very much with the noble Lord, Lord Home, that that is a major achievement and an essential one&#x2014;cannot be viable unless it is part of a general agreement. It remains a blueprint. I repeat that a great deal of progress has neen made, with all the parties to the conference making their contribution, and an invaluable degree of consensus has been created in Parliament and in the country. I hope that the noble Lord, when he replies, will be able to respond to the questions which my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones and I have put. If he does

so we may be able to agree to the Bill and to continue to help. If not, we must register our disagreement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02307">7.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02308"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it falls to me to follow the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, in winding-up this debate from this Dispatch Box. Rhodesia is a question which has always attracted numerous and distinguished contributions from noble Lords in all quarters of the House when it has deen debated, and today's debate has lived up to that standard. I shall do my best to answer as many points as possible that have been raised by noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
But before I turn to the specific themes of our debate, may I remind your Lordships briefly of the respects in which I believe our consideration of this problem can be, and should be, different on this occasion from the approach which has characterised our discussion of it here and in another place in recent years, or even at any time since the illegal declaration of independence by Mr. Ian Smith's Government in 1965. Certainly, every year since 1968 successive Governments have had to ask your Lordships to support their efforts to secure a peaceful settlement in Rhodesia, to deplore the failure of this party or that in Rhodesia to make an adequate response to those efforts, to acknowledge that there was no means by which the Government could impose any solution, however reasonable, against the wishes of the parties themselves and, finally, to accept that economic sanctions against Rhodesia must be continued for yet another year.<lb/>
To say this is not to seek to try&#x2014;for it is the last thing that I would wish to do, because how difficult these things are&#x2014;to depreciate the sincerity with which successive Governments have tried to find an honourable solution to this, the last and most vexatious problem posed by our colonial heritage in Africa. All did the best they could, as they saw it at the time. All strived hard to achieve their results. But all failed, ultimately, because events in Rhodesia itself and the attitudes of those with direct power in and over the country had not developed to a point where they matched what any British Government were prepared to do to achieve a settlement.<lb/>
<col>1182</col>
But that is not the situation that we find ourselves in today. Rhodesia has changed fundamentally in the last year and there has been a fundamental change in the attitudes of Rhodesians themselves. This Government have made it their task to build on that change. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, I think there are so many aspects that have led to this change of attitude that I would not try to single out any particular one. But one thing that is for sure is that this Government are right&#x2014;and I think noble Lords on both sides of the House would have wished it&#x2014;that if advantage could be taken of this change of attitude, it was right so to do.<lb/>
Many of your Lordships have generously, and I think justifiably, acknowledged the success of my noble friend in carrying out that task. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, as I saw it, did not question the rightness of what the Government are seeking to achieve, but they did question the timing of this legislation. They spoke sincerely of the danger they foresaw of precipitating a breakdown of the present conference by appearing in this respect and in others to exert undue, unfair pressure on one or other of the parties to it.<lb/>
As my noble friend has already said in his opening speech, the Government fully recognise the inconvenience to the House of the procedures adopted for this Bill, but it would not have been possible to introduce it before the Government had tabled their full proposals for the interim period in the conference on 2nd November and had received the first reactions of the parties to them. Before that it would not have been possible. Had we done so, we should most certainly have been accused of trying to exert unfair pressure. But thereafter there really was not a reason for further delay.<lb/>
The conference has been in session now for nine weeks. Considerable progress has been made. Indeed, I would say great progress has been made, compared with what happened before. The issues remaining for decision have been identified and the need now is to clear the decks for decision and for action. We may very soon need the powers which the Bill will grant and which we do not at present have. The Bill in no way pre-empts or
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0600"/>
<col>1183</col>
prejudges decisions to be reached in the conference. As we have explained and as my noble friend has explained to the delegations, its purpose is to permit us to implement those decisions with all possible speed when the moment comes. Now that there is agreement on full majority rule and, we hope, an imminent return to legality in Rhodesia, there is no reason why the people of Rhodesia should wait any longer than is unavoidably necessary for the opportunity to decide their future in free and fair elections.<lb/>
The amendment to the Bill proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, is, I find, a somewhat curious proposition. It regrets the failure of the Government to continue in force Section 2 of the 1965 Act "during the transitional period". I do not understand why noble Lords opposite regret this fact. Do they suggest that the indirect sanctions orders made under Section 2 should remain in force throughout the transitional period? If they do, we have been applying sanctions against ourselves. This would seem to me to be patently absurd, for once a governor had arrived we should in effect be applying sanctions against whom? We should be applying sanctions against a legal part of Her Majesty's dominions. If the suggestion is that the Government should keep in force Section 2 rather than introduce this enabling Bill, then the noble Lords have, I would say with respect, missed the point of the Bill. It is precisely because the 1965 Act does not give sufficient powers&#x2014;powers to make an independence constitution and hold elections, since these were never envisaged in 1965&#x2014;that the Government have needed and have therefore introduced this Bill.<lb/>
A number of noble Lords, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, have asked whether the Government will appoint a governor even if there is no agreement between all the parties on the cease-fire. May I interject here that my impression of this debate is that if the conference continues to go on as it has gone on hitherto but with more speed&#x2014;and I shall come to that in a moment&#x2014;then noble Lords on both sides of the House will be delighted.<lb/>
The whole thrust of the speeches made by noble Lords in opposition was, what would happen if the conference did not
<col>1184</col>
succeed? This caused the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, to ask whether a governor would still be appointed&#x2014;this was the direct question he asked me&#x2014;if there was no agreement on a cease-fire among all parties. We all agree that that is what we seek. Of course this is what we want to have. We have been striving for it and we hope to get it. We think that Rhodesia deserves it and needs it, and we think that we have been perfectly and scrupulously fair in what we have offered. We hope that it will be possible to make further progress tomorrow. But agreement will never be reached if we allow any single party to any negotiations to have what is effectively a veto. Any noble Lords who have had dealings in negotiations must and do realise this.<lb/>
Here I would ask noble Lords to consider who can best judge this. Oh, yes, we can make speeches; we can talk to the people who arc involved in the negotiations; we can have our own views. But these are not easy negotiations. There is this country and there are the three other parties. The situation is very difficult. As for the guy who is running and handling them, either you have confidence in the way in which the negotiations are being handled or you do not. Certainly suggestions can be put to him and he, I know, welcomes them as much as anybody. However, the time has to come in any negotiations when you think that the right thing to do is to say, "We have had enough time to discuss this. Everybody knows where everybody else stands and the time has now come to reach a decision".<lb/>
If there is no agreement&#x2014;and I regret to have to come back to the noble Lord's point&#x2014;then the Government will have to make up their mind on how they are going to proceed. This is not what we have been counting on, and it is not what we are looking for. In doing so, however, we shall have regard to what has been achieved in the conference and to what we think&#x2014;if failure there is&#x2014;are the reasons for that failure. But it must surely have been clear from my noble friend's opening speech that the Government are determined to carry out their responsibilities to the people of Rhodesia. This we intend to do, and it is our earnest hope that we can do so with the agreement of all the parties to the conference.<lb/>
I turn next to the question of sanctions, which has been a subject of great concern
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0601"/>
<col>1185</col>
on all sides of the House. The purpose of sanctions, let it be remembered, was to bring an end to the state of illegality and to bring Rhodesia to genuine majority rule. Bishop Muzorewa's delegation has accepted the independence constitution which indisputably provides for genuine majority rule, as have the other parties to the conference, and also the appointment of a British governor, which would mean Rhodesia's return to legality. In these circumstances, the Government believe they would be unjustified in taking the positive step of renewing sanctions, in so far as they are applied under Section 2 of the 1965 Act.<lb/>
What are these sanctions? They are indirect sanctions. They are not sanctions against direct trade between this country and Rhodesia. They are sanctions against someone selling something out of this country through a third party, via a third country, which then gets transmitted on into Rhodesia. It was about, say, 20 per cent. of the trade; that was the order of it.<lb/>
If we envisaged a long delay of some months or even years before we made up our minds about the major aspect of sanctions, then I think that noble Lords who say that it is very dangerous to take off the indirect sanctions might have a point. Why? Because it takes quite a time to set up this indirect trade. It does not just happen from one day to the other. We hope that it will only be a very short time before the governor will go to Salisbury, Rhodesia and thus restore legality to Rhodesia. When that happens it will be the intention of the Government to take off all sanctions. So in fact what we are doing short of legality, as it were&#x2014;it is rather like the housemaid's baby; we have done it but it is only very small; and it is not going to be very effective, either, in the short period of time before we hope to have full legality and the removal of all sanctions. I believe this is a fair solution; one which does no violence to any of the principles which we uphold and I certainly could not accept that it shows partiality to any one party. After all, as my noble friend Lord Home pointed out, Bishop Muzorewa has agreed to all that successive British Governments, from that side of the House and from this, have asked them to do.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, asked what the Government
<col>1186</col>
would say on this subject at the United Nations. My Lords, the Government will point out that Britain continues to prohibit direct trade with Rhodesia and the transfer of funds to Rhodesia, for the moment, until we get back to legality. But the progress made at Lancaster House has been such that we can clearly now see a prospect. I pray that we may be proved right. We can clearly see a prospect within a very short time of a return to legality and when that has been achieved there will be no reason or authority for the continuance of sanctions.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Gridley, drew attention to the need to reassure Rhodesian public servants and former public servants about the future security of their pensions. Let me assure him that the Government accept that need: the constitution will contain measures to protect public service pension rights, but let me say again that the most effective way to guarantee these pensions is to bring Rhodesia to legal independence and to lift sanctions in circumstances which allow Rhodesia's economy to flourish. That is what we are aiming to achieve through the conference.<lb/>
Several noble Lords on the Opposition Benches have suggested that the transition period is inadequate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02309"><member>Lord PAGET of NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord goes on to that, will he permit me to ask him one question? Supposing that Mr. Mugabe were to win this election, what would be the position with regard to the pensions of the civil servants?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02310"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said, the British Government take whatever responsibilities they will need to take in this regard and they will look to the Rhodesian Government to take the responsibilities that the people who are elected should take.<lb/>
Several noble Lords have suggested that the period set aside for elections is inadequate. Frankly, we do not accept this. I understand the argument. There is a balance to be struck and certainly there must be adequate time for all to prepare for elections, to put their views to the people; but it is not as though the Patriotic Front leaders are unknown in Rhodesia. I can assure the noble Lord
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0602"/>
<col>1187</col>
Lord Hatch of Lusby, that the ban on the parties making up the Patriotic Front, upon which he specifically asked me a question, will be lifted in those circumstances. But the cease-fire will be extraordinarily vulnerable and difficult to maintain. And do not let us forget that it is the British Government who will be responsible for this and it will be a very fragile cease-fire: it will be fragile for days, let alone weeks, and let alone months. And supposing it bursts in our face, would it have been very clever to have given it so long a time that the cease-fire bursts and turns into chaos? It would not be a very pleasurable proposition. Of course, it is no fun having it in the rainy season, but "there is a tide in the affairs of man"&#x2014;and we are where we are. We cannot say, "We will stop now because it is the rainy season and We will pick it up again in three months' time". That would lose momentum. I hope the noble Lord was not saying that it had been planned to happen in the rainy season, because that was certainly not so. We must strike a balance here and I really do not think that we are wrong. It is a matter of judgment. There are arguments both ways and we think that we have hit it just about right.<lb/>
The nobe Lord, Lord Hatch, asked me about the position of Bishop Muzorewa and his colleagues during the election campaign. What matters in this situation is the exercise of power and the bishop has agreed that he and his Government will not exercise power during that period. Power will be exercised by the governor through the administration in Rhodesia and not by Ministers. This is a major concession. I think if it was put to either of our parties we would not like it very much, but he has conceded it and there is no reason to humiliate them by insisting that they divest themselves of their titles and everything else. It is the power that matters, and they are not going to have it, and it will be seen that they have not got it; and it is understood and they are prepared to face up to this. and they are prepared to face up to this. The cease-fire remains to be discussed at a later stage of this conference&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02311"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may we get this absolutely straight? Is the noble Lord saying that the Ministers
<col>1188</col>
who have resigned will keep their ministerial houses, their ministerial cars, and all the appurtenances of their offices?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02312"><member>Loau SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think a lot of Ministers keep their cars&#x2014;do they not?&#x2014;during elections until they have been beaten. I cannot answer that. What matters here is whether they exercise the power or they do not. Whether they are living in one house or another, or driving one car or another, I do not regard as a major issue in the election.<lb/>
As I have said, the cease-fire remains to be discussed at a later stage and I do not want to anticipate the discussions here. It is very dangerous and I think it is frightfully important that we do not try to transfer the Lancaster House arguments into this Chamber. What we want to do here is to discuss this Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tranmire, suggested that the Government were too easily discarding the elections held in Rhodesia last April. I can assure the noble Lord that this is not so. The Government have never concealed their view of the importance of those elections, but none the less we are convinced that further elections at which all parties can take part are an essential step in implementing the new constitution. That is what we should like to see. This was the commitment undertaken at the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government at Lusaka in August, and this is what we are trying to get agreed at Lancaster House.<lb/>
In conclusion I should like to say this. Several noble Lords opposite drew attention to the dangers they could foresee if Rhodesia returned to legality and subsequently became legally independent in a situation where the Patriotic Front were continuing the present war. It is not for me to say whether they were right to pose that, but in my submission they were wrong in implying, if they did wish to imply it, that this consideration must give the leaders of any party a right to delay the settlement indefinitely. The Government are still seeking a comprehensive settlement and believe that such a settlement is possible, but the time for decision cannot be put off much longer, Much is at stake&#x2014;the prospect of an end to the war, the exercise by the people of Rhodesia of the right to genuine majority rule. We look forward also
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0603"/>
<col>1189</col>
to wiping out the bitterness which has distorted Anglo-Rhodesian relations for the past 14 years. The people of Rhodesia for their part are looking impatiently for a return to legal status in the comity of nations. For them and for their neighbours it can mean, if the will is there, a future of stability and of prosperity. The Government have no hesitation in asking this House to give them the powers which will enable the first steps&#x2014;and they are but the first steps&#x2014;to be taken into that future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02313">7.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02314"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord the Leader of the House has deplored the transfer of Lancaster House arguments to this Chamber, but, pray, whose fault is that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02315"><member>Lord SOAMES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise that I missed what the noble and learned Lord said. I was being complimented, as I always am.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02316"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not say whether the noble Lord deserves to be complimented or not. It was a speech which was delivered with more vigour than enlightenment. But let us not exchange discourtesies for a moment. When the noble Lord's attention was temporarily distracted by compliments I was venturing to deal with his complaint about the transfer of Lancaster House arguments to this Chamber. Whose fault is that? I think it is deplorable that in the middle of the most delicate and difficult negotiations this procedure has been necessary in Parliament for the reason that the Bill has been brought before Parliament. As my noble friends have said, it should have been brought forward at the end of negotiations and when, as we hope, a settlement has been accomplished. It would have gone through rapidly; there would have been no difficulty from this side of the House. We have sought to sustain the Government in their attempts at a settlement.<lb/>
What I am bound to say is that what we on this side of the House, certainly I, found most disturbing was the failure of the noble Lord to answer the question about what the Government will do if, alas, no agreement is arrived at and negotiations fail. They will in the mean-
<col>1190</col>
time, if the Bill goes through the House and through Parliament, have secured powers for the Government. Parliament is entitled to ask what, in that situation, the Government would do with those powers. Is there to be a simple handing over of authority to the Muzorewa r&#x00E9;gime? Is that what is proposed? These are problems which the noble Lord has sought to avoid answering by simply saying "Well, wait and see; we will see what to do when that time comes". I really do not think that is satisfactory, and I think this House and the other place should have been given an explanation.<lb/>
So far as the issue of sanctions is concerned, I hate to repeat again the much-discussed statement of the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary when he said on 7th November:
<quote>"sanctions will be taken off when the governor takes over in Salisbury, and he will take over when a cease-fire has been agreed".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7/11/79; col. 833.]</quote>
But the Government are taking off part of the sanctions now before the governor goes to Salisbury and before a cease-fire is agreed, and that the most symbolic part of those sanctions, the Section 2 sanctions. I am bound to say that, like the noble Lord, Lord Banks, and other noble Lords on this side of the House, we are not satisfied with the explanation which Ministers have given for not renewing the Section 2 sanctions. Indeed, on the contrary, we regard this as a fundamental mistake for the reasons which my noble friend Lord Goronwy-Roberts and other noble Lords have given, and a mistake which could have damaging effects on the prospect of a settlement and on our standing in the United Nations.<lb/>
What the noble Lord the Leader of the House did not answer is what procedural steps the Government are going to take at the United Nations. Are they going to go in sackcloth and ashes and explain that we are departing from the sanctions resolutions of the United Nations, or are they waiting upon events? That would be a very dangerous course to take, because those not well disposed to us could take the initiative. So I would like to know what steps are to be taken. We did not get the answer on that. It may well be that, if it is inconvenient for the noble Lord to answer now, we could,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0604"/>
<col>1191</col>
when we come to discussing some of the Amendments, revert to the matter, which is something we do need further guidance upon. In view of our dissatisfaction with the explanations that have been given, in particular about sanctions, I must on behalf of my noble friends and myself press my reasoned amendment.</membercontribution></p>

We have discussed the general principle during the debate on Second Reading and many noble Lords have taken part in the discussion.

Government should be given the broad, unconditional powers in the Bill, save in the context of an agreement and to carry through an agreed settlement.

As I understand it, this Bill has been introduced by the Government because they believe that agreement is in sight. It has also been clearly enunciated from the Government Benches this afternoon and in another place that the intention of introducing the Bill was to further the progress of the Lancaster House conference and to give the Government the power to bring into effect a new constitution. If that is the case, surely the Government themselves only want the power to bring into effect this Order-in-Council when agreement has been reached by all parties at the Lancaster House conference. If, for example, to take a hypothetical case, the Lancaster House conference had broken down last week, presumably this Bill would not have been introduced. So the Bill has been introduced on the supposition that agreement
<col>1196</col>
will be reached at the Lancaster House conference.<lb/>
Therefore, I suggest that in the light of their own logic the Government should accept Amendment No. 1 and avoid the suspicion that the powers&#x2014;and the powers in this Bill are very wide indeed&#x2014;which the Government are asking Parliament to grant them, could be used for any other purpose than introducing a constitution which was agreed upon, and all the arrangements agreed upon, by all the parties at the Lancaster House conference. If the Government do not accept this amendment, they are at least implying that in certain circumstances they might use these powers without the agreement of all the parties represented at the constitutional conference.<lb/>
I suggest that that would be a bad influence on the progress of the conference itself, and so I call upon the Government to recognise that in putting down this amendment we are trying to help them at the Lancaster House conference, that we are trying to help all the parties at that conference, that we are trying to remove the suspicions which have already been voiced about the purpose of the Bill; and that by accepting it they will be moving a step forward towards agreement between all the parties represented at Lancaster House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02333"><member>Viscount CALDECOTE</member><membercontribution>: Before I speak to this amendment I must declare a business interest in Rhodesia. I strongly oppose the amendment: first, because it ties the Government's hands unnecessarily. All noble Lords will agree that the progress that has been made by my noble friend the Foreign Secretary has been outstanding. That is a powerful argument for giving the Government the maximum freedom of manoeuvre in these negotiations. Secondly, I oppose the amendment because, effectively, it would give the Patriotic Front a veto, and even the previous Foreign Secretary clearly stated that no one in these negotiations on Rhodesia should be given an effective veto.<lb/>
Of course, as many noble Lords have said, the Patriotic Front must be treated fairly and honourably. Equally, they must act reasonably themselves. Clearly, Bishop Muzorewa and his party have made far more concessions than the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0607"/>
<col>1197</col>
Patriotic Front. Therefore, I can think of nothing more likely to encourage the Patriotic Front to hold out for unreasonable, one-sided conditions in the subsequent negotiations than the passing of this amendment. So I strongly oppose it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02334"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The effect of this amendment would be to make it impossible for the Government to make provision for an independence constitution for Zimbabwe, except with the consent of all the parties represented at the constitutional conference at Lancaster House. I believe that this would be an extraordinary provision to incorporate in a statute, and it would be wrong for the Government to accept this amendment.<lb/>
As I hope I made clear in my opening speech on the Second Reading debate, all the Government's efforts since 3rd May have been devoted to seeking an agreement on Rhodesia in which all the parties can participate. That has been the purpose of the extensive consultations which the Government undertook in the early summer. That was our aim at the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government; that has been our purpose over nine, nearly 10 weeks of negotiation at Lancaster House. I have also explained the very considerable progress that has been made towards achieving that goal. But the fact is that we have now reached a point where further progress can be made only if the Patriotic Front will face up to the need for a decision.<lb/>
The proposals for the independence period which the Government have put forward are a fair compromise between the opening positions of the two sides, and in our judgment, and that of many of our friends and allies, would allow both sides to take part in elections on an equal footing. They provide a genuine opportunity to settle the competition for power fairly and by peaceful means. As soon as the Patriotic Front can accept them, as Bishop Muzorewa's Government has done, the negotiations can move on to a cease-fire; but without agreement on the basic political issues we cannot take this step.<lb/>
The Government have gone to great lengths to ensure that the Patriotic Front fully understand our proposals, and to provide them with clarification on certain points. Indeed, officials of my depart-
<col>1198</col>
ment have been meeting the whole of this afternoon with the Patriotic Front to go over possible points of misunderstanding yet again. However, there comes a moment when decisions can no longer be delayed, and I am bound to tell the Committee that in my opinion&#x2014;and I have informed the leaders of the Patriotic Front of this&#x2014;the moment is now with us.<lb/>
I have listened to some of the speeches from noble Lords opposite about patience&#x2014;a few more days, a few more weeks, and a few more months; but there is a difference between patience and indecision, and there is a difference between patience and procrastination, both of them conceivably and very possibly leading to the real danger of a collapse of what we have achieved so far. There are two parties to these negotiations. If the Government were to accept the amendments proposed by the Opposition, the effect would be to grant one party or the other a veto over the outcome of these negotiations, as my noble friend behind me has said. I can imagine nothing less likely to help progress at Lancaster House than to put a provision of that kind in this Bill. If I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, if it were the Salisbury delegation who were delaying things by their lack of progress I doubt whether we should have heard the same speeches from him this afternoon and this evening.</membercontribution></p>

If I may also say so&#x2014;and I should be happy to be corrected&#x2014;I have heard nobody on the opposite side of the Committee who has acknowledged the concessions and compromises and the very difficult decisions that the Salisbury delegation have taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02337"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to the noble Lord. His accusation is totally without foundation. I have worked with, been friendly with, and associated with members of all races, of all parties in Rhodesia, Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and now Zimbabwe. I do not take sides between the Patriotic Front and the Muzorewa party. I do not take sides between the Patriotic Front and the present r&#x00E9;gime in Salisbury, because, as I understand it, the present r&#x00E9;gime in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0608"/>
<col>1199</col>
Salisbury is an illegal r&#x00E9;gime; it is in revolt against the Crown, and at least a section of it has been responsible for the disasters which we have seen in Rhodesia over the past 14 years.</membercontribution></p>

I was saying that I did not think that it was right that any party should have a veto over what happened. The Government cannot accept that in the last resort, when every effort has been made to find a settlement to which all the parties can subscribe, the gains of all of those weeks of negotiations should be lost because one side is unwilling to put its support to the test in elections held under our auspices. The Government will do all</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02347">I assume that what is referred to is the constitution as summarised in the Command Paper.

Perhaps the noble Lord will give the Committee his guidance on that suggestion. I beg to move.</p>

amendment is to require the Government to make the constitution described in Command Paper No. 7758, and no other&#x2014;and that is important. The conference at Lancaster House has reached agreement on the independence constitution which will for the first time ensure genuine majority rule in Rhodesia. This is a very considerable achievement which no other Government have been able to attain, and we are grateful to both the other parties in the negotiations for the willingness to compromise which they have shown.<lb/>
I can assure the Committee that this is the constitution that the Government intend in due course to make for Rhodesia, and no other. There is no need therefore to amend the Bill as the noble and learned Lord proposes. Indeed, it would be inappropriate to do so because the text in Command Paper No. 7758 is the summary of the constitution as agreed at the conference. The full text, in proper legal language, is being prepared and will be brought forward in due course. Therefore I hope that in the light of this explanation the noble and learned Lord will not press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02352"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member> moved Amendment No. 3:</p>

<quote>("Provided that no recommendation shall be made to Her Majesty in Council to make such an Order until a cease-fire has been agreed.")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02354">The noble Lord said: Our object in moving this amendment is, if we can, to elicit from the Government what importance they ascribe to obtaining a cease-fire before they move to make recommendations to Her Majesty in Council to make an Order on any particular. Do the Government include a cease-fire in the final package agreement that they seek in Lancaster House? They are moving now, I understand, to dealing in particular with the very difficult and extremely important question of a cease-
<col>1204</col>
fire. But will the agreement to be announced be inclusive of an agreement on a cease-fire? We ascribe very considerable importance to this point for obvious reasons, and I will not reiterate the arguments that were so ably put on Second Reading. But do the Government, for instance, envisage any situation in which they may move for an order for any purpose without having obtained agreement on a cease-fire? I should hardly think so myself, but perhaps the noble Lord will explain how the Government see this, and I hope that he will find it possible to accept the amendment. I should not think it would in any way impair the validity of the Government's policy or technique if in fact the amendment were included, thus firmly making a cease-fire&#x2014;which, after all, is essential to any kind of developing action in Rhodesia&#x2014;integral and, in the terms of the Bill, beyond any doubt a part of the final agreement emanating from Lancaster House. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02355"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: I believe that the amendment may be subject to the same kind of criticism as Amendment No. 1; namely, that if accepted, it would give a veto to one of the parties at the Lancaster House conference. May I answer that point as it applies both to the cease-fire and the necessity for a general agreement. If two or more parties are negotiating with an object of reaching an agreement, any party has a veto; inevitably it must have a veto. If any part says, "No", that is a veto, a veto to agreement.<lb/>
What we are trying to suggest, and what we are still urging upon the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary, is that the object of the conference should be, must be, to obtain agreement between the Rhodesian parties concerned, and that it is his responsibility to try to achieve what I referred to this afternoon as the highest common denominator between those parties. I do not understand why the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary, and indeed other noble Lords, have made this point about the veto. Inevitably, the Foreign Secretary is trying to get the Patriotic Front to come to agreement, but not, surely, agreement with the British Government rather, agreement with the other parties to the dispute in Rhodesia. Nor do I understand the comment made by the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0611"/>
<col>1205</col>
his last intervention about the transitional period&#x2014;and this amendment refers to the transitional provision. I cannot understand how his period of two months is a halfway point between two original positions. The Patriotic Front has been asking for a minimum of six months. What is two months the middle of?<lb/>
Finally, may I point out that this amendment really repeats a great deal of what the noble Lord said in his Statement last week&#x2014;a Statement which I warmly applaud: that the governor will not be sent out until a cease-fire has been agreed Once a cease-fire has been agreed, then in the circumstances of the debate we are happy about the rest of the clause. But it is the cease-fire, and only the cease-fire, the end of at least the present, and one hopes the final, stage of this war, which must bring this conference to an end and allow the Government to take the powers which have been laid down in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02356"><member>Lord WEDDERBURN of CHARLTON</member><membercontribution>: I have listened to most of the Second Reading debate and what comes through to me is the importance of the Committee stage. It looks as though the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary may be intending to resist the Amendment. I hope that he will not&#x2014;but it looks as though he is going to. That means that the Government arc going to commit themselves to the prospect of acting without a cease-fire. The noble Lord the Foreign Secretary cannot blame noble Lords on this side for stating that obvious point&#x2014;that by resisting this Amendment they have to go on record as being in that position. It was the unwisdom of bringing forward this very Bill which has impaled the Government upon the amendments moved in Committee&#x2014;amendments which noble Lords on this side have been bound to move. I still hope that the noble Lord will not resist the amendment, but if he does, he will put himself in a position&#x2014;because of the Government's own Bill&#x2014;of having to make a pronouncement which he might have wished not to make in order to retain a better position in the negotiations themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02357"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, in his delightful way has of course skated over the fact that the effect of the amendment will be
<col>1206</col>
almost exactly the same as the effect of the first amendment which we discussed earlier. I need hardly say that it is the Government's desire to reach agreement on a cease-fire before making the arrangements for the interim Government of Rhodesia which have been described to your Lordships; that goes without saying. But if the amendment is accepted it will make it impossible for the Government to make any provision for, or in connection with, the Government of Southern Rhodesia before the territory proceeds to independence unless there is an agreement on a cease-fire.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships&#x2014;and I was reminded of this point by my noble friend Lord Duncan-Sandys earlier&#x2014;that there have been occasions in constitutional conferences when there has not been agreement; for example, in Kenya, in relation to the Kenyan constitutional agreement, and the constitutional conference on Malta never came to an agreement. Those countries are now independent.<lb/>
One has to have regard, I think, to the consequences of what one does before one accepts an amendment of this kind; but the result in this case, of course, as in the case of the previous amendment, would be to give any of the parties to the present war an effective veto over the implementation of what has so far been achieved. The Government cannot accept that this would be right. If there is a failure to agree on a cease-fire, then the Government will have to decide what action is to be taken in the light of where we consider the responsibility for that failure lies; but your Lordships would surely not wish to put the Government in a position in which they could do nothing without the consent of one side or the other in the war.<lb/>
Any party which decides to continue the war after agreement has been reached on a democratic constitution, and after the Government have reached agreement with one delegation at the conference on the arrangements for returning Rhodesia to legality, will surely, in everybody's view, bear a heavy responsibility; but to go on to give that party the power to prevent the Government taking any further steps really would be intolerable, and I would ask the noble Lord not to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02362">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02363">9.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02364"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member> moved Amendment No. 4:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02365">Page 1, line 16, at end insert&#x2014;
<quote>("Provided that such transitional provision shall include provision for elections and that a party of members of all parties in the House of Commons shall observe those elections").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02366">The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment and also could be described as a very well-intentioned suggestion&#x2014;two, in fact. We agree with the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary in what he said during the Second Reading debate that all parties in Rhodesia&#x2014;and by "parties" I mean all elements, including the Patriotic Front&#x2014;should be not only encouraged but indeed required to take part in the democratic process. The object of this suggested form of words, to be added to line 16 on page 1 of the Bill, is to make clear in the statute that the transitional provision most certainly includes the provision for elections. We all know that it does, but it is a point of importance that will not suffer from repetition, particularly in Africa.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02367">The second point of suggestion (which I equally hope the Minister who will reply
<col>1210</col>
will be glad to accept) is that these elections could well be observed by&#x2014;I hesitate to use the term "official"&#x2014;an all-Party delegation, properly serviced, which could be sent from the House of Commons, as the elected body, to Rhodesia to observe the conduct of these elections. It may well be that some Members will think that if such an official party were selected and sent then it might well be drawn&#x2014;not in equal proportions perhaps&#x2014;from both Houses of Parliament. I would not violently object to further amendment to this amendment on those lines.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02368">In any case, we think that to add these words and this provision to the clause would do two things. First, it would emphasise the importance of the democratic process, the electoral process, as part of the transitional provision&#x2014;hopefully encouraging such a provision to be continued during independence, which is not always the case in all parts of the world. Secondly, in regard to this election their observance should be placed on a more formal and official basis than has happened in the past. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02369"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord explained, this amendment falls into two parts. It was agreed at Lusaka
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0614"/>
<col>1211</col>
that elections were an essential step in implementing the new constitution. As members of the Committee will know, the Government's main concern in the interim period is to create conditions for free and fair elections, and we have made detailed proposals for them. A distinguished British official will be appointed as election commissioner and will have a substantial staff to help him supervise every aspect of the electoral process. There is provision for elections in the first three lines of Clause 2(1) of the Bill. In the Government's view, it would be a mistake to link elections to the transitional provisions, as suggested in the amendment, since they take effect only at the moment when the constitution comes into force. Elections should be held well before then, and the Government must have the powers to organise them. For that reason provision is made in Clause 2.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02370">Regarding the second part of the amendment, it will be open to any Member of either House who wishes to do so to observe the elections. No provision for this is necessary in the Bill. If there is a strong desire to set up an all-party parliamentary group to observe the elections, this can be discussed through the usual channels. But there is no need to make statutory provision: nor is it obvious why the members of such a group should be drawn only from another place. The noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-Roberts, referred to that in his speech; but the amendment we are considering refers only to the House of Commons, and I believe the Members of your Lordships' House may well wish to participate. I hope, having given these reasons, that the noble Lord will not press the amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02371"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: I can hardly press this amendment after that extremely helpful speech by the Mimister. I think enough has been said, and no more will be said, to emphasise that we regard the democratic electoral process as very much an integral part of the transition period and of the period following that transition. In view of what the noble Lord has said, I will not press the amendment, and I beg leave to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02372">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<col>1212</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02373">9.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02374"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member> moved Amendment No. 5:
<quote>Page 1, line 17, leave out from ("section") to end of line 18 and insert ("shall be subject to the approval of each House of Parliament").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02375">The noble and learned Lord said: I beg to move this amendment. The relevant part of the clause, as your Lordships will see, concerns subsection (3):
<quote>"Any Order-in-Council under this section shall be laid before Parliament after being made".</quote>
There is no provision in that subsection for any resolution being necessary, and once the order is made it becomes effective and that is the end of the matter. The explanation that Ministers have given of the distinction between that and the other subsections (2) and (3) is that this relates to the constitution and an Act of Parliament will be necessary to introduce and set up the constitution, and that the content of an agreed constitution is not amendable. That I follow; but your Lordships will see that subsection (2) provides that:
<quote>"Her Majesty may by Order in Council revoke the Constitution of Southern Rhodesia 1961, and may make such transitional provision as appears to Her Majesty to be necessary or expedient in connection with the coming into effect of the new constitution or the revocation of the said Constitution of 1961".</quote>
It seemed to us that transitional provisions do not come into the same category as the provision for the new constitution itself. Do they come into effect only after a new constitution has been put into a Bill and that Bill has been approved by Parliament? In respect of those transitional provisions and in view of their potential importance, I wonder why there is no provision in relation to them for the orders to require affirmation by Parliament at the very least as in Clauses 2 and 3.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02376"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: I think it will be for your Lordships' convenience if I speak to Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 at this moment. The arguments that I shall deploy are broadly in line, and I think that the arguments the noble and learned Lord would want to make are also broadly in line on those three Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02377"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: I have no objection.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0615"/>
<col>1213</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02378"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: If I may say then, procedurally I shall answer this amendment and we shall dispose of it and then the noble and learned Lord will decide what to do with the subsequent amendments, but not speak to them. Subsection (3) of Clause 1 provides that the constitution order is to be laid before Parliament after being made. There is thus no provision for parliamentary control over the order. This subsection follows normal practice. It has not been the practice, either of this Government or of previous Governments, to make an order granting an independence constitution subject either to the Affirmative Resolution procedure or the Negative Resolution procedure.<lb/>
For example, no such parliamentary control was provided for in the Cyprus Act, in the Seychelles Act, in the Kiribati Act or in respect of constitutions granted under the Prerogative or made under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts. The reason for this is clear. When the main elements of the constitution have been agreed at a constitutional conference, these elements are often the result of the most delicate negotiations. This is certainly the case in the present instance. There could be no question of Parliament subsequently changing the elements agreed at the conference, without putting at risk the agreement which has been so painstakingly achieved.<lb/>
In any event, the present debate and subsequent consideration by Parliament of the independence Bill, which the Government expect to lay before the House, provide ample opportunity for noble Lords to state their views. As your Lordships will know, the Government have tabled a White Paper containing a summary of the independence constitution as agreed at Lancaster House. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will agree that you have been properly informed, and I accordingly ask the noble and learned Lord not to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02379"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: I wonder if the noble Lord can tell me whether, in regard to the other constitutions which he has mentioned, there were equivalent&#x2014;not the same, of course&#x2014;or similar transitional provisions. I am not aware of any, but his knowledge may be better than my memory.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1214</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02380"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: I am not able to respond to that point at this moment, but I am not sure that it is exactly relevant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02381"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: I thought that the noble Lord was calling precedents in aid. It is a good legal technique; I have done it myself from time to time. It is the bread and butter of the legal profession. I thought that the noble Lord was showing a remarkable skill and now he resiles from it. He had better forget that part of his argument, I think.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02389"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member> moved Amendment No. 8:
<quote>Page 2, line 9, leave out ("with or without modifications").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02390">The noble Lord said: My purpose in moving this amendment is to endeavour to get further clarification of the words "with or without modifications". To what extent do the Government anticipate, if at all, bringing the constitution into force with modifications? Is it a question of bringing some parts of it into force&#x2014;is that the modification envisaged here&#x2014;or do they anticipate looking at the constitution when the time comes, and changing in some degree the provisions of what is an agreed constitution which certainly, in summary, deserves to be agreed to? It is a short point. Are the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0616"/>
<col>1215</col>
Government in a position to give us some idea of what modifications they think may be necessary? Would they be considerable or would they be minor? If minor, then this is inevitable. But if considerable, then we would need to discuss the matter further, would we not? I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02391"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I think, if I may say so, that this is a perfectly reasonable question and amendment, and I hope I can answer it without getting the boot put in, as the noble and learned Lord so elegantly put it. The steps leading to independence are normally taken under a constitution previously granted by the United Kingdom for internal self-government. That is not possible in the case of Rhodesia. The 1961 constitution has been set aside. It is therefore necessary to introduce parts of the independence constitution before independence, so that the elections can be held for a parliament and government to be formed under the provisions of that constitution. I can assure the Committee, and the noble Lord opposite, that the Government have no intention to use the power to modify those parts of the constitution which are implemented before independence in any sweeping way. But the fact of the matter is that, in certain important respects, the proposals which the Government have made for the pre-independence period will require some departure from what will subsequently be the normal constitutional practice.<lb/>
For instance, it is envisaged that the first elections before independence will be conducted on a party list rather than a constituency basis, and that it will not be possible to conduct a full registration of voters. Both these points will require a temporary&#x2014;and I emphasise the word "temporary"&#x2014;amendment to the provisions of the constitution. Similarly, in the pre-independence period any reference to the "president", in those parts of the constitution which are introduced, will in the interim period need to be modified to read "governor". In each case the relevant modifications will be made by Order in Council which will be subject to the Affirmative Resolution procedure. The Government therefore see no need for this amendment. I hope I have satisfied the noble Lord, Lord Goronwy-
<col>1216</col>
Roberts, that the Government have no evil intention in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02392"><member>Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: I am sure that the Government have no unusually evil intentions. I am sure, too, that the noble Lord would not only wish the constitution to be applied in the most effective way possible but would need to be able to apply certain parts before others. He would also need to be able to vary not only nomenclature in the case of the governor and the president but also, perhaps, electoral processes&#x2014;the substitution of the list system for one election in preference to the constituency system. I am most grateful to the noble Lord for having explained the Government's intentions in this matter, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

Your Lordships will observe that this clause gives power to bring particular provisions of the new constitution into force before the appointed day. It is clear that these are steps of some importance because subsection (3) provides expressly for Affirmative Resolution. However, it is an Affirmative Resolution procedure which has the result that on the laying of the order the order becomes effective, remains effective for a period of 28 days and then expires unless during that period it is approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02398">There is another more stringent form of Affirmative Resolution procedure which requires the Order in Council to be approved before it takes effect. That has been used recently as a procedure under the new Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 and, curiously, under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. We feel that these are important provisions and that Parliament should have a greater

opportunity to keep an eye on them&#x2014;indeed, to keep control over them. This is why we move the fuller parliamentary procedure which is provided for in the amendment. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02399"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: As my noble friend explained earlier this afternoon, and as my other noble friend Lord Soames repeated in his winding up of the Second Reading debate, the purpose of the Bill is to allow the Government to implement an agreement quickly. The constitution itself has been agreed by the parties to the constitutional conference and will not itself be subject to parliamentary procedure. It would therefore be quite disproportionate to insist that orders to bring parts of it into effect for the purpose of holding elections should be subject to prior parliamentary approval.<lb/>
If the concern of the noble and learned Lord is with the circumstances under which parts of the constitution may be introduced, then there will be an opportunity for Parliament to express views on the Orders in Council introducing parts of the constitution which will be subject to Affirmative Resolution. But the need to introduce parts of the constitution will arise as the situation in Rhodesia develops and the Government must be able to act quickly and effectively. For this reason I hope that the Committee will disagree with the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02400">On Question, amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02401">Clause 2 agreed to.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02404"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member>moved Amendment No. 10:
<quote>Page 2, line 31, leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02405">The noble and learned Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 10, and with that it is convenient to discuss Amendment No. 11. Clause 3 provides that Her Majesty may by Order in Council&#x2014;and then I will mention (<i>a</i>) because it may arise later, but not too late:
<quote>"Her Majesty may by Order in Council&#x2014;

<quote>(i) in consequence of any unconstitutional action taken therein;".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02406">I should like a little elucidation of what is intended to be covered there. As I understand from a speech made by one of the noble Lords today, what seemed to be contemplated was obviously the desirability of granting immunity to Ministers or persons in Rhodesia who might, because of any unconstitutional action, be imperilled by attending a conference. If that is all that is its purpose, then of course it is something that is necessary. Or is it intended to cover an attempted grant of general immunity for all matters, alleged offences or other, conducted during the period of the rebellion? I imagine not, but it is a matter about which I should be grateful for elucidation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02407">Then Amendment No. 11 proposes to leave out lines 37 to 39, that is the last sub-paragraph (<i>b</i>)(ii): The provision in connection with the repeal, revocation, expiration or lapse of any statutory provision relating to sanctions. I take it that when earlier your Lordships were informed that at any rate power could be given to revive, so to speak, Section 2 of the 1965 Act that was the power which would enable that to be done. I am not sure whether that is so or not but perhaps we might get a little help about that. I beg to move Amendment No. 10.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02408"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I think that Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15 really all have the same object, which is to require the Government to maintain sanctions either by adding UN sanctions orders made under Section 2 of the 1965 Act, the orders to be saved and continued, or by deleting references to powers to deal with the consequences of the expiry of sanctions. I wonder whether, with your Lordships' permission, because we have, so to speak, gone round this buoy a number of times already this afternoon, I might make an answer in advance of anything that might be said on Amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 which I hope, if it does not satisfy noble Lords opposite, will at least serve as an answer.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1219</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02409"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: I am quite content that that should be done. I was not absolutely sure what the full purpose of Clause 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii) was, but it is inter-related and I accept therefore that it is convenient to consider that along with the matters raised in Amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02410"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: If I may make a general statement which I hope will satisfy the noble and learned Lord, the Government's decision on sanctions and the renewal of Section 2 of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 was set out in my Statement in the House on 7th November. The Government considered their decision against the background of the changes which have taken place in Rhodesia in recent months and of the progress which has been made at the constitutional conference.<lb/>
In Rhodesia itself there is an African Prime Minister and a Parliament representing the African majority in the country. Bishop Muzorewa and most of his colleagues were not involved in the illegal declaration of independence. At the constitutional conference they have agreed on a constitution which is internationally accepted as providing for genuine majority rule. They have also accepted the appointment of a British governor, which will mean in effect the end of the rebellion in Rhodesia which led the United Nations to impose sanctions at our request in the first place.<lb/>
In this situation the Government could see no justification for taking the positive step of renewing Section 2. Indeed to have done so would, in our judgment, have been a slap in the face to Bishop Muzorewa and his delegation, and I cannot believe that many Members of your Lordships' House would really wish to justify such a decision in the light of the dramatic change which has taken place in the circumstances which led to the imposition of sanctions in 1965.<lb/>
But, as I emphasised in my Statement of 7th November, the great majority of sanctions&#x2014;that is those which cover direct trade and financial transfers&#x2014;will remain in force until there has been a return to legality in Rhodesia. This will come about when a British governor arrives in Salisbury and his authority is accepted. The Government will take the
<col>1220</col>
action necessary to lift all sanctions and will expect other governments to do so, too. Indeed it would be patently absurd to do otherwise, since we would in effect be applying sanctions against ourselves. This would be the effect of the proposed Amendment No. 13.<lb/>
To deal with all possible contingencies the Government will have the power under Clause 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(i) to reimpose all sanctions should events justify such action, although, as I have told your Lordships, the Government find it hard to envisage circumstances arising in which this power would be needed. The amendments proposed by the Opposition would mean that the full vigour of sanctions would continue to be imposed even though Bishop Muzorewa had accepted all that had been asked of him and the conditions for an end to the rebellion had been agreed, and the Government do not believe that such an action is justified.<lb/>
Clause 3(1)(<i>b</i>) is the power which enables us to reintroduce sanctions. Clause 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii) deals with indemnity or amnesty or consequences of ending sanctions. There is no intention whatever of using the clause on immunity for other than the purpose that I have described, which is to allow those who have been taking part in this conference to escape the penalties of a private action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02411"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: I am very gratified with that assurance. It was indeed implied, if not expressly stated, earlier in the speech of the noble Lord, but I just wanted it clearly on the record. The noble Lord has brought that into discussion, but of course we shall not reach it for the purpose of the amendments being proposed until after the noble Lord, Lord Gridley, has moved his Amendment No. 12.<lb/>
However, the general issue of sanctions has, in many ways dominated a great deal of our debate today and we have traversed the ground pretty thoroughly. I noticed that in another place the Lord Privy Seal said on 8th November at column 666 that the Heads of Government at Lusaka,
<quote>"accepted that it must be a major objective to bring about a cessation of hostilities and an end to sanctions as part of the process of implementation of a lasting settlement",</quote>
That implies, as we have thought to be the case, that sanctions should only cease
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0619"/>
<col>1221</col>
to operate on the cessation of hostilities and as part of a lasting settlement. Now it is being done as a preliminary step and with total frankness the Foreign Secretary has said that it is being done as a gesture to Bishop Muzorewa. I have already expressed the view that that is not evenhanded treatment of the parties to the conference.<lb/>
However, we have covered this ground very fully. Indeed, in a sense, we divided on it when I moved the amendment to the Motion for Second Reading. Therefore, I do not propose to burden the Committee, because repetition will not add strength to what has been said before. However, we are satisfied that the decision on Section 2 is unfortunate and may well prove to be ill-fated. Accordingly, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 10.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02412">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02413">[<i>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02414">9.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02415"><member>Lord GRIDLEY</member> moved Amendment No. 12:
<quote>Page 2, line 39, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("(<i>c</i>) make such provision in relation to the pension rights of the public servants and former public servants of Southern Rhodesia and their dependants, as appears to Her necessary to ensure that those rights will be no less favourable than the rights enjoyed by pensioners under the Overseas Pensions Act 1973").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02416">The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 12 which concerns page 2, line 39 of the Bill. I move this amendment because Clause 3 envisages that certain things may be done to secure the government of Rhodesia during the period up to independence. My amendment refers to the pension rights of the public servants of Southern Rhodesia and asks that as regards their pension rights under the Bill&#x2014;which is a Bill to bring into force an independent constitution for Zimbabwe&#x2014;there should be an Order in Council ensuring that those rights are no less favourable than the rights enjoyed by pensioners under the Overseas Pensions Act 1973.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02417">I wish to stress to my noble friends in the Government and on the Front Bench that the amendment does not require that the existing pension laws in Zimbabwe should be taken on board by the Overseas Pensions Act 1973. It suggests that the
<col>1222</col>
Rhodesian pension laws should be amended to bring them into line so that they are in a no less favourable position than those under the Overseas Pensions Act 1973.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02418">In addition, I emphasise that under the amendment there is no obligation at all on Her Majesty's Government to under-write or guarantee the viability of Rhodesian pensions. No guarantee is necessary at all. The payment of such pensions would be&#x2014;and it is correct that they should be&#x2014;the responsibility of the Zimbabwe Government under their own pension laws. The Overseas Pensions Act is to be a yardstick as regards what should be done in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02419">There are a number of reasons why the Rhodesian State Services Pension Act should be amended during the intervening period if the new independent Government, when in office, are to get off to the best possible start. If it were possible for someone with a dispassionate mind or for someone from the overseas pensions department or from the Ministry of Overseas Development&#x2014;a person expert in overseas pension matters&#x2014;to go to Rhodesia and examine the position, that would be of benefit not only to pensioners themselves but to the new Rhodesian Government, which we want to see get off to the best possible start.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02420">Under the existing Rhodesian Services Pensions Act there are many anomalies. When that Act was conceived I would suggest that in Rhodesia there was the intention that it should apply to persons retiring in that colony. Anomalies arise which affect pensionable emoluments. For example, there is no provision at all when a man receives a pension or when he might be Africanised, which will obviously have to be faced in the future, for him to obtain transfer expenses or passage expenses to the country of his new occupation. There are other anomalies in the Rhodesian Pensions Act which do not apply to other colonial officers, although I accept that in this case the Rhodesian public service is a service on its own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02421">The position is that during the tenure of office of a serving Rhodesian officer, he is required to buy a house for occupation; whereas the normal position of a serving colonial officer in an overseas territory was that he paid a nominal
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0620"/>
<col>1223</col>
sum for the quarters in which he lived. When a Rhodesian public officer is Africanised in the circumstances which I have depicted, he might well be left with a property on his hands and find difficulty in selling it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02422">All these anomalies have a bearing on the situation and on the financial position of a serving officer when he retires. Those are only some of the worries that affect the Rhodesian public servant today. I submit that it is essential that these worries should be removed, particularly at the present time. The purpose of this Bill for a new constitution for Rhodesia is to give security and stability, together with independence, to the new Government. But I stress that the success of the new Government will very markedly depend on support from an experienced, contented and efficient public service. I stress that that also applies to the future economy of that country, which is envisaged in the constitution which the Government now wish to bring to Rhodesia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02423">I can give other examples of anxieties which have to be ironed out at this time. Now is the time when a governor will probably be appointed to Rhodesia. There are terms for the abolition of office, and the preservation of the value of pensions in an inflationary age, and so on. I assure noble Lords in the House that this anxiety exists among black and white Africans with whom I have had discussions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02424">There is another issue which affects pensions. At the time of the 3rd March 1978 internal agreement in Rhodesia, inducements were offered to public servants to remain in the service for a minimum period of one year to ensure a state of tranquillity in the transfer of power to the incoming government of Bishop Muzorewa. It is expected, because the anomalies which I have illustrated to your Lordships exist, that it is very possible that many public servants, including those in the security forces, will take advantage of the position which exists and leave at a time when, under the constitution in this Bill, Her Majesty's Government must hope, and must be concerned, that they will remain to provide stability to the incoming government. If the war continued, and men of
<col>1224</col>
the security forces were to leave, what would happen to Zimbabwe and this new constitution? Would it not be the end? Might not South Africa be drawn into an escalating war?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02425">I fully appreciate that guarantees regarding the pensions of public servants have been written into the constitution by Her Majesty's Government, but they do not cover the anomalies in the present Rhodesian pensions legislation. All I seek in my amendment is to assist the Government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia&#x2014;and ourselves&#x2014;in their present difficulties regarding pensions. I would ask that Her Majesty's Government would sympathetically consider sending somebody out to Rhodesia as soon as the governor of that country is appointed, and that under the instruction of the governor the Public Services Commission and the Public Services Association should go carefully into the question of existing Rhodesian pensions and bring them into line with modern conditions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02426">For 14 years Rhodesian public servants and most people in Rhodesia have been ostracised. They have been entirely out of touch with what has been going on in the outside world. They need all the assistance we can give them at the present time. I respectfully suggest that it is of vital importance for the success of this constitution that what I have said should be acted upon and that the pensions situation be brought up to date. What is happening under the present consitution before this House is, I appreciate, a guarantee of pensions under the constitution, but in modern conditions I do not think that a guarantee of these pensions meets the case of the present situation. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02428"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: Very briefly from this side of the House, without introducing any acerbity into this discussion and debate, I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Gridley. He is well known in this House for the work he has done over a number of years in support of public servants' pensions. I myself had experience in the other place on Committees of the anomalies that existed as the old colonies were disappearing. I hope that we can get a constructive answer, whereby we shall be acknowledg-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0621"/>
<col>1225</col>
ing to those people who have been public servants over the years in Rhodesia their due and their rights, which I think this country should grant to them. I hope we can have some declaration that is a little further than that in Cmnd. 7758, which I have carefully read.<lb/>
My name was down for a number of amendments today, but I accept the clarity of diction of my noble and learned friend here, the ex-Lord Chancellor, and he said that repetition does not increase anybody's case. I certainly agree with that. I sincerely hope that we shall get a definitive and positive answer that some constructive action will be taken over the pensions of these people who have served sometimes a little in the darkness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02429"><member>Lord DAVIES of PENRHYS</member><membercontribution>: In my view the noble Lords, Lord Gridley and Lord Davies of Leek, have missed the boat; we are talking not about pensions but about Africa. We have to solve that problem first, and until that is done the question of pensions and so on does not arise. What we want to do today is get the right settlement, and when that is right we will have pensions and everything else right, and that must be our first task. We must get the African people to support us. We must get our independent States and the Commonwealth with us and until that is achieved pensions will be forgotten. It is all very well talking about pensions and the like, but the atmosphere must be correct first. I talked about this sort of thing in the pits 20 years ago, but it did not happen because we did not have the right climate. The pensions issue can be got right in Rhodesia only if we get a proper settlement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02430"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: I fully accept the modest effects which my noble friend Lord Gridley intends of the amendment, but I am not sure that the modest effects which he intended are in fact the effects which will flow from the amendment if we were to agree to it.<lb/>
The Overseas Pensions Act 1973, which is referred to in the amendment and if we were to accept it, would impose considerable burdens on Her Majesty's Government. We well understand the need to reassure Rhodesian public servants about their pensions rights. For this reason the independence constitution
<col>1226</col>
which has now been agreed at Lancaster House contains provisions, amendable only by a 70 per cent. majority, specifically preserving public service pension rights. Moreover, a provision in the Declaration of Rights, entrenched for 10 years, equates pension rights in general with other property rights protected against arbitrary deprivation. I believe those provisions amount to a substantial guarantee of public service pension rights under the constitution.<lb/>
As I have said, the British Government cannot undertake to underwrite the Zimbabwe Government's public service pensions liability. They could not impose such a large contingent liability on the British taxpayer, especially at a time when we are making strenuous efforts to control increases in public expenditure. We have made it clear to the Salisbury delegation that there is no prospect of a change in the British Government's policy of refusing to contemplate underwriting the pensions liability of the Zimbabwe Government.<lb/>
If there is a satisfactory outcome to the constitutional conference, the apprehensions in the public service which my noble friend encountered in his recent visit to Rhodesia, and which he described earlier in our debate this afternoon, could be largely allayed by the time the present incentive scheme for public servants expires next April. It is likely that a constitutional settlement and the lifting of sanctions will lead to a large inflow of commercial investment into Rhodesia and there will be prospects of economic aid as well.<lb/>
My noble friend specifically asked whether an official experienced and knowledgeable in pension matters could go to Rhodesia to advise the managers of the pension fund there. I cannot give a commitment that that will be so, but I do give a commitment that that matter will be looked into and I will write to my noble friend with the answer of our consideration. I hope that with those assurances my noble friend will feel free to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02431"><member>Lord GRIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Trefgarne for saying that they will consider sending a pensions expert out to Rhodesia. That meets very much the case which is in

my mind. I hope that by doing so it will be a constructive act to make the position happier in Rhodesia for the public servants, who I know from experience, are the most loyal people and who have given a pledge of their loyalty to any Government who may be elected after the elections. I wish to express my thanks to my noble friend and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

Perhaps I should have been less ready to accept not putting Amendment No. 11 to a decision of the Committee. However, I beg to move Amendment No. 13, which has already been discussed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02436"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: It is a pity that the Foreign Secretary has already replied to this because there were certain questions that I asked in my speech on Second Reading this afternoon which were not answered and I have to make implications in relation to those answers now. I do so in this way. I asked directly whether the Government will use the powers in the Bill in order to re-enact Section 2 of the 1965 Act, which applies to sanctions. I was not given an asnwer, but I believe that I am right in saying&#x2014;and I trust that he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary has answered that and that the Government do not intend to re-enact the sanctions under Section 2. Where does that leave us? It leaves us with a Government who have declared that they will lift sanctions when there is a return to legality, and who at the same time are saying, "We are lifting sanctions now." I think that this is a dilemma; it is a contradiction which will be seen perhaps much more importantly in the rest of the world than in this country.<lb/>
<col>1228</col>
It may be that the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary can tell us that this applies to only 20 per cent. of sanctions. It does now. But that 20 per cent. can very easily be increased. Unless I am wrong, the section to which I have referred allows British companies to supply Rhodesia through their subsidiaries. We know that this figure can be increased. But, above all, and much more importantly, may I remind the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary of the very solemn words issued by his noble and learned friend the present Lord Chancellor in the debate on sanctions last year on the binding responsibility of our international obligations. I believe that unless we agree to this amendment, this country stands condemned of having broken its international agreements, having indeed broken its own word by lifting sanctions before Rhodesia has returned to legality.<lb/>
The noble Lord accused me of partiality, and asked me to read <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow. Unless I am mistaken&#x2014;and if I am, I apologise to him&#x2014;I do not think that he was here during my speech. I certainly did not suggest that the lifting of sanctions was an act of partiality. My case was that it was an act which made it much more difficult to reach agreement at the Lancaster House Conference. This is not a question of partiality, but it is a question of national honour and of the integrity of this country&#x2014;in having taken our case to the United Nations in the first place, and having used a newly-independent country such as Zambia, only 13 months old, as a front liner on sanctions, now unilaterally lifting sanctions because it suits the domestic needs of the Conservative Party. I believe that that is a shameful act.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02462"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member>: The High Commission in Georgetown were asked immediately about the circumstances of Father Darke's death. They reported that the Guyanese police were treating the case as one of murder, and were investigating: charges have since been laid. It

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02471">Why, in view of the statement by Ministers that they are aware of the limitations on estimates of age by doctors and the use of X-rays, and that such evidence is used as supporting evidence only, the Entry Clearance Officer, Dacca, lodged an appeal in the case of Nazir Ullah (TH/18115/77 (1278)) giving as grounds of appeal that</p>
<col>1236</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02472">"the adjudicator erred in not placing sufficient weight on the medical evidence".</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02473"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member>: In the case to which the noble Lord refers there were discrepancies between the physical characteristics of the applicant as recorded in medical reports for age assessments made on his own behalf, and in the report made on behalf of the British High Commission. Those discrepancies created doubts as to the applicant's true identity. In upholding the appeal against refusal of entry clearance the adjudicator commented that he did not do so without having some doubts in either direction. In all the circumstances of the case it seemed reasonable to seek a review of the matter by the Tribunal.</p>

<col>1237</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02479"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES and FOOD (Earl Ferrers)</member>: The noble Lord no doubt has in mind the International Undertaking on World Food Security, the main aim of which was to encourage signatories to set stock targets or objectives for cereals in order to promote world food security. Although it has not set itself any formal targets the European Community pursues a cereals stock policy commensurate not only with the needs of the internal market but also with likely export requirements, including food aid obligations. This year the Community has increased its stocks of wheat from a normal level in years past of 4&#x00B7;5 million tonnes to around 7&#x00B7;5 million tonnes.</p>

<title>STRYCHNINE SALES AND PEST CONTROL</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02480"><member>Lord HOUGHTON of SOWERBY</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02481">Whether they will now ban altogether the sale of strychnine for pest control in view of the availability of less cruel alternatives and the misuse of this poison for unlawful purposes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02482"><member>Earl FERRERS</member>: Strychnine may not be retailed in Great Britain except for mole control&#x2014;for which in most cases it is the sole viable method not posing a threat for non-target species&#x2014;and to persons specifically authorised for the purpose by the agricultural departments. Those using the substance against any other species expose themselves to prosecution under the relevant legislation, and the maximum penalties which apply have lately been increased. In Northern Ireland, where strychnine may only be used for fox control, there are equivalent provisions. The Government are satisfied that further restriction would not be justified.</p>

<title>FARM AND HORTICULTURAL GRANT AND DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02483"><member>Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02484">How much time normally passes between application for grant and Ministry of Agriculture approval to
<col>1238</col>
start work on (i) the Farm Capital Grant Scheme, and (ii) the Farm and Horticultural Development Scheme; what types and number of checks have to take place before such approval; and what purpose is achieved by each of these checks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02485"><member>Earl FERRERS</member>: In both the Farm Capital Grant Scheme and the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme there are some items for which prior approval of applications is required and some for which it is not. In the latter case the applicant can begin when he wishes. Grant under the Farm and Horticultural Development Scheme is however payable only on items which form part of an approved development plan. In respect of work for which prior approval is required, under both schemes the applicant may, once he has made an application, ask for urgent work authority, which enables him to start work on his investment without prejudice to the subsequent decision on payment of grant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02486">Every case is different and the time taken to consider an application can depend on whether it contains all the information required as well as on the size and complexity of the investment and its general character. On average most applications are approved or rejected within two months of receipt. When an applicant applies for urgent work authority this is generally given within seven days of application.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02487">Before prior approval is given to applications for grant under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme, checks are made to establish that the farm is equipped with buildings and capable of yielding a sufficient livelihood (except in the case of certain land improvements); that the investment is of a capital nature and for the purposes of an agricultural business; that the work proposed is technically suitable for its purpose and of reasonable cost; and that any implications for conservation or amenity are taken into account.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02488">Under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme the EEC Directive (72/159) requires further tests to be applied. The applicant must be experienced in and mainly dependent upon agriculture. The farm business must yield an average labour income lower than the average nonagricultural income (the "comparable
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0628"/>
<col>1239</col>
income"); and there must be a development plan calculated to increase farm labour income to at least the "comparable income" over a period of up to six years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02489">The purpose of the checks in all cases is to ensure that public money is properly spent in accordance with the statutory requirements and the rules of the schemes.</p>

<title>FLUORIDATION OF WATER AND THE EEC</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02490"><member>Lord O'HAGAN</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02491">How many Member States of the EEC add fluoride to the public water supply; how far fluoridation is (a) compulsory and (b) universal in each Member State; and how far British officials responsible for this question have consulted their counterparts in each Member State.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02492"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member>: Two Member States, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, at present add fluoride to the water supply to reduce the prevalence of dental decay. Fluoridation is compulsory in the Republic of Ireland where, I understand, most of the population served by piped water supplies now receives fluoridated water. British officials concerned with fluoridation have consulted, as necessary, officials in other EEC Member States, but the Community has not, as yet, made a concerted approach to this issue. Professional contacts are regularly maintained through the European Regional Committee of the World Health Organisation.</p>

<title>IMMIGRATION: EQUALITY</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02515">2.40p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02516"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of my noble friend Lady Seear, I beg leave to ask the first Question which stands in her name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02517">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02518">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will give an assurance that they will not retreat from their commitment to full equality before the law for all citizens including women, and that they will embody in the new Nationality Bill the right of all British women to reside in Britain with their non-EEC spouses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02519"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are not retreating from the general spirit of that commitment but it was also made plain in the Conservative Party's Manifesto that there would be changes in the law governing the entry of husbands and male fianc&#x00E9;s. This inevitably means some difference in treatment as regards the right of a woman to be joined here by her husband or fianc&#x00E9;. We believe that this is justified to prevent abuse of the present system by men using marriage as a means of immigration to this country. These are matters for the Immigration Rules, and we shall not wait for our Nationality Bill to implement our proposals on them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02520"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we can deal with the Immigration Rules in a moment; but does the noble Lord recall that in paragraph 50 of the previous Government's Green Paper on British nationality law there were four options set out on the acquisition of citizenship by virtue of marriage to a person who was himself or herself a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and that all these four options were nondiscriminatory in regard to the two sexes? Are the Government in their forthcoming proposals intending to confine themselves within the limits of one or other of these four options, or to introduce some new proposal which will in itself be discriminatory?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0631"/>
<col>1245</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02521"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are not responsible for the previous Government's Green Paper. I seem to remember, however, that the previous Government felt that it was right&#x2014;indeed, necessary&#x2014;only two years ago, in 1977, to take a hard look at the question of arranged marriages, and to do something about them. In fact the rules, if I remember rightly, were changed. As regards the line which my right honourable friend will be taking, I shall be making a Statement to your Lordships' House, if the House will agree, at a convenient moment after half-past three.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02522"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, have the Government received any representations from any other Governments saying that they may well refuse the rights of British men who marry their female citizens? Also, have any other countries applied or are they expected to apply, reciprocal treatment to our citizens?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02523"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of any representations of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02524"><member>Lord DAVIES of LEEK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware what would have happened to the Royal Family through the centuries if this medieval concept of this Tory Government had been put into effect?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02525"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware that previous Royal Families have indulged in arranged marriages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02526"><member>The Lord Bishop of SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming the Government's statement of their commitment to the equality of all British citizens before the law, may I ask that the sensitivities of the Asian community in this country are not bruised by any suggestions that arranged marriages are necessarily to be presumed to be marriages of convenience?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02527"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I unhesitatingly give the right reverend Prelate an assurance to that effect. It is no part of the intention of Her Majesty's Government to discourage the traditional practice of the arranged marriage. But we are fully entitled, we believe, to take steps to prevent further primary immigration through marriages which are arranged for this purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1246</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02528"><member>Lord INGLEWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, referring to the question from the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, will my noble friend confirm that His Majesty King George I never did succeed in getting his wife into this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02529"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I am quick I can reply just before my former tutor at university, who was introduced into your Lordships' House today, takes his seat, and say that honestly I cannot answer that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02530"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I asked the Minister a similar question last week as to whether he could produce evidence of the abuse, he said this was a fair point and he proposed to deal with it, as I understand it, in the White Paper. Has he not again in his first Answer referred to the exploitation of the present system? So far as I can see, however, we have had no evidence of what this abuse is and how far it has gone. Is the noble Lord going to produce this evidence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02531"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a fair point and I thought I gave a fair answer. Indeed, pressed by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I then wearied your Lordships with specific statistics. I do not think the House would want me to do that again. I think I should say to the noble Baroness on this occasion that the statistics for husbands coming into the country have shown a very marked increase since the concession which was made by the noble Baroness's Government after, I know, very mature thought and considerable hesitation in 1974. Similarly, the numbers of male fianc&#x00E9;s coming into this country have also shown a very marked increase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02532"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that his former tutor has a lot to answer for if he taught him that the Royal Family have not entered into arranged marriages in the past, or that indeed it was not the custom for persons of Royal blood to enter into marriage with persons they had never seen? Can the noble Lord separate in his mind for a moment the concept of immigration from that of citizenship and address himself to the question of how a person acquires citizenship by virtue of a marriage to a person who is a citizen of the United Kingdom? Does he recall that the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0632"/>
<col>1247</col>
Green Paper, whether or not the present Government are committed to it, contained four non-discriminatory options with regard to the acquisition of citizenship by marriage to a British citizen? Will he answer my original question: Do the Government therefore in their forthcoming proposals on nationality, which are not going to be dealt with in the Statement after 3.30, intend to adhere to the principle of non-discrimination?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02533"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what would be needed to reply to the noble Lord's question is a nationality Act and I do not think there is anything between the two sides of your Lordships' House that this is desirable; but I am afraid we have not got to the moment when we are able to introduce such legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CITIZENSHIP: BRITISH WOMEN</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02534">2.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02535"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the second Question which stands in the name of my noble friend Lady Seear on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02536">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02537">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will assure the House that they will not create two classes of citizenship for British women by allowing British women born in Britain to live with their non-EEC spouses whilst insisting that those British women who happen by chance to be born overseas must live abroad if they marry a non-EEC man.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02538"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today published a White Paper on our proposals for revision of the Immigration Rules, and I shall be repeating his Statement to your Lordships later this afternoon. Under these proposals a husband or fianc&#x00E9; will not be allowed to settle in the United Kingdom if the primary purpose of the marriage is to obtain admission to this country or if one of the parties does not intend that the couple should live together permanently as man and wife or if the parties
<col>1248</col>
have not met. In other cases the man will have no claim to settle here but may be allowed to do so if the woman is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
We have not, however, overlooked the fact that girls will have been born abroad because their parents happened to be out of the country (for example, on Crown service or on business) at the time of their birth. It is my right honourable friend's intention to consider such cases sympathetically outside the rules.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02539"><member>Baroness WOOTTON of ABINGER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask by what authority the Home Secretary can consider cases outside the rules and, if he can, what is the purpose of having rules?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02540"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for precisely the reason to which I admit I have only alluded at the end of my reply to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#x2014;because it may be that girls may have been born outside the United Kingdom but in circumstances in which I think any fair-minded person would feel that such girls would fall within the rules as they are being made. I have mentioned that parents might have had to be abroad on Crown service or on business, and it also occurs to me that they might have been abroad as missionaries or in certain other guises. It is such cases that my right honourable friend would be looking at sympathetically.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02541"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I understood the noble Lord correctly, he is repeating a Statement made by his right honourable friend the Home Secretary, at a convenient time after 3.30. Might it therefore be for the convenience of the House if we dealt with these matters comprehensively in the course of dealing with that Statement later on?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02542"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: I would have thought so, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02543"><member>The Earl of SELKIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do I understand the noble Lord correctly, that anyone who goes through a form of legal marriage without the slightest intention of pursuing it will in future not receive a passport?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02544"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. We are, of course, talking in the context
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0633"/>
<col>1249</col>
of marriage to girls who are not born in the United Kingdom; otherwise what the noble Earl has said is correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02545"><member>The Lord Bishop of SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord if he would give an undertaking that in the Government's forthcoming changes in Immigration Rules and nationality law no provision will be made regarding British subjects born overseas which in fact amounts to a distinction between white women and those who are coloured?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02546"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when your Lordships will allow me to make the Statement, I think the right reverend Prelate will find that in that way the new rules are not racially discriminatory. Girls of any race, colour or creed born in this country will, under the rules which my right honourable friend is putting to the House in the form of a White Paper, have the same rights.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02547"><member>The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Lord Soames)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to suggest that, in view of the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, with which I think we all agree, perhaps further questions should wait until the Statement is made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02549"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02550">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02551">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have made any protest to Bishop Muzorewa's r&#x00E9;gime about the invasion of Zambia and the attack on the Tanzam railway.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02552"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary answered a similar Question from the noble Lord yesterday and I have nothing to add to the reply he gave then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02553"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that, while his noble friend the Foreign Secretary may
<col>1250</col>
have answered a similar Question yesterday, he did not answer this Question yesterday? This Question refers to a separate and quite different incident. Would he agree that this incident of an attack on a bridge on the Tanzam railway, many hundreds of miles from where any guerrillas could have been, is an act of international aggression perpetrated by a r&#x00E9;gime for which the present Government claim to be responsible, against a friendly Commonwealth country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02554"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's supplementary contains a number of assertions with which I would disagree, but I would remind the noble Lord and the House that a war is going on in that part of the world. We certainly deplore that fact. Noble Lords will recall that when the conference began at Lancaster House some 10 weeks ago we invited all the parties to that war to enter into a cease-fire. The bishop's parties in Salisbury agreed to that ceasefire but the other parties did not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02555"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I to understand the noble Lord properly? Is he saying that, because there is at this moment the war between the forces of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and people from Zimbabwe-Rhodesia who are in fact trying to overthrow the Government of the country of which they were members&#x2014;in other words, the forces of Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe&#x2014;it is right for the forces from Zimbabwe-Rhodesia to take action such as the bombing of the Tanzam railway, which in fact invites retaliation from the Zambian forces? Is that what the noble Lord is suggesting?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02556"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course we deeply regret that the war continues, but I can only repeat that we invited all the parties to enter into a cease-fire at the beginning of the conference. The Muzorewa party did agree to a cease-fire but the Patriotic Front did not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02557"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry; the noble Lord is not answering the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02558"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend not agree that, while these very delicate and important negotiations are going on, the less these
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0634"/>
<col>1251</col>
matters are brought up (which we on certain sides of the House consider as irritations), the more smoothly the conference might go?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02559"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I could not agree to condemn the actions of one side only. We regret all the military operations that are occurring in the war in that part of the world, and I can only say yet again, for the third time, that we have invited all the parties to enter into a cease-fire. If only they would.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02560"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has not answered my question, because what I am asking him is: is he aware that the bombing of the Tanzam railway invites retaliation from the forces of Zambia, and therefore, in fact, could cause an escalation and an enlargement of the war?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02561"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, of course, my Lords. All military operations invite retaliation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02562"><member>Lord DERWENT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the pursuit of this question really help matters at this particular moment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02563"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: Not particularly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02564"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must ask the noble Lord to answer my original Question. This has nothing to do with the Lancaster House Conference. This is an attack on a friendly Commonwealth country which is our friend, and which has been trying to assist the British Government in their mediations. Is this the attitude which the present Government take to the Commonwealth: that they will allow and excuse an attack from another country on a friendly Commonwealth country, and call it nothing more than an incident?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02565"><member>Lord TREFGARNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that the noble Lord can have listened to what I said. Yes, of course, we regret that the Rhodesian authorities mounted this attack into Zambia, but we also regret the attacks mounted from Zambia into Rhodesia.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02570"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the announcement by my noble friend the Foreign Secretary on 18th July of the Government's decision to take a further 10,000 Indo-Chinese refugees from Hong Kong indicated that the timetable of admission would be agreed with the governor, and fixed no particular period. In view of the situation in Hong Kong, the Government are anxious to admit these refugees as quickly as possible. The total received in October was well over 1,000. The future rate of intake will, however, be largely determined by the speed with which the refugees can be resettled in permanent accommodation. The machinery for handling the reception and resettlement of these refugees has recently been strengthened by the formation of the Joint Committee for Refugees from Vietnam, to which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has appointed Sir Arthur Peterson as chair- man.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02571"><member>Lord SHEPHERD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very appreciative of the full reply which the noble Lord has just given. May I ask the noble Lord whether his department, in particular, will consider with sympathy the suggestions which I believe are being made by the Hong Kong Government; that the officials who are looking into the credit of the refugees who wish to come to the United Kingdom should be strengthened, and should be able to remain in Hong Kong for longer periods than they have during 1979? Secondly, recognising that many of the refugees have very little knowledge of the United Kingdom&#x2014;in the main, it is knowledge of the United States that they have&#x2014;is there not a case, in order to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0635"/>
<col>1253</col>
fulfil our commitment to the colony of Hong Kong, for some form of counselling and advisory service to be set up to inform the Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong of the possibilities and the openings in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02572"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. I am most grateful to the noble Lord. I think that his second question in particular is something which officials in the Government, especially in my right honourable friend's department, would want to look at very carefully. May I just say in reply to the noble Lord's first question that, as I think he will be aware, the selection is carried out by officials of the Home Office and the British Council for Aid to Refugees, and they have indeed recently returned from their third visit to Hong Kong. I think it is fair for me just to say that arrivals here have at no time been limited by a lack of refugees already selected, and we do not think there is at present a need to maintain a permanent selection team in Hong Kong. But, in the light of the noble Lord's question, we will certainly keep this matter under very close review. As I said, so far as the second question is concerned, I think the noble Lord will forgive me if I say that I should like to take it away and draw my right honourable friend's attention to it and, if need be, write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02580">3.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02581"><member>Lord WINSTANLEY</member> rose to call attention to the increasing inability of the National Health Service to meet the needs of patients, and to the necessity for the more efficient use of existing resources and the improvement of industrial relations within the service, and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. As noble Lords are aware, this is one of those rare occasions&#x2014;some, though by no means all, might say too rare occasions&#x2014;on which the privilege of selecting the topic for debate in your Lordships' House is bestowed upon noble Lords sitting on the Liberal Benches. I hope that in focusing attention on the National Health Service and its present problems and inadequacies, we are not merely pursuing a long-standing interest and preoccupation of our own, which dates back to the National Insurance Act 1911&#x2014;a Liberal measure. This gave birth to the beginnings of the National Health Service, with the old panel doctor and so on for insured persons, though, unhappily, not for the dependants of insured persons; a measure taken further by a notable document, the Beveridge Report, whose author was a distinguished Liberal
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0636"/>
<col>1255</col>
Member of your Lordships' House. I hope that we are also serving the interests of this House as a whole.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02582">We have among us noble Lords and Baronesses with immense knowledge and experience of this subject, whose collective wisdom, at a time when Government must be devoting their thoughts to the National Health Service, should surely not be allowed to go to waste. And, after all, whether we are experts or not, we are all patients or potential patients. In discussing these matters before the Government make up their mind about the report of the Royal Commission and other pressing matters, it is surely appropriate that your Lordships' House should have an opportunity to make the kind of constructive contribution to the formulative stage of policy-making of which we all know it is so very capable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02583">I must begin by saying at once that I, as a doctor with more than 30 years of experience working in the National Health Service, and as spokesman for my Party on this subject, have brought with me no magic instantaneous cure, no revolutionary therapeutic measure which, at a stroke, could shorten waiting lists for in-patient or for out-patient hospital treatment; empty GPs' waiting rooms or reduce their visiting lists: conjure up skilled and necessary workers, not just doctors and nurses, but speech therapists, chiropodists and many others of the same kind who, in some areas, are conspicuous at the moment by their absence; halt the closure of pharmacies, which is now proceeding at a rate of something like nine per week and causing immense inconvenience to many patients in many areas; bring back to our shores some of those anaesthetists, radiologists and other consultants whose disciplines do not require linguistic ability, but who have left our shores to work for higher remunerations in the EEC; provide a dental service in districts where none now exists; make kidney transplants readily available to all who need them; restore the situation when GPs had time not only to talk to their patients but to listen to them as well; or, indeed, restore a sense of harmony, commitment and partnership between all those different groups who work within the National Health Service, and a commitment to the needs of patients
<col>1256</col>
rather than, perhaps, to their own needs as individual groups working in the service. No, my Lords; neither I nor anyone else has a magic wand with which to do any of those things. Things are not like that. All we can do is to accept that all problems do not necessarily have solutions, but we must look for those solutions none the less.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02584">Having looked at the long list of distinguished speakers in today's debate, I am sure that suggestions will be made from all parts of your Lordships' House from which a Government that is willing to listen and able to learn could derive much benefit and assistance. In that connection, I must say that fate appears to have exercised a nice discrimination in timing by striking down with ill-health certain noble Lords on these Benches who were to have supported me. Furthermore, the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington, who is so experienced in hospital matters and administration, has been summoned to grass roots to deal with a crisis and will not be able to be here to support me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02585">Let us consider some basic facts. First, we must all get rid of the notion that we in this country spend an unusually large percentage of our resources on health. We do not. If we examine the facts critically, as I am sure many noble Lords have done, we find that in fact we spend on health less per head of our population than many other of our European partners and, indeed, many nations beyond the Iron Curtain and in other parts of the world. I should like this country to spend a great deal more on health but I must reluctantly accept that at the moment it is unlikely that we shall. Also I have to accept that there are other functions which are desperately in need of money&#x2014;matters like housing, education, food&#x2014;which are relevant to the health of our community. So we have to accept that at the moment the amount which can be spent on health is necessarily limited.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02586">We must also accept that we shall never be able to spend enough money to do everything for everybody. The cost of modern methods of treatment, diagnosis and investigation in one way or another is now so large that if every single thing which could conceivably be of benefit to the patient was at once to be made readily available to every man, woman
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0637"/>
<col>1257</col>
and child, the Health Service&#x2014;and, indeed, almost everything else&#x2014;would come grinding to a halt. Let me give your Lordships a tiny example; namely, the immense progress which has been made in recent years in the transplantation of human organs and human tissue. Immense strides have properly been made in heart transplants, liver transplants and so on and they must be commended, but if we were to accept that any man, woman or child who could conceivably benefit from a human organ transplant must immediately have a right to that human organ transplant, then we should realise that we just could not cope.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02587">Next we must accept that the workload, already large, is growing and that it will grow further. On 5th July 1948 when our National Health Service originally began, I think many people were under certain delusions; namely, that if we removed the financial barrier which existed at that time between the patient and his doctor, somehow or other ill health would be banished from the face of the earth and the need for doctors and resources in health would diminish steadily and remorselessly as we made the service available. Regrettably and unhappily, the reverse is the case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02588">We have to accept that our very success has added and still is adding to the total workload. Every time we learn to treat a disease which formerly was not treatable, so we increase the total workload. Every time we prolong the life of a person who formerly would no longer be with us but who continues to live and who now requires regular treatment, regular care and maintenance therapy of one kind and another, we increase the workload. In our country there are today thousands, indeed millions of people alive who in past years would have been no burden to anybody at all. They are alive and they are consuming resources; and they are requiring increasing resources. That is a fact with which we must all grapple. The workload is growing and it will continue to grow.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02589">There seems also to be some kind of melancholy law of medical science that as we get rid of old diseases like diphtheria and the old nutritional diseases&#x2014;and we have got rid of a great many, to our very great credit: to the credit of the professions and also to the credit of those who
<col>1258</col>
have been responsible for hygiene, sanitation, better housing and things of that kind&#x2014;so it appears that new diseases arise to take their place. Let us think, if we can call them diseases, of the immense burden caused by accidents on the road, in the home, and at work and also of the growth of cancer and cardiovascular disease which in part may be related to the way in which we now live&#x2014;to our modern life style. We have to accept that the workload will grow and that it is continuing to grow and that the more successful we are in medicine the more that load will grow. So the problem facing us is how to cope with an increasing volume of work when resources are finite and limited and when those resources are going to grow only at a minimal rate in the immediately foreseeable future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02590">First, we must look at legitimate ways to reduce the workload&#x2014;not by stopping doing necessary things but by seeking ways by which we could possibly reduce the total burden of ill health and the total burden at the moment bearing down upon our resources. Next, surely, we must look very carefully at ways of using those resources which we have very much more efficiently and very much more effectively than we now do.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02591">In trying to answer those two immense questions, what can I do? In a short debate I can merely try to drop one or two pebbles in the pond, if I may so describe this august House, in the hope of producing a few ripples. There are minor aspects of this subject. One could talk about the whole problem of coping with, dealing with and caring for the psychiatric-geriatric patient. That would be a day's debate, yet it is a tiny part of the whole subject; so I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I generalise and merely make a few pointers which I hope will promote and provoke observations from other speakers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02592">Let me deal with the question of reducing the workload. First, surely we must direct more and more of our attention to the environment in which we live&#x2014;the environment at work, at home, on the roads, the air we breathe and so on. I do not think I need to elaborate on that. I am quite sure that many noble Lords are aware of small things which can be done with our environment that would very rapidly indeed reduce the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0638"/>
<col>1259</col>
total volume of ill health and of illness in the community in which we live. Let me take as a tiny example something to do with our environment. Surely in the long run it is going to be very much more profitable to dissuade people from smoking rather than to set up more and more complex and expensive thoracic units in different parts of the country. That would be a simple and short way to cut down the workload and reduce the overall burden.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02593">Next we must look more closely at the question of health education. As a doctor speaking about health education, I do not mean cultivating somehow or another a new generation of amateur doctors&#x2014;the kind of people who used to walk into my surgery every day to blind me with science out of the <i>Readers' Digest.</i> I do not mean that for a moment. I mean cultivating a greater understanding among our people of what health really is and how to achieve and maintain it. I mean, also, cultivating a greater understanding of those conditions and symptoms which require attention and the work provided by highly trained people, by resources which are in very short supply, and those which in point of fact can be left to get better on their own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02594">I used to get a little tired of the sort of patient who came to me at the end of a long surgery and said: Isn't it awful, all these people here wasting your time?". He was never the one who was wasting my time; it was all the other people. What I am endeavouring to say is that the vast number of people who come to doctors' surgeries come for reassurance; they come merely because they wish to know about this symptom, that symptom or the other symptom&#x2014;does it matter? Provided you can convince them that it does not matter, they can go away happily. They do not necessarily need treatment or further investigation, but it is a little unfortunate that the general practitioner finds it easier to give a patient a prescription rather than to explain to that patient that he does not really need a , prescription. I am sorry to labour that point, but it is a fact that if colleagues who are general practitioners could see their way to spend a little more time in explaining to patients that something will get better on its own and they should not
<col>1260</col>
worry about it, I think in the long term we should reap considerable rewards. Whereas in a minute and a half one can dish out a bottle of inert medicine or harmless pills, it might take half an hour to explain that the patient does not really need the medicine or the pills.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02595">Health education has to be started in the schools. There are many old dogs who can no longer learn new tricks&#x2014;I am not addressing my remarks to anybody in particular, but I think that if we were to start with the younger generation there is surely hope that in the future we may have people who, first, understand the way in which to recognise danger signals which indicate an immediate need for advice and perhaps further investigation and who can also understand that certain things may be safely left to get better on their own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02596">Of course, if we had a more sensible approach to the whole question of certification, not only from Government but perhaps from many firms who insist on a doctor's note being produced when a person has been off for two days with a bad cold, that might cut down some of the unnecessary work. I am merely saying that health education is extremely important, and I say most earnestly to the Government that they will not save money in the long run by saving money in the short run. It is possible that health education could be better done; greater use could be made of the media, not to teach people to be amateur doctors or to teach them about elaborate scientific techniques which are nothing to do with them, but to teach them to recognise that many things can be left to get better on their own so that skilled manpower can be devoted to things that really matter, and to recognise in fact that many things do not require the use either of the doctors or of the hospitals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02597">I will now move on to the whole question of preventive medicine. Immediately one mentions that people tend to give three loud cheers and to say, "That is the way to proceed". Certainly it is, but even in that field we must have some kind of study of cost effectiveness. We have to start thinking about the elaborate schemes into which we enter, such as cervical cytology schemes, cervical smears&#x2014;a campaign which I supported for many years&#x2014;and from time to time
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0639"/>
<col>1261</col>
we have to examine the way in which we are using the resources which are in extremely short supply, and assess whether or not we are getting a return for our investment in terms of real relief from human illness and suffering. So we have to look at them very carefully. Some things are obvious and have brought immediate benefits, like the immunisation programme for diphtheria. Before that was introduced we had some 80,000 cases a year of that very serious disease; within a matter of years the total number was down to single figures, and it remains down. That is the kind of preventive medicine which really brings immediate results.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02598">Perhaps I might not be straying from our rules of order (if we have any rules) if I say something to anticipate a debate which is to take place tomorrow, to be introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy. Let us take the matter of fluoridation of water supplies. I do not want to start that debate here and now: I merely say that in my honest opinion&#x2014;and I say this now so that your Lordships will not have to listen to me tomorrow on the same subject&#x2014;no public health measure has ever been so exhaustively studied and found so free of undesirable side effects or consequences, and demonstrated to be so capable of making a substantial contribution to the public health. If something of that kind can be done and can bring an immediate return in terms of an improvement in the public health, surely that is the way to bridge the present gap between work load and resources.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02599">We must even look at things which perhaps sound a little exotic, like genetic counselling. In many ways modern medicine has taken evolution by the scruff of the neck. No longer does the principle of the survival of the fittest endure. I am not saying that it should. We now make absolutely certain that the least fit not only survive&#x2014;as indeed they should&#x2014;but survive and reproduce and multiply; and again so they should. But we will disregard what we have learned about the transmission of genetically transmitted diseases at our peril. If we expand the kind of genetic counselling services which have come into being, then again we can do something to reduce the growing number of genetically transmitted diseases from which people in our country are suffering.</p>
<col>1262</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02600">Many minor matters contribute to this in a wholly innocent fashion. If we take societies like the British Diabetic Association&#x2014;a remarkable society doing wonderful work for diabetics&#x2014;the kind of disadvantage is that this kind of society, which works for people who suffer from a particular ailment, tends also to become a social gathering, so that the diabetic meets only people who are diabetics and it then happens (not surprisingly) that an increasing number of people suffering from diabetes marry diabetics, with the result that we slowly increase the total amount of diabetes within the community. That does not greatly matter, my Lords, because here we have a disease which can now be controlled, but controlled at a price. It would surely be better to give some thought to those procedures. I merely say that in passing. I repeat, we ignore what we have learned about genetically transmitted diseases at our peril. We are not doing enough to explain what we have learned to people and to advise them about it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02601">I wish now to say something briefly about making better use of our limited resources. The efficiency of the National Health Service depends on four factors: the number and quality of the people doing the work; the adequacy or otherwise of the premises within which they work&#x2014;such as the hospitals, the clinics, the doctors' surgeries, and so on; the tools with which they work&#x2014;the X-ray appliances, the kidney machines, surgical instruments, the drugs and medicines and, finally, the administration by which those other three are welded together and given to the patient. In each of those four areas there are deficiencies, but there is also waste and duplication. So far as the number and quality of the people doing the work are concerned, over and over again we come across examples of people duplicating other people's work. For example, we get duplication as between the school medical service and the family doctor; as between the occupational medical service and family doctors, and indeed hospital doctors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02602">In short, so far as people are concerned we are not really spending time on the things which bring the maximum return and we are often duplicating the work of others. Many of my colleagues in your Lordships' House who are doctors and who practice medicine, either in hospitals
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0640"/>
<col>1263</col>
or outside, if they pause and think I am sure they will tell us that they often spend time doing work which really could be done by somebody with much less expensive training and could be done in a very different way. We make nothing like enough use of ancillaries of one kind or another; nor do we make enough use of volunteers and of voluntary organisations, which are only too willing, ready and able, as they have demonstrated over and over again, to save the National Health Service enormous amounts of money by providing services themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02603">On premises, it is a waste of resources to persist with old and dilapidated buildings which consume resources and waste them. It is a waste of resources, as other noble Lords will explain, I am sure, to have in hospital at a very high daily cost people who frankly ought to be looked after outside hospital, at home or in ways which are very much less consumptive of resources which are in very short supply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02604">I move on to the tools with which we work. How many patients are referred regularly for unnecessary X-rays merely because it has been the habit to send the patient for X-rays, or merely because it is a wise precaution in case there should be some medico-legal inquiry crop up at a later stage and some learned counsel asks, "Did you not send the patient for an X-ray?"? People are sent daily to casualty departments for X-rays which nobody wants to look at, merely for the sake of some kind of medico-legal necessity which might possibly arise in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02605">What about drugs? I have no wish to see a nationalised drug industry. The nationalised pharmaceutical industry of the Soviet Union has produced no new therapeutic substance of any significance at all, whereas our own industry has produced an enormous number of new products which have revolutionised people's lives. But while we keep on producing new products, I do not see much enthusiasm for getting rid of old ones. Because doctors are conservative people and some doctors greatly object to anybody telling them what to prescribe or not to prescribe, it is now necessary for the average pharmacist to have on his shelves perhaps 80 or 90 different kinds
<col>1264</col>
of antihistamines, 40 or 50 different kinds of iron preparations, just in case some obstinate and conservative old general practitioner insists on going on prescribing them. All of us who work in this field in any way must be prepared to start doing something about variety reduction so far as the use of instruments are concerned and so far as drugs are concerned, and we must also be prepared to start doing something in the way of cost-effective studies with regard to what we are actually doing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02606">On administration I do not wish to say very much. A lot will be said in the course of this debate. I agree that we should phase out one tier. I am not sure that I would like to discuss which tier, but whichever tier is phased out I hope it will be recognised that there is a real need to establish and preserve some kind of health service unit which has substantial local involvement, local commitment, and is capable of generating local pride in the health services within a locality. Let us not move away from that, whatever else we do.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02607">On industrial relations I will say little. My noble friend Lord Rochester will deal with that aspect of the subject from our point of view. It is a very important aspect and one to which some answer will have to be found. I have no magic wand and I greatly doubt whether my noble friend Lord Rochester has.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02608">Finally, may I say a word about finance and charges. I should like to refer noble Lords in particular to Recommendation 112 of the Royal Commission report, which substantially turns the Commission's back on the idea of charges at the time of need and recommends the gradual phasing out of charges. I am under no delusion that the National Health Service is free. It has to be paid for. I take the view, and my noble friends take the view, that it is better that it should be paid for throughout life on a taxation or insurance basis rather than at the time of need by the patient.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02609">Here I must say a final word about the rumours with regard to a massive increase in prescription charges. With regard to prescription charges I merely say this, that a whole system of elaborate exceptions and exemptions, with season
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0641"/>
<col>1265</col>
tickets or certificates of pre-payment, exceptions for this category of diseases or that, cannot make right in the end something which is wrong and a muddle to start with. If the present Government decide that they wish to make a charge, so be it. I would not agree with them. I believe payment should be spread throughout life and not levied at the time of need when the patient is least able to pay.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02610">But surely that charge should be related to the actual demand made on the service. A prescription charge does not do that. The patient who spends three-quarters of an hour of a general practitioner's time for matrimonial advice, often very necessary advice, needs no prescription, pays nothing. The patient with diabetes who may want some insulin, cotton wool, surgical spirit, needles or whatever, might pay &#x00A3;2 or &#x00A3;3 and take only half a minute of the doctor's time. There is no relation to the cost of the drug. An individual drug might cost &#x00A3;50 a tablet and the patient will pay 70p. A prescription for iron and vitamins might cost a few pence a bucketful, but the patient may pay &#x00A3;2 or &#x00A3;3. Let us remember that the patient who costs the State money by having his pneumonia in hospital not only gets his drugs free but he gets his laundry and food and everything else free. The patient who has his pneumonia at home and saves us money has to pay a prescription charge on his drugs which could add up to &#x00A3;4 or &#x00A3;5 or even more.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02611">Let us remember the consequences of prescription charges and what happened before. They lead first of all to poly-pharmacy; that is, an enthusiastic effort by the drug firms to save patients money by including in one tablet nine or ten ingredients which would formerly have been prescribed separately. It is not very good pharmacy, not very good therapeutics; but it is very attractive to the GP who wishes to save his patient money, so he prescribes that which in the end may cost the service a good deal more. This tendency to prescribe blunderbuss preparations, everything in one tablet rather than in several, could cost money in the long run. One other consequence of prescription charges is bulk prescribing. General practitioners will, as prices go up, prescribe in larger and larger amounts, particularly for elderly patients, in the hope that it will save them money. It
<col>1266</col>
will not save the Government money; it will in the long run cost money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02612">My Lords, I have gone on speaking for longer than I meant to. To conclude I would merely say this. I hope, and I feel sure, that in the course of our discussions on this Motion we will realise that what matters in the National Health Service is the patient. I would say that when those who work in the National Health Service and those who legislate about it in this House or in another place come to consider the Health Service entirely from the point of view of the patient, rather than from the point of view of their own wellbeing in their own work, whatever it is, then I think we shall make progress at long last.</p>

<title>IMMIGRATION RULES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02614">3.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02615"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The Statement is as follows: <lb/>
"I am today publishing a White Paper setting out the Government's proposals for revising the Immigration Rules. The Immigration Act 1971 requires the Home Secretary to lay before Parliament a statement of any changes in the Immigration Rules, and the statement may be disapproved by a Resolution of either House. My purpose in publishing our proposals as a White Paper is to enable them to be debated before I lay that statement of the new rules. The White Paper is the result of a comprehensive review. The new rules will be clearer, easier to operate and firmer in a number of critical areas.<lb/>
"We shall end the automatic rights of entry of the husband or fianc&#x00E9; of a woman settled in this country. But it is not my intention to keep out the husband or fianc&#x00E9; of a woman who was born in the United Kingdom and whose marriage is not contracted for immigration purposes. The object of the new rules is to prevent the exploitation of marriage as an instrument of primary immigration. We cannot permit that
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0642"/>
<col>1267</col>
to continue. I have not overlooked the fact that some girls will have been born abroad because their parents happened to be out of the country (for example, in Crown service or business) at the time of their birth. It is my intention to consider such cases sympathetically for favourable treatment outside the rules.<lb/>
"We undertook to end the practice of allowing permanent settlement for those who come here for a temporary stay. The new rules will provide that visitors and students will not be able to remain for another temporary purpose if this carries with it the prospect of eventual settlement. Visitors will be prohibited from taking employment. People who wish to set up in business or stay here as self-employed persons or as persons of independent means will have to meet stricter requirements and will need first to obtain entry clearance.<lb/>
"We undertook to limit the entry of parents, grandparents and children over 18 to a small number of urgent compassionate cases. Children aged 18 or over will qualify for settlement only where the circumstances are of the most strongly compassionate nature, though special consideration will be given to daughters under 21 who formed part of the family unit overseas and have no other relative to whom they can turn. Parents and grandparents aged 65 or over and widowed mothers already have to show that they are wholly or mainly dependent on children in this country who can support and accommodate them. In future they will also have to show that they are without other relatives in their own country to whom they can turn and that they have a standard of living substantially below that of their own country. Parents and grandparents under 65 will not qualify for entry, save in the most exceptional compassionate circumstances.<lb/>
"We also said we would severely restrict the issue of work permits. This is not a matter for the Immigration Rules, but my honourable and learned friend the Under-Secretary of State for Employment is answering a Written Question on the subject today.<lb/>
"The White Paper explains that the Government will consider on the basis
<col>1268</col>
of the present rules all applications made before today.<lb/>
"The other changes in the White Paper are the result of the comprehensive review which I have mentioned. Obscurities have been cleared up, anomalies have been removed, and the scope for abuse and evasion of the control has been reduced.<lb/>
"The Government believe that firm immigration control is essential in order to achieve good community relations. The new rules will not affect our commitment to certain United Kingdom passport holders being admitted under the special voucher scheme, nor to men lawfully settled here who wish to be joined by their wives and young children. We shall continue to welcome the genuine visitor and the genuine student. What we are determined to do is to deal strictly with those who seek to evade or manipulate the control."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02616">3.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02617"><member>Baroness STEDMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, for repeating the Statement. There are one or two comments that I should like to make. First, quite early on in the Statement, he says, in effect, that the White Paper gives the details of all the proposed controls and that he will enable them to be debated before the new rules are laid. I hope that the noble Lord when replying will give us an assurance that time will be given for debate on those rules to take place in this House as well as in another place.<lb/>
A year ago the present Prime Minister spoke about the country being swamped with immigrants. It was not true then and we said so; and it is not true today. At the election the Conservatives said three things. First, that they would maintain a register&#x2014;that seems to have been dropped. They said that they would establish a quota&#x2014;that seems to have gone by the board. They said that there would be restrictions on husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s&#x2014;half of that appears to have been dropped because the only restrictions left are those which affect Asian women. At one stage it would seem that the argument was about numbers and now, when we come down to it, it is about the abuse of the regulations.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0643"/>
<col>1269</col>
I remind the noble Lord that in 1977 we introduced measures to deal with marriages of convenience, and for the most part they seem to have worked. So two and a half out of the three election proposals have now been dropped and I contend that what we are left with is both racist and reactionary. The attack is on an arranged marriage system. I contend that it is not for Governments to attack minority cultures. The practice will change with time, but such a practice must change at the pace which can be set by the ethnic minorities themselves and not by regulations of Governments.<lb/>
Before we have the proposed debate we need more facts. For example, prior to the election we held an inquiry into overstaying. I believe that the results of that inquiry showed that it was not the coloured people who were overstaying. Will the Government now publish the results of that inquiry and will they make those facts available to both Houses? I believe that the major primary immigration is over, and has been for some time.<lb/>
As regards the other proposed changes, what of the children who have been left behind to go to university or to look after elderly grandparents and who will now no longer be able to join their families? Many of them will be entirely alone. What about the parents and the grandparents who cannot join their children? It is inhuman to try to prevent a family from looking after its elderly people. That is entirely lacking in compassion. It will make little difference to the total number of black people in Britain, but it will cause the utmost pain to the families affected. I contend that it is being done solely to satisfy racial prejudice.<lb/>
The Statement says that the new rules will be applied from today. Is that so, my Lords?&#x2014;before either House has debated the proposals or the rules have been laid? Does that statement tie up with paragraph 13 of the White Paper which seems to imply something slightly different? The developing countries have moved towards equal treatment on nationality law for the men and women citizens of their countries. Now we are creating three categories of citizenship: men and women born in Britain and women who were born overseas. The White Paper begins by saying that:
<col>1270</col>
<quote>"Immigration officers will carry out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of the people seeking to enter the United Kingdom".</quote>
That is as may be, but our contention is that these proposals are sex discriminatory and are quite unworthy of a British Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02618">3.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02619"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble Lord about three matters. As regards refugees, is he aware that, in two of the places where they are referred to, only the convention and not the protocol is mentioned and therefore they are technically deficient? Moreover, is he aware that the immigration officer is given a very wide discretion as to when he should refer applications for refugee status to the Home Office; that the immigration officer is not instructed to inform the passenger of his right to contact the United Nations High Commissioner or the United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service; that there is no objective machinery for determining claims to refugee status; and that, as regards all those matters, the requests made by the UNHCR representative here have not been satisfied?<lb/>
As regards parents and grandparents, is he aware that very few are permitted to enter under the existing rules, that they are not even separately distinguished in the statistics, and that the few parents and grandparents who will be denied entry as a result of the harsher provisions now contained in these draft proposals will be caused very serious hardship? It is incompatible with the Tory Party's claim to be the party of the family to deny entry to those few parents and grandparents and children between 18 and 21.<lb/>
If it is the intention of the Home Secretary invariably to use his discretion to admit, outside the rules, the husband of a United Kingdom citizen&#x2014;a woman herself born outside the United Kingdom, although the child of a United Kingdom-born citizen&#x2014;why could that not have been embodied in the rules themselves? Is he aware that the provisions regarding husbands are retroactive, in that they apply to the husbands of women who were not born in the United Kingdom, although they have hitherto had that right up to the time that these rules were published?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0644"/>
<col>1271</col>
How could the Minister claim, as he did in answer to the Question that I put to him on 7th November, that the number of husbands entering Britain under the previous rules, is evidence of abuse when, if one looks at the immigration statistics themselves, in each of the last six years the number of wives entering the United Kingdom has exceeded the number of husbands?<lb/>
Finally, these changes will not satisfy the commitment in the Tory Manifesto to an immediate and substantial reduction in net immigration. But it will have the effect of causing grave hardship and anxiety to a few families, and of undermining community relations by creating needless anxieties among the ethnic minorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02620"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, have asked me a series of questions which persuades me&#x2014;indeed, that is the intention, as indicated in the Statement&#x2014;that some further discussion in your Lordships' House would be desirable. Of course, this would be arranged through the usual channels. I say to the noble Baroness that this has nothing to do with attacking minority cultures. About three-quarters of an hour ago I specifically gave an assurance on this point to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark. I shall certainly look into the question asked by the noble Baroness about the project within the Home Office on "over-stayers".<lb/>
I come to the points which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised with me about refugees. In order to get the matter straight I shall say this to the noble Lord. The paragraphs with regard to those claiming refugee status under the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol, and to those seeking asylum in the United Kingdom, are being revised to make it clear that a refugee or an asylum claim has precedence over other parts of the rules, and that where such an application is well-founded the person is not to be removed to the country in which he has a well-founded fear of persecution. This is already our practice, but the drafting of the current provision of the rules has been criticised, and we want to make it
<col>1272</col>
clear. I am very pleased that I have this opportunity to make the point absolutely clear.<lb/>
At this stage it might be the wish of the House that I do not burden your Lordships with any other remarks, except on one matter. Several times this afternoon I have been asked for statistics. The statistics show something without a peradventure. It is that after long and earnest consideration by political parties on both sides of the House; after one Home Secretary, in the shape of the right honourable gentleman, Mr. Callaghan, in 1969 had brought down a bar on many forms of immigration; after deep thought in 1974 and debate in your Lordships' House in which the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, warned your Lordships of the dangers of a wave of immigration if something was not done about the particular problem of husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s; after the Home Secretary of the day, Mr. Roy Jenkins, took the view that he would make a concession in this matter, and bearing in mind the fact that clearly this is a very difficult problem, it is absolutely certain that the numbers of both husbands and wives coming into this country have enormously increased, and increased in particular from the Indian sub-continent.<lb/>
It is for that reason, and because we are certain that many of these partnerships are arranged to the detriment of girls living in this country, that we felt it right to make the Statement to your Lordships today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02621"><member>Lord BARNBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the Statement which my noble friend has just made and congratulate him on its detail. It is a fairly balanced solution to what undoubtedly is a complicated question. Over the past 15 years in this House we have had many discussions on immigration. At times the discussion has centred on the matters which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, so often raises, and which have been effectively dealt with in the Statement. But over the years there have certainly been anxieties on this side of the House and I think on the Cross-Benches about the whole question of immigration. Admittedly it is a very sensitive matter which has habitually raised great emotions. I ask my noble friend to bear in mind, and to reassure his right honourable friend the Home
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0645"/>
<col>1273</col>
Secretary, that there remains in this country widespread anxiety that, under the guise of emotion such as we have heard today and at other times, increases in immigration may occur. There is undoubtedly great anxiety that the scale on which immigration has occurred in this country in the last 15 years has imperilled the rights and privileges of native citizens. This has manifested itself in housing, health and education. It is on those grounds that I hope my noble friend will remind his right honourable friend of the strength of feeling there is that emotion may cause an excess and a bending of the rules of immigration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02622"><member>Baroness FISHER of REDNAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I recognise that the Government are committed to equality between the sexes, although that might not go down very well with the noble Lord, Lord Barnby. Perhaps he does not even believe in equality between the sexes. Will the Government consider changing the legislation, because that is what will be necessary&#x2014;not changing the rules&#x2014;so that the right of British men born overseas to marry and to settle in Britain with foreign wives is taken away from British men? I ask this question bearing in mind the equality between the sexes which the Government are supposed to support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02623"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02624"><member>Lord DENHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not want to interrupt the noble Lord, but it is usual on these matters, after the two initial statements, for each question to be answered separately. If my noble friend can do that and then turn to the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, it will be easier for the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02625"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Barnby for his intervention. In essence, my noble friend was saying something which was in the manifesto of his political party and mine at the last election&#x2014;at least, I think it was in the manifesto&#x2014;namely, that firm immigration policy leads to good race relations. I believe that that is right and I know that that is what my noble friend believes.<lb/>
In answer to the noble Baroness, no, we are not at present, as I made clear
<col>1274</col>
when I answered Questions earlier this afternoon, considering the introduction of a nationality Bill, not because it is something that we do not want&#x2014;indeed, we do and I believe that there is common ground on this&#x2014;but because I am afraid I must say to the House that we are simply not ready to introduce that particular legislation at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02626"><member>Lord HATCH of LUSBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to a supplementary question from me last week, I understood the noble Lord to admit that there was some dichotomy within the Conservative Party manifesto at the election. If he has read beyond what he has just quoted, he will find that the Conservative Party put itself forward as a party which was going to control immigration in the interests of better community relations in this country, but it then went on to insist that the rights of all British citizens today should be equal. Does this White Paper not contradict that pledge? Is it, therefore, not the case that the Government are introducing legislation which is completely opposed to the mandate on which they were elected?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02627"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great pleasure to answer questions from the noble Lord. He asks me the same questions from week to week and I give him the same answers. The answer to the noble Lord is, no. I give that answer because we made it clear in our manifesto that we believe that a firm immigration policy is the necessary precursor to good race relations. We also made it quite plain in our election manifesto that we would change the rules governing the entry of husbands and male finac&#x00E9;s in order to deal with the exploitation of marriage as a means of primary immigration of men for work. I must say that I cannot think of a practice which is more likely to lead to worsened race relations. That is why I have no hesitation at all in following my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and making this Statement to your Lordships today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02628"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord and all Members of your Lordships' House will know that I do not agree that firm immigration controls in fact are an aid to good race relations. You have often heard me say hat they do the direct opposite. How
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0646"/>
<col>1275</col>
ever, that is not my reason for rising. My reason for rising is to ask the noble Lord to beg his right honourable friend to look at this again. With regard to the statistics he is quoting, there is evidence that in fact there are more wives coming than husbands, which merely indicates that people want to marry in that particular way. What he is in fact doing is to penalise people who have obeyed the law because certain people are breaking the law.<lb/>
Would it not be better for his right honourable friend to look for a tighter way of making sure that there is not evasion, rather than this blanket refusal to allow people to exercise a right they already have? The analogy to what he is doing would be if my noble friend Lord Sainsbury were to close his supermarkets in order to stop shoplifting. This is the analogy to what is being done. Will the noble Lord ask his right honourable friend to look at this matter much more seriously, because all that is happening as a consequence is that there will be more unpleasantness&#x2014;and we have too much already.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02629"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for the way in which he has put his question. I must say that in the time that I have been in your Lordships' House together with the noble Lord I have learned to listen carefully to what he says. Certainly I shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what the noble Lord has said. That is not just a form of words. Deliberately these proposals, which are of course much wider than the specific point about the entry of husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s, have been put to Parliament in the form of a White Paper so that it would be possible for both Houses of Parliament, if the Members of both Houses wish to do so, to debate these matters before the order for the rules is actually laid.<lb/>
I should add that from time to time I get the opportunity to see individual cases, and there is no doubt in my mind that the exploitation of immigration control in the way we have been talking about in the last few minutes does in fact occur. If one attaches that to the statistics concerning the increase in husbands and fianc&#x00E9;s one can only be led to the conclusion that exploitation is occurring
<col>1276</col>
more and more. I would just say to your Lordships that if this is the case and it is not ended, then it brings into disrepute the system of an arranged marriage arranged within the country not for the purpose of primary immigration, and that is yet another reason why I believe it has been right to make this Statement today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02630"><member>Lord ELWYN-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask two short questions. First, has consideration been given to the question whether the new rules are in compliance with the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights, and in particular Articles 8, 12 and 14? I do not expect the noble Lord to have those immediately in his mind. Perhaps we can be informed in due course whether that question has been examined and what conclusion has been reached, because I greatly fear that the Government and this country may be in grave difficulty under the terms of the convention.<lb/>
Secondly, in relation to girls who will have been born abroad because their parents happen to have been out of the country and for whom consideration should be given, the Statement says:
<quote>"It is my intention to consider such cases sympathetically for favourable treatment outside the Rules".</quote>
Does that mean that in any given case a wide discretion will be given to the Minister whether to apply the rules or not? Is this a customary way of dealing with rules? Should there not be an attempt at any rate to spell out in the rules the exceptions that are contemplated? Otherwise the purpose of having rules at all seems to be minimal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02631"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may reply to the first question which the noble and learned Lord has put to me, consideration has been given by my right honourable friend as to whether the changes proposed in this White Paper are consonant with the provisions of the European Convention, particularly the articles that the noble and learned Lord mentioned. My right honourable friend believes that the Government have a perfectly respectable argument for doing what we are proposing. The answer to the noble and learned Lord's first question, therefore, is, Yes, we have taken this seriously into account.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0647"/>
<col>1277</col>
So far as the second point is concerned, if I may say so, the noble and learned Lord has, with his customary accuracy, hit the nail on the head. The matter which he raises is something which has concerned my right honourable friend in trying to decide how to present the White Paper to your Lordships' House, as to whether or not the exceptions outside the rules for girls born abroad could be framed in the White Paper. It is true that at the moment we simply refer to exceptions and give an indication of the sort of exceptions the Home Secretary would have in mind. Your Lordships might like to go into this in more detail if the House comes to debate these matters further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02632"><member>Baroness DAVID</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the light of the Statement, may I ask whether the Minister is going to advise British women who are abroad, that if they become pregnant they had better come back for their confinement.?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02633"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is not the slightest need to do anything of the sort, precisely because the White Paper refers to the discretion of the Home Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02634"><member>Baroness LOCKWOOD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether I may first declare an interest, and secondly therefore seek the approval of the House to put a further question to the Minister. It seems, in looking at paragraph 50 of the White Paper, that even British women born here are going to have no automatic right to bring a spouse into this country. What they have is the right to seek permission to do so.<lb/>
They have a number of obstacles to overcome. In the first place, they will have to establish that they were born in this country. Having established that they were born in the country, then there may be a clearance permit issued for their spouse, or their fianc&#x00E9;, to enter the country. It is only "may", it is not automatic. One has to look at the three clauses contained in paragraph 50. Therefore it seems that not only are British women who were born abroad going to have great difficulty in coming back into the country with their spouses, and it will be dependent on the Home Secretary's discretion; it
<col>1278</col>
also seems as though the Home Secretary is going to have to exercise discretion in relation to those British women who are born here in this country.<lb/>
May I link this with the provisions in relation to EEC citizens. A woman, a member of certainly those EEC countries&#x2014;and there are a number of them&#x2014;which provide equal rights for citizenship to men and women, such as France, Italy, Germany and Denmark, would be able to marry outside the EEC. Would the Minister confirm that they would then be able to bring into this country a spouse from South-East Asia or from any other part of the world, and that that would place them at a very great advantage compared to British women?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02635"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate the concern which the noble Baroness, as chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, has about this aspect of the White Paper but, if she will forgive me saying so, I think she is disregarding the reason why paragraph 50 appears in the White Paper. It appears there because the Government believe, and I think many of your Lordships would agree, that we are entitled in this country to take steps to prevent primary immigration through marriages which are arranged for that purpose and for that purpose only.<lb/>
Regarding the noble Baroness's question about the EEC, it is technically correct to say that a woman who is an EEC national, if I may put it that way, and who comes here to work, may bring her husband and dependants with her. But there is no evidence to show that many are seeking to do that, and, when such women are wanting to do it, those marriages are not being used for the purpose of primary immigration. Therefore although there appears to be a contradiction between the effects so far as EEC nationals are concerned and the effects so far as other men and women are concerned, it is only an appearance; the fact of the matter is that those EEC cases have nothing to do with using marriage for the purpose of primary immigration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02636"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one point which the Minister&#x2014;-</membercontribution></p>

<col>1279</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02637"><member>Lord DENHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is of course for the House to decide, but noble Lords may feel that, having spent 33 minutes on this subject and having a long list of speakers wishing to take part in today's debate, we might leave this matter until we come to debate it later on.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02638">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02639">4.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02640"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, by the time we come to the end of this debate I have no doubt that many of your Lordships will be glad that we had two maiden speeches this afternoon because at least they are required by the custom of the House not to speak too long and to be non-controversial. I am sure I can say with the approval of the House how delighted we all are to have two maiden speakers in the noble Earl, Lord Erne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw, and how much we look forward to hearing them.<lb/>
I suspect that by the time I sit down noble Lords will have come to the conclusion that I have been both disagreeable and controversial. One fact we must recognise, namely that, when it comes to what should be done in the National Health Service, there is a wide gulf separating noble Lords opposite from those of us on this side as to what we believe is absolutely essential and necessary. Let me say at the outset that in our view the Government plans affecting the NHS which have been set out recently can only be described as absolutely disgraceful.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, when talking about the NHS&#x2014;and I thought he presented a very fair and impartial view of what needs to be done&#x2014;said, "We are all patients or potential patients". I very much doubt whether that applies to most noble Lords opposite, who are more likely to be private patients and, when necessary, occupants of private beds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02641">Several noble Lords: Nonsense!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02642"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: It is not nonsense, my Lords, because I happen
<col>1280</col>
to know the private doctor of a good many of them. It is not nonsense and they know it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02643"><member>Baroness FAITHFULL</member><membercontribution>: What about confidentiality, my Lords?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02644"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if noble Lords in the Chamber say, "My doctor is sitting behind me", there is nothing confidential about it. In the five years when I was a Minister in the Labour Government I was subjected by noble Lords opposite to a good deal of criticism about the NHS and all I wish to say about the achievements of the last Government is that capital spending did not suffer in any one year under us; under Labour the NHS did well out of the total public expenditure. We managed to increase its share each year and in those five years there was a tremendous increase in medical staff&#x2014;4,000 more hospital doctors, 1,300 more general practitioners, 1,000 more midwives and 45,000 more nurses. The number of patients who became in-patients in the last year exceeded 6 million, a figure never before reached, and there were over 3 million more dental treatments in 1978 than in 1973; in 1978 there were 27&#x00B7;1 million dental treatments as against 23&#x00B7;7 million in 1973. I mention those figures for no other reason than to show that the NHS, in spite of all the difficulties the Labour Government had to face, was not static.<lb/>
I wish to refer to the Conservatives Election Manifesto of April 1979, in which they said:
<quote>"In our National Health Service standards are falling; there is a crisis of morale; too often patients' needs do not come first. It is not our intention to reduce spending on the Health Service; indeed, we intend to make better use of what resources are available".</quote>
On 12th June 1979, after the election, they said:
<quote>"As we have repeatedly made clear, it is not our intention to reduce spending on the National Health Service".</quote>
Then we had the Secretary of State for Social Services saying in the House of Commons on 17th July 1979, about five weeks after the Statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
<quote>"We anticipate that the total amount to be squeezed [from the NHS] will be of the order of &#x00A3;90 to &#x00A3;100 million in this year. Of this only &#x00A3;35 to &#x00A3;40 million is a result of the increase in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0649"/>
<col>1281</col>
VAT &#x2026; I concede at once that some health authorities, especially some of those in London, are faced with the need to make real cuts this year in order to remain within their cash limits. It is not for me or my Department to tell them where or how to make their savings. As responsible authorities, it is up to them to look at their priorities carefully and make savings where they will do least harm to patients' care".</quote>
"Least harm"&#x2014;not no harm. It may be argued by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, "But we did not know the state of the country's finances when we came to power." I am sure that that may well be true, but what a stupid remark to make: that one will not do something if one does not know what the circumstances are; far better to have made no promises at all. In fact the Government ordered health authorities to cut &#x00A3;125 million from their budgets before 31st March next. The Secretary of State expressed confidence that the cuts could be restricted to the administrative service. He knows very different now&#x2014;that they cannot be confined to the administrative service. My Lords&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02645"><member>Lord WOLVERTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hate to interrupt the noble Lord in an important debate like this, but the Government's White Paper on expenditure, issued in November, stated: <lb/>
<quote>"The Government plans to maintain spending on the National Health Service in 1980&#x2013;81 at the level proposed by the late Administration".</quote>
That has only recently been stated in the Government's expenditure plans for 1980&#x2013;81, yet we have just been told by the noble Lord that the Government are going to make cuts. They may be making cuts on the administration side, but they have said that they are not going to cut spending on the National Health Service. So I should like to know what the noble Lord thinks about this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02646"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have just said that the Government have ordered the health authorities to cut &#x00A3;125 million from their budgets before 31st March, 1980. Cuts of that magnitude cannot be imposed without affecting patient care; and in a matter of a few minutes I shall enumerate the way in which this is being done. What is really happening is that health authorities are proposing the temporary or permanent closure of dozens of hospitals and clinics&#x2014;that cannot be denied&#x2014;the closure of
<col>1282</col>
hundreds of wards and special units; leaving vacancies for doctors and nurses unfilled; cutting out holiday cover for doctors; reducing staffing levels in laboratory services; postponing all new developments to improve services.<lb/>
Let us make no mistake about it, my Lords; it means a real deterioration in the service that the National Health Service can offer. None of this is surprising to us on this side of the House. I am sure that this will be denied by the noble Baroness: the Conservative Party has never whole-heartedly accepted the National Health Service, either in principle or in practice. It is doubtful whether noble Lords opposite know much, if anything, about it&#x2014;certainly not, I believe, from personal experience, because it is common knowledge that many of them use the private sector. I am not quarrelling about that, but I am saying that one is in a far better position to make judgments if one really knows what is going on.<lb/>
The Secretary of State's room in the Department of Health and Social Security contained a portrait of Aneurin Bevan&#x2014;at least in my day. I read recently that,
<quote>"A large square of unfaded wallpaper above the Secretary of State's desk at the Elephant and Castle is symbolic. For years a portrait of Aneurin Bevan, founding father of the National Health Service, hung there. Patrick Jenkin, the new Social Services Secretary, has had it removed. Instead on the sideboard is a framed photograph of Iain Macleod".</quote>
May I say that I am very glad that he has removed the portrait because, bearing in mind what goes on in that room at present, it would be an insult to have it there. I am not so sure that the photograph of the late Iain Macleod is appropriate because if there was one thing that the late Iain Macleod stood for above everything else, it was his belief in one nation, and this Government, let us make no mistake about it, believe in two nations: the "haves", the richest 7 per cent., to whom they gave 34 per cent. of the tax cuts, so that they could go off and buy private medicine and private education; and the "have nots", the 10 per cent., to whom they gave 2 per cent., and who have to suffer deteriorating health and education services.<lb/>
The growth of separate private medicine, approved and encouraged by the present Government, can be accomplished only at the expense of the National Health Service. I ask noble Lords opposite to
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0650"/>
<col>1283</col>
take note of this: that the growth of separate private medicine, approved and encouraged as I believe it is by the present Government, can be accomplished only at the expense of the National Health Service. Private medicine can in many ways make tempting offers to doctors, nurses and other medical personnel who in the end will not be treating citizens of the United Kingdom. The vast growth of private medicine in this country is a growing concern; it is also a cause of growing anxiety to all of us on this side of the House. As I said on a previous occasion, one can go into Wellington Hospital and it will not cost more than just over &#x00A3;900 a week&#x2014;I emphasise a week&#x2014;using doctors who have been trained in this country at public expense, drawing on nurses whom we badly need in our National Health Service hospitals, and as I said a few moments ago, to a very large extent they are treating anybody but citizens of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
We know that the Government want to encourage medical insurance schemes by introducing tax relief on contributions, in order to shift the cost of the Health Service from taxes to insurance. But what of the future for the National Health Service for those who cannot afford an insurance scheme? Are we going to fall back on the kind of situation, which I can remember vividly, that existed before 1948, in which we had voluntary hospitals that could not pay their way and had to have Government help and in which the service left much to be desired? Are we going back to the kind of situation in which hospitals have to be maintained by charitable institutions, lotteries, and the like?&#x2014;because this has been suggested; make no mistake about it, my Lords.<lb/>
I want to refer for a few moments to the Royal Commission Report. I do not ask for answers to these points. I may well put them in question form, but that is simply because I want to emphasise to the Government the importance of these matters. The Royal Commission made a number of proposals: there must be removal of queue jumping through private medicine&#x2014;so the Royal Commission was aware of it; there should be no change in the method of financing the National Health Service; and the National Health Service should provide equality of entitlement to health services. It said that the
<col>1284</col>
National Health Service should provide equality of access to all the services and a service free at the time of use, satisfy the reasonable expectations of its users and remain a national service to local needs.<lb/>
I should like to emphasise a number of things that the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, said and, if he does not mind, cross the proverbial "t"s and dot the proverbial "i"s. I think it would be helpful if the Secretary of State looked carefully at a number of things; for example, the cost of agency medical staff, which is phenomenal, and the saving which could be made in the cost of drugs. A pilot scheme could be started in this country in a defined area to find out what drugs were really necessary, and there could then be drawn up an approved list of inexpensive drugs, because I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, will agree that there is more than one drug available which will do a certain thing, some of them three or four times more expensive. I think we also need to look at the secretaries employed through agencies for administrative work. With agency secretaries there is no continuity, and they never get to know the staff, they never get to know the system, because they come and go through an agency. The amount of money that has to be paid to employ agency secretaries would warrant paying shorthand-typists in the National Health Service a bit more, so cutting out the need for secretaries from agencies.<lb/>
My final point is this&#x2014;and to this I should like an answer, but not necessarily today if the noble Lord or the noble Baroness feels that it is a flatter that cannot be dealt with today, as I am inclined to believe. I think we ought to look very carefully at the scope and function of the community health councils. It came to my notice only a few days ago that one community health council were so enraged at the cuts being imposed upon the area health authority through the regional health authority that they wanted to take legal action to see whether they could be stopped. Not surprisingly, they were told by the regional health authority that the money which the regional health authority gave the community health council was not for litigation&#x2014;anything but. T have some sympathy with this view, but as I see it&#x2014;and I
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0651"/>
<col>1285</col>
may be quite wrong about this&#x2014;the community health council is a public body, and public bodies are not prevented from taking some action. I think that this is an area which needs looking at, and I would be grateful if at some suitable time the noble Baroness or the noble Lord would look at it and let me know.<lb/>
As I say, my Lords, I am sorry, in some respects, that I could not have sounded more cheerful; but after a good many years in politics, going back to the time when I sat on a committee, albeit a very humble committee, a very small committee, that was planning the National Health Service, I have yet to be convinced that, whether or not we have the money, from the present Government we are going to get a sincere and sustained attempt to give us the kind of National Health Service we should have, unless there is a conviction on their part that this is of supreme importance to the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02647"><member>Lord SOMERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I must take issue with him on one or two things that he has said&#x2014;and the noble Baroness has kindly allowed me to intervene at this stage. I hesitate to do this because the noble Lord is a personal friend, and when he represented the Health Department in your Lordships' House nobody could have worked harder or been more conscientious, and we all admired him. But I must press him to believe that the old theory that all noble Lords who sit on this side of the House are wealthy landowners and all who sit on his side are poverty-stricken citizens is absolutely exploded by now.<lb/>
Although I sit on these Cross-Benches I am a potential Conservative Peer, and, what is more, I am one of that obnoxious breed which I know is really allowed only on tolerance by that side of the House&#x2014;an hereditary Peer. But I can assure the noble Lord that I have enjoyed the services of the National Health Service ever since they were founded, and I am thankful to say that if it were not for the services I received from them I would not be sitting in your Lordships' House today. I am a constant patient, and I have the very greatest admiration for the doctors who work in it. Naturally I know nothing about the private affairs of noble Lords who sit on the Government side of the House, but I think that if a secret ballot
<col>1286</col>
was taken the noble Lord would find that only about half a dozen enjoy the services of private doctors and private beds.</membercontribution></p>

We can hold our friendhisps very sincerely and very dearly, but we can also take our politics very seriously, as well. I think it is one of the great joys of this House that we can say what we think, although I hope we always say it nicely. But I think the noble Lord is mistaken when he thinks that there are only about half a dozen Peers on the other side of the House who use private practice.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02650"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of EDUCATION and SCIENCE (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we are all very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for initiating and introducing this debate today. He has made a most perceptive and stimulating speech, and I was very glad to hear the constructive and realistic contribution that he made. It is appropriate that we should at this stage, at the start of the new Government's life, debate the National Health Service, and do so as we move into the 1980s. I should also like to wish the two maiden speakers good fortune in their speeches. I am sure they will go well, and we shall look forward to hearing both noble Lords on very many occasions.<lb/>
My Lords, I would take as my starting point this afternoon what members of the Royal Commission have recently said about the National Health Service:
<quote>"In the course of our work we have seen things we have liked and admired, and things we have not liked at all. But our general view is that we need not feel ashamed of our health service and that there are many aspects of it of which we can be justly proud".</quote>
I think that this, in a very real and balanced way, sums up the position we find ourselves in today.<lb/>
It is very easy to be critical and to say critical things about the state of the Health Service, and I shall be turning to some of those detailed points in a moment; but before doing so I should like to place on record my party's support of the National Health Service, and certainly our pledge, which we gave in Opposition
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0652"/>
<col>1287</col>
and which we reiterate now, that it is our determination that in what we do we shall put the patients first. Many points will come up in the course of this debate today, and if they cannot be answered either by myself or by my noble friend Lord Cullen I give an assurance to the House that we will follow them up, that the proceedings will be read by my right honourable friend the Secrtary of State for Health and Social Services, and that we will of course write on matters which we cannot answer.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, said that Britain spends less of its gross domestic product on health than many other countries in Europe. He is, of course, quite right. The truth is that the National Health Service is no longer the envy of the world, and the Royal Commission in fact showed that for every &#x00A3;100 spent on health care per head of population in Britain, the Netherlands, for example, spends &#x00A3;147, and West Germany, &#x00A3;158. The consequences are what we might expect, as for example in perinatal mortality, which is higher in England and Wales than in Norway, the Netherlands and France. Nobody can be pleased by this state of affairs, and all of us agree that we want to do something about it.<lb/>
We on this side of the House would like not only to spend more on the Health Service, but we can only do so once we have succeeded in restoring the nation's prosperity. Really, our fundamental difficulty is the fact that, even today, our factories produce barely more than they did five years ago under the three-day week. Because we have not had the economic growth the National Health Service, as other public services, has suffered greatly. I do not believe that in these circumstance it is a very valuable contribution to have an interminable debate about whether or not we should or should not have private medicine.<lb/>
I have spent enough time queueing up in hospitals to know quite well how some of the more difficult features of the National Health Service work. Having said all that, it is, I believe, a fact that only this year the Electrical, Electronic, Tele-communication, and Plumbing Union agreed with the electrical employers to provide private medical cover for 40,000 employees&#x2014;and why not in a free society, if that
<col>1288</col>
is what they want to do! Really and truly, I do not think that debating who does or who does not have private medicine is a profitable use of our time. The fact is that we want to improve the National Health Service, and it is to that end that we should be addressing ourselves.<lb/>
May I now turn to the economic situation facing the hospital service. The position is that health authorities are having to keep their expenditure about &#x00A3;125 mllion to &#x00A3;130 million below what they had planned to spend in order to keep within their cash limits. The reason for this is that we inherited a whole series of commitments on NHS pay but not alas! the wherewithal to meet them. We have agreed to honour the arrangements made by the previous Government and to increase health authority cash limits by most of the excess cost over the inadequate cover they had provided. This has already cost &#x00A3;250 million and with more to come. The previous Government had already told health authorities they could expect no increase in their cash limit to cover excess price inflation over the amount that had been provided. Faced by the need to foot the substantial increase in the NHS pay bill, and by the equally urgent need to reduce the borrowing requirement and the burden of direct taxation, we felt unable to go further than our predecessors. This has meant in consequence hard decisions by many health authorities, and I recognise that there have had to be reductions in services in some places. London has faced particular difficulties. In general, however, health authorities have responded very well to my right honourable friend's request to achieve economies with the minimum impact on patient services; they have done this by cutting back on new developments as well as by stringent housekeeping economies, and focusing any cuts as far as possible on expenditure not concerned with patient care.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, quoted our Manifesto. He said&#x2014;and I accept this&#x2014;that in our Manifesto we said that it was not our intention to reduce spending on the Health Service. I have just given the figures, and I accept that there has been a tight squeeze this year because of cash limits and the economic situation. However, as my noble friend said&#x2014;and it is in the White
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0653"/>
<col>1289</col>
Paper&#x2014;the fact is that planned spending on the Health Service in 1980&#x2013;81 will give an increase of about 3 per cent. in real terms for the two-year period since 1978&#x2013;79. This increase will restore this year's squeeze and add the further &#x00BD; per cent. real growth previously planned for health authorities. The net cost of the NHS will rise to &#x00A3;7,904 million, about 11 per cent. of the total of Government expenditure. We believe that it is not right that users should not bear a reasonable share of the cost where they are able to pay. We have therefore made two further proposals. The limits on hospital costs for road traffic accident victims which can be recovered from vehicle insurers involved will go up from 1st April.<lb/>
I think at this point I should answer the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, about prescription charges. We have accepted that prescription charges will be raised to 70p from 1st April 1980&#x2014;representing roughly the same proportion of the total cost of a prescription as 20p did when that charge was introduced in 1971. There will continue to be arrangements for exempting the elderly, who will not have to pay; those under 16; those on supplementary benefits and other groups, such as expectant and nursing mothers. The prepayment certificates&#x2014;which are colloquially called "season tickets"&#x2014;for those needing frequent prescriptions, will continue on favourable rates. We recognise that many believe that treatment should be absolutely free at the time it is received. But we do not believe that the savings from increased charges&#x2014;nearly &#x00A3;33 million next year&#x2014;can be lost. Still less do we believe that we can afford to abandon charges altogether for those who are able to pay<lb/>
As I have already indicated, we judge that the country cannot at present afford to devote more resources to the NHS if we are to restore the country to its economic prosperity. But we believe, as already indicated, that there is very considerable potential for making more efficient use of the resources that are available. The Government are seeking to reduce waste, bureaucracy and over-government across the whole range of public services including the NHS. I was particularly interested to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, had to say on health
<col>1290</col>
education for all of us, preventive medicine and generally his remarks on sensible living.<lb/>
Before Christmas the Government will issue a consultative paper setting out their proposals to simplify and decentralise the Health Service, and reduce bureaucracy. This will pick up and respond to the Royal Commission's recommendations on these matters. I believe that the Government's general approach is well known. We shall propose a simplification of the existing structure; in some places there are in effect six tiers&#x2014;the department, region, area, district, sector and unit. We shall also propose greater delegation of responsibility to those at the level at which services to patients are provided. I hope that when the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, sees the consultative document, it will help him on some of the points that he made about the importance of involving people at the level of the community.<lb/>
We shall be making our proposals in order to achieve a more effective and responsive service. We also believe that if our proposals are implemented, the service will be less costly. My right honourable friend the Minister of State at the Department of Health has said, in answer to a question in another place, that the long term aim should be to save 10 per cent. of the present cost of managing the service&#x2014;that is, &#x00A3;30 million of the &#x00A3;300 million per year spent on management Some have dismissed this aim as wholly unrealistic. I would simply reply that some authorities have already shown that substantial savings are possible by simplifying their structure. Somerset, for example, expects to save over &#x00A3;200,000 a year as the result of changes implemented earlier this year.<lb/>
However, we are not simply limited to the question of making structure and management more efficient. We are also reviewing a wide range of possibilities for making better use of resources, some of which&#x2014;for example, the use of incentive budgeting&#x2014;have been highlighted in the Royal Commission's report. If I may, I will give two examples of initiatives taken by the Department of Health over the past few months.<lb/>
First, a research project is being undertaken in several health districts which is designed in part to help clinicians be
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0654"/>
<col>1291</col>
more aware of the economic consequences of their clinical decisions. There is certainly no intention to infringe the tradition of clinical autonomy, but there is no denying that within a finite budget the use of unnecessarily expensive drugs or procedures in diagnosing and treating one patient means there is less to be spent on others. Experience so far shows that if given by management well presented information about the costs of procedures, drugs, et cetera, clinicians are sometimes able to save quite considerable sums without in any way reducing the quality of care they give their patients.<lb/>
The second project is one designed to help relieve consultants of part of their burden of paperwork and administration generally, by giving administrative support to groups of consultants working as a clinical unit. Experience in one or two cases has shown that a relatively junior administrator can relieve consultants of much of the chores of scheduling their work, arranging admissions, and similar matters, giving them more time for clinical work. If the experiment now being undertaken in several districts proves valuable to the consultants concerned, this is one area of administration in which we shall want to encourage growth. Noble Lords may be assured that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State will encourage initiatives to cut out waste and improve efficiency&#x2014;and I shall of course draw the suggestions that will undoubtedly be made today to his attention.<lb/>
I should now like to turn to another area in which concern has been expressed: that it the very important matter of industrial relations in the National Health Service. Not everybody realises that there are about one million employees in the National Health Service and that in fact it is the largest employer in the country. Of course, industrial relations in the National Health Service attract publicity. When they go wrong, industrial action threatens to harm people already vulnerable because of illness. Until relatively recently industrial action was almost unthinkable in the Health Service, with its traditions of service inherited from voluntary hospitals and other institutions. However, over the last 10 years there have been problems resulting primarily, I think, from two causes: first, as a pressure
<col>1292</col>
stemming from our relative national economic failure coupled with the application of rigid national pay policies. I think these cumulative facts have indeed had a very unhappy effect. Secondly, I believe it to be true that there has been a change of attitude in the National Health workforces and that management has found it very difficult to come to terms with this.<lb/>
The present Government are most anxious to restore responsible collective bargaining within cash limits, so that settlements reached are, and can be seen to be, fair to the staff involved, to the service as a whole and to the taxpayer who foots the bill. Staff will not accept as fair public sector pay settlements markedly out of line with the private sector. Almost inevitably there must be some system of comparability, but the Government have not yet decided its shape in the long term. For the present the Clegg Commission continues to deal with references to it. Its recommendations on ancillaries and ambulance men have already been received and accepted. Its recommendations on nurses and midwives are expected early in the New Year. We hope that, through comparabilities and with the developing system of cash limits, reasonable settlements will be reached within the Whitley Council machinery, because the Government believe they can help by standing back from pay negotiations.<lb/>
There is above all the clear need to foster good personnel and industrial relations at the local level. The Royal Commission made a number of pertinent recommendations. We believe the proposals for changes to the structure and management arrangements of the service, to which I referred earlier, will help and we shall be encouraging health authorities to develop ways of avoiding disruption of the normal flow of work in the National Health Service by avoiding disagreements through consultation and resolving those that arise through negotiation.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to conclude by saying something about the importance we attach to volunteers and the whole of the voluntary movement in the hospital service. The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, drew our attention to this and I think we are all very grateful not only to the Leagues of Hospital Friends but to the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0655"/>
<col>1293</col>
many people who do voluntary work in connection with hospitals.<lb/>
A particular point has arisen, and that is the use of volunteers during industrial disputes. It is during industrial disputes in the National Health Service that the general public can have a role to play. Unlike the management of an industrial concern, NHS management cannot contemplate a shut down during a strike and basic essential clinical services must be maintained. Where these services are threatened by industrial action, National Health Service management must take other measures; and last winter saw heroic measures made by other groups of staff to cover for absent strikers. Nurses were cleaning wards, administrators were stoking boilers and doctors were acting as porters. However, the Government believe it is unfair to the other groups of staff to expect them to pick up all the pieces. We made our position clear when in Opposition last winter and we now believe, and we say again today, that National Health Service management must be and are free to make whatever use of volunteers from the general public they can. Perhaps alone among public services, the NHS always gets a spontaneous response from the public at times of crisis. We believe that the NHS management should be able to tap this fund of goodwill. But, of course, it is not only at times of crisis that volunteers have an important role to play and we support what they can do to complement the National Health Service.<lb/>
There are many speakers today and many experts will be speaking. My noble friend Lord Cullen will be winding up for the Government and will be answering many of the points that are raised; but I should like to say finally that we believe in the importance of getting the best use of resources for the National Health Service. We accept&#x2014;and I understand there are between 78 and 80 different professions involved in the National Health Service&#x2014;how much we depend on all these people. I should like to pay my tribute to the many thousands of people who work in the National Health Service, who give to so many of us of their time, of their skills and of their efforts. All of them are needed to make the Service a success and each one is dependent upon the other. I hope we shall have this sense of belonging to a great service which we all want to
<col>1294</col>
support. It is for these reasons that I and my colleagues welcome this debate today, the interest of your Lordships, and the expert knowledge which you can bring to this debate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02652"><member>The Earl of ERNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will give me the indulgence of the House during my maiden speech. I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for having raised this important question and for giving me the opportunity of addressing your Lordships for the first time.<lb/>
My interest in the question stems from my being a member of the Western Health and Social Services Board in Northern Ireland. The geographical area for which the Board is responsible includes my home county of Fermanagh, which is the most western county in the United Kingdom. It is an extremely remote county, consisting of small farms, forests, moors and lakes. It has a scattered population of 50,000, with some modest industrial development in three major towns.<lb/>
We read with interest about developments in medical science in such fields as heart surgery, brain surgery, and radio-therapy; and we are pleased that these services are available to us at our regional hospitals in Belfast. However, we are much more concerned about our local services and we wonder whether those who plan in the National Health Service and in particular those who influence professional training, may be rather too obsessed by the views expressed in the cities and in the "centres of excellence" and whether perhaps they tend to overlook the somewhat different needs of those of us who live in rural areas.<lb/>
I am informed, for example, that pharmacists and opticians are now required to undertake a university degree course rather than attending a local part-time course as they used to do. One wonders whether they may be more inclined to seek employment in the hospital service in research or in industry rather than to engage in retail pharmacy or eye-testing in small country towns and villages. It is certainly becoming more difficult to attract graduates into retail pharmacies, with the result that many chemists' shops are closing and smaller communities are losing this essential part of our Health Service. Similarly, I believe that the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0656"/>
<col>1295</col>
entry of doctors to general practice is seen to be the subject of regulations imposing compulsory vocational training, which in itself is most desirable so long as that training is not concentrated in the teaching hospitals and the larger centres.<lb/>
I view with some concern the move towards group practices and financial incentives available to those who work in them. I should hope that some corresponding incentive would be made available to those doctors who undertake the much more demanding duties of providing single-handed medical care to village practices&#x2014;practices which are still common and which are so much more appreciated in my part of the country.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to speak with some feeling about two local matters. First, as has been mentioned before, the overall death rate in the West is similar to that of the rest of the Province although the birth rate is appreciably higher. However, the infant mortality rate and the perinatal mortality rate is the highest in the whole of the British Isles. This is due partly to social and economic reasons&#x2014;high unemployment; a high proportion of families receiving social security benefits, combined with relatively poor housing&#x2014;and partly to the lack of sufficient paediatric services.<lb/>
The second local matter to which I should like to refer concerns our county hospital, the Erne Hospital in Enniskillen. This is a modern acute hospital with 215 beds, providing an excellent service to our isolated community. In common with many hospitals of this size, it has been experiencing difficulties in attracting medical staff and in providing acute services. The Western Health and Social Services Board has recently carried out a comprehensive study of our hospitals, under the chairmanship of Dr. Gordon, and has now issued a report in the form of a consultative document. This recommends that the Erne Hospital should be extended to take a larger population and thereby justify increased staffing levels, which should ensure a more reliable service. I feel that it is essential for County Fermanagh to retain and develop this acute hospital, and I fully endorse this recommendation. I hasten to add that my support for this recommendation is not due to the fact that this hospital
<col>1296</col>
shares my name, but is because it is so geographically situated as to meet the needs of the majority of our scattered community. I should like to end by saying that I sincerely hope that adequate hospital services will be retained in neighbouring areas until such time as communications have been considerably improved.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02654"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I be the first to congratulate the noble Earl on his maiden speech, which I found very interesting, and also to thank him for what he said because his speech will fit in very well with mine. I say that because he was speaking for a rural area, while I, of course, am speaking as a GP in a very deprived inner city area, but I am a single-handed practitioner. I started this practice in 1950 and saw it grow. I saw the first patient come in. Before that, I worked as an assistant in a general practice in Chiswick, and prior to that I was <i>locum</i> in Sydenham and in Newcastle. I was in at the inception of the National Health Service, though at that time I was only a <i>locum.</i> So I have seen the service grow.<lb/>
I want to start by talking about general practice and then move on to other things. My practice was built by my wife and myself, she being my unpaid secretary as most doctors' wives are. But, of course, the stage has now been reached where a doctor in my position is allowed to employ up to two people, for which the State pays 70 per cent. of the cost of employing them. So we have moved a long way there. We have also moved to the stage where there is no question of my not being able to get pathology services from the hospitals around me. There is no question of my needing to send my patient to a consultant before he is X-rayed. I can get radiological services from the hospitals around me. I can also get physiotherapy services from the hospitals around me. So we are moving well forward there, too. In any general practice at the moment one can get an attachment to a health visitor and one works closely with social workers, because it is always possible to be in touch with those people in the area. Therefore, over the period that I have practised in this deprived area I have seen the benefits of the Health Service improve consider-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0657"/>
<col>1297</col>
ably, so far as primary health care is concerned<lb/>
The area has changed out of all recognition during my period there, and of course, as in all such areas, I have the usual problems of drug addicts, alcoholics and the like. There is also the continuous problem of homelessness. Perhaps that explains to your Lordships why I so often speak on housing in this House. We could move further in improving primary health care if we improved housing, because a lot of the patients who go to hospital do so because it is not possible to nurse them at hime, as their home conditions do not allow it. Again, we could improve to a tremendous extent the turnover in our hospitals if people could be sent home earlier. There could be more day surgeries and things of that sort. But those matters are tied up with improving the housing in areas such as the one in which I practise. In addition to that, I represented another deprived area at County Hall for 16 years. So I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if most of my speech this afternoon is probably critical. It is because I am really talking about what has been happening to these deprived areas in London, so far as Health Service matters are concerned.<lb/>
When I started my practice, one of the attractions of the area was that there were a large number of teaching hospitals around me. That is one of the reasons why I started there, even though it was a very congested area and other doctors were there. I was taking a big chance when I put my name on the door and waited. When I knew that we were having this debate today, I made contact with those teaching hospitals and found that they had terrific problems, most of which are the result of the resource allocation scheme which has been followed. As I listened to them, I thought that I was back in County Hall, because the way in which London has been treated in the resource allocation scheme is very much like the way in which London is treated in the rate support grant.<lb/>
London never gets its fair share of the rate support grant. What happens is that it is agreed that the rate support grant should be 61 per cent. but then there is a claw-back. The theory is that London has more resources than the rest of the country and can therefore meet its
<col>1298</col>
problems more easily. To some extent that is true; both the City of London and the City of Westminster are quite rich. But poor people live in the City of Westminster. In fact quite a lot of poor people live in Paddington and they have to bear the consequences of those sort of decisions. What is worse is that the East End of London, which is a poor area, usually has to pay these high rates because of the decision that other parts of the country&#x2014;which are, in fact, much wealthier than these areas of London&#x2014;ought to receive more of the resources, since London is better able to take care of itself. That is the basis of this iniquitous way in which the rate support grant is usually distributed.<lb/>
I get the feeling that the same sort of thing happens with the resource allocation scheme and that, as a consequence, London is having a rough time. London does have more teaching hospitals than most parts of the country, but London also has problems which are greater than those in many other parts of the country. Teaching hospitals develop special units, special services. Those services usually serve not just the area, district or region in which the hospital is situated. More often than not, those hospital services serve large areas&#x2014;areas well outside London. This is one point which nobody seems to bear in mind when it comes to the total allocation of resources for London. Nobody has a clear conception of the cost of these special referral units which exist in London but which serve people who do not live in London. What happens is that the regional health authorities nominate regional specialties and they allocate funds for them. Since, however, as I said earlier, they are not too clear about their exact cost, the allocation is never adequate.<lb/>
One of the suggestions I want to make to the Government is that in looking at the National Health Service&#x2014;as, obviously they are doing at the moment&#x2014;the question of more central funding of some of these special units should be seriously considered. May I give your Lordships an example of something that bears out the point in a very clear way. The Royal Free Hospital has a haemophilia unit which costs &#x00A3;10,000 per patient per day. That unit does not serve merely Hampstead; it serves a very much larger area than even the North-West Thames
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0658"/>
<col>1299</col>
area. Such a unit should be centrally funded because I was told that to treat one individual has cost that hospital &#x00A3;100,000. Now &#x00A3;100,000 paid from central funds may not be too heavy a burden, but &#x00A3;100,000 paid by the North Camden district is a terrific sum. Even if, as happened, the region meets a large part of that sum, a great deal of expenditure still falls on North Camden, expenditure which it ought not to be made to bear.<lb/>
I am using this example to illustrate the point that one needs to look a little more closely at the degree to which there can be central funding. I know that there is a certain amount of central funding. For example, Coppetts Wood is a Lassa fever specialist unit, and that is being centrally funded. This is the same sort of thing as the haemophilia unit when it comes to expense. However, there are many other units besides Coppetts Wood which need to be centrally funded and not left to be funded by the local or the regional authority.<lb/>
Another point about London is the cost of the nurses. I am always hearing that we must not have agency nurses, but the truth of the matter is that most London hospitals have trouble getting nurses because of the accommodation problem and because of the cost of living in London. Although there is London weighting, it does not really meet the cost of living in London. Therefore, many of these hospitals can maintain their services only by using agency nurses. When, frequently, I hear that we must reduce the incidence of the use of agency nurses, I have to say, "Think again", for sometimes this is the only way to meet the needs of a particular hospital.<lb/>
I said earlier that I would concentrate on some criticisms. The other side of my story is the question of the area: which I represented in County Hall. I am referring now to the London Borough of Hackney. Recently, the Hackney Borough Council took the decision to withdraw its representatives from the area health authority. I am sure the noble Lord knows that. It was a very serious decision for a borough council to take. In fact, they discussed their action with the other borough councils involved, who were sympathetic but who were not prepared to take the same action.<lb/>
<col>1300</col>
I have spent some time today trying to get at the facts behind their decision to withdraw from the area health authority. The borough council told me that they withdrew from the area health authority because Hackney's interests were not being safeguarded. They told me that 250 acute beds have been closed in Hackney since 1976. The Metropolitan Hospital has been closed; the acute functioning of the German Hospital has been closed. Hackney and St. Leonards are the only hospitals left in Hackney. When they retired from the area health authority it was because there was a proposal to close St. Leonards Hospital. In fact, St. Leonards Hospital has not been closed, although the performance of its accident and emergency wards has been reduced. They function only from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., which means that St. Leonards is not so useful to the people of Hackney as it once was or was expected to be.<lb/>
The borough council also found that although Barts was expected to take the extra work as a result of the closure of these other hospitals, Barts itself was having to close beds. In 1976, Barts closed 40 beds which have never been reopened, and recently the hospital has been made to close a further 78 beds. They found, too, that the Prince of Wales and the Royal Northern Hospitals&#x2014;which are not in their area but just on the border and which can therefore be used&#x2014;were under the threat of having their accident and emergency services closed. They gave me a number of other details but I will not weary your Lordships with those because time is passing. When the suggestion was made that we should also close St. Leonards they decided that they had had enough and Hackney withdrew from the area health authority.<lb/>
This is a serious matter and I have used it to illustrate the point I was making. It is quite easy to say that London has a surfeit of hospital beds. The truth of the matter is that the hospital beds in London serve more than merely the people of London. What is more significant, however, is that the reductions in the allocation to London are in the poor areas of London. Therefore although as a consequence it may well have helped some other poor area in the rest of the country it will certainly have done harm to one of the poorer areas of London.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0659"/>
<col>1301</col>
I have made this case at length because I want the Minister, when he is thinking in terms of next year's extra 3 per cent. to think more carefully of how much of that can go to areas such as the East End of London, because what is really required&#x2014;and Merrison actually said it&#x2014;is an improvement in the resource allocation scheme. It is not&#x2014;certainly so far as London is concerned and it is London that I know about&#x2014;doing the good that one hoped it would in the long term. In fact, it is doing a lot of harm.<lb/>
I do not want to burden your Lordships for longer than I need to. There are many other things that I wanted to say but I want to draw the attention of the Minister to two threatened closures, one of which in fact is not taking place&#x2014;that is, the closure of the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital, which I now know will not take place. The other is the threatened closure of St. Columba's Hospital which is the hospital for terminal cancer up in Spaniards Road in Hampstead, which I gather the area authority of Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster are threatening to close because they cannot see why they should be spending money on people who in fact do not come from their area. That was one of the points that I was making earlier.<lb/>
In the case of the EGA, I know that it is to be reopened but it is to be reopened as a gynaecological hospital, with day patients, 12 beds, a proper out-patient department and an early diagnostic unit, which will be useful for screening for cancer of the cervix, the breast, and so on, and possibly screening as a means of preventive medicine and some health education. All this is quite good but I think the Department misses the point. The EGA was a hospital where women who were sensitive about being treated by men were able to go to be treated by women and it is not only for gynaecological treatment that women feel they need to go to women doctors. The whole ethic behind the agreement to reopen the EGA as a gynaecological hospital suggests that that is the only reason why women want to go to women doctors. That is not true. There are a lot of women who prefer to have women doctors&#x2014;just as, of course, there are a lot of women who prefer to have men doctors. I would not have said, for example, that it was necessary to
<col>1302</col>
build a new EGA, but you have the EGA and therefore you should keep it.<lb/>
What is more, we are now turning out more women doctors than we did before and we need to know how best to use them. I should have thought that what the Government would be interested in doing is using the EGA to enable them to see how best to use women doctors. I am referring to such things as where part-time working can fit in, and so on, because one could do that with a hospital like the EGA which is served by women doctors for women patients. That could give a very good idea of how to fit women generally into the other hospitals in the country.<lb/>
I have spoken for far too long so I will conclude by just making two points. First, my own view, having given some time to studying what is happening, is that there is more need for local influence on decisions. That is my firm conviction. I intended to take a few minutes to comment on Dr. Owen's suggestion that we should elect the health authority. I will not do that at the moment because already I have spoken for too long, but I think it is something that ought to be taken on board. Obviously it could not be done now&#x2014;and here I come back to my local authority theme, which I to not like to do so often&#x2014;unless one had local income tax. It could not be done on the rates. Therefore it is long and not short term, but it is worth thinking about.<lb/>
The second point concerns the community health councils. One should strengthen them&#x2014;and I notice again that Merrison suggests that&#x2014;because they ought to be, and what is more they can be, a good thermometer of what the public want and, since they will know what resources are available, they would be useful vehicles for enabling the viewpoint of the public to be taken into account when decisions are being made. Therefore I hope that more use will be made of community health councils, and I hope the Minister will not pursue the line that he has taken, for example, when he told one of the regional hospital authorities that the statutory provision that there should be three months' delay before the services were withdrawn, in order to have consultation, can be waived because there is an emergency. I hope that emergency excuse will not he used for too long because I do not think it would be a
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0660"/>
<col>1303</col>
good thing for us to start making changes and ignoring the local pressures which can come from community health councils and which can be for good.<lb/>
I had intended to make some remarks on industrial relations, but I will only say one thing. What one needs is sensible machinery, but in the end what one needs are arbitration situations and arbitration which can be accepted. The doctors have a review body, and so do the dentists, for their pay. It is worth giving serious thought to having a similar set-up for the rest of the Health Service. That said, I may add that if that is going to be done there must not be an arbitrary rejection of the report by the Government of the day, as we have had sometimes with the doctors' review body. What we must have is arbitration machinery which, as employers, the Government would be willing to accept; and if the Government accept the machinery and its awards I think it will be found that the employees will also accept the machinery and the awards.<lb/>
I am sorry that I have spoken for much longer than I had intended to, but there are many things in connection with the Health Service about which I feel strongly. On this occasion I felt that I had to put the case for Hackney. When I was told of the action they had taken, which I regarded as very strong action for any borough council to take, I thought I ought to find out what it was and why they did it, and that your Lordships ought to know.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02656"><member>Baroness RYDER of WARSAW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I crave the indulgence of your Lordships in addressing your Lordships' House for the first time. Also I am a newcomer, but I am moved, especially on this occasion today, to speak, if I may, for the silent sufferers in society whom I feel so deeply about. From the very wide spectrum of the problems among the handicapped and disabled I wish to confine myself to adults and children with cancer. Their lack of care constitutes one of the biggest gaps in our society. I refer in particular to people who receive, when possible, surgery and treatment. While some return to a full life, others realise with some alarm that they have entered a twilight world.<lb/>
<col>1304</col>
The real problem arises when they must be discharged from hospital because they are blocking an acute bed needed for many others. Then these people for whom I speak are often left to their own devices. So long as patients need medical nursing care in hospital they are the responsibility of the National Health Service. It is not unknown that a general practitioner has neither the time nor the facilities in his busy practice to visit as frequently needed. Many patients are often in great distress, in need of constant support, full nursing care for 24 hours, and on pain killers. How can the average person with no nursing experience and with a family, perhaps with young children, when the husband or wife must go out to work, cope? Equally, how can a single person alone, often lonely, also cope? Whatever the patients' condition they fully deserve compassion, hope, love and dignity in death.<lb/>
What is to be done? The average cost in my own foundation homes in Britain is between &#x00A3;90 and &#x00A3;120 per week per person, substantially less than the cost of a National Health Service bed. Is it fair, therefore, that we must raise funds both for capital and running costs? The one positive and clear point which emerges while these financial difficulties continue for the Government is that the public at large should be better informed, and from an early age in schools, too. We may rally them. In this way we give the public the opportunity of responding in a far greater and more effective way, based on our long tradition in Britain of giving voluntary service. Any discouragement of such voluntary efforts, of which my own is one, must be a most important factor to the Government as to when they make their cuts and where.<lb/>
Is this help going to be sufficient? I can only say to your Lordships that it is daily a long hard struggle, but we cannot and will not turn our backs upon these needs, which are growing. To illustrate these needs, may I mention the boy Timothy, aged 11, whose illness was prolonged and painful. His parents were devoted to him. He had a great fear of hospitals and needles. He finally had to be admitted to hospital at Christmas time. The staff there were marvellous and gave him a tree and presents. But he would have benefited so much more in a more
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0661"/>
<col>1305</col>
homely place and environment, out of the hospital atmosphere. He died, and later his mother died too.<lb/>
Mr. N., aged 62, has had carcinoma of the bowel. This patient had constant discharge because of his malignant condition and lived in a house where there was no sanitation and no drainage, not uncommon in his part of the country. His wife was near to a nervous breakdown. Mrs. H., aged 49, had a spinal tumour and lived in a terraced house. She slept in a bed in the kitchen. Both her lodgers and neighbours tried to look after her. Conditions became deplorable and she needed long-term nursing care.<lb/>
The four London regions are especially hit by the lack of resources. Successive Secretaries of State, including David Ennals and Patrick Jenkin, wrote to regional and area health authorities to encourage them wherever possible to help voluntary organisations, including the Sue Ryder Foundation, but, alas! the financial situation has, with very few exceptions, precluded this help. The warning lights came on early in the 1970s. The axe is falling upon social services, too, because there is no guarantee, due to cuts in public spending, that an individual in great need will be sponsored for his maintenance.<lb/>
I am deeply aware of the financial crisis facing the Government. Moreover, every aspect of medicine has a huge priority; the field is so wide and the gaps so great. So, alas! we can but plug a few to meet the many. Charitable foundations here should always work, as abroad, together in harness with the Government. For three years the Foundation has benefited from the job creation programme, enabling us to use good unemployed tradesmen and labourers and thus provide the Foundation with an extra 134 beds for short and long-term treatment and nursing care. Now this scheme, too, referred to as STEP, is apparently denied us at the end of 1979.<lb/>
My Lords, I am not here only to complain, but to speak for those who are hidden and sick in society. I have tried to stress the urgency for more assistance from the public and ordinary individuals to meet these tragic needs. I am reminded of the lines written by an Irish poet:
<col>1306</col>
<quote>"Who would once more relight creation's flame</quote>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02657">5.37 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02658"><member>Lord GISBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel it a special privilege to be in a position to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder. A maiden speech is a formidable task, and I know she spoke at short notice; but she has accomplished it with exceptional excellence and commendable brevity. She speaks with a formidable and long record of public service, exceptional service to the sick and disabled, and her name is known worldwide. This House is richer for having her with us, and I know we would all wish to hear her often on health and other matters. I should like to add my congratulations also the the noble Earl, Lord Erne, whose personal expertise and experience will be of great value to this House, particularly as he comes from Northern Ireland. I should like to apologise personally that I will not be able to stay to the end of the debate as I have to go to another appointment. I can only excuse myself by saying that I have not had to do that before.<lb/>
My Lords, before criticising the Health Service one must first accept that many hospitals run very smoothly, efficiently, have flexible working by all, have good will and good management, and in spite of all the difficulties they are thoroughly appreciated by the patients, whom it is all about. But, because that is so, it is no reason for not looking at some of those other hospitals where those conditions do not apply. Whatever I may say does not reflect on those hospitals that are run well and are a credit to the nation.<lb/>
There is a great deal wrong with the service. Over the past five years the waiting-list for admission to hospital rose from half a million to three-quarters of a million, which is surprising considering the huge increase of staff and resources categorised by the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell. In his speech&#x2014;which I am sorry to say I considered to be a bit of class war-fare&#x2014;he mentioned his hatred of private medicine. For one thing, he does not seem to be aware of the machines which were provided by private medicine and which then became available to National
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0662"/>
<col>1307</col>
Health Service patients. He also seemed to forget that whether for Peers, people, or for the union man, private health is paid for by insurance policies for which premiums have been paid. Others may have preferred to spend those premiums on beer. It is a question of choice.<lb/>
The morale of the service dropped, so that a combination of lack of discipline and weak management, caused by over-protective conditions of employment, led to the situation where the ancillary workers were almost able to bring the service to a halt last winter. The situation of ancillary workers trying to dictate terms by which the service will operate continues to this day.<lb/>
We now have the cuts and the great question is where they should fall. The Government have suggested several areas for economies&#x2014;for example, raising prescriptions to realistic figures; charging for traffic casualties; the abolition of the Health Services Board and general good housekeeping. But after that eventually comes jobs, and how will that affect the service? NUPE says: No cuts or the patient will suffer&#x2014;no cuts, above all, to ancillary staff. Yet, who are these ancillary workers who are now complaining about cuts and insisting that patients will suffer? How have many of them shown&#x2014;and how do they show&#x2014;their concern for the patient? We saw how ancillary workers almost brought the Health Service to a halt last winter when they went on strike. At that time management were afraid to be tough and afraid to let volunteers do the jobs. Patients had to be turned away. Even last month at Great Ormond Street Hospital a spreading, irresponsible strike of porters stopped admissions. The strike was caused by the suspension of a shop steward who became involved in a birthday party punch-up. I have in my possession the Press cuttings concerning that dispute. One employee at a hospital is reputed to have said:
<quote>"People die every day: what difference does it make if a few more die".</quote>
At another hospital a drunk porter on a ward was suspended on full pay pending inquiry and that caused an immediate strike by all the other ancillary staff at the hospital; cases of refusal to carry out their jobs; refusal to leave a canteen to help
<col>1308</col>
a 90-year-old woman from an X-ray table and repeated foul abuse to a hospital secretary. There were many examples, and these are just some examples of how some of them behaved. Yet management's hands were tied. Then came the strike. What did doctors find? I refer to a quotation from the <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> It says:
<quote>"There is a further lesson which the dispute has taught us, namely that the hospitals are quieter and function more efficiently when many of these workers are away. We have known for a long time that there are too many ancillary staff for the available work".</quote>
Hospitals varied and some suffered more than others; certainly not all had to put up with the monstrous behaviour that I have started to quote. No doubt there are many hospitals where relations with ancillary staff are excellent. But since the strike, in the bad hospitals, nothing has changed except some lessons have been learnt by management who have found themselves able to take a tougher line. Where four men have turned up to do two men's work, two men have been sent home, and where management has shown resolution the situation has improved.<lb/>
But it is necessary that the Government should speedily amend existing legislation so that those comparatively few disruptive, destructive and non-working workers, who bring disrepute to their hardworking fellow workers, can be removed from the service. There are many economies that could be made&#x2014;altering shifts and breaking some old traditions; but often the men will not even meet management to discuss the matter, in spite of the attempts by management to get them to talk.<lb/>
It is traditional that the ancillary staff work a great deal of overtime&#x2014;a relic of the days of low pay. Now it is difficult to reduce overtime, yet it is very expensive and should not be necessary and its reduction could result in a large economy. So progress to economies that would benefit patients, the economy and in the long run the staff, is often hard and the complicated complaints procedure to achieve dismissal is so heavily loaded in favour of the bad worker as to make discipline very hard to apply. Doctors still have to wheel patients into lifts because the porters are too long in coming. Of course, those conditions vary and there will be hospitals where ancillary staff are hugely co-operative. That does not alter
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0663"/>
<col>1309</col>
the facts of the examples that I have quoted. Nurses still have to undertake menial tasks that should be carried out by ancillary workers employed for that purpose. They still have to re-do work badly done by ancillary workers. All the time spent by doctors and nurses sorting out these problems is time taken from looking after patients. All that behaviour saps the moral of the whole service.<lb/>
In addition, the effects of the reorganisation have only added to the problems: dividing nursing from administration; removing the matron and substituting numbered heads; and removing authority&#x2014;the authority where the buck stops. Nurses used to have time to talk to patients and used to control diet. Since reorganization that is often done by orderlies and often their attitude is impersonal and they have no concern for the patient's welfare. Nurses who have responsibilities to the patients see their pay rates vastly overshadowed by those of administrative staff who have regular hours. Little wonder that trained nurses move to administration and leave a shortage on the wards. Operating theatres close at five o'clock for lack of staff and trained nurses who have gone into administration. It is not surprising what there is a long waiting-list for operations. Yet, one writer states, when referring to administrators before and after the reorganisation:
<quote>"I worked in a hospital of 150 beds and the assistant matron ordered and distributed stores to kitchens and wards. When she was off-duty it was my job, and we were also doing nursing administrative work.</quote>
<quote>"Soon after stated take-over, a man was installed in the stores with a large new desk and large stock book. Soon after that he got a male assistant.</quote>
<quote>"In the local hospital in Huddersfield, the boardroom was taken over by office staff and soon after that a ward was closed to accommodate more office staff.</quote>
<quote>"One consultant may have a secretary of his own. Before takeover, one secretary worked for two or even three consultants".</quote>
I believe that there are now far too many over-protected administrative and ancillary staff. They could be drasticaly pruned without any damage to the patient and probably to the benefit of the morale and smooth running of the service.<lb/>
Now NUPE challenges the present cuts as being detrimental to the patients and the service. Yet its notices in hospitals read, "Stop cuts and save jobs". It is
<col>1310</col>
hypocrisy for them to suggest that they are interested in patients&#x2014;it is only their jobs that they want. Yet a hospital is not a factory or a job creation scheme: it is for sick people and they should be looked after by people who are dedicated. Yet many workers feel that they are in a factory and act with total unconcern for the patients. No one is forcing them to work in a hospital and they should leave and work with inanimate objects.<lb/>
I believe that economies can and must be made by reducing administrative and ancillary staff. The Government must consider whether or not to return to pre-Salmon conditions; scrap the administrative build up; put back the matron with her supreme authority; increase the sphere of the nurses and pay them more for doing so.<lb/>
For all its faults of overmanning, we have in this country exceptional talent in our doctors, we have dedicated nurses and a service sought by foreigners from all over the world and one that gives our own country great service. However, I hope and believe that the philosophy of this Government will succeed in making the most of that talent and dedication, in raising morale and in paring down that part of the service that is overmanned and constitutes a drain to those dedicated to providing a great service.</membercontribution></p>

I have tremendous admiration for the work that the noble Baroness has done; on one occasion I visited one of her homes in Yorkshire and met a Polish girl who had been raped 28 times. I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for bringing this debate to your Lordships' House at this time.<lb/>
Remembrance Sunday has just passed, when I am sure many of your Lordships remembered the souls of the Servicemen who died in the two world wars. My noble friend Lady Darcy de Knayth and the noble Earl, my husband, both lost their fathers serving for this country, as I am sure did many other sons of your Lordships' House. Many men lived,

but remained paralysed from their wounds. It was because of those casualties that the Ministry of Pensions started the National Spinal Injuries Unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1944. It was under the medical direction of Dr. Ludwig Guttman, who revolutionised the treatment of paraplegics. Before that time paraplegics had been considered hopeless cases and generally died in the first few months from urinary tract infection or sepsis from infected pressure sores. The routine then became to turn patients every two or three hours night and day; the treatment of infections; and intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation to teach the patients that they could again return to society and take up useful employment.<lb/>
In 1952 that unit went into the National Health Service serving the whole of the South of England and, being the National Spinal Injuries Centre, taking patients from all parts of the country. Priority has always been given to Service personnel. The hospital was built by Canadians in 1939&#x2013;40 as a temporary emergency hospital. It was meant to last about 10 years. The patching-up process stopped about eight years ago when a new hospital was to have been built. This has never materialised and the wards are still housed in flimsy old nissen huts.<lb/>
The North of England, mainly because of the mining industry, established spinal units when the treatment at Stoke Mandeville had been proved to be effective. The sooner the spinal patient is got to a special unit, the sooner he is returned to the community. Apart from this being by far the best treatment for the patient, it is always the most cost-effective method to the National Health Service. It has been proved time and time again that the hospitals that hold on to their spinal patients and do not refer them to a special unit run into endless problems. Pressure sores develop due to the ward routine not being geared to the spinal patients; urinary and blood conditions arise as many doctors do not expect the complications; contractures of the limbs occur, as often in general hospitals there are not sufficient physiotherapists to treat patients of this sort; and depression of the patients, and their relatives, develops because they become specially difficult patients, as everything starts to go wrong.<lb/>
<col>1312</col>
In a spinal unit there is always someone worse than oneself. I can assure noble Lords that a depressed patient with pressure sores is much more difficult to rehabilitate, and it takes months of unnecessary hospital time to heal the sores that should not develop. Over the years I have had desperate calls from paraplegic patients or their relatives, who have been landed in general hospitals. One was from a young man who had broken his neck while at borstal doing gymnastics. After treatment in a spinal unit he went home; some time after that he developed pneumonia. That was cured, but a massive pressure sore developed because he had not been turned, even though he had asked to be turned. A note written by a student nurse which came into my possession reads:
<quote>"Sue, if you don't get me out of here, I will die".</quote>
It was signed "John". Another example is of a man who had been in a general hospital for 18 months paralysed from the waist down. His mother called me in as her son had tried to commit suicide because of depression. He had terrible sores and contractures and rehabilitation had not started. Both these men needed a voice to speak for them. They went to spinal units and, after years of treatment for their desperate conditions, they are now married and living in the community.<lb/>
In 1970 I tried to get the Government to make spinal injuries resulting in paralysis a notifiable condition. This would have helped the Government to carry out research into where and why such injuries occur. In the past few years it has been evident that the Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital has become overstressed and understaffed, and there has been an increasing inability by the National Health Service to meet the needs of patients belonging to that unit who needed check-ups and on-going care. The National Health Service was failing in its duty to patients.<lb/>
At the spinal units in North of England I could see patients being called back for check-ups and IVP's on a routine basis every year for a review, and every two years for a thorough check. That is good preventative medicine and money well spent, as serious complications can take months in hospital to put right once a condition takes hold. That was unable to happen at Stoke Mandeville
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0665"/>
<col>1313</col>
Hospital which has about 6,000 patients on its books.<lb/>
Last year I visited the spinal unit with Patrick Jenkin, the then shadow spokesman for health. He saw the conditions for himself. With the snows of last winter several of the spinal wards' roofs fell in. I visited the unit again on 1st February, this time with Timothy Raison, the Member of Parliament for that constituency. Two of the wards were closed as the ceilings had fallen in on top of patients. Outside the operating theatre in the main corridor a large bulge in the ceiling had been incised by a surgeon so that the water dripped into a bucket, rather than the whole ceiling should fall down and cause a major disaster.<lb/>
On 7th November a meeting was held by the area health authority to decide whether or not to cut a further ward from the Spinal Injuries Unit, when already the DHSS knows that there are 100 spinal beds short in the South of England and that two proposed much-needed units have not yet been built. The ex-patients could take no more. On 7th November they moved in and had a sit-in to show how strongly they felt. Their placards read such slogans as: "Enough is enough" and a paralysed soldier said "We fought for you. Now fight for us". The whole country knows about this: most newspapers reported it, and the television showed the nation just how serious the situation is.<lb/>
At a conference on 19th September held by the National Association of Health Authorities in England and Wales the Secretary of State, Dr. Gerald Vaughan, said:
<quote>"We have taken on board the Royal Com- mission's point that people must not be left in an agony of indecision and uncertainty about their future"</quote>
Dr. Vaughan is to visit Stoke Mandeville Hospital on the 20th of this month. This is just what he will find. He will also find a spinal unit serving a vast part of England, funded by one area. This point has already been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, who has stressed, as I have, that funding of these special units should be done nationally. Without direct Government reorganisation there will be a disastrous effect on many patients in this part of Buckinghamshire. With a growth rate of 18,000 patients, and a lag of two years' allocation of resources for the current year, the fact
<col>1314</col>
that the Aylesbury and Milton Keynes health district has the most rapidly rising population in the country means that the problems are exacerbated. Already they have a waiting-list of almost 5,500 patients of various surgical conditions, and the Government have told this area to cut services to patients. This district by circumstance of fate, is supposed to run the National Spinal Injuries Unit.<lb/>
The unit in theory is supposed to bring in extra resources for patients treated from outside the region, but in practice this has not happened. I should like to ask the Government what has happened to these extra resources. Would it not be wiser for the Government to treat the national unit as a national responsibility and collect the funds from the various regions and fund the district direct from the DHSS? These vital resources for the National Spinal Injuries Centre are being swallowed up by the Oxford Region, and are not going to where they belong.<lb/>
The Spinal Injuries Association, of which I am chairman, does all it can to help and support the patients and their relatives with spinal injuries. We have written several books to help both sufferers and professionals. We are at present about to publish one on the first 48 hours of nursing care for spinal cord patients. We have three members of staff working flat out, and a voluntary management committee. As a voluntary organisation we shall do all we can to help the Government to keep up the standards of spinal care in this country. The need is urgent.<lb/>
On the 29th March this year I put a Question to Her Majesty's Government asking:
<quote>whether they will ensure that in future volunteers will be able to help in hospitals during emergencies so that patients are protected "&#x2014;[<i>Official Report;</i> col. 1652.]</quote>
Should it not be a human right of all patients who are under the care of Her Majesty's Government that they are well looked after? My Question of 29th March got support from all sides of the House. The noble Lord, Lord Sandys, said:
<quote>"where a robust attitude was taken locally, volunteers were warmly welcomed".&#x2014;<i>[col.</i> 1654]</quote>
We all know that some local authorities are much stronger and better than others. The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, told
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0666"/>
<col>1315</col>
the House that there were some volunteers who had not been able to get through picket lines. The noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, asked:
<quote>"Should it not be possible for people to get through picket lines?"</quote>
He went on to say:
<quote>"People should always be allowed through picket lines. Picketing is the right peacefully to inform and persuade. If the present law is unenforceable, it should be changed".&#x2014;[col. 1656]</quote>
The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, said:
<quote>"we have a number of plans which we propose to put into operation as soon as possible after 9th May".&#x2014;[Col. 1655.]</quote>
His party did not get back into power. May I now ask this Government what they intend to do? Can they negotiate a clear policy so that guidelines are put out throughout the country? Negotiations should be, I feel, with Government, unions, and voluntary bodies dealing with volunteers. Surely it is in the Geneva Convention that patients should be protected.<lb/>
Coming from the poorer North, as I do, I should like to bring to your Lordships' notice the concern from a few people that the proposed new contract for consultants will not benefit patients in the deprived areas. The new contract proposes to encourage private practice. I am all for free enterprise and incentives, but not at the expense of the poor areas where good health needs are so great. I should like to quote to your Lordships from a letter in the <i>British Medical Journal: </i>
<quote>"The Secretary of State should remember that one of his tasks is to safeguard the National Health Service. It is not his duty to subsidise private practice".</quote>
There are many full-time consultants in places or specialties which do not attract private patients, and these consultants are unfairly treated in the new contract. It looks as if the bright young consultants, with young families to educate and support, will be encouraged away from the poor northern areas to the places where there is scope for a thriving private practice. I hope that we do not get a two-tier system in the National Health Service: one for the rich and one for the poor.<lb/>
I should like to end by congratulating the Spastics Society in this International Year
<col>1316</col>
of the Child for the excellent research they have done into ante-natal facilities in this country. It has been found that far more babies of Social Class V, in medical terms, die or are born handicapped. This is partly due to lack of attendance at ante-natal clinics. It has been found from research that pregnant women are not paid during the time they take off to go to ante-natal clinics from working in industry or large plants. Clerical staff would not lose their wages. It seems strange that single women, and those not having paid stamps, do not receive the maternity grant. These, most likely, are the girls and babies in greatest need. As there is a Bill coming into Parliament about this, I hope that the Government will look at this matter in depth. It seems an area that could be much improved.<lb/>
It has also been found that if small babies weighing less than 1,500 grammes when born are transferred quickly to intensive care baby units, at such places as the University College Hospital in London and St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester, their mortality is reduced by 50 per cent. Understaffed baby care units with nurses who do not know how to use ventilators can become dangerous places, especially at weekends, and permanent handicap, which is a terrible cost to the nation, becomes a risk of such places. Regional referral units for intensive care with an expert staff will reduce calamities and be an effective use of existing resources in the long run.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02662"><member>Baroness FISHER of REDNAL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I also join with other noble Members in congratulating the noble Earl, Lord Erne, on his maiden speech this afternoon. He outlined to us that the problems are not just of the capital city of England but are also of the rural areas, in what one would call the far flung parts of Britain. I want to pay special congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw, to whom one listened with great interest, while admiring all the work that she has done for so many years for those less fortunate. The work that she enumerated this afternoon is particularly touching to me because it was this time last year that I lost my husband through that, perhaps one should say, dreadful disease. I hope we shall hear them both speak often in the future.<lb/>

<col>1317</col>
This afternoon we have heard many speakers talking about the top-heavy administration. We have heard from the Government side that there are going to be fresh proposals brought at the end of the year. I hope that the fresh proposals are going to be much better than the Sir Keith Joseph proposals in 1974, when we became a top-heavy, administrative National Health Service. But I wonder. When one gets to administrative level in any organisation, they are the most difficult people to move. You can get rid of the cleaners of your corridors; you can get rid of the women who do the washing up; but the people who earn the money at the higher levels in administrative jobs are the most difficult to get at. I shall be listening with great interest and reading the Government proposals, but I repeat that 1974 was a black day for the National Health Service under the Conservatives and we hope for better at the end of this year.<lb/>
This afternoon noble Lords have been talking about hospital closures. I do not have a great deal of knowledge about the situation of London hospitals and therefore will not speak about them, but I do know about those in another great city, Birmingham, and the feeling that the people of Birmingham have for their local hospitals is exactly the same as the feeling people have for their hospitals in Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and elsewhere. I cannot emphasise too much that people have strong feelings for their local hospitals as a result of trust and confidence having been built up in the services which are provided by those hospitals, service given by staff at all levels. These local feelings are of the greatest importance because they show consumer satisfaction, or dissatisfaction as the case may be, and are expressed clearly.<lb/>
About 18 months ago the Birmingham Accident Hospital, which has a national reputation, particularly for its injury unit concerned especially with industrial injuries&#x2014;and the West Midlands, being a great industrial area, has many industrial injuries&#x2014;and an excellent burns unit and a special unit dealing with road traffic accidents was under threat. This hospital is in a very old building that was provided by the City Fathers of Birmingham many years ago. It is worth reminding our-
<col>1318</col>
selves when we talk about cuts in expenditure that, if our Victorian forefathers had talked about such cuts, we would not today have hospitals for use in our National Health Service because the majority of them are in such buildings, and the Birmingham Accident Hospital is no exception.<lb/>
The powers-that-be decided that the building was not good enough because they could not purchase the equipment necessary to benefit the hospital and the patients. But there were strong feelings in the area over the issue and the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail</i> ran a campaign, as a result of which many thousands of pound were contributed to the hospital by trade union branches, women's organisations, Rotary, patients, patients' relatives and many others, the money supplying exactly the equipment that could not be provided from public funds. The result was that they got exactly the equipment the medical staff were asking for in that hospital. We are keeping our fingers crossed that the Birmingham Accident Hospital does not close.<lb/>
How many people consider what happens when a local hospital closes? It is not like closing a local pub so that people cannot pick up their beer on the way home and drink it in the house. We are talking about hospital beds that normally contain patients; hospitals have casualty and out-patient departments. What happens to the people who attend those? They do not just disappear into thin air. Instead, they go further down the list and join the long queues already in existence at established hospitals. I sometimes feel that the people who decide on hospital closures imagine that once the doors are closed the patients just go away, like closing a cinema and the people saying, "We will not go to the pictures any more".<lb/>
When the question of staff is discussed we should particularly bear in mind staff morale in the National Health Service. When morale is low industrial unrest can be caused. The point I wish to stress is that hospital closures are usually decisions arising from economic considerations; no medical considerations are taken into account. What is particularly worrying for those who work in the NHS, whether at the lower levels of the ancillary staff or whether at the higher levels of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0668"/>
<col>1319</col>
consultancy, is that those who are advising the Government on cuts in expenditure and economies are in the higher echelons of the Civil Service, and when they bring forward closure recommendations they are themselves completely shielded from the effects of their decision. They are the people who enjoy large pensions on retirement, inflation-proofed because of their own action, and they have the prospect of retiring five years earlier than the average manual worker, after complete job security.<lb/>
Is it any wonder that the morale of those who work in our hospitals is undermined when the Government are assisted by such people who have no idea what their decisions and recommendations mean? As I have said, their decisions are economic ones. They look at graphs and statistics and make the figures do what they want. But the figures are people; they are the thousands of women who are waiting throughout the country for gynaecological and obstetric treatment. The figures and graphs must be interpreted into the children who are waiting for orthopaedic treatment. A Sheffield doctor, speaking out a few weeks ago, said that if treatment is not given early, children will be condemned for the rest of their lives. Those are the statistics which have to be related in human terms&#x2014;men who are waiting for treatment, losing time off work and perhaps reducing production figures because of long queues for routine surgery. Certainly we must not waste money in the National Health Service and we must keep a watch on that, but when we are thinking of closing hospitals let us not get bogged down in economics. And before any local hospital is closed, the decision must be taken on a sound medical view of the situation and perhaps some of the economic arguments should be disregarded.<lb/>
On the question of expenditure that is permitted, we see new hospital buildings and extended wards which cannot be used because we do not have enough money left in the kitty to man and run them. A man is now working for the Government and is going through all the Civil Service departments; I believe his name is Mr. Rayner who comes from a large firm called Marks and Spencer. I am not sure his organisation would not be building and opening
<col>1320</col>
shops in High Streets only to say, "They will not be open for 12 or 18 months because we do not have enough money for the tills and women to serve the customers" That is what it comes to. What the general public are saying is, "What a cockeyed way to run a hospital service!", when they see new buildings standing there but not enough money to pay the staff to run them and treat the patients.<lb/>
I appreciate that the National Health Service will not suffer quite as severely as local authorities from the economy cuts. But it must be emphasised that the National Health Service is dependent upon the personal social services that a local authority provides, and so any serious cut-backs in home helps, night-watching services, or meals-on-wheels will automatically result in a greater pressure on geriatric provision in hospitals, because directors of social services will not carry the can for any difficulties that might arise among the elderly people they serve.<lb/>
We have heard figures this afternoon about National Health Service expenditure. People obtain figures from all kinds of places, and perhaps mine have come from a different place than those already quoted. However. National Health Service expenditure as a proportion of overall Government spending has declined rapidly since 1964. In 1964 15&#x00B7;1 per cent. of overall Government spending was on the National Health Service. In 1973 the percentage fell to 13&#x00B7;75, and in 1974 it dropped to 11&#x00B7;58 per cent. Perhaps I may leave it to the Minister who is to reply to bring the House up-to-date on overall Government spending figures for 1975, 1976 and 1977.<lb/>
I want to refer to a particular group of persons catered for in the National Health Service who cannot speak up for themselves; others have to speak for them. I speak on behalf of those thousands of people who are mentally handicapped. Time and time again not only this Government but the Government whom I supported have paid lip service to the needs of the mentally handicapped. I suppose that a reason for this is that these people cannot speak up for themselves. They cannot make their own protests, and very often their relatives do not want to make too much fuss because, unfortunately, they feel that there is a stigma attached to mental handicap. There is a propaganda
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0669"/>
<col>1321</col>
campaign&#x2014;and I say that it is a propaganda campaign&#x2014;for community care for the mentally handicapped. I believe that it is a completely dishonest campaign, and it is a trick. It is aimed at getting the public, especially those engaged in the mental health field, to accept a running down of the National Health Service in the vague belief that other services exist for the mentally handicapped. Up and down the country, local authorities have not been able to provide after-care facilities or ongoing services for the mentally handicapped. I believe that the trick of community care that is being played on the mentally handicapped ought to be exposed.<lb/>
I accept that under the National Health Service, there has been a marked improvement in the health care of thousands and thousands of people. Thousands and thousands of people have been very greatful for a return to good health. However, we must accept&#x2014;and this point was touched upon by my noble friend Lord Pitt of Hampstead in relation to the London area&#x2014;that those areas in the country with the most serious health problems have the poorest facilities and the fewest doctors; and in that way there are two divisions in the country. Many of the old industrial cities have very poor facilities. As my noble friend Lord Pitt said, they do not have the benefits of the large teaching hospitals which could help them out. They have old, Victorian buildings, converted from work-houses. Statistics show clearly that those areas represent the black spots on the map in our National Health Service. Is it merely wishful thinking to suggest that perhaps some of the eminent consultants who practice in the London teaching hospitals might give their services&#x2014;I do not say voluntarily&#x2014;to those regions of the country so starved of facilities, even if for only two days a month?<lb/>
I do not want to delay the House too long, but I want to refer to fears that I believe are being expressed regarding the state of general practice in inner city areas. I speak as one from a large city that has its fair share of inner city problems. These fears are real. Doctors are no different than other people, in that if they can get an easier job in easier surroundings, they will go for that job. But it is important that the inner city areas are protected and that those doctors
<col>1322</col>
who are willing to work in such areas should be encouraged. Therefore I wish to ask the Government what future capital provision they are contemplating for these areas and for the GPs who are volunteering to work in them. I have in mind the kind of provision that is so necessary for health centres, so that there are available all the ancillary staff&#x2014;the marriage guidance counsellors, the psychiatrists, the nurses and all the other people&#x2014;who make up a complete team for the GP. If we are able to do this, there will be a considerable saving in drugs, through getting rid of stress. As the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, said, it is easier to give pills than to give treatment.<lb/>
My final words will be about children, a matter which has been touched upon by previous speakers. We must recognise that one of the best investments of a nation is to give its children a good start. As we heard this afternoon, Britain is not at the top of the league table in regard to infant mortality. Fifteen out of every thousand babies in this country die within a few days of birth. There are many babies with abnormalities and malformations, and one wonders why this should be. Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that he will undertake serious investigations and research regarding the infant mortality figures that were published last week. These figures cause great concern to those of us who live in the West Midlands&#x2014;I am not saying in Birmingham&#x2014;where there was quite a high incidence of infant mortality. There must be reasons for this. If one re-reads the court report one realises that today in this country children still die from 19th century causes.<lb/>
I am not going to go into the question of increased prescription charges, which has already been discussed. However, I believe that while asking the patient to pay more for a prescription the Government should seriously consider asking the drug companies who have a complete monopoly in supplying the National Health Service whether they will take a cut and perhaps less profit.<lb/>
I have been in active politics for a long time. I do not speak as an expert on medical matters, except to say that if one receives the services&#x2014;and I have received them over the last 12 months on behalf of my husband&#x2014;one sees that excellent
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0670"/>
<col>1323</col>
service can be given, and one worries when one hears criticisms being levelled. I could have levelled many criticisms during my long time visiting hospitals, but it was said this afternoon, I think, that there are over 1 million people working in the National Health Service. There are also over 1 million people using the National Health Service every day, and their grumbles and their dissatisfaction permeates down to the people that work inside it. Here I would say that the morale of ambulancemen is lessened as people complain that they are having to wait two hours or three hours for an ambulance to return them home; and that the morale of the cook in the hospital declines as the catering officer says, "We have got to cut back; we have not got as much money to spend", so that he or she has to serve less appetising meals. And so their morale, already low, continues to sink.<lb/>
I do not want to keep the House any longer because I know that there are many speakers who have interesting things to say. My final words would therefore be that I do not think the National Health Service has failed. What has happened is that it has lacked a real chance. I think that noble Lords sitting on this side of the House should perhaps accept some criticism, in that they looked upon the National Health Service too sympathetically and too paternalistically, instead of accepting that it was Nye Bevan who brought forward our National Health Service, and our memory to him should have been much more forceful in making it a better service than it is. When we established the National Health Service we had to accept that it was a compromise between the vested interests of the medical profession. I think that was recognised by this side of the House at that time; but what we have today&#x2014;and this is recognised by many doctors who speak out against the inability of the National Health Service to provide all that their training qualifies them to do&#x2014;is that interest being usurped by economists and balance sheet budgeteers.<lb/>
I am sorry I have spoken so long, although I could perhaps have said a lot more. I do not speak very often in this House, but I have spoken this afternoon because I have been 16 years as a councillor in what might be called a down-town area
<col>1324</col>
in the City of Birmingham and the time I spent in the other House was again as a representative of a down-town constituency; so I know what poor housing and bad standards all round mean in health care. All I would say this afternoon is that I look forward to the Government bringing forward a much more imaginative proposal for the future of the National Health Service.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02664"><member>Lord ROCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from these Benches I should like to join in congratulating the noble Earl, Lord Erne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw, on their maiden speeches. If I may say so, I particularly admired the evident compassion&#x2014;I suppose it was predictable&#x2014;with which the noble Baroness spoke. I want to speak on that part of the Motion which deals with the need to improve industrial relations in the Health Service, and I approach the subject with considerable diffidence because I have absolutely no experience of these matters in the service itself.<lb/>
First, on the question of structure, I certainly subscribe to the objective of shortening the distance between senior management and staff as an aid to achieving a number of desirable ends&#x2014;strengthening management in the front line; improving communications, both upwards and downwards; and helping to ensure that when disputes arise they are settled at the lowest possible level. As regards support for our front-line management, in my view specialising in the industrial relations field can nowadays lead to training on and off the job to develop considerable expertise in this field, and this is necessary if the management team of which they form a part is to have a chance to maintain sound industrial relations. I would add that from what I have read and heard it appears to me that the level at which the personnel function in the Health Service is most in need of strengthening is that of the district. But noble Lords who are closely involved in the service will of course be better judges than I am on that point.<lb/>
In the matter of communications, it is essential, in my experience, not only that management at every level in an organisation should know from those above and below them what is going on, but more
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0671"/>
<col>1325</col>
particularly that at the very lowest level there are meetings of staff which are held on a regular basis, so that there is a recognised forum for discussing matters of general concern before they develop into industrial disputes. When disputes do arise, it is essential, as I have said, that they should be settled at the lowest possible level, and this cannot be done without an adequate negotiating procedure for dealing with both individual and collective complaints. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service had a good deal to say on this point in their evidence to the Royal Commission, and I noticed that in their own conclusions the Commission welcomed the proposals on the matter which had been put to the General Whitley Council, and hoped they would soon be introduced. In this, I would strongly support the Commission, but add that every bit as important as the establishment of such procedures is training aimed at ensuring that they are observed. I know something of this at first hand, and particularly of the difficulties which can sometimes arise in trying to arrange for the training of management, supervisors and shop stewards in a large organisation being done jointly; but from the same experience I also know that success in such training will be achieved only if there is a joint commitment to it by both management and trade unions.<lb/>
I should like to turn now to this vexed question of how national disputes about pay in the Health Service are in future to be resolved. The Royal Commission understandably felt that it would take some time to devise a workable procedure; but I was frankly surprised to learn of their recommendation that the initiative in this matter should come from the TUC alone. It has long been my view that the pay of people employed in certain key occupations which are vital to the support of life should be determined by a single, independent body representing employers and employees, and comprising also an element independent of both employers and trade unions but acceptable to their representatives. I think, further, that the maintenance and independence of this body should be guaranteed by commitments entered into, not only by the Government of the day but also by the main Opposition parties, which commitments would include an undertaking that
<col>1326</col>
in all circumstances, and irrespective of incomes policies, the findings of the body would be implemented.<lb/>
I do not think it is practicable that the people whose pay would thus be determined should be required to forego their ultimate right to strike in return for this special treatment, since in the case of the Armed Forces and the police they have no such right to forego and the representatives of others seem to me to be highly unlikely to surrender their pay negotiating rights. Indeed, it was partly for this reason that I could not see how the general body of Health Service employees could be included in any such arrangements at their inception. However, this whole process has been speeded up by the events of last winter and, as we all know, the pay of ambulancemen and of health staff ancillaries has now been adjudicated on by the Clegg Comparability Commission. That being so&#x2014;and I was interested in what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, had to say on this this afternoon&#x2014;it seems to me best that we should now try to build on the work that the Clegg Commission has begun, thus preserving that continuity of policy which with the rejection first of the Prices and Incomes Board and later of the Relativities Board has in recent years been so conspicuously lacking.<lb/>
The Clegg Commission's terms of reference included responsibility to
<quote>"&#x2026; assess the appropriate form of comparisons with terms and conditions in other sections of the economy and identify relevant comparitors".</quote>
A less well publicised aspect of the same terms of reference was in the particular service under review
<quote>"to report on the possibility of maintaining appropriate internal relativities".</quote>
It is perhaps understandable that in the time available the Clegg Commission seem to have paid more attention to external comparisons than to internal relativities. However, in my view this is a matter for regret, for it would no doubt be generally acknowledged that a certain instability has been caused in Health Service industrial relations by the inadequacy of current Whitley Council pay negotiating machinery and the discrepancies that this creates in terms of internal relativities. More particularly, reference to the Clegg Commission of the claim of
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0672"/>
<col>1327</col>
Health Service ancillary staffs before that of nursing staffs seems to have led to an award for ancillary staffs based on external comparisons which carried with it the risk that the service could suffer all the consequences of an inflationary settlement without benefiting from the stability to be obtained from acceptable internal relativities.<lb/>
However, better late than never. With some trepidation, I should now like to suggest that consideration should be given to establishing a job evaluation scheme having the widest possible application among Health Service employees and based on factor analysis of the same kind that was or has been used in the points scoring system for jobs at corporal level in the armed forces of which the Clegg Commission made some use in its first findings. In evaluating jobs, account could thus be taken of requirements such as previous training, experience, responsibility, physical or mental skill, the working environment and other factors which are relevant to the Health Service.<lb/>
It is always risky to seek to transpose experience in one working environment to another, particularly when that experience is out of date. I well recall that when about 15 years ago we were seeking in the company for which I then worked to introduce, with the agreement of the unions concerned, what could be loosely called a productivity bargain, we could not have done this without an established job evaluation scheme which was applicable to all our general workers. We were endeavouring at the same time to bring the employment conditions of weekly wage earners more closely into line with those of monthly salaried staff, to inculcate the changes in attitude which those improved employment conditions necessitated, and to involve the employees concerned in deciding how productivity was to be improved. What happened very briefly was that those working in each plant were invited to determine, together with management, what work was to be done by whom, and then they were rewarded under the job evaluation scheme that we had on the basis of the degree of responsibility and other requirements for each reconstituted job in accordance with rates of pay for the various categories that had been agreed with the unions concerned.<lb/>
<col>1328</col>
I can only say that it has always seemed to me that that was the best example of employee participation in real life that I have known. I recall moreover that senior line managers closely involved in the exercise at the time told me that it worked primarily because of the great efforts that were made to give management and supervisors generally training in what for want of a better word might be called leadership. That is another story, but it is relevant I suggest to this debate because in my experience it is the quality of leadership, management, getting things done through people, whatever you care to call it, which more than any other factor contributes to the success or the failure of an organisation.<lb/>
I know that the situation in the public services today is very different from that in industry at the time of which I have been speaking, not least in relation to the reduced amount of money and the number of jobs that are now available. But I should like to ask the noble Lord who is to reply to the debate whether he thinks that there is any prospect of some such imaginative approach as I have sought to suggest being made to this problem of pay relativities within the Health Service, bringing in, as I have tried to indicate, even more desirable objectives into view including, as we are reminded by the Motion before us, the more efficient use of resources, particularly of people. It might be that those of your Lordships who have much closer knowledge than I possess of the operation of the Health Service will be able to think of all sorts of reasons why such a task cannot now be carried out: the size of the organisation, the possible cost of the exercise, and so on. Clearly it is for people other than me to determine how far the task is practicable and, to the extent that it is, the agencies that should be involved in undertaking it: the Clegg Commission, Whitley Councils, the General Whitley Council I suppose it would be, or some other body. I am consoled, however, by the reflection that, in my experience it has often been found useful for someone from outside to make a suggestion that is immediately seen by the insider to have obvious flaws in its first presentation but which nevertheless sparks off some variation of the same idea that eventually proves helpful. I hope it may prove to be so in this case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02666"><member>Lord RICHARDSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my congratulations and pleasure at having heard the maiden speeches of the noble Earl, Lord Erne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw. Both said things that must have had great interest to your Lordships and, in particular, to a doctor. Towards the end of his speech, the noble Lord, Lord Rochester, referred to what seems to me the very pertinent wording of Lord Winstanley's Motion:
<quote>"&#x2026; the necessity for the more efficient use of existing resources".</quote>
The noble Lord, Lord Rochester, added to that: "This means, of people".<lb/>
We have heard the word morale "frequently throughout the afternoon. Morale is very difficult to define but it was studied in depth by a professor of psychology at Cambridge Unversity as a result of his experience in the First World War. He incorporated it in a classical book called <i>Psychology and the Soldier.</i> His name was Sir Frederick Bartlett. He looked at morale on different levels. We use the word now so often in relation to the frustrations of our hopes&#x2014;often unfortunately financial, and sometimes in terms of the resources that are available to us to do our jobs. That is one level.<lb/>
Sir Frederick looked at it at the level of discipline and imposed morale. Discipline is not a feature of our national life at the present time; but he regarded true morale as something that is within the individual and that can withstand external forces which are inimical to him, and yet maintain a line of conduct that is directed to the service of those in a wide field and beyond his own interest. We are told&#x2014;and I fear it is true&#x2014;that morale is low in the Health Service, to which I am personally devoted. It is low at various levels, but if we are to make the most of our man and woman power&#x2014;people&#x2014;we have to try to do something to help the formation of a true morale coming from within.<lb/>
In the war, service hospitals, when on active service in the field, had exactly the same quota of equipment and staff, one with another, the only difference being in actual size, and yet all those hospitals, were different. They all had their own particular sense of pride in their difference:
<col>1330</col>
they all wished to show their visitors the special things that they did particularly well, and their morale was extremely high. Of course, they had the great advantage that the war must be won and liberty must be established; but they had disadvantages in that they were mobile and constantly moving, roots could not be put down and there was no surrounding community to support them.<lb/>
In our civilian life we have still the advantage of a common purpose, and that common purpose is not just the service of a patient or of the public in an abstract way: it is the service of ourselves and our own. We are the patients and we are the public. In civilian life we do not suffer from the disability of mobility. Our local area is our local area and we do not suffer from the unavailability of local support.<lb/>
What I am coming to is this: that in any reorganisation and in any thinking, I do beg that the local interest is mobilised to the utmost. Other noble Lords have made this point this afternoon but I wish to make it most strongly, and I can claim to have worked in hospitals of various kinds ever since the inception of the National Health Service. Locally you can develop pride, locally you can develop service. People like working on medical matters. There is no difficulty in getting volunteers. Those in local service find it the mot interesting of all subjects, so they tell me. There is no trouble about getting people involved and interested if the opportunity is given to them and if they see that the fruits of their work are going into the areas of their interest, namely locally; and if financial saving is made it benefits the local situation.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Young, referred to volunteers and to her enthusiasm for them. Indeed, I hope the point is really well taken by the Government. The noble Baroness, Lady Ryder, talked about voluntary organisations&#x2014;yes, again, indeed. They must be encouraged and they must be made to work.<lb/>
There is another thing that will promote a change in attitude, and that is of course very much the most important psychological aspect of the disturbances in the Health Service. It is the withdrawal of constant criticism. The noble Baroness, Lady Fisher, touched on this very clearly. She talked in relation to the cooks who are disappointed in that they cannot get the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0674"/>
<col>1331</col>
equipment they need. That applies at all levels, and there has been for years the insidious development of a feeling that it is a good thing to develop a demand for complaint instead of a demand for advice and help, instead of promoting some gratitude. Gratitude, of course, promotes effort and energy whereas carping criticism promotes anger and inertia. So I hope that the movement towards always trying to develop ever more complicated methods of complaint is looked at again so that the object of getting the very best for the patient can be seen not necessarily to be achieved by antagonising those who for the most part, at all levels of the hospital, are trying desperately hard to make the best of the resources that, we have heard over and over again this afternoon, are limited and are going to be limited.<lb/>
When I was working at that great hospital across the water and I went to talk to a patient newly arrived and said, "How are you? How are you settling in?" over and over again I was told exactly the same thing. It was not just the welcome on the ward by the kind nurses and the gracious sister: it was the porters, my Lords&#x2014;the porters in the porters' lodge who got the people out of the ambulances or the hospital cars and wheeled them or walked with them down the hospital corridors and carried their bags. It was they who made the patient welcome, and the result on the patient was quite dramatic: they were peaceful and prepared to face whatever had to be. That was only a minimum of time ago. There are many who will do exactly the same thing now. It has to be fostered and encouraged; the attitudes have to be changed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02668"><member>Lord AUCKLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the two maiden speeches to which we have listened today have been of unique distinction. My noble friend, Lord Erne talked of hospitals and medical services in a very troubled part of the country, where nurses and doctors have to cope not only with what one might call conventional patients, but also with those who are victims of bombs and other very nasty and horrible forms of attack, and, alas! such incidents still take place in that part of the country. The noble Baroness, Lady Ryder, made what I thought was the
<col>1332</col>
most outstanding speech that I have heard in the 20 years or so in which I have been in this House. It was a speech of quite unique distinction, from somebody to whom many thousands of disabled and handicapped people owe so much, because, if it were not for the noble Baroness and her very worthy helpers, many who are already cruelly disabled would be very much more so today. The House will hope to hear from the noble Baroness very frequently in the future.<lb/>
I shudder to think how many times I have spoken on the National Health Service in various guises, since I entered your Lordships' House. Indeed, the last time I spoke on it was in a debate which I myself initiated on 6th July, 1977, and I certainly do not propose to go over those points again. But the House is indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for enabling this very effectively worded Motion to be debated today and, as we might have expected, he presented his case clearly and very fairly and made a number of points which we all hope the Government will take on board.<lb/>
In regard to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, for whom I have had genuine respect and devotion over the years, because he himself has done so much for the National Health Service, I must say that I listened to the earlier part of his speech, at any rate, with a certain amount of depression. I say that because, in some ways, it was a re-run of his response to my own speech on 6th July, 1977, when the noble Lord was himself the holder of distinguished office in the then Government.<lb/>
I just want to say this about private practice. I am one of those noble Lords in this House who do not use private practice. For financial and other reasons, my family and I use the National Health Service and, generally speaking, we have had excellent service from it. But if I may make very brief mention of the Wellington Hospital, I happened to visit that hospital fairly recently and talked to the medical superintendent, the hospital secretary and others. It is a fact that, in practice, the nurses there get rather less remuneration than nurses in the National Health Service, although it is perfectly true to say that the accommodation and possible other bonuses are more favourable.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0675"/>
<col>1333</col>
But I have never been very convinced by the argument that, because we have private practice in this country, it is siphoning off large numbers of nurses from the National Health Service. I served on the house committees of two hospitals, one a children's hospital and the other a mental hospital, before the reorganisation of the National Health Service, and I really wonder whether there is a single country in the world&#x2014;and I include the Comecon countries, of which I have visited two&#x2014;where there is not some form of private practice in operation.<lb/>
Despite what the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, may say about my noble friends and myself, and about our attitudes to the National Health Service, I have always supported the concept of a National Health Service. I have read several times the reports of the debates in 1948, when the late Mr. Aneurin Bevan moved the Second Reading and other stages of the Bill, which followed very closely on the plans of the late Lord Beveridge. Even at that time&#x2014;I have said this before in your Lordships' House&#x2014;there was no open hostility in the Conservative Party to the Health Service as such, even though some of the proposals which were put forward at that time were regarded with a certain amount of scepticism, which has in some respects, at any rate, proved to be justified.<lb/>
But the word which must really pervade any Health Service debate is "dedication", and I believe that nurses, doctors and others who work in the Health Service today are as dedicated as they have ever been, despite the fact that, as has been said, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Richardson, in a very distinguished speech, morale is certainly not as high as it might be. The reasons for this are in some cases beyond the wit of any political party. Overall, the amount of money which is being spent on the Health Service today is higher than at any other time. Whether it is spent more or less wisely than at any other time is a matter for conjecture.<lb/>
I speak with some feeling about the pay and conditions of nurses, because, like many noble Lords, I have a daughter who is a second-year student nurse at one of the big London teaching hospitals, where she generally enjoys her job and gets on well with her patients; and if she had
<col>1334</col>
not been dedicated to the nursing profession she would not have gone into that job. The rent which they have to pay for accommodation in nurses' homes, which are very often old, and undecorated, is, more often than not, the reason for morale not being as high as it might be.<lb/>
We have to realise that, particularly in our teaching hospitals, we have nurses not only from Essex but also from Penzance and Wick&#x2014;and similarly with doctors. Also, of course, we have nurses from many countries overseas&#x2014;from both the old and the new Commonwealth and also from other parts of the world. To them, the nurses' home, for probably 50 weeks of the year, is their home. As I have said, some of the conditions in those homes are certainly not all that they might be.<lb/>
I have given my noble friend notice of a number of other questions, but I should like to ask him whether, as soon as financial conditions allow, the Government will give priority to making sure that not only in the London teaching hospitals but also in the hospitals of big cities like Birmingham&#x2014;a friend of ours is a doctor at the accident hospital there&#x2014;there is a campaign to upgrade nurses' homes. I think that this would do a great deal to improve morale within the Health Service.<lb/>
The other problem surrounding the Health Service is the plethora of blue papers, green papers and others that we have had upon the service. All of these committees have been headed by such distinguished people as the noble Lord, Lord Porritt, the late Lord Platt and the noble Lord, Lord Briggs, a copy of whose report, which dates back to 1972, I happen to have here.<lb/>
I should also like to ask my noble friend when the Government intend to act on some of the more important proposals which Briggs put forward regarding the committee on nursing services. Successive Governments seem to have fought shy of this. May I draw your Lordships' attention to paragraph 1 of Chapter 1 which deals with the background to the work of the committee. I quote its purpose:
<quote>"To review the role of the nurse and the midwife in the hospital and the community and the education and training required for that role so that the best use is made of available manpower to meet present needs and the needs of an integrated health service".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0676"/>
<col>1335</col>
Much has happened in the Health Service since then, but the same urgent problems remain to be solved.<lb/>
There has been, alas! the reorganisation of the Health Service under the party which I support. I make no apologies for having opposed that particular scheme root and branch ever since I spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill. I hope, with others who have spoken, that any reorganisation, any removal of a tier, ensures some local representation. I am thinking in particular of the local hospital management and house committees. Although I am no expert on the question of industrial unrest, I venture to suggest that at least some of the industrial unrest which we have had in our hospitals is due to the lack of communication in a very large organisation. When there were hospital management committees, a relatively small complaint could often be looked at very quickly, even if not rectified. I know from the experience of one of our local mental hospitals that very often one now has to wait some time before the local area health authority or community health council visits that particular hospital.<lb/>
These are the kind of matters which I think the noble Lord has put at the forefront of the debate. As a result of it, I hope that we shall get at least reassurance from the Government on two matters: first, that when the new reorganisation&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;takes place, communication will be the foremost point to be looked at ; secondly, that the nurses' pay review will be looked at as quickly as possible. At the moment, not only in this country but in others, nurses are having to do all kinds of jobs. In casualty departments, very often they have to cope with drunken and violent patients. For this kind of work they get no extra pay. It is a miracle how many survive the course.<lb/>
I have said this before in your Lordships' House but I conclude with these words: the National Health Service of this country is an example to the rest of the world of how medical treatment is given, devotedly and conscientiously. It is unfortunate, when there is industrial unrest from time to time and when a patient dies on the operating table, that the communication media publicise it to the hilt. It is right that these things should be publicised.<lb/>
<col>1336</col>
Equally, it is essential, when this country is going through a difficult period and will do so for some time to come, that our National Health Service's creditable points should be revealed&#x2014;because they far outweigh the others&#x2014;so that those who use the Health Service, and above all those who work in it, are assured of at least the goodwill of Parliament for their welfare.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02670"><member>Baroness DARCY DE KNAYTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for initiating this debate and for giving us the opportunity to hear two maiden speakers, whom I should like to congratulate most warmly on extremely interesting speeches. I should also like to express my admiration for the work done by the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw. I have no intention of likening the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, to the Mafia, but having been involved in the sit-in last week at Stoke Mandeville when ex-patients occupied two wards at that hospital, I really did feel that in presenting us this week with an opportunity to take part in this debate he was making an offer that I could not refuse.<lb/>
My noble friend beside me on the "mobile bench" has already spoken of the problems of the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville. She spoke of their serious consequences in the debate on the family last month, so I shall try not to bore your Lordships by going over ground which has already been covered. However, the present problems of the NSIC are so important and so urgent that I really do feel that they bear underlining.<lb/>
First let me tell your Lordships very briefly about the sit-in, because perhaps not many of your Lordships have ever been involved in a demonstration of this sort. The sit-in started on 7th November, the day that the Bucks Area Health Authority were to meet to decide upon the proposed closure of one whole female ward&#x2014;what was the only other female ward is now a mixed ward&#x2014;and also on the closure of the children's annexe which has recently been renovated by voluntary contribution. Unlike most demonstrations, this had no political or union undertones whatsoever. It was organised entirely by paraplegics, among
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0677"/>
<col>1337</col>
them ex-servicemen, retired civil servants, a solicitor, an ex-jockey, housewives. They were all ex-patients who were so worried by the proposed cutbacks that they felt some action was necessary. I think it would be true to say that none of these people had ever been involved in a demonstration of any kind before.<lb/>
The sit-in was well organised, well behaved and caused no serious disruption to the running of the hospital, only minor inconveniences&#x2014;and it had its effect. The area health authority deferred its decision until after the Minister of State for Health visits the NSIC on the 20th November. The Member of Parliament for the area came down to discuss the problems and the Minister himself had a friendly, and I hope constructive, consultation with a small deputation of us, and agreed to meet the ex-patients again when he visits the unit and talks with the consultants there on 20th November.<lb/>
When I spoke of ex-patients, I should really say "old patients" or "on-going patients" because in the case of spinal cord injury there is no such thing as an ex-patient, unless he be a dead one. There is a need for continual regular checkups and in all probability the need for readmission at some stage to treat, for example, a pressure sore or urinary or kidney problems. The national spinal injuries centre, being the only spinal unit for the whole of the South of England, has to care for somewhere in the region of between 4,000 and 6,000 such old patients. The pressure is so great that the patients are not called in for check-ups; they have to ask for one. If there are no known problems check-ups are done only every two years instead of annually.<lb/>
My noble friend has already told your Lordships of the much more satisfactory situation in the northern units. I know of patients who have had to go to their local hospitals for check-ups which consequently were incomplete because the waiting-list at the unit is so long. Those with pressure sores may have to wait vital weeks before being admitted and the needs of these patients are very clearly not being met.<lb/>
For the newly injured spinal patient the situation is even more grave, and I cannot stress too often how essential it is to get
<col>1338</col>
the correct treatment and nursing from the very start to prevent complications&#x2014;as my noble friend also has said&#x2014;such as pressure sores or contractures. A pressure sore may seriously retard a patient's rehabilitation and continue to be a problem throughout his life. If contractures of the limbs are allowed to develop through insufficient physiotherapy a patient may never become as agile and fully rehabilitated as he might have been. Therefore, it is essential to be in a spinal unit from the earliest possible moment. Some consultants in general hospitals at present do not even bother to contact the NSIC to find out whether spinal patients may be admitted because they have heard of the problems of the unit and think that the waiting-list may be too great.<lb/>
But, my Lords, general hospitals simply do not have the specialist knowledge required, apart from the fact that it is psychologically important for a spinally injured patient to be with other paraplegics from whom he can gain knowledge and support and hope for the future. My noble friend has already cited several cases of patients who have been in dire plight in general hospitals, and the same is still true today. A friend of my daughter recently broke her neck in a car crash and, after a few weeks in one of the best orthopaedic hospitals in this country, arrived at Stoke Mandeville with a pressure sore on&#x2014;of all places&#x2014;her head. Some of your Lordships may have seen the horrific sores on the patient featured in "Nationwide" last week. I can assure your Lordships that when that patient arrived in the unit they were far worse; they were large enough to get one's fist into them.<lb/>
This is waste, not only in human terms but in financial terms. My noble friend has already mentioned cost-effectiveness. A patient can spend six months in a spinal unit, repairing such damage&#x2014;an expensive exercise, as your Lordships will be aware. It is reckoned that a paraplegic, correctly treated, can be rehabilitated and discharged within four to five months. A tetraplegic&#x2014;that is someone who has broken his neck and consequently has not got movement in his hands and possibly not in his arms, either&#x2014;within seven months. Why double the cost by incorrect treatment at the start? This cannot be the most effective use of resources.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0678"/>
<col>1339</col>
When the National Spinal Injuries Centre was transferred from the Ministry of Pensions in the early 1950s it had a two-year special allocation and then came under the Oxford Regional Health Authority; and as your Lordships have already heard from my noble friend this region has severe problems of its own because it is so rapidly expanding in population. The present system of funding simply has not worked as money allocated to the NSIC is not easily identifiable. I will give your Lordships an example of this. In another place, in his adjournment debate on Stoke Mandeville Hospital, on 2nd February 1979, the honourable Member for Aylesbury spoke of the special spinal weighting factor that was going to be introduced to provide more money for Stoke Mandeville Hospital. This was following the visit the previous year of the then Minister of State for Health, Roland Moyle, to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. This special weighting was expected to produce an additional &#x00A3;400,000.<lb/>
In February, in an adjournment debate, the honourable Member spoke of the anxiety of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital staff to know what had happened to that sum. Although the national allowance had been made the Oxford region was spending up to its so-called RAWP level&#x2014;the resources allocation mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead&#x2014;and the &#x00A3;400,000 appeared to be a mythical bookkeeping transaction. In his reply the Minister said that the special weighting would come into effect for the financial year 1979&#x2013;80. We are now well into that financial year and the unit has still not seen a penny of that sum. Perhaps the noble Lord who is to reply for the Government can discover what has happened to this before the Minister of Health visits Stoke Mandeville on 20th November.<lb/>
The unit has been starved of money over the past 10 years and is already seriously below par so that the cuts are really not comparable with other similar cutbacks. At present it is the only spinal unit in the South of England from the Severn to the Wash, covering a population of 23&#x00BD; million people. Patients also come from outside this area and from overseas, and the Department of Health has recognised that over 100 spinal beds are needed now in the South of England. The
<col>1340</col>
proposed unit at Odstock, which will be 50 to 60 beds, will not be operational until mid-1983 at least, and the unit at Stanmore, which is a small one of 20 beds, somewhat earlier. I submit that we cannot therefore allow the NSIC to be further reduced at this moment. I very much hope that after the Minister's visit on 20th November he will produce some practical and workable solution and some way of ensuring that money allocated to the NSIC actually gets there.<lb/>
We are talking about one of the foremost hospitals in the world for the treatment of spinal injuries. Can we afford to let its reputation die as its Nissen huts crumble and patients have to be refused admission? International prestige and human lives and suffering apart, can we, in purely financial terms, afford the cost of repairing damage to spinally injured patients&#x2014;damage that need never have occurred had they been correctly treated in the first place and in the right place?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02672"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, first, to thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for having initiated the debate, but, having said that, I always feel that there is an air of sadness about these debates. One air of sadness is to hear the noble Baroness who has just spoken of the individual problems that spending cuts raise and the fact that I genuinely feel sure that nothing is going to be done as a result of this debate. I think that the Conservative Government are on a course of spending cuts, and whatever we say here, or whatever they say in that House across the way, nothing will be changed. We have to start and have a look at some of the things which my noble friend Lord Wells-Pestell said about their election Manifesto. In the election campaign the Labour Party said that there would be cuts in the spending on health and the Tories denied this, but in fact we have been proved right.<lb/>
In any other field the Tories would have been prosecuted under the Trade Descriptions Act, because over a whole range of areas, whether educational or health, we are now going to see a series of cuts that will, in my view, take generations to remedy. They have got
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0679"/>
<col>1341</col>
this thing about public spending, which is partly a myth, because the amount we spend, the Government expenditure of the gross domestic product, is lower in this country as a percentage than in any other country in the European Community.<lb/>
One of the priorities that the Government ought to have been looking at when they came into office is at least maintaining the Health Service as it has been maintained over the last 30 years, because it is a fact that in many years there is more time lost through ill health and sickness and accidents in our places of work than through bad industrial relations, which again is an area which the Government seem hell-bent to do something about. I believe that this Government are moving us towards a mean-minded and hard-hearted society. We are moving into that area of Proposition 13 in California where we are witnessing what Galbraith said:
<quote>"private affluence and public squalor".</quote>
I think that all of us ought to be very concerned about what they are doing to the Health Service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02673"><member>Baroness YOUNG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will give way for one moment, I think if he looks at the <i>Official Report</i> tomorrow he will see that I said that the volume of Government spending on the Health Service will increase by 3 per cent. over next year; this will more than make up for the slight cutback there has been this year, and in fact will mean a one half per cent. improvement. So that statement is not true and what we said at the election is true.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02674"><member>Lord MURRAY of GRAVESEND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid the noble Baroness is wrong, because at least 1 per cent. is needed to take up the demographic question of people living longer. That has immediately overtaken your half per cent. growth. We ought to be looking to maintaining and improving the service. The cuts also do not take into account the question of wage increases. They do not take into consideration that the Health Service will be paying &#x00A3;40 million a year in increased VAT. So I think that myth has to be dealt with. Again the cuts always affect the least well-off in our society, whether they are the people receiving treatment or needing treatment or whether they are the people working in
<col>1342</col>
the hospitals, and we know that they are mostly the people in this society on lower incomes.<lb/>
Mr. Jenkin in the other place said that administration will be the target and not patients. I think that is another bogeyman. If that is the case, Sir Keith Joseph ought to be making a public apology to the country for the reorganisation of the Health Service, when we are now told that we can save &#x00A3;30 million a year by cutting out one of the tiers which was created by the last Conservative Government. But if we look at the question of non-hospital administration costs in this country, again that is lower than most of our partners in the European Community. It is certainly lower than France, which runs at 10&#x00B7;8 per cent.; it is certainly lower than Germany, which runs at 5 per cent. Our non-hospital administration costs in this country run at something like 2&#x00B7;6 per cent. Again I think it is a matter of setting up a bogeyman and saying it is bureaucracy causing all our problems in the Health Service.<lb/>
What this Government ought to be concentrating on is the fact that we have on our waiting lists in this country at the present time something like 620,000 people. We have a situation where wards are being closed all over the country and we have at the moment 8,000 nurses who are unemployed. It would be interesting to see the equation of what we may be paying those in unemployment benefits as against what they would be paid if they were able to do the job for which they were trained. It is a service that is already under pressure in this country. Half of our hospitals were built in the 19th century. If the Minister wants to say&#x2014;and I dispute her figures&#x2014;that they are running at just above the previous level, we ought to be injecting more money and making sure that the people who work in the hospitals and the people who have to use the hospitals as patients get the best possible hospitals.<lb/>
We can only admire those people who work in the hospitals. As the noble Baroness has said there are over 1 million working in the National Health Service, and nobody can doubt the record they have in terms of industrial relations over the past 30 years since the inception of the National Health Service, and that is at all levels. They are obviously not con-
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0680"/>
<col>1343</col>
cerned only with the wage levels but with the problems and the need to serve the community in this country.<lb/>
Occasionally we have industrial disputes. We had in the last week or so the question of Charing Cross Hospital; that situation was highlighted and people were being harassed and pressed by the media to see how they were cutting off supplies to the hospital. But we must recognise, and the Government ought to recognise, that it is only a tiny minority of people who cause these sort of difficulties. Indeed, if we look at the record of last winter, when there were disputes in the National Health Service, I would have thought what the Clegg Commission did, as a result of those disputes, was to say that the workers in the National Health Service certainly had a case. The previous Government were trying to fix a ceiling of 5 per cent. and indeed Clegg gave them increases varying between 15 and 27 per cent.<lb/>
In my own area in Kent we have the problem of cuts in the Gravesham and Dartford area of something like &#x00A3;500,000. We are facing the problem in Kent of something like &#x00A3;100,000 having to be saved on the ambulance service which does such fine work in our county. We are having ward closures and unit closures in the Medway towns. This is the area of Dickens and certainly the hospitals there were built when Dickens was living and working in the Medway towns. We have the problem of the closure of the orthopaedic ward at the Medway Hospital and psychiatric unit.<lb/>
People are trying to have to raise money to keep two units open in Kent. In my view this begging-bowl mentality for maintaining the Health Service is the wrong way to go about it. I should say that in that area the <i>Evening Post,</i> the local Medway paper, has been running a campaign to raise money, and they have done remarkably well in raising money. But in my view that is not the way to run our Health Service and people should not have to be raising money once again after having paid their taxes and their health insurance stamps to maintain hospitals which should be their right. We are moving back into the area of Poor Law Guardians. The Government ought to to be looking at
<col>1344</col>
what we can do to improve the Health Service rather than saying we should be cutting services and having ward closures, not only in Kent but all over the country.<lb/>
I think we ought to get some answers from the Government, and if we do not get them tonight I hope we are going to get them in the document they are producing later. There are the problems of teaching hospitals and their position within regional health authorities; whether the burden of that should be placed on regional health authorities, having to disburse those funds. There is the question of whether we should, as the Royal Commission suggested, abolish prescription charges. After all, they only contribute something like 1&#x00A3;6 per cent. of the funding of the National Health Service. I wonder whether, with the administration involved, it is worth while having prescription charges purely on economic grounds, apart from my political feeling about them.<lb/>
Then there is the question&#x2014;again a question raised by the Royal Commission&#x2014;of pay beds. There is also the question of trade unions and industrial relations within the National Health Service. The noble Baroness spoke about volunteers in hospitals. I am not so certain about that aspect. I am not certain that, at a time when we want to go into the possibilities of achieving a better trade union relationship and industrial relations with the trade unions in the National Health Service, we should be talking about having volunteers in the National Health Service if there is a further breakdown in negotiations. I do not think that that is the way we should be embarking on the negotiations. There are&#x2014;this is one of the problems of the National Health Service&#x2014;something like 44 different bodies with negotiating rights at national and local level. I think that the TUC accepts that something needs to be done about that. The TUC has set up its own training courses to give instruction, help and advice to those people who are shop stewards in the National Health Service. There is the question of whether we ought not to abolish VAT for the National Health Service in the same way as we do for local authorities. It is paying a great deal of money and, as the Minister said in another place, there will be an increase of &#x00A3;40 million over and above what it already pays in VAT.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0681"/>
<col>1345</col>
There is also the question of whether we should be looking at cutting down drug costs. About 60 per cent. of the drugs used in this country are imported. We should be looking at whether there is a better way of dealing with this matter and whether more drugs could be manufactured at cheaper cost in this country. There is the question of the promotion of drugs in this country. Every doctor to whom one talks mentions yards and yards of paper. We talk about Government paper work, but let us consider the paper work that comes from drugs companies and others interested in selling commodities to doctors. I am thinking of the reams of paper that come through their letter boxes and the samples. Perhaps we should look at whether there is over-promotion of drugs. I hope that the Government&#x2014;and I say similar words at the end of most of my speeches&#x2014;will re-examine whether they should be moving along the path of cutting down the National Health Service. I hope that they will not go much further down that path. If they will not stop, then certainly when we return to power we shall do something about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02675">7.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02676"><member>Lord SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too believe that this House owes a great debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, not only for the opportunity of this debate, but for the terms in which the Motion was moved at the beginning of the debate. He placed the emphasis where it should be and that is on the needs of patients. Before I leave that point I should like to say how much I enjoyed both of the maiden speeches. However, I was particularly moved by the splendid speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw.<lb/>
Emphasis should be placed on the needs of patients, but I think that right at the beginning we should take a good look at those needs and, before we accept unreservedly what might be an implied criticism of the National Health Service for not meeting those needs, we should be quite sure that they are needs which a National Health Service can in fact meet. Before trying to answer what is obviously a fundamental question, I ask your Lordships briefly to look at what has happened to medicine in the last few decades and in particular the last 10 to 15 years. Changes have occurred which
<col>1346</col>
would, in any case, have presented us with huge new problems&#x2014;problems just as pressing in countries that have not made the attempt to bring into being a national health service.<lb/>
To begin with, there has been, and still is, a huge and rapidly growing expansion in the demand for medical services of all kinds. Your Lordships will, of course, know that, but I hope that noble Lords will bear with me while I mention briefly some of the causes of this expansion as seen by those who provide the services. There have been totally unprecedented scientific and technological advances. One could mention a couple of dozen advances without having to stop to think. However, from the surgeon's point of view let me give as examples the whole new area of coronary artery surgery and the whole new area of replacing joints, of which new hip joints for old is just one example. They have all provided new hope for patients. However, as they do so they have provided new headaches for those who have to pay for those services.<lb/>
The expansion is also due to the survival into old age of a much higher percentage of the population. It is also due to large increases in the screening and immunising programmes. It is due to a great demand at the small hospitals and at small community level for services previously confined to the large hospitals, universities, or specialised hospitals. I am thinking of services such as kidney machines, intensive care units, coronary care units, sophisticated new diagnostic machinery and highly sophisticated new modern surgery.<lb/>
The expansion is due to a much broadened view of what is, in fact, a need. For the unjustified demand yesterday becomes a need today and will become a right tomorrow. Moreover, there is the "We have paid for it" syndrome&#x2014;that is, the belief in the minds of many that National Health Service contributions carry an entitlement to everything which medical science has discovered, however exotic and however costly. The latter presents growing problems, because, human nature being what it is, any service that appears to be free at the moment of delivery will generate its own unreasonable demand. Moreover, as the public becomes better educated in health matters&#x2014;there is a good side
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0682"/>
<col>1347</col>
and there is also a bad side&#x2014;the demand becomes not only quantitative but qualitative. The increased demand is not just for more services, but for services of a higher and therefore a most costly standard.<lb/>
I believe that that last factor is largely uncontrollable if every element of personal responsibility in regard to the provision of health care is removed from potential patients and vested solely in the State. Doctors who are anxious to see the Health Service succeed&#x2014;and that is most of them, certainly, I would say so&#x2014;have from the start seen this as a danger point. For centuries our hospitals and individual doctors, too, have been actuated by the belief that, "Yes, I am my brother's keeper, provided he needs to be kept". It is a considerable step to add, "Whether he needs to be kept or not"; and not only that, but ,"Whether he wants to be kept or not".<lb/>
Together with the huge expansion in demand there has been an equally huge and accelerating increase in the cost itself. That is so, not only in countries where there is a national health service&#x2014;it is worldwide. In the United States of America the published costs of health care in 1950 amounted to 12 billion dollars. Twenty-five years later that 12 billion dollars had become 118 billion dollars. In the four years since then the figure has risen, and it appears that by the end of 1979 it will top the 200 billion dollar mark. Both as regards technology and management, the costs are increasing and they are increasing at an accelerating rate. Here, the cost of the National Health Service&#x2014;which before the Health Service first started was put as low as &#x00A3;40 million a year&#x2014;has crept up beyond the &#x00A3;9,000 million mark.<lb/>
This produces terrifying problems for patients, doctors and for any Government. From the patients' point of view there is a constricting combination of heightened expectation, lack of availability and lack of the means to pay for what is available. As for doctors, their professional pride in advancing the frontiers of medical knowledge is accompanied by a disillusionment in the lack of means to apply his knowledge. From the point of view of any Government, with medical costs out of control there is a need to look at three linked questions.<lb/>
<col>1348</col>
The first is: can any State afford the highest standards of medical care for everybody? If the answer to that is "No", what standards can be provided, and how can we set this standard? Thirdly, once we have set that standard, will it inevitably decline with time? I do not mean decline in absolute terms, but certainly decline in relative terms, as the gap widens between what medical science tells us can be done and what we know can be afforded.<lb/>
One of the major difficulties, of course, in maintaining standards goes right back to the definition of the purpose of our own National Health Service contained in the White Paper of 1944. It says:
<quote>"The proposed service must be ' comprehensive ' in two senses&#x2014;first, that it is available to all people and second, that it covers all necessary forms of health care".</quote>
That was in 1944. In 1966, in Canada, almost the same words were used. In introducing the Bill containing plans for a national health insurance programme, the Prime Minister listed certain basic requirements. The first two were that it must be universal&#x2014;available to all; and that it must be comprehensive and cover all needs. That is history repeating itself, but alas! one of the unpalatable facts of life today is that every time history repeats itself the price goes up.<lb/>
In 1974&#x2014;a mere five years ago&#x2014;I was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and I asked the Prime Minister of the day&#x2014;because it was obviously useful for doctors to know this&#x2014;whether the policy of his Government was still that the Health Service must be comprehensive in these terms: providing everything for all people. He answered: Yes, it was. It was shortly afterwards that I became less than popular with the then Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, with whom I had many interesting conversations at that time, for expressing the view that medical science was advancing at such a rate that already the expense of providing, through taxation, everything for all people was beyond the means of any Government and that we had entered an era of health care rationing.<lb/>
Today to say such a thing raises not a ripple. We know that there is this gap and it is painfully obvious to us all that the rationing of health care in this country is a fact. Moreover&#x2014;and this is not an
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0683"/>
<col>1349</col>
illogical parallel&#x2014;if a Government, through the worthiest of motives, said: "Let us feed the hungry", and then decided that it would be a better idea to feed everybody, in times of shortage the thinly spread subsistence might prove inadequate for any; and then not only might the original intent of feeding the hungry be lost, but deficiency diseases would be apparent everywhere. That is what is happening today to our National Health Service. To provide everything for all may have sounded right in 1944; it may have been right in 1948; but it is creating near-insuperable problems as we approach the 1980s.<lb/>
What can be done? I believe that it is not a problem that can possibly be solved merely by increasing the percentage of the GNP which is applied to health care, though in some countries, as we know, this percentage is higher. But this would be a short-term expedient and I believe would make no attempt to identify and tackle basic problems. The report of the Royal Commission says:
<quote>"The impossibility of meeting all demands for health services was not anticipated. Medical, nursing and therapeutic techniques have been developed to levels of sophistication and expense which were not foreseen when the NHS was introduced".</quote>
In a different place in the same report it says:
<quote>"It is important to remember the almost unlimited capacity of health services to absorb resources".</quote>
That is right. The expanding field of modern medicine has a voracious appetite, and would swallow up any additional allocation and simply ask for more.<lb/>
On the other hand, are we doing enough, or is the situation totally out of control? I am sure that there are things that can be done and many that certainly should be done. In the short-term we must, of course, use resources to their best effect and eliminate waste, including the waste of over-complicated and over-proliferated administration. I believe that no one should or would blame the ills of the National Health Service on our administrators who, in the main, are highly skilled and highly motivated professionals who serve our Health Service well.<lb/>
But there is a difference between good administration and an obstructing bureaucracy. We must find some way of keeping
<col>1350</col>
the former and getting rid of the latter. I do not believe that it is enough to delete a redundant tier, which perhaps we never ought to have had in the first place. We must go back much further than that. I was greatly affected by what the noble Lord, Lord Richardson, said. We must try to simplify more than that. I should like to see us re-animate our hospital management committees. I should like to see given back to the profession the boards of governors of the university hospitals that served us so well. I should like these to work directly with regional hospital boards. Then we would have got back to the local control of affairs, to which reference has already been made this evening.<lb/>
Also in the short and the long term, clearly, we should hope that we may improve industrial relations in our hospitals. This is not a matter which I shall talk about in detail, but in this context perhaps I might remind the Government that in this House on 25th January (at column 1582) I asked a question about the situation in our hospitals while a solution is being sought to a major problem. The question was:
<quote>"Is it really a task beyond the intelligence and ingenuity of our society to devise some way in which at least the safety of patients in hospital, incapacitated by illness or by injury, might be guaranteed?"</quote>
In asking that question, I received some considerable support from various noble Lords, but since then I do not think I can recall any question that seems to have stirred up so much apathy. I hope that my question has not been forgotten or that it is now considered to be of no importance. I do not think that patients who were in hospital last winter have so easily forgotten.<lb/>
I turn now to the long term. It is not enough to identify this gap and merely to watch it widen. Surely the State and the health care professions in partnership can do better than that. I believe that one mistake that is in some danger of being perpetuated is in assuming that independent medical practice is inimical to the Health Service, a danger to it and must necessarily develop in isolation. If we continue along that road, all too easily we can arrive at a situation which is ethically disturbing to doctors and perhaps also politically precarious for any
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0684"/>
<col>1351</col>
Government in power. For if those in relatively low income brackets perforce accept treatment in a contracting National Health Service and those in higher income brackets have access to an expanding independent medical sector, this tacitly accepts two standards in medicine, which must diverge as increasingly the State is compelled to provide not the best Health Service it can design but the best Health Service it can afford.<lb/>
I believe the philosophy of isolating independent medical practice from the National Health Service might thus irreparably damage the Health Service itself, and also reintroduce class differences that at the present time are fast disappearing in relation to health care in Britain. The reverse of course would be to accept that there is a limit to what the State can do, that there is a gap, and that one might hope the closer links between State medicine and independent medicine might fill some part of that gap, or at lease mitigate its effects.<lb/>
That is an overlong and perhaps grammatically clumsy sentence, so let us go the whole hog and end it with a "proposition": supposing there were already in being a small group whose sole concern was the liaison between State medicine and independent medicine, and that whenever a hospital, a department, a ward were in danger of being closed for lack of resources this group were merely asked, "What could you suggest, working together, might be done to keep this open?" Might this not help patients? Might it not maintain employment? Might not private hospitals, some of them of high standard, train nurses? Might not private hospitals on occasion provide registrar posts for those aiming at a specialist career? Is not the concept at least worthy of some detailed examination?<lb/>
The concept of the National Health Service is a great one of which I think all in this country ought to be proud, and still, despite its many detractors, it could be the envy of the world, though many countries looking in on us from outside do so with anxieties and wonder whether it could become a casualty of our economic difficulties. We simply must not let that happen. Can it not be accepted that "the needs of patients", the entirely appropriate words used in
<col>1352</col>
the Motion, would best be served by a partnership between the State on the one hand and the whole of medicine, including the independent sector, on the other? What is needed is merely, I believe, for the Government to say, "Let us examine this proposition together". If such an approach were made&#x2014;I speak today as a doctor and for many doctors who feel alike as I do&#x2014;I know the answer would be that we believe this to be right, and would support it. If you would test our sincerity in this matter, just try us and see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02677">8.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02678"><member>Lord COLWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while wishing to thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for initiating this interesting and wide-ranging debate this evening, I must apologise to him and indeed to the speakers from both Front Benches, and to the maiden speakers, for not being in my seat during their speeches. I should like to be able to say that I was unavoidably detained in my National Health Service practice seeing my National Health Service patients, but regrettably I am now getting far too old to deal with the vast numbers of patients many of my colleagues have to see under the National Health Service. However, I hope perhaps to say a few words about that tomorrow night in our debate on flouridation.<lb/>
Clearly there is a limit to the funds which we can put into our public services; even the most worthy ones such as the National Health Service. The current financial constraints can be seen constructively as providing an incentive to the Health Service's managers to look for improvements in efficiency. I have no doubt that there is scope for this in many parts of the service, including services in my own dental field. But keeping to the general for the moment, one of the areas which is widely seen as in need of pruning is administration, and again I have to agree.<lb/>
The 1974 reorganisation has proved cumbersome and unwieldy. Too many people spend too much time sitting on committees and taking part in other administrative rituals rather than getting on with their real work. I think it is common ground between us that the Health Service would do well to simplify its administrative structure. But how this simplification should be carried out is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0685"/>
<col>1353</col>
not an easy question. The structure which is appropriate would depend on the geography of the area being served, and it would depend on the nature of the service being managed.<lb/>
The Royal Commission on the NHS emphasised the need for flexibility. In the Commission's words:
<quote>"The needs of Wester Ross and Tower Hamlets are obviously entirely different".</quote>
Equally, a structure which is appropriate for managing 200,000 ancillary staff, or 400,000 nurses and midwives, is unlikely to be ideal for organising the community dental services, which number only 2,000 dentists over the whole country.<lb/>
In fact, and in spite of its other faults, the 1974 reorganisation recognised this. So far as dental services are concerned the organisational focus has been at area level. Districts have had little significance for dentistry, and neither in practice have regions. Effectively our structure is already simple: it is already single-tiered. It is therefore with some concern that my colleagues have heard the Health Minister, Dr. Gerard Vaughan, suggest recently without qualification that it is almost certainly area health authorities which will go in the forthcoming restructuring.<lb/>
Now I am not suggesting that this may not broadly be the right thing to do, but I am suggesting that it is not the whole answer. If areas go, then in some parts of the country and for some services efficient management will require something else very like them. What I also suggest is that it is not good industrial relations for the Minister to give an incomplete statement of his intentions to a party conference in advance of publication of an important White Paper. The fact is that the Minister's statement has given rise to considerable anxiety, certainly in the community dental service, and probably in other services too. Careers face disruption again only a few years after the last reorganisation, and as yet no protection arrangements have been agreed.<lb/>
This is not the way to persuade people to work more efficiently. Good industrial relations need openness, clear intentions, consultation, and in the present situation when we are about to change the Health Service's administrative structure an
<col>1354</col>
important need is to minimise career uncertainties for people working in the service, otherwise declining morale could undermine the whole running of the service. I am sure that we all wish the Minister success in his efforts to improve the Health Service's use of its resources in this difficult time. I hope he will bear in mind that better industrial relations are essential to more efficient management.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02679">8.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02680"><member>Lord BROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first of all I note that Lord Winstanley's Motion is very carefully worded, in that the first impression on reading it is that it directly accuses the National Health Service as such as going wrong, but more careful study reveals that it does not specify who is responsible. The general impression easily accepted is that the NHS itself is at fault, and with this I wish to protest strongly. There is little doubt that there is much wrong with the service that it provides; but is this the sole fault of the service or something else? It is not so long ago that we were being told that the NHS was the best in the world and that we could be proud of it. How does it come about that now it is said to be running to seed?<lb/>
I have been associated with the hospital service since 1924, and with the National Health Service itself from its commencement in 1948 until 1968, when I retired. Since then I have observed a steady deterioration in what is being provided, but not in the service itself which is still splendid; the work of the doctors at all levels from consultants downwards, is as good as ever. The nurses also do just as good work. I have a daughter who is ill in hospital and she becomes lyrical about what the nurses do so magnificently; often dirty, unpleasant and hard things, without protest.<lb/>
It is in certain of the ancillary services that I see a falling off as a positive hindrance to good work. Their antics, actions and intentions have even begun to affect the speech and thoughts of the doctors, nurses and other workers who have at times even mentioned such shabby, unprofessional and unacceptable things as threats of industrial action. Many of the ancillary staff, no doubt influenced by union action, have already descended to this. It is clear that if you touch pitch
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0686"/>
<col>1355</col>
you may be defiled. A year or two ago the country was electrified by the statement of some foolish woman that food should no longer be served to private patients in hospital. A big London teaching hospital which cost many millions of pounds is now threatened with closure because a group of hooligans are stopping its oil deliveries. Since then we have had the sad tale of similar disruption and threats.<lb/>
When I look back on my long years of service with the hopsitals and with the NHS, I retain a very different impression of doctors and nurses, who in general are eager and dedicated people, falling over themselves to do a good job. This same spirit of service and of devotion was still to be seen in the NHS that I knew from 1948. I continued to be fully impressed with what was being done. After 1968, when I retired, I began to notice disturbing elements. Things were just not so good and one heard many sour comments and criticisms. Things altered so much that one even accepted the statement that it was just as well not to be in the NHS.<lb/>
But despite these misgivings and criticisms, I was still very impressed with the high standard of excellent work being done. It is true that adverse comments were continually heard about certain levels of ancillary staff whose behaviour was, frankly, disgraceful, but the real high standard of good work went on. Take, for instance, the conduct of obstetrics, a common and much-needed discipline. I was recently talking to an obstetrician friend who would enthuse over what it now has to offer, especially, for instance, in the way of monitoring the health and performance of newly-born babies. Then one thinks of advances in hip joint replacement and many joints in surgery pioneered by Sir John Charnley and followed by many surgeons. Many thousands of patients have been, and are being, benefited by this, including, I imagine, not a few in your Lordships' House. This is a field where previously there was almost nothing, and it now offers complete relief from a severe crippling complaint.<lb/>
There is then the whole field of cardiac surgery, a virtually completely new industry which brings so much to so many where before there was no hope of relief. Only recently we had the news of
<col>1356</col>
a politician in prison for his criminal activities but let out temporarily so that he could benefit from the operation now available. We also had news of a distinguished and popular entertainer who was able to have the same operation as a life-saving procedure.<lb/>
Rather more esoteric, but none the less very important and supplying a much needed advance, is the replacement of diseased organs, especially kidneys and liver, and now even the heart with which success is being achieved. Although less spectacular, but still a very successful form of tissue transplantation, is the whole saga of blood transfusion for which service the NHS has much to be proud. When I reflect on all these things and the many others we owe to the NHS I continue to marvel at the success and progress of this much criticised and maligned service.<lb/>
The defects lie scarcely at all with the professional element, the doctors and nurses, but the disturbances lie with many of the non-professional or ancillary element; by no means with all of them, many of whom maintain the high and praiseworthy standards that pertain to the doctors and nurses, but it is not possible to ignore the harm done by a certain element. While these continue to be disruptive, there is going to be discord in the service. But I must point out that they form a group new to and inflicted on the original NHS, and it is they who are responsible for the disharmony that exists. But they are not intrinsically part of the NHS as I and many others used to know it. They are a new element. Their control is not the prime concern of the NHS. It is a Government function and Government should rid us of these disturbing elements.<lb/>
Some of this has arisen from the enabling legislation of 1972 or 1974 directed at the reorganisation of the service. I well remember the long hours of debate that we got involved in. Much of it seemed complex and unconvincing to me, and doubtless to many others; we were just presented with a vast bureaucratic upheaval or earthquake, much of which was wished on us and was just too complicated. So it has turned out to be, and now we are finding that the control is too complex and far too expensive, and it is
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0687"/>
<col>1357</col>
proposed that it be simplified. With this we must agree. There is at least one too many among the tiers of control, expensive in itself.<lb/>
All this reorganisation requires thinking out again and modifying. Whether improvement will result it is difficult to say, but something must be done, and again it is the Government's task to do so. It is not the responsibility of the NHS, which seems to share the blame, but is a function of the Government and it falls to them to correct it; to try among other things to control the disturbing elements that are doing so much harm and are chiefly responsible for the disturbing things the Motion speaks of. Let us get the affairs of our NHS in order and make it again something of which we can all he proud.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02682"><member>Lord HENLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for giving us the opportunity to discuss the various problems which beset the National Health Service. Many of those who have spoken can justly claim to be experts on the subject of the Health Service, and I especially wish to include the two maiden speakers whom I join other speakers in congratulating. I am afraid I have no expertise at all and I can only speak from my own recent personal experiences as a patient under the National Health Service.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, does not seem to think that many on these Benches use the NHS. Like my noble kinsman Lord Auckland, I have made full use of it. I spent the whole of last week and the week before in the Middlesex Hospital; I was there under the auspices of the NHS and not privately. I was taken in rather suddenly and so there was no question of any delay, and I can therefore say nothing about the problems of long waiting lists for less pressing treatment. Others, notably Lord Winstanley and my noble friend Lord Gisborough, have mentioned this problem this afternoon. I am sure it exists but I am not qualified to speak on it. All I can do is give my impressions of the NHS as I saw it from my bed in the Middlesex Hospital. It might be that my views are of very little relevance. The Middlesex Hospital is one of the large London
<col>1358</col>
teaching hospitals and for all I know it is not typical in any way of NHS hospitals; I have never been to any NHS hospitals, or to any hospitals for that matter, in all my life since I was born and therefore do not know much about them. I suppose that one of the great teaching hospitals has much greater resources to command than do many of the regional hospitals. At the same time, I imagine that it has many disadvantages in being in Central London, with relatively old buildings, rather crowded. I must add that while I was there I was completely unaffected by any industrial action, or any other disaster, and so my experience is probably totally untypical of what other people have had to undergo. Nevertheless, I hope that what I have to say will not be entirely irrelevant to the debate.<lb/>
I will not keep your Lordships very long because I want to say only one thing; namely, how very impressed I was with the whole set-up. The picture of the Health Service painted in the Press has very little in common with what I saw. Some newspapers would have us believe that the whole system is falling apart at the seams, that it totally fails to meet the needs of the patients. In fact, from reading the Press it is very easy to be rather frightened of going into hospital at all; I certainly was. There are fears that strikes will prevent any oil getting in or food being cooked, and one reads reports of the wrong foot being cut off or of some other ghastly amputation. I suppose that all these things can in fact happen, but again I hope that they are not necessarily typical.<lb/>
I have absolutely no complaints about the manner in which I was treated by all the staff at the Middlesex, whether the doctors themselves, the nurses, or even the dreaded ancillary workers, who many have criticised this afternoon. They seem to be rather partial to various industrial disturbances of one kind or another, and as a result they are very much a <i>b&#x00EA;te noire</i> in the eyes of the Press. But they caused me no problems while I was there, so I am not going to criticise them. If I might, I should particularly like to thank the nursing staff with whom obviously I came into most contact. Despite the long hours they work, despite very difficult patients&#x2014;and I expect I was probably one of those difficult patients&#x2014;and despite their relatively low pay, I do not think I saw
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0688"/>
<col>1359</col>
any ever lose their temper or behave in anything but an exemplary manner. They deserve all the praise they receive.<lb/>
I have already said that I do not know whether what I saw in the Middlesex was in any way typical of the National Health Service, and I am prepared to concede that it probably might not be in that it is a large hospital with large resources. I think that it has about 750 beds and a staff of over 3,000. I have not checked those figures; I do not know whether they are correct. But my experience does at least show that parts of the Health Service are working well and efficiently and are meeting the needs of the patients, which after all is what the debate is supposed to be about. I do not want to sound complacent, but things do not really seem to be as bad as some people would have one believe. The Health Service might not be perfect, it might have a great many failings, but what I saw from my bed appeared to be a highly efficient hospital. It would be a credit to any health service.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02684"><member>The Countess of LOUDOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, services for the elderly are one of the current National Health Service priorities, along with those for the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped, and children; and it is about this first group, the elderly, that I should like to say a few words. The major problem of mental illness is now the dementias of old people, and it is therefore impossible to plan services for the old and the mentally ill separately. As people grow older certain organs, in particular the brain, tend to lose a number of cells. In most people this gradual loss has no effect at all, but dementia occurs in elderly people whose brain cell loss is abnormally heavy. This may take the form of depression, which is a psychotic disorder, where the sufferer's mood sinks to a level not experienced by someone who is mentally healthy, and can lead to suicide; or paraphrenia, a form of schizophrenia in elderly people, which is likely to affect those suffering from loneliness, poor vision, or deafness. This is a feeling of not being wanted, a type of persecution mania.<lb/>
In the less acute stages of brain cell loss stress on an elderly person can cause the mental state diagnosed as confusion,
<col>1360</col>
where a person can be alert and articulate one minute and drowsy and incoherent the next. But where the cell loss is abnormally heavy the resulting dementia is permanent, irreversible, and tends to get worse. Although nothing will change a person with dementia back into someone who is mentally normal, it is possible to slow down the process of deterioration. There is an urgent need for more counselling services for the elderly, particularly in times of crisis such as those caused by bereavement, retirement, loneliness, or ill-heath, which can be major upheavals to those concerned.
Then there are the dangers of overmedication and mal-medication, all of which can be potential causes of mental ill health; yet little gets done about them. Though most GPs are conscientious and utterly trustworthy, there are some who automatically dish out tranquillisers rather than try to find the cause of the problem. There are those doctors who issue repeat prescriptions without even seeing the patient.
I think that one must recognise that some forms of mental disorder are avoidable altogether, and that others can be handled successfully if proper care and attention are available at an early stage. Assessment of the elderly patient by both health and social services staff, preferably at home where the patient feels most at ease, is vital. And what then? Owing to the piecemeal development of residential services by both the National Health Service and local authorities these services for elderly, mentally infirm people are at best inadequate and at worst untenable. The only answer, surely, is joint planning between local authorities, the Health Service, and voluntary organisations, to develop a range of residential services which complement each other and offer a choice to meet the needs of individuals.<lb/>
The Health Advisory Service has for years expressed concern about the quality of life in geriatric and psychiatric hospitals, many of which fall short of acceptable standards. Can the Government tell us when the report of the working party on management of hospitals is likely to be published? Can the Government see any virtue in giving psychiatric hospitals more control over their own hospitals, so that those responsible can plan their own
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0689"/>
<col>1361</col>
budgets? There is a shortage of staff, both trained and untrained, in these hospitals. Many nurses prefer not to look after mentally disturbed old people, though this, one of the most demanding branches of nursing, is also one of the most rewarding, calling for personal qualities and skills of a high order. A high proportion of the staff are men and women from overseas who have given invaluable service in psychiatric and geriatric hospitals, but problems sometimes arise due to an imperfect command of English and the fact that they come from cultures with different assumptions and conventions.<lb/>
But apart from the elderly, mentally infirm person living in some kind of residential provision, there are many more living in the community, mostly with their families. Surely one of our priorities must be to maintain these elderly people in the community for as long as possible, thus easing the strain on hospital and local authority provision. But to achieve this we must aim at complete co-operation between health and social services staff, including social workers and community psychiatric nurses. This would cut out some of the waste now prevalent due to overlap and ensure that the best possible use is made of resources already available to the patient, without necessarily spending more money. Cooperation and co-ordination between all the statutory and voluntary services involved in the care of elderly, mentally ill and infirm people is essential if we are to allow them the quality of life to which they are entitled and allow them to be treated with the humanity and respect to which they have a right.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02686"><member>Lord WALLACE of COSLANY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are now approaching the end of a somewhat long but extremely useful debate, and I should like to congratulate and thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, and his party for initiating it. The noble Lord may recall that some years ago he had the responsibility of whipping me off, in an emergency, to Westminster Hospital. I have now fully recovered, although they never in fact discovered what was wrong with me. I should also like to congratulate the two maiden speakers, the noble Earl, Lord Erne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of
<col>1362</col>
Warsaw. We look forward very much indeed to their participation in the future. There are two other speakers that I should like to thank and congratulate. 1 have called them "the dynamic pair". They are the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth. I hope that the message that those two energetic Members of this House put forward will be accepted and dealt with, as indeed they have the greatest possible public sympathy.<lb/>
While I agree that severe problems exist in the National Health Service, nevertheless the service compares favourably with conditions in many other countries. Those of us who have been faced with a sudden disaster overseas realise the sense of relief when a member of the family is eventually returned to National Health Service care in Britain, and receives that high standard of medical and, particularly, nursing care which still exists at home. In passing, I should like to pay a personal tribute to one aspect of health care and service that is hardly ever mentioned. I should like to pay a personal tribute to the fine standard of service at Heathrow Airport Medical Centre, so often the point of transhipment for those stricken with sudden illness or accident overseas. The service is admirable, compassionate and efficient.<lb/>
I deplore attempts to "knock" the National Health Service in order to advance private schemes. Harsh words indeed have been used earlier in this debate. Medical need should not be subject to financial considerations. I believe strongly that the best possible treatment should be available to the sick in body or mind, irrespective of class, colour or creed. Freedom of choice most certainly, Yes, but no question of first- or second-class citizens. It is true that today the National Health Service faces severe problems, not all of them financial. At all levels of staff there is evidence of low morale. What has gone wrong? There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the primary cause is the disastrous reorganisation carried out by a Conservative Government and engineered by Sir Keith Joseph. On the Third Reading of the Bill in another place I warned him of the chaos that would arise, and my worst fears have indeed been confirmed. The result has been a bureaucratic monster smothering patient care with mountains of paper work,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0690"/>
<col>1363</col>
and faceless individuals with electronic calculators producing incomprehensible statistics on bed norms. I always thought a bed norm was a parasite: on second thoughts, perhaps I was right.<lb/>
I do not want, in any case, to show too much political bias in this debate. I am now going to support my arguments with a quotation from a very useful document which the noble Baroness herself has no doubt read. This is from a working party on "the Cinderella service". It says:
<quote>"The Working Party found widespread criticism of the reorganisation of the National Health Service, which had resulted in low nursing morale. There was a feeling that the service had been depersonalised because the level of effective management was now so far from the level of clinical practice. The administrative structure was top-heavy, with one tier of authority too many. Lines of communication were over extended and considerable overlap of responsibility had almost submerged nurses in paperwork, and had added to postage and telephone costs. All the respondents stated that this was one of their principal frustrations".</quote>
I could go on, because this is an excellent report; and, for the record, it is a "Report on the Nursing Profession presented by a working party of the Women's National Advisory Committee of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations". I commend the reading of this document, but it shows the criticism that I have already made in my speech.<lb/>
There is no doubt whatever that reorganisation was a disaster, but the comment made in this report on the nursing profession applies to all levels of staff. I agree with the report entirely that there is one tier too many. We are now told that area authorities are to be phased out and replaced by some 200 district authorities. Great care will have to be taken to avoid another upheaval, leading to a further lowering of morale. There will be staff redundancies, and careers will be blighted. Those responsible for sorting it all out will have an agonising job. I know only too well, because I had to take part in those agonising procedures, when we had a short list of officers, for all of whom we had the highest respect and all of whom had excellent records, and we had to choose one for a post, the others having to go searching elsewhere. Some of them, excellent people, had to leave the service. In fact, one of my officers emigrated to New Zealand to get out of the country;
<col>1364</col>
he was fed up to the teeth with the situation.<lb/>
Every effort must indeed be made to return to more localised control, creating a more corporate entity, staff loyalty and sense of unity. Newly appointed district authority committees must go out of their way to be known by staffs, collectively and individually. That was the strength of the management committees before reorganisation&#x2014;trust and confidence on both sides. It is also essential that members appointed have local knowledge and experience.<lb/>
Now I come to industrial relations, and may I say that I agree almost entirely with the speech on this subject made by the noble Lord, Lord Rochester, who has a great experience in this field, as we all know. From the old atmosphere of loyalty and dedication, we now have the problem of industrial relations, which became severe last winter and continues today in incidents which can bring comfort to no one. Faults exist on both sides. No-strike contracts are not the answer. They may possibly be negotiated, but reality must be faced. Dispute situations will still arise unless a better atmosphere is created. I am well aware of the disputes procedures put into operation by my honourable friend David Ennals when he was Secretary of State. Admirable as they are if fully carried out in good spirit, they do not go deep enough to the source. Something additional is needed; and what I say about those procedures is also what is in the mind of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, in the proposals that are coming, to which we are all looking forward. Something more is needed.<lb/>
What is the answer? May I submit it, with all humility, in three words: communication, consultation and cooperation. Hospitals are communities in themselves, but abound in rumours&#x2014;small, perhaps, but if not dealt with they snowball into disputes; and those of us who have connections with hospitals in any way know how quickly rumours can spread. Area health authorities have joint consultative committees with union representation, but their field is limited. Hospital JCCs rarely exist, and in fact are frowned upon by some chairmen and administrators in case secret decisions and discussions are leaked. I, after some
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0691"/>
<col>1365</col>
difficulty with my area health authority, did get one set up in a certain local hospital. It was set up with elected staff and I can say with definite assurance that it worked well and re-created trust and confidence. Some of the old goodwill and good spirit has returned. Although I had to resign when I became a Lord-in-Waiting, I understand that the committee is still continuing with some good effect.<lb/>
Nothing is lost and much is gained by taking hospital staffs into full consultation and providing information. Patient care means dependence on all levels of staff working together: doctors, nurses, technicians, catering staff, porters, domestics and many others are all primary units in a team. There is no comparable industrial set-up elsewhere to compare with it. The tendency since reorganisation has been to regard administration as the primary factor. The service, in my view&#x2014;and I have some experience in this field&#x2014;is over administered. There has to be a new concentration on communication to all levels. There must be a joint consultative system at hospital level comprising elected representatives of all levels of staff together with management: lay and professional. There must be a full and free discussion and maximum information.<lb/>
Trust in staff will in turn create greater trust and confidence in management. Reduction of the present bureaucratic mess and creation of a system of consultation and co-operation will not only improve morale and patient care, but could lead to better financial control. In my little JCC we had suggestions how money could be saved. I am sure that the staff could make intelligent and constructive solutions and suggestions if only they were given the opportunity to do so. The suggested change of abandoning AHAs gives a great opportunity to create a far better atmosphere which in turn would eradicate much of the dispute situation which exists today, which I am sure we all deplore.<lb/>
In conclusion, may I say this. No one in his right mind wants the National Health Service to become a political battleground. We are all in it together; we can all make our constructive contributions. Our aim is, and must be, to reconstruct a service which has been, and can still be, the finest in the world.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02687">8.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02688"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this time of night I feel that I should be as short as I can, but I should like to start by saying how gratified I was that so many things that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, has said are exactly how we see things ourselves. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has frequently admitted that the reorganisation in 1974&#x2013;1975 was a mistake, and that is something to which he is turning his attention now and the consultation document will be out by the end of this year. It is expected that that consultation will take six months or so and thereafter matters can be gradually dealt with and not rushed.<lb/>
We should be more than grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for initiating this debate. It has been to me extremely interesting and I have learned a lot this evening. We have had very distinguished speakers and again I feel many of those speakers will be rather pleased when they see the consultation document before the end of this year. There is much agreement between Government thinking and many of the speeches that I have heard this evening.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, spoke of the workload which will be increasing. There is no question that that is so with the prospect over the next decade of an ageing population. The noble Lord made a balanced and very fair speech. He did not attack either noble Lords opposite or ourselves for the cuts or things that have gone wrong; he made constructive suggestions as to what could be done in the future to make improvements. I thought that he made a lot of extremely useful points, and I have no doubt that they will be much appreciated by my right honourable friend. I thought the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, made a rather sharp attack. I cannot help asking him why, as the Party opposite was in power for five years, if they really thought that the reorganisation was so erroneous, they did not take any part in altering it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02689"><member>Lord WALLACE of COSLANY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I briefly say that I was going to mention that in my speech. I was furious one day in this House. I was having tea and I met Mrs. Barbara Castle. I said, "For God's sake reorganise the Health Service" She said:
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0692"/>
<col>1367</col>
"George, it has been mucked up enough already, we cannot give alarm and despondency to the staff. You will have to wait."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02690"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps it is more suitable that we should reorganise the Service again, having reorganised it wrongly in the first place. I may take rather a long time in reply because I have an enormous number of notes, there have been rather a lot of speakers and a great many points raised. I will answer some questions now and write to a number of speakers whom I cannot answer.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to community health councils and asked me a particular question. One community health council was prevented from taking action. We know which one and I will write to the noble Lord setting out the situation as we sec it. My honourable friend the Minister of State is meeting the Association of CHCSs tomorrow and I would rather deal with the matter in the light of that meeting. My noble friend Lord Erne made an excellent speech. I should like to congratulate him on it. It was short, to the point, and non-controversial. I hope that we shall hear from him many times in the future.<lb/>
He asked me two questions: one was about infant mortality. An advisory committee on infant mortality and handicap was appointed in November 1978 by the former Minister of State for Northern Ireland with responsibility for health and social services, the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, to advise on the whole range of preventive and caring measures in the field of infant death and handicap, and to make recommendations for action. In addition to a medical chairman, there are 12 members on the committee, two community physicians, one university; two obstetricians, one university; two paediatricians; two general medical practitioners; a midwife; a social worker; a health visitor and a layman having a particular interest in socio-economic an d environmental factors. The work of eight sub-groups set up by the committee is now almost completed, and their reports are to be considered during the next few months. The advisory committee hopes to complete its work before next summer, when it is likely that its report will be published.<lb/>
<col>1368</col>
The second question the noble Earl asked me concerned continuing problems in maintaining acute hospital services in the Western area to which he referred. A joint working party comprising representatives of the Department of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland and the Western Health and Social Services Board was set up in 1976 to study the existing provision of hospital care and to make recommendations on the pattern of service which would best ensure stability for the future.<lb/>
The working party's report recommended that acute services should be based at two centres only, namely, Londonderry and Enniskillen, and that a number of existing hospitals should become community hospitals, including Tyrone and County Armagh which at present provide acute services. No final decisions have yet been taken, however. The Western board, which is at present consulting a wide variety of interests, is to submit its conclusions to the Minister of State charged with responsibility for health and social services in Northern Ireland. The Minister then intends to consult interested parties further before taking a final decision.<lb/>
We then had a most fascinating speech from the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder. It was a joy to listen to and I hope we hear from her often again. We are, of course, aware of and deeply grateful for the work of the Ryder Foundation and other voluntary organisations. We intend to encourage voluntary effort. There are obvious limits to what can be done in the present circumstances, but we shall do what we can to support voluntary effort.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Gisborough then spoke. He referred to making better use of ancillary staff and to seeing that overmanning is cut out wherever possible. However, I think my noble friend was painting a slightly unfair picture. The overwhelming majority of ancillary staff do sometimes very important work effectively and have the best interests of the service firmly in view. We had very sad occasions last winter which I hope we shall never see again; but I think we must remember the good rather than the militant minority. My noble friend also mentioned administration, and again I think he will appreciate our consultative paper when it comes out later this year.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0693"/>
<col>1369</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, referred to some of the deprived areas of London and to the Resource Allocation Working Party. He queried whether or not London was properly looked after in this respect. I think this is rather a big question to go into tonight, and I will write to the noble Lord on that score. He also referred to the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital which, as noble Lords know, is being kept open but not with all the services that it previously had.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, spoke on the subject of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, of which she has spoken several times before. I do not think I can say much to her this evening because, as she told the House, my honourable friend the Minister of State, Dr. Vaughan, is visiting the hospital on 20th November and I think that if I said anything about that in the meantime it would be inappropriate. The noble Baroness also spoke about the importance of volunteers, as have many other speakers; and we are entirely in favour of making the maximum use of volunteers both in good times and in bad, and also of supporting and encouraging voluntary organisations wherever we can.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Fisher, spoke about hospital closures. I think I must say that no Government of whatever colour likes closing hospitals. The policy of Her Majesty's Government is to keep open all the hospitals they possibly can, and particularly small hospitals. I know people get very fond of their local hospitals and even though the facilities may be greater in a larger hospital some way away, they would rather go to the hospital which they know.<lb/>
The noble Baroness mentioned waiting lists and, of course, we share her concern, but getting waiting lists down is not going to be easy. They have risen by 50 per cent. in the last five years&#x2014;from 500,000 to 750,000 or so&#x2014;and it would certainly be our greatest wish to reduce those waiting lists as quickly as we possibly can. We hope that the restructuring of the National Health Service will help towards that end.<lb/>
The noble Baroness also mentioned the cut-back in personal social services: again, most regrettable. But social ser-
<col>1370</col>
vices cannot be isolated from other forms of public expenditure. Unhappily, the public expenditure plans of the previous Administration were based on an expectation of growth of, I believe, 2 to 3 per cent. which, as we all know very well, did not occur. Without making any particular aggressive party point, it is rather a mystery to me why they actually expected such a growth rate, because during the period of their time in Office I do not think they ever got anywhere near that. However, the cut-back in the social services is certainly regretted and my noble friend has made it very clear that he hopes the elderly, the sick and the deprived people will suffer to the least possible extent, and that will be for local people to look after.<lb/>
I was asked for the level of expenditure on health as a proportion of total public expenditure programmes, and the noble Baroness gave earlier figures. The figures for which she asked are for 1974&#x2013;75, 11&#x00B7;8 per cent.; 1975&#x2013;76, 12&#x00B7;2 per cent.; 1976&#x2013;77, 12&#x00B7;7 per cent.; 1977&#x2013;78, 13&#x00B7;4 per cent.; 1978&#x2013;79, 13&#x00B7;1 per cent. and we anticipate 12&#x00B7;6 per cent. for 1979&#x2013;80.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, I entirely agree with so much of what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Rochester. He has very great experience in this field and his words will be read with great interest by my right honourable friend. I thought that we had an immensely impressive speech by the noble Lord, Lord Richardson, the chairman of the General Medical Council. It seemed to me that both his speech and the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Smith, covered so many of the things that we feel. His concern over the morale and discipline of the service, the wish to look beyond self-interest and to encourage local pride in the work, is exactly the kind of thing that we ourselves are after. I am sorry to be taking rather a long time over this, but there were a lot of speeches.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Auckland asked me several questions. He spoke about the need for better nurses' accommodation. I am sure that this is an important matter, but, though we sympathise with what he said, our philosophy is to leave it to local people to determine local arrangements and priorities. I do not think it would be right for central Government to determine local priorities, in the way that my noble friend suggested. He also asked
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0694"/>
<col>1371</col>
me when we were going to go further with the recommendations of the Briggs Committee. I am afraid I cannot answer that, but I will write to my noble friend on that point. My noble friend inquired what was happening about nurses' pay. Of course, the Clegg Commission is looking at this and will be reporting early in the New Year. The Clegg award will be implemented in two equal stages, with effect from August, 1979, and April, 1980, and we shall be honouring the commitment made by our predecessors.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, also spoke about Stoke Mandeville, so I must give her the same answer that I gave to her noble friend Lady Masham. She asked too about the missing &#x00A3;400,000. I will ensure that my right honourable friend the Minister of State looks into this matter, and will write to the noble Baroness as soon as possible.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Murray of Gravesend, spoke about the cuts. I think that my noble friend Lady Young put the position very clearly as to what actual cuts are being made, and what is the position over the two-year period. He definitely had a point about the I per cent. increase which is necessary to maintain services at the same standards. But without talking party politics, we inherited a rather difficult situation. As I said, there was an expectation of growth of 2 to 3 per cent. by the Labour Party. I do not blame them for that. It must be extremely difficult to work out these things. Anyway, the final effect is that there is not as much money in the kitty as we should like to have.<lb/>
Also, I am sure it is true to say that had the Labour Government been re-elected they would have had to cut back on public expenditure. The money was not there. They would have had the alternatives of very high increases in taxation or of borrowing money from abroad, and I doubt whether they would have wanted to do that again. I do not think I shall go any further into that point.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Murray, also suggested that the NHS might be exempted from the payment of VAT. I am sure that a lot of people would like to be exempted from the payment of VAT.
<col>1372</col>
When VAT was first introduced, it was decided that health authorities and most other public bodies should pay VAT. Extra resources were given to health authorities to enable them to meet the extra cost, and it is intended that cash limits for 1980&#x2013;81 will include provision for the full year effect of the June, 1979, increase in VAT.<lb/>
I think that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, answered many of the points which have been made today and said many of the things that I know my right honourable friends at the Department of Health and Social Security themselves feel. We agree with the noble Lord's observations in so many ways&#x2014;in particular, about not knocking the National Health Service without appreciating its achievements over the years. We were extremely lucky to have so many distinguished speakers, and I immensely enjoyed the noble Lord's speech.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Colwyn, who is also to speak tomorrow evening on the subject of fluoride, talked of the need for flexibility and setting new structures. I think he will find that our proposals will provide for flexibility. He talked of uncertainty. Uncertainty is never good for morale. I think he should wait until the consultative document comes out, with which I believe he will be pleased.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Brock, spoke about ancillary workers and also about structure. I have covered both of those points in dealing with other speeches. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, spoke of his spell in the Middlesex Hospital. It was very encouraging to hear my noble friend's account of his stay there. I am sure that his experience is typical. Indeed, consumer surveys of the service show high levels of satisfaction with the quality of care which is given.<lb/>
The noble Countess, Lady Loudoun, spoke of services for the elderly mentally disturbed. She has drawn attention to a very real problem&#x2014;one which has not, perhaps, been given the attention that it deserves. We are anxious to see improvements in services for this group of patients. In general, I agree with the noble Countess's remarks and will write to her shortly setting out how we see policies developing over the next few years. The
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0695"/>
<col>1373</col>
report of the working group on the management of mental illness hospitals will be published soon, hopefully by Christmas or early in the New Year.<lb/>
I have done my best to deal with the points which have been raised by noble Lords. I shall, as I promised, write to noble Lords on any questions to which I have not replied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02691">9.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02692"><member>Lord WINSTANLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the mover of this Motion it would normally be appropriate for me merely to say a few quick words of thanks to all those who have spoken, congratulate the maiden speakers&#x2014;which I shall do with all possible warmth in a moment&#x2014;and then beg leave to withdraw the Motion and sit down. However, may I crave the indulgence of the House and say that these are not entirely normal circumstances for me, in that this is one of the two debates in this House for which my noble friends on this Bench are allowed to choose the subject. Normally it would be the practice of the House for one of my noble friends to say a few words so as to tie up the ends above the line, as it were. However, as I informed the House, my noble friend Lady Robson of Kiddington was suddenly snatched to the grass roots of the Health Service to deal with a very urgent hospital crisis and was unable, therefore, to perform this function. Then my noble friend Lady Seear, who was to take her place, was suddenly taken ill and had to go home. Therefore we had nobody in that particular position.<lb/>
I shall be very brief. This creates no precedent, but I hope that I am not abusing the courtesy of the House if I say a few words more. Of course, I have not been entirely alone. I had excellent support from my noble friend Lord Rochester who, I thought, made a most balanced and thoughtful speech. I was deeply grateful to both the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, and the noble Lord, Lord Cullen of Ashbourne, for the way in which they so readily embraced his words, took them on board and promised to think further about them. This was particularly gratifying to me because I was most impressed by what was said by my noble friend. As has been said, he has great experience and I
<col>1374</col>
am delighted to know that his wisdom is not to be totally disregarded.<lb/>
I also had eloquent support from the noble Lord, Lord Auckland, who made a most balanced and interesting speech, for which I was most grateful. If he did nothing else, surely he will have convinced even the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, that the Benches opposite are not entirely occupied by the serried ranks of BUPA.<lb/>
Perhaps I should also say that I had the most sterling support from what was so eloquently described by the noble Baroness, Lady D'Arcy de Knayth, as the "mobile bench". Perhaps noble Lords will think it not inappropriate that a noble Lord on the Liberal Bench should have some affinity with those on the mobile bench, but I was delighted to know that our views are clearly reciprocated on that mobile bench. The noble Baroness and also the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, stressed the importance of specialised units and the great importance of nationalised funding of those units. That is something which I would certainly like to underline. I believe also underlying their words was the point that it is really a waste of resources for everybody to be trying to do everthing on a small scale when some things can be done so very much better in specialised units such as that particular one which I know so well and for which they were speaking so eloquently.<lb/>
I must now come rapidly to two very distinguished and impressive maiden speeches. The noble Earl, Lord Erne, warned us of the danger of being too preoccupied with what happens in London and other major conurbations. How right he is! And how better to remind us of that than to hear a voice that comes from a rural area just about as far from London as one could possibly get? It was really a great pleasure to hear him and I hope we shall hear him on many more occasions.<lb/>
He reminded us, too, of the existence of what I had begun to think was an endangered species&#x2014;the single-handed GP, were it not that the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, actually claimed to be one. But when the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, said, "I am a single-handed GP" I seemed to detect that somehow quietly under his breath he said, "and God bless the emergency call service"! I mention
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0696"/>
<col>1375</col>
that merely to stress that we do have new developments in medicine. We have group practice, but with group practice I think there is a feeling that somehow the old close personal relationship that used to exist with the single-handed GP is disappearing. It is a fact that it really is rather difficult to establish a very close personal relationship with an emergency call service. So it was delightful to hear that there still are single-handed GPs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02693"><member>Lord PITT of HAMPSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to intervene? When I started my practice, for the first five years I did night service for a doctor who lived down the road, so having a deputising service is not as new as all that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02694"><member>Lord WINSTANLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. With regard to the brief quarrel (if I may so describe it) between the two Front Benches, naturally I took no part in it because it happened after I had spoken. I will only say this: the subject of private practice cropped up. I have no brief for private practice, but I would say both to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and to the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, that the one thing that private practice does is to act&#x2014;or it can act&#x2014;as a very sensitive barometer of what is happening in the public sector. That is true not only of health but also of education. When one suddenly sees a growth in the private sector, and a growth in the demand for private practice, then one should start to look immediately and carefully at what has happened to the public sector. It is my honest view that for those who wish to get rid of private practice there is no better way than to improve the Health Service. Where hospitals are new, where waiting-lists are short, where doctors' lists are manageable, one looks in vain for private practice.<lb/>
So far as finance is concerned, that, too, was interesting in so far as there was a dispute between the two Front Benches. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, will forgive me if I say that there were a great many things which his Government&#x2014;if I may so call it&#x2014;would have liked to do and believed they ought to have done, had the money to do those things been available. But the money was
<col>1376</col>
not available at that time, and therefore I do not criticise the late Government for not doing some of those things. But the money is still not available. I am by no means convinced that the new Government are necessarily on the right course in order to get that money and to make it available. It may be they are and it may be they are not; time will show, but at least I am personally very grateful indeed for what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said. She said, clearly and unmistakably, that she personally and her colleagues would like to spend more on the National Health Service, and when we had more money they would spend more on the National Health Service. I hope that, if and when that time comes and if and when her Government are in power, she will have great influence to make absolutely sure that that undertaking is fully and effectively carried out.<lb/>
We heard two excellent speeches from two most distinguished doctors, Lord Richardson and Lord Smith&#x2014;if the noble Lord, Lord Smith, a surgeon, is prepared to accept the term "doctor" in its broadest sense. I think they made most interesting contributions. Lord Richardson stressed the need for a new mood, or perhaps, more appropriately, a return go an old mood, which was well recollected by the noble Lord, Lord Brock. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, used the words "rationing of health care is a fact". I accept that. I would merely say to him and others who heard those words that I think he would agree with me that people practising medicine today and in recent years, in whatever capacity, even as the president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, have been forced to cut corners in order to get work done at all, but they have cut corners on a random basis. When I talk about the need for some cost-effective studies about some of our routine procedures what I am in reality saying is that it is high time we learned not how to cut corners on a random basis merely because we have to, but how to cut corners on a planned and calculated basis so as to minimise risk and maximise use of resources which are in desperately short supply.<lb/>
I could go on and on. I really am so grateful to so many noble Lords for taking part in this debate on a very important subject. I think noble Lords have had
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0697"/>
<col>1377</col>
very important contributions to make. I could have gone on and on referring to their speeches, but I am sure your Lordships would not wish me to. I should merely like to thank each and every noble Lord who has taken part, and those who have come and listened to noble Lords who have taken part.<lb/>
Once again I congratulate the two maiden speakers on remarkable speeches. I do not think I finished on the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw. I know that I speak for every Member of this House when I say that we are very proud to have her in our House and we hope she will speak to us very often about her wonderful work. How right she was to remind us of the benefits of priming the pumps of the voluntary sector and to remind us that if the Government try to save money by ceasing to prime those pumps they will pay very dearly for that so-called economy! My Lords, I am most grateful to all who have taken part, and with those words I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02695"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I say this: The fact that I remained silent when he referred to what I had said with regard to the private sector must not be understood by him that I am in complete agreement. It is merely that because of the hour I am exercising very great control.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE STING RAY<lb/> ANTI-SUBMARINE TORPEDO</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02699"><member>The Earl of KIMBERLEY</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02700">If they will make a statement about Sting Ray, the new lightweight antisubmarine torpedo under development for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02701"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, MINISTRY of DEFENCE (Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal)</member>: The Ministry of Defence has awarded the prime contractor, Marconi Space and Defence Systems Limited, a contract for the final development and initial production of Sting Ray lightweight torpedoes for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02702">The contract includes substantial incentives for successful performance. Excesses or savings above or below an agreed target figure will be shared between the company and the Department in agreed proportions so that in general the higher the cost the lower the profit and vice versa. The company will also be eligible for bonuses for good progress and for improvements on specified operational performance. These arrangements constitute some of the strongest financial incentives the Ministry of Defence has ever negotiated for a project of this size and complexity. The readiness of private industry to accept the challenge of these risks and rewards is welcome and gives substantial confidence that delivery will be to time and cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02703">The ultimate cost of the contract will depend upon the outcome of the incentive arrangements but is expected to be over &#x00A3;200 million in today's prices. Including previous development work (on a cost-plus basis) and possible further production orders, the total cost of the Sting Ray programme could be around &#x00A3;800 million at today's prices.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02704">Sting Ray will be capable of being launched from helicopters, maritime patrol aircraft and surface ships, and will provide the advanced and highly lethal weapon needed by the Royal Navy and
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0698"/>
<col>1379</col>
Royal Air Force in the 1980s and beyond to counter the increasing capability of Warsaw Pact submarines. It will progressively replace first the US Mk 44 and subsequently the Mk 46 lightweight torpedoes currently in service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02705">The Government expect its full commitment to completion of development and initial production will arouse considerable interest among allied and friendly countries
<col>1380</col>
seeking a new lightweight torpedo with Sting Ray's advanced features. This substantial prospective market will be energectically pursued, including any prospects for collaboration in further development which might arise.</p>

<title>COMMERCIAL RETURNS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02709"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02710">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02711">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they have so far taken to relieve industry and commerce of the administrative burden and expense involved in the making of statistical and other returns.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02712"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of INDUSTRY (Viscount Trenchard)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a result of decisions taken by the Government, more than a million fewer statistical forms will be sent to firms. I am expecting more savings to be made as a result of further reviews, including that being conducted under the auspices of Sir Derek Rayner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02713"><member>Lord BOYD-CARPENTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that very encouraging reply. May I ask him to confirm what I think is implicit in it, namely, that Her Majesty's Government appreciate the very real burden, particularly on small firms, involved in the compilation of elaborate statistical returns? May I ask him, further, whether he will invite his right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture to cease to demand from very small farmers or market gardeners the completion of immense forms demanding, <i>inter alia,</i> the number of hectares under aspidistras?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02714"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can certainly say to my noble friend that the small firm aspect of this problem is uppermost in my mind, and that it has priority. I should pay tribute to the previous Administration for starting an interdepartmental review of statistical
<col>1382</col>
inquiries which had already laid plans for the saving of some forms required from small firms. So far as farmers are concerned, I really cannot answer, but I shall draw my noble friend's remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02715"><member>Lord WYNNE-JONES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount not agree that, if a sufficient amount of inaccurate statistical information is collected, the mean of it has a certain probability of being approximately right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02716"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to say that there is no question that, in cutting down the quantity and sometimes the frequency of statistical forms, one is to a very small degree&#x2014;and that has been our guiding light, that it is only to a very small degree&#x2014;affecting the statistical accuracy of the final results as presented ; but if one uses all modern techniques and examines one's sample properly, I am convinced that we can go considerably further. I think I should put this in perspective by saying that the saving of a million forms relates to 4&#x00BD;million forms on the statistical side&#x2014;not on the administrative side, where there are many more forms&#x2014;and that, according to the thickness of the paper, if we piled them on top of each other I believe they would be considerably higher than Big Ben.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02717"><member>Lord BALOGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Viscount agree that the postponement of the verification of statistics is a good way to camouflage the consequent worsening of the situation under the present Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02718"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is not part of the Government's intention, nor their achievement. The worsening of the situation has, at this stage still, far more to do with the incredible position we inherited than with anything we have done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02719"><member>Lord ORR-EWING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend include small shopkeepers among those particularly deserving of attention, as many are so sorely overloaded by form-filling that in villages all round our country they are even closing down, to the great disadvantage of village life? Secondly, will he
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0700"/>
<col>1383</col>
remember that it is not just a matter of statistics but of administration forms as well, and that pressure needs to be kept up? It is no good doing it for once and then slackening off, because forms grow even faster than aspidistras.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02720"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for mentioning retail shops. Of the total number of forms I have mentioned, 150,000 forms have been saved by abandoning plans to hold a retail shops inquiry in 1981. So far as administrative forms are concerned, this is a more difficult problem and must follow a policy as to what the Government administer and what they do not. In this respect, and not included in my total, we have of course already made a small contribution. The Price Commission no longer sends forms; a few came from exchange control; and, while we have been criticised for it, our more effective but narrower regional policy will also involve fewer forms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02721"><member>The Earl of HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Viscount bear in mind that a statistical investigation into the utility of statistics could be a cure that was worse than the disease?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02722"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think Sir Derek Rayner's sponsored inquiries have already shown their worth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02723"><member>Viscount ECCLES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend assure me that, having cut down the form filling requirements, better use will be made of the forms that we do fill in? I filled in my livestock form and, being completely fed up with it, I put down: "one elephant and two giraffes" and nobody took any notice!</membercontribution></p>

<title>TEXTILE IMPORTS FROMNEW EEC MEMBERS</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02725">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02726"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02727">The Question was as follows:</p>
<col>1384</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02728">To ask Her Majesty's Government with regard to the integration of the textile and clothing industries of Greece, Spain and Portugal into the Community market, what specific transitional arrangements (<i>i.e.</i> residual quotas and other safeguard mechanisms) are envisaged in order to avoid serious disruption to these industries in the existing Member States.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02729"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, under their present trading agreements with the EEC, Greece, Spain and Portugal&#x2014;that is, all the aspiring members&#x2014;are entitled to unrestricted access to the Community's markets for textile products. However, at present, all three countries are restraining their exports to the Community within agreed limits on a voluntary basis. The Treaty of Accession which has already been signed with Greece includes a reciprocal safeguard clause which would allow the Commission to authorise action against disruptive imports during the transitional period. That transitional period for Greece is five years. We feel that the safeguard clause is in itself not a wholly satisfactory way of dealing with the problem, and we shall be seeking alternatives in the negotiations with Portugal and Spain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02730"><member>Baroness HORNSBY-SMITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, but may I ask whether he will also bear in mind that for years the Greek Government have aided their textile export industry by tax concessions and other subsidies? Could we have some assurance that, not only now but when they are fully in the EEC, these practices, which are against the regulations of the MFA and indeed GATT, will cease and will not continue producing such unfair competition?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02731"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we certainly intend, as my right honourable friends said in the other place yesterday in the debate on the textile industry, to investigate all allegations of unfair trading, and to help in any way we can to ensure that competition for this industry is on a fair basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02732"><member>Lord BARNBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say, with regard to his first Answer to the noble Baroness&#x2014;in which he referred to the specific countries&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0701"/>
<col>1385</col>
whether in view of the critical position of the textile industries, Her Majesty's Government control in any way imports from low-cost countries into those countries, whence of course they in turn can come into this country under the arrangements he described?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02733"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the case of the countries of which we are speaking, they are generally regarded as being low-cost countries. I am not aware of them being used as, so to speak, intermediate points, as has been alleged in the case of Mauritius. We are looking into that. I am not aware of anything on those lines. To put the matter in perspective here&#x2014;and I appreciate that from the textile industry's point of view it is the accumulation of small increases in imports that worries them&#x2014;the 1978 figures for imports from Greece and Portugal were each 1 per cent. of the total imports into the United Kingdom. In the case of Spain, the figure was 5 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02734"><member>Lord HAWKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do Her Majesty's Government agree that, for strategic purposes, it is absolutely essential to maintain both a cotton and a woollen textile industry of a reasonable size in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02735"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are confident that on a fair competitive basis both of those sections of the industry, which are large and very important, will continue to have a major part to play. It is not for Government to ensure at any cost or by unilateral protection that the exact size or shape of any section of industry should be maintained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02736"><member>Lord HALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not also essential that we should maintain this industry, which already has been allowed to dwindle from one of our very largest and most important and which has a high standard of employment and a record of freedom from industrial disputes, of acceptance of sacrifice throughout the century and of co-operation with the Government of the day? The industry is now seriously menaced. If I may incorporate a second point as regards what the noble Viscount said so well&#x2014;and we appreciated what he said&#x2014;if he is conducting an investigation into what is happening in the EEC
<col>1386</col>
in relation to textiles, will the Government see what checks can be applied? We all generally welcome the accession of Greece, but that means the opening of another frontier singularly close to many of those countries which are already sending a large amount of textiles, and which may open the necessity for a reexamination of the monitoring which is to follow the accession to the Treaty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02737"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: I should like to thank the noble Lord for those very interesting points. We agree entirely with much of what he said about the efficiency and adaptability that have been shown by the textile industry in recent years, but this is an age of change and that has to go on. I do not think it is the moment to go into the wider questions he raises. If I may return to the limited question with one final remark, which I hope your Lordships will not regard as flippant, I tried to look into the degree to which the voluntary agreements in relation to the three countries which are the subject of the Question today have been effective. I can really find only two instances of any major difficulty. The latest one, over which we are still negotiating, is in relation to imports of Spanish under-pants, which are well above their agreed voluntary level. Her Majesty's Government are looking at every possible way of lowering the level of imports of Spanish pants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02738"><member>Baroness LLEWELYN-DAVIES of HASTOE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may we ask the noble Viscount whether they were male or female under-pants?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02739"><member>Viscount TRENCHARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I asked that question and my office does not know. I think, in Civil Service terms, "pants" can also be "panties".</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02741"><member>Baroness DUDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02742">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02743">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they intend to amend the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0702"/>
<col>1387</col>
employment protection legislation so as to give small business more flexibility in employing staff.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02744"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, DEPARTMENT of EMPLOYMENT (The Earl of Gowrie)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are currently engaged in consultation on their proposals to amend the employment protection legislation, some of which have been framed with the specific purpose of giving small businesses more flexibility in employing staff. Copies of the working paper for consultation, published on 25th September, have been deposited in the Library.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02745"><member>Baroness DUDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it true to say that if every small business employed one extra person it would cut unemployment by half?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02746"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, without wishing to initiate further statistical surveys, I understand that is roughly the position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02747"><member>Baroness EMMET of AMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming the Minister's reply, may I ask whether he will be able to help to make the situation easier for invalids and older people who have to do shopping but can now no longer shop in the villages because the shops are closed? We used to have seven shops; we now have one. This is closely tied in with the transport problem. Will the noble Earl please give his mind to some flexibility both to help the individual shopkeeper and also as regards transport to other, nearer shopping centres?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02748"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I altogether agree with my noble friend that the proliferation of small businesses is useful not only in employment terms but also as regards services to the public, particularly in rural areas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02749"><member>Lord SPENS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that at the moment we suffer from two employment protection Acts: that of 1975 and the consolidation Act of 1978, which did not appear to consolidate very much? Does the Minister not agree that it would be far better if a further consolidation Act were introduced, which was very much slimmer
<col>1388</col>
than either of the two present Acts, which would be of very great advantage to small businesses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02750"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware, of course, that the Government are fully committed to the concept of employment protection. It was, after all, a Conservative Government which first brought into law the concepts of, for instance, remedies for unfair dismissal. But I agree that things very rapidly got out of hand, and that is why we are seeking to amend the legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02751"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister not agree that, despite his lip-service to the furtherance of small businesses, in view of the Government's fiscal policies there will be very few small businesses left in the very near future?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02752"><member>The Earl of GOWRIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is perfectly right in saying that inflation falls harder on the smaller rather than on the larger business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02753"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in that case, of course, the noble Earl is agreeing with what I say, because the present Government are pushing inflation well above the 20 per cent. mark, and&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02757"><member>Lord BARNBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while expressing my apologies to the noble Baroness for too early an intrusion, I ask leave to put the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02758">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02759">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will take steps to prohibit interference with sporting and recreational activities and to impose or strengthen penalties for such interference.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0703"/>
<col>1389</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02760"><member>The PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY of STATE, HOME OFFICE (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, interference with sporting activities may infringe a number of provisions of the criminal law. My right honourable friend knows of no present need to strengthen the law in this area. The prevention of disorder at individual events is a matter for the chief officer of police concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02761"><member>Lord BARN BY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in thanking the Minister for that informative reply, may I ask him whether he understands that my Question should have referred only to recreational and not sporting activities? It is difficult to divide the two. I refer particularly to games such as football or golf, and so on. Is it not possible by some means to achieve&#x2014;not by further legislation because that is not what I seek, but by administration&#x2014;some cessation of interference in games such as I have described, by such bestial and uncivilised means of incitement as to put glass on football pitches and to tear up golf greens? There are millions who want to see lawful games played under authoritative rules, and it is that test of international strength which millions of the community want to see and which seemingly could be helped by more rigid action such as I have asked the noble Lord to give an assurance about.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02762"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I share my noble friend's concern that when people put their views forward by taking action which goes beyond the limits which have been set by the law, that is something which should cause us all concern. My noble friend asks me whether this cannot be prevented, not by further legislation but by administrative means. May I give him two answers? I think, first, one needs to do as my noble friend did in his Question, namely, to look at the penalties; and I ought just to point out that the penalties for the kind of offences I think my noble friend may have in mind are not inconsiderable. To give one example only, conduct conducive to a breach of the peace carries with it now a maximum fine of &#x00A3;1,000 or six months' imprisonment or both.<lb/>
Secondly, may I say to my noble friend that when he refers to administrative means to combat the sorts of practices
<col>1390</col>
he deplores, he may be interested to hear that the Government intend to increase the number of attendance centres, which are places where young people causing trouble may be given a more sensible occupation, particularly on Saturday afternoons, to keep them out of trouble. There are 85 such centres in England and Wales at the moment and the Government are taking steps to increase that number.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02763"><member>Lord PAGET of NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that modern society is suffering from an overdose of politics and that the invasion of politics into the realm of sport is becoming quite intolerable? Would not a Home Office note to the magistrates, that a few swingeing sentences here would be welcome, be extremely beneficial?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02764"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with a very great deal of what the noble Lord has said, but not, if I may say so, with his final remarks. I think there are many noble Lords here who would jump on me very quickly, if I did not make the point that the Home Secretary is not responsible for the enforcement of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02765"><member>Lord FERRIER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that there are many people in the country, among whom I include myself&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

who are egging on the crowds from the back? Is he aware that some of us feel that it is no good picking up the silly people in front, who throw the stones?

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02771"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far as the enforcement of the law is concerned, as I was venturing to say to the noble Lord, Lord Paget, this is a matter for the police in consultation, as appropriate, with the Law Officers.

<title>CITY OF LONDON (VARIOUS POWERS) BILL</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02778">3.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02779"><member>Lord MATS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<col>1392</col>
I hope that it will not be a contentious Bill, but there are one or two points which may cause your Lordships concern and I hope that I can, as briefly as possible, dispel those fears. As some of your Lordships know, Epping Forest, which is covered in Part II of the Bill, covers about 6,000 acres of the North-East of London. It is maintained by the Corporation of London as Conservators of the Forest, without expense to the public, under the powers contained in the Epping Forest Act 1878. That Act lays upon the Conservators two duties which are particularly pertinent in the present circumstances: first, to preserve as far as possible the natural aspects of the forest; and, secondly, not to sell, demise or otherwise alienate any part of the forest.<lb/>
The Conservators take, and always have taken, these obligations very seriously. Nevertheless, they are only too well aware that they cannot completely ignore the fact that we are in the twentieth century so, when it is possible to do so without undue damage to the environment, they have endeavoured to meet the requirements of public bodies and others, primarily by means of a system of wayleaves. From time to time, however, very careful consideration has to be given to applications in connection with road improvements&#x2014;and by that I mean mostly major road improvements&#x2014;because of their effect upon the natural aspect of the forest, and also because of the 1878 Act, which contains specific powers to allow the Conservators to permit the dedication of forest land for such purposes.<lb/>
Over the years, there have been a number of occasions when land has been dedicated in this way, although the areas involved have usually been small. Very approximately, since the Act was passed in 1878, the Conservators have in fact made available about 100 acres, and in return, because they are required to seek land in replacement, they have acquired back 175 acres, so that the forest has grown, not shrunk. However, where more substantial road improvements are in view, the Conservators advise the relative highway authority that the land cannot be made available without first seeking the sanction of Parliament to an appropriate variation in the 1878 Act.<lb/>
On only one prior occasion has such an application been made, and that was in
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0705"/>
<col>1393</col>
1967, when the Minister of Transport put forward proposals for re-routing the North Circular Road at Walthamstow. The Conservators asked that the road should be built in a tunnel where it passed under the forest and they were told that that was not practical. They then decided that their powers of dedication were inadequate, and the matter was referred to Parliament. After this had been considered and a public inquiry held, it was agreed that the matter should proceed, anyway, to planning stage.<lb/>
The Conservators have at all times been concerned about the orbital road, the M25, since its inception and, quite naturally, our first reaction was that we did not want the road to go through the forest or anywhere near it. But, eventually, we came to appreciate that there was no alternative route. By 1970, the Department of the Environment had, in fact, produced five alternative routes through the forest for that road. The Conservators would have preferred a route that went further to the North, but that was not possible. So, eventually, they decided that the most northern route was the one that would cause least damage to the forest. That was the route that passed through Bell Common. But the condition was that the whole length of that road where it passed through the forest should be in a tunnel. That was eventually agreed to and that is the position today. Part II of the Bill reflects these proposals.<lb/>
In addition, the Conservators maintain their stand with regard to the road being in a tunnel, and they have given an assurance that the cricket ground at Bell Common will be restored, and also that suitable land will be provided in return for the land which is taken, so that the forest will not suffer. Apart from Bell Common, the motorway and the associated roads encroach upon the common of the forest in three places, but it is roadside verge land which is involved. They are little patches of land, not connected with the main body of the forest, and their absorption into the motorway will not in any way diminish the potentiality of the forest; and, once again, the Conservators will receive back land in place of that which is taken.<lb/>
The Conservators' first interest is and always has been to preserve the forest in its perfect state, but they have decided
<col>1394</col>
that the arrangements which have been now put forward are the very best that can be devised. For that reason, they lend their support to the Government through the promotion of this Bill.<lb/>
So much for Epping Forest. May I for a moment dwell on Billingsgate Market. This is referred to in paragraph 5 of the statement. Your Lordships can imagine that the Corporation is somewhat sad at the thought of the City losing this ancient market. However, one cannot build a new market and at the same time keep the present one operating. Therefore we accept that it must be moved from the City both in the interests of traffic and in the interests of producing a modern market. We are glad that the market is to be moved to the adjoining borough of Tower Hamlets, where access will be better for the users of the market. We hope that it will provide employment in an area which requires additional employment facilities. From the point of view of the City, it will also render the through route at the end of the underpass very much better for through traffic.<lb/>
I believe that certain of your Lordships could be disturbed about the clause relating to the Museum of London. In that clause we are seeking permission to charge for special and exceptional exhibitions. It is not the City's intention to impose for the time being any charge for ordinary admission. However, without being able to charge for special and exceptional exhibitions, the limited funds at the disposal of the museum are such that unless we can do this there just will be no special exhibitions. I hope your Lordships will agree that that would be unfortunate and not in the interests of the public.<lb/>
Lastly, may I deal with Tower Bridge. This is a straightforward matter. The proposals have the full support of the London Tourist Board. The object is to make available to the public the upper two storeys of the two towers and the high-level walkways between the towers. They will be able to see the old hydraulic engines which used to operate the bascules and they will have an excellent view from those high level walkways. In no way does this obstruct the footpaths of the bridge itself, or the roadway of the bridge. When the bridge is open, it does not affect the upper storeys but it does affect the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0706"/>
<col>1395</col>
bridge. Apart from that, these proposals will in no way cause any obstruction to the normal operation of Tower Bridge.<lb/>
There is another clause relating to Spitalfields. For years now, Spitalfields Market has been operated on a weekly tenancy and I am sure your Lordships will agree that this is most inconvenient. It gives the market traders no security whatsoever. Under this heading, the Bill is seeking to give to the Corporation authority to let or license the occupation of a stall or a stand for periods up to 21 years.<lb/>
Lastly, Clause 21 relates to the increase of fines for offences under Section 35 of the City of London Police Act, which deals with certain offences in thoroughfares, including furious driving, obstruction and the discharge of firearms. Having sat for 20 years on the Bench in the City I have never yet had to deal with a case of discharge of firearms or furious driving. I have dealt with traffic charges under different headings, but personally I do not think we could disagree that to ask for an increase from a &#x00A3;20 to a &#x00A3;50 fine for discharging firearms or driving furiously is exactly overcharging by present-day standards. It is, in fact, a modest adjustment.<lb/>
That is all I can say to, I hope, explain and possibly clarify this Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02780">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>. (<i>Lord Mais.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02781">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02782"><member>Lord UNDERHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to deal with Part II of the Bill relating to Epping Forest. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mais, for the detailed explanation he has given of the position, therefore enabling me to cut down my remarks.<lb/>
My interest is that I am one of those very fortunate persons who for practically all his life has been able to enjoy the amenities of Epping Forest. For over 30 years I lived in East London&#x2014;in Leyton, in which some of the detached parts of the forest are to be seen. If one looks at those detached parts, one see what happens when roadways are constructed all round parts of the forest.
<col>1396</col>
I now live in Buckhurst Hill which is in the Epping Forest local authority area. That is the area in which most of the main parts of the forest are situated. Only this morning I passed what is known as Lopping Hall in Loughton, which was erected some 100 years ago as a public hall with funds which arose from the defence of certain interests in the forest.<lb/>
I mention these personal matters because it is not just the interests of the people who reside on the fringe of the forest which are concerned. Epping Forest has been a valuable lung for thousands of people who live in East London. It has been a source of pleasure and recreation for all those people. The noble Lord, Lord Mais, referred to the Act of 1878 which established Epping Forest and gave powers to the Conservators. It arose because of public concern over the considerable encroachments which were being made on the forest. Those who know Epping Forest will appreciate that it is a forest of very distinctive charm.<lb/>
I should like to pay my tribute to the Corporation of London and to the Conservators for the way in which they have cared for the forest. There is no criticism from me about their actions. It is because of their work that so much of the forest has been left in its natural state. Only last year there were widespread celebrations on the centenary of the establishment of the forest. A century ago the struggle was against illegal encroachment. Now the struggle appears to be against public bodies which seek to take parts of the forest for roads and other developments.<lb/>
The Bill explains that the scheme is for some nine acres to be required permanently for the construction of a six-lane motorway and for 5&#x00BD;acres to be taken over temporarily in connection with road works. I readily appreciate that others will be vitally concerned with the construction of this motorway, believing that it will relieve their own areas of heavy traffic, particularly of juggernauts. It may be irrelevant to the Bill, but I must comment that surely a more sensible, integrated system of transport would mean that we could save a considerable sum of money on road works without having these massive vehicles conveying certain of our goods. While developments must take
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0707"/>
<col>1397</col>
place&#x2014;I recognise that developments may impinge upon the environment&#x2014;we must ensure that nothing is done to damage one of our great heritages. Epping Forest is one such heritage.<lb/>
Sir William Addison, who for over 20 years was closely concerned with the care and maintenance of the forest, has written in his book <i>Portrait of Epping Forest</i>:
<quote>"The threat to the forest in the 1970s comes not from a small number of privileged persons for the purposes of profit but from planning authorities in the name of progress".</quote>
Sir William Addison has been a verderer in charge of the care of the forest for well over 20 years. He also wrote:
<quote>"The threat of roads must remain the major anxiety of the Conservators for many years to come".</quote>
It is for that reason that I believe your Lordships should not allow a Bill of this kind to pass without the closest scrutiny. It may be said that only 14 acres are involved and that this is merely a nibble. Well, it seems that we have one nibble after another, and this seems to be a big bite.<lb/>
I understand that there will be petitions against the Bill and I am sure your Lordships will agree that there are tens of thousands of people who take these things for granted. People in the vicinity and in East London take their forest for granted. Most people will not even be aware that a roadwork of this kind is contemplated until the upheaval starts.<lb/>
I should like to make a few observations to your Lordships which I should be obliged if the noble Lord who is to reply to this debate will deal with. First, is it possible, even at this stage, to adjust the proposed route of this six-lane motorway affecting the forest so that encroachment may be avoided? If not, I hope it will be accepted that such encroachment will be avoided in future. Then, will the Minister confirm that this will be the last such road development to make a claim on the forest? That seems to be the view expressed in another place by the Committee which considered this matter, and I should appreciate the Minister's view upon that.<lb/>
I have emphasised that the Conservators do a splendid job in caring for the forest and the rights of the public; but should the Minister be unable to give
<col>1398</col>
this undertaking for the future, it would be regrettable but I would hope that the Conservators, as good a job as they have done up to now, will have to decide that in future they will resist any such major road development of this kind.<lb/>
I come to my last few points. First, what is the precise nature of the land which is to be handed over to the Conservators to replace the land which is to be given up permanently? If it is open land, will it be possible to develop that land as an integral part of the existing forest'? Will any woodlands which have been there for centuries be destroyed in the land to be taken over temporarily, and, if so, what steps can be taken to rectify that position?<lb/>
In another place it was stated that it was very heavy lorry traffic that it was hoped would be diverted to the M25. What are the views of scientists and naturalists on the possible effects of noise and diesel fumes on the splendid wildlife which exists in the forest? In conclusion, my Lords, I appeal to your Lordships that in considering this matter, now and in Committee, the excellent objectives and the whole spirit of the 1878 Act are preserved and that this matter does not in any way mar the great characteristics of this fine forest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02783">3.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02784"><member>Lord MOWBRAY and STOURTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be helpful if I explain the Government's position on Part II of this Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Mais, said in introducing the Bill, this part is being promoted by the City of London to enable the Department of Transport to acquire land in Epping Forest needed to build part of the M25, the London orbital route.<lb/>
This route has the highest priority in the Government's road building programme. It will serve three main functions. First, it will provide a convenient and safe way round Greater London for through traffic, particularly traffic from the Midlands and North going to the ports on the East Coast, on the English Channel and at Tilbury. It will also link Heathrow and Gatwick and provide a route from those airports to the M4, M40, and M1. Secondly, it will act as a general distributor, linking the radial routes that carry traffic into and out of London. Drivers
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0708"/>
<col>1399</col>
will be able to reach places in London or find the most convenient access road without crossing the centre or using existing inadequate orbital routes. No doubt many of your Lordships who use the present orbital roads will appreciate this point. Thirdly, it will also bring substantial local relief to many congested roads in the towns and villages on the outskirts of London.<lb/>
At present, 32 miles of the road are open to traffic. Indeed a 9-mile section between Godstone and Sevenoaks was opened by the Minister of Transport yesterday. A further 15 miles are under construction. On the remaining 72 miles the route has been fixed for just over half and the department are completing the remaining statutory procedures for the acquisition of land and the final design work. The section which passes through the northern tip of Epping Forest comes in this category. Planning is well advanced on the remaining 34 miles for which the route has not yet been fixed, and in fact a public inquiry is being held at the moment into the route of a 13-mile stretch between London Airport and Rickmansworth. Assuming that we can complete these remaining procedures satisfactorily, I expect that the whole road will be finished by the end of 1985.<lb/>
The North-East quadrant of the road, which includes the section through the forest, will play a significant role in taking traffic from the M1 and the A1 to Tilbury and Channel ports. It should also benefit more local traffic moving round this North-Eastern sector of London. Without this section, increasing volumes of heavy traffic would continue to use routes through London and its suburbs, or, alternatively, through rural Essex and Hertfordshire, on totally unsuitable roads causing increasing delays for both through and local traffic. My Lords, that would be undesirable both for those who live in the area and those travelling through it. A transfer of traffic to a purpose-built road will lead to substantial environmental benefits for the London suburbs and the towns and villages of Essex and Hertfordshire.<lb/>
The proposed route for the section between the A10 at Bulls Cross and the A 11 near Brentwood was published in 1973. Over 1,500 objections were received and a public inquiry was held in Epping
<col>1400</col>
between December 1974 and July 1975. The inquiry sat for 89 days. At the time, it was the longest inquiry ever held. All the objectors had a fair chance to put their views forward.<lb/>
The inspector reported in May 1976. He took into account the department's forecast of the number of vehicles likely to use the road, the environmental effects and the effects on agriculture, green-belt land and the forest. He declared himself satisfied that the road was needed and that the environmental damage it would cause would be more than offset by the environmental benefits enjoyed by the wider community. The report is over 900 pages long. Although the size of the report and the length of the inquiry are not themselves conclusive evidence that nothing has been overlooked, I hope that your Lordships will accept that all the relevant factors were very carefully and thoroughly considered by the inspector. He recommended that the line orders should be made, as drafted, subject to some minor alterations.<lb/>
The then Secretaries of State for Transport and for the Environment considered the inspector's report, and their decision was announced in a letter dated 28th September 1977. The line orders were made on 1st March 1978. Since then the Department of Transport has been going ahead with the remaining statutory procedures, of which this Bill forms part. Public inquiries were held into draft compulsory purchase orders for other parts of the A10 to M11 section while this Bill was being considered in another place. Perhaps I should add that anyone who is compelled to give up land will of course receive compensation based on the market value of their property.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has raised various points, such as whether, even at this late stage, it would be possible to adjust the route of the M25 to avoid the forest. I should explain that the route for this section has been under study since 1970, and I think it would be fair to claim that almost all possibilities have been raised at some time or other. The noble Lord also asked whether this development would be the last, and, if not, whether the Conservators would object to further development. I cannot speak for the Conservators, but, so far as the department is concerned, we have no
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0709"/>
<col>1401</col>
plans for any other schemes in this part of the forest. I know that the Upshire Village Preservation Society have been concerned about the A121, Honey Lane, which will be linked to the motorway by an interchange, fearing that it will need to be widened. Honey Lane is not a trunk road, so Essex County Council are the highway authority. I understand they have said that they have no plans to widen it. We certainly have not.<lb/>
The department are, however, studying some road schemes further South designed to relieve congestion in the Hackney and Barking areas. Some forest land may be affected, but none of these roads is on the same scale as the M25, and the land involved consists of long narrow strips alongside existing roads. We are consulting the local authorities concerned and the Conservators of Epping Forest. No decisions have been taken.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, is also concerned about the A121, Honey Lane interchange. We accept that Honey Lane may suffer some increase in traffic but other forest roads will benefit. On balance the Honey Lane interchange will result in a reduction in the amount of traffic using forest roads and will bring a great deal of relief to Waltham Abbey. The interchange is better left in than out.<lb/>
The route in the area of the forest is a compromise. A route further to the South would have been more direct, but although it would have been cheaper and more convenient for motorists, it would have passed through a broad part of the forest. A route further to the North than the current scheme designed to avoid the forest altogether would have been significantly longer and so would have taken more land, property and houses, would have cost more, and would have been less convenient for motorists.<lb/>
The compromise route is designed to have the minimum impact on the forest. It touches forest land at four points, but with the exception of Bell Common these are all roadside verges. At the two principal points where these verges are crossed the motorway will be carried on bridges so that riders and walkers will be able to follow virtually their present paths. At Bell Common the road passes through about 500 yards of the forest. The department had originally proposed that
<col>1402</col>
the road should be constructed in a cut-and-cover tunnel for about half that length in order to preserve the continuity of the forest land. The inspector, however, supported the proposal put forward by the Conservators that the whole length should be in a tunnel. The Secretaries of State accepted that recommendation. The cost of the tunnel will be about &#x00A3;13 million. After construction the land on top of the tunnel will be returned to its current use, which is as a cricket ground. Clause 7 will lay on the department responsibility to provide the cricket club with equivalent facilities to those they now enjoy. In the meantime, while the road is being constructed, the cricket club will be using another ground and the department will be reimbursing them for the rental.<lb/>
The department will, my Lords, be taking all measures it can to minimise the effect of the road on the forest and its wildlife. In addition to the tunnel at Bell Common, one of the accommodation bridges will be wider than normal in order to allow deer to travel between the forest and the Essex countryside. A culvert under the road will be provided for the same purpose. There will be chain-link fencing along the side of the road in order to prevent deer trying to cross it directly. Trees and shrubs will be planted alongside the road; this could involve planting up to a quarter of a million saplings. The department has been discussing with the Nature Conservancy Council what species should be used, and wherever practicable will follow their advice. In particular, and with the agreement of the Conservators, the department will use saplings taken from the Forest, but it may not be possible to obtain the quantity which will be needed from this source.<lb/>
The amount of land involved in Part II of the Bill is 14&#x00BD; acres out of the 6,000 acres which form the forest. The department will be buying and giving to the Conservators 14&#x00BD; acres of land adjacent to the forest in exchange. Landowners have been approached, but no agreements have yet been reached, so I cannot give any details for fear of prejudicing future negotiations. The Conservators know what we are proposing and I understand that they are content. Five and a half acres of the land to be taken for the road is in fact required only temporarily,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0710"/>
<col>1403</col>
and will be returned to the Conservators when it has been built. Of the remaining nine acres which will be held permanently six acres will be open to the public, including the area over the cut-and-cover tunnel.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, asked how long it would be before the land acquired only temporarily was restored to its present state. I understand that the contractors will need the land for about two and a half years. When they have finished the department will landscape it, plant grass, shrubs and saplings, and return it to the Conservators. It should be back to normal in about five years' time.<lb/>
My Lords, I hope the House will accept that the department has made every effort to find a route which does the least damage to the forest and has taken every reasonable step to minimise the effect of the route on it and its wildlife. This section of the M25 is urgently needed. If it were not built the damaging effect on the forest of the traffic seeking its way between the completed parts of the orbital road would be far worse than the impact of the road which is proposed. I regret that it is necessary to take land from the forest, but failure to complete the road would leave unsolved acute problems of congestion, noise, pollution and danger. My Lords, I would, therefore, ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MONETARY POLICY</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02786">4.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02787"><member>The MINISTER of STATE, TREASURY (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Statement is as follows:
<col>1404</col>
"With the permission of the House, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on monetary policy.<lb/>
"The figures for October, just published, show that &#x00A3;M3 grew by 2 per cent. in that banking month. The growth since mid-June, the beginning of the target period, has been equivalent to just over 14 per cent. a year. Although the figure for banking October was erratically high, it is clear that the underlying growth of &#x00A3;M3 is still significantly above the target of 7 to 11 per cent.<lb/>
"There have been two principal causes of this excess: a higher than expected public sector borrowing requirement in the first half of the year and the persistently high level of bank lending.<lb/>
"Because of the timing of the Budget measures&#x2014;in particular receipts from VAT and reductions in public spending&#x2014;the PSBR was always expected to be higher in the first half of the year than in the second. In the event, the PSBR in the first half-year has been further increased by strikes and other industrial action, which have delayed the collection of VAT and telephone bills. At the peak arrears on telephone bills are expected to reach &#x00A3;1 billion.<lb/>
"A large part of these arrears will be made good in the second half-year. Even so, the best estimate which could now be made of the PSBR for the year as a whole if no action is taken is that it would be about &#x00A3;9 billion, compared with the &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;3 billion Budget estimate.<lb/>
"The monthly growth of bank lending has averaged about &#x00A3;700 million over the last quarter. Although the timing is difficult to predict, its growth can be expected to fall in due course.<lb/>
"Nevertheless it is necessary to take action now to bring the growth of the money supply within the target range. The Bank of England accordingly announced this morning with my approval that Minimum Lending Rate would be increased to 17 per cent. This goes beyond the rise in market interest rates at home and demonstrates the Government's determination to act with the firmness foreshadowed
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0711"/>
<col>1405</col>
by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister earlier this week.<lb/>
"The House will realise that interest rates overseas have risen sharply as other countries have moved to fight inflation by limiting monetary growth. In the United States, for example, prime rates have risen from 11&#x00BD; to 15&#x00BD; per cent. since the summer.<lb/>
"In addition to sales of gilts, we intend to secure further funding of the PSBR through National Savings. The limit on holdings of the index-linked National Savings Certificates Retirement Issue will be increased next month from &#x00A3;700 to &#x00A3;1,200. A new ordinary National Savings Certificate will be introduced early next year. The interest rate on the National Savings Bank investment account will be raised to 15 per cent. from 1st January next.<lb/>
"Although much of the increase in the estimate of this year's PSBR is due to the timing of receipts, further action is required to bring the PSBR down. In the light of this we shall require oil companies to make a payment on account of petroleum revenue tax at the time when they make their returns. This will have the effect from now on of advancing the due date for collection by two months, thus bringing the arrangements for PRT into line with those for collecting royalties. This will ensure that PRT reaches the Exchequer with the minimum of delay at a time when oil prices are rising.<lb/>
"The Bill to achieve this will be introduced shortly. It will reduce this year's PSBR by &#x00A3;700 million and thus bring the estimated level back to the original Budget figure of &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;3 billion. It will also yield an extra &#x00A3;300 million next year, in addition to &#x00A3;400 million or so from the deferred payment of telephone bills.<lb/>
"I set in hand some months ago a review of methods of controlling the growth of the money supply. The main instruments must continue to be our public expenditure and tax policies, which together determine both the size and the composition of the PSBR, and interest rate policies. Recently the Supplementary Special Deposits scheme, or corset, has also played a part in monetary control. I am well aware of
<col>1406</col>
the limitations of this scheme and do not believe that it has a permanent role to play. Nevertheless, the Governor and I have agreed that it is right that it should continue for a further six months. The Bank announced the arrangements this morning.<lb/>
"In the future, other techniques, including one of the variants of monetary base control, could play a useful role, without the disadvantages of the SSD scheme. The Bank and Treasury will therefore shortly issue a discussion paper for consultation. I must, however, stress that no such scheme can avoid the need for the right fiscal and interest rate policies. Indeed, one of the possible advantages would be to improve the response of interest rates to monetary conditions.<lb/>
"Finally, I am extending the period covered by the present target range for &#x00A3;M3 of 7 to 11 per cent. per annum. That target at present applies to the 10 months from mid-June 1979 to mid-April 1980. It will now cover the 16 months from mid-June to mid-October 1980. The effect will be to avoid building into the target for the new period the excess growth of the money supply in the recent past, while allowing a reasonable period in which to offset that excess.<lb/>
Mr. Speaker, Britain's future depends above all on mastering inflation. This can only be done if we bring the money supply under firm control, progressively reduce the rate of monetary growth over the years, and pursue the most rigorous restraint on public spending. The supposed alternatives to these policies are a delusion. None of them would be responsible and none of them would be sustainable. The action I have taken today underlines the Government's total and continuing commitment to getting inflation down."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02788">4.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02789"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not only the weather that is very bleak today. We have now heard that the minimum lending rate is going up to 17 per cent., which is the highest in the history of the United Kingdom. The Government's rigid stance on monetary policy which has
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0712"/>
<col>1407</col>
reached an unenviable peak today, is a major disincentive to investment, resulting in an enormous setback to economic recovery. Higher interest rates will damage our overseas trade, and the ending of exchange controls&#x2014;which the Government have recently done&#x2014;means that it will be far more difficult to control the flow of credits. Many small businesses will be unable to afford future credit and I envisage countless bankruptcies and hardship.<lb/>
At the election the Tory Manifesto said:
<quote>"The creation of new jobs depends to a great extent on the success of small businesses".</quote>
I ask the Minister, what comfort do the Government have to offer small businesses now? The Chief Secretary estimated the average unemployment for the year at 1.65 million, excluding school-leavers. Will the Minister calculate what unemployment is likely to be now? Two million or upwards? With high interest rates, a fall in exchange rates and no pay policy, does the Minister disagree that inflation could reach 20 per cent. or more next year? With mortgage rates now certain to go above the 12&#x00BD; per cent. threatened for January&#x2014;which again will be the highest in history&#x2014;will the Minister agree that the prospects are horribly bleak for home owners and house builders?<lb/>
The false election prospectus is now even more clearly revealed. The promise of lower taxation was kept&#x2014;but at what a social and economic price! It has been completely subsumed by the 15 per cent. VAT and by all the economic events that have taken place since.<lb/>
In spite of cuts in public expenditure, which will diminish services and increase the cost of living, the staggering increase in interest rates must result in a higher PSBR. I should like to know when the Treasury forecast on PSBR is likely to be announced. I have the feeling that the Government are slightly reluctant about that. Finally, after six months of Conservatism we now see monetarism following a monstrous path and the failure of the Government's monetary policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02790"><member>Lord BYERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement, but I must tell him from these Benches that we find the Statement itself, and the
<col>1408</col>
increased rates of interest which arise from it, absolutely horrifying. This particular announcement throws very serious doubt on the Government's competence to direct our affairs, when policy is changed so suddenly and so drastically overnight. That is not what the electors voted for. The Prime Minister claimed before the election that a Conservative Government could control monetary supply without increasing MLR, even after income tax cuts. What has happened to that Conservative belief?<lb/>
I should like to ask for how long interest rates as high as the ones which are implied in this Statement, can be or are to be maintained? If they continue for any length of time it will become impossible to finance expansion and exports. They must lead to higher prices, which will lead to higher wage demands, which will hit particularly small businesses and small firms. It will certainly fuel inflation, and in my view it will not in any way counter the inflation which we all seek to control. This sort of panic panacea is in our view no substitute for a properly thought out incomes policy. I ask the Government, how long do we have to wait for that and for common sense to prevail?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02791"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, needless to say, while I have listened with great interest to the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, I do not agree with anything that she has said. The biggest danger facing this country is inflation and all our other problems flow from that. The Government remain determined that inflation shall be beaten. There is no question of any change in our policy. In fact, the Statement indicates that the Government are resolutely pursuing their policy and will continue to pursue it towards a successful conclusion.<lb/>
The present problems arise from two causes. One is an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement over the original estimated level. May I remind the noble Baroness of what happened last year. The public sector borrowing requirement was estimated by the then Government at &#x00A3;8.5 billion; it turned out to be &#x00A3;9.25 billion. They did nothing to correct the situation and the results of that failure to take action are to be seen in the inflation which we face today.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0713"/>
<col>1409</col>
When facing a situation of a rising public sector borrowing requirement, the present Government have taken the action required immediately and at once. It is only in that way that we have any hope of rebuilding our economy. The comment was made that this will have a serious effect on investment and that many businesses will be unable to afford the cost of credit. So far as both those comments are concerned the position is perfectly clear: inflation would have a much worse effect on the level of investment and it would have a much worse effect on the level of output for small, as well as large, businesses. Although nobody likes to see interest rates at the present level, nevertheless to allow inflation to go on would be the choice of the worse evil.<lb/>
This is not, as the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, suggested, a failure of monetary policy. On the contrary, it demonstrates that monetary policy must be adhered to and that the only prospect of reducing inflation is to pursue a firm monetary policy backed by a correct fiscal policy, and particularly a correct policy in relation to public expenditure, which is what we are doing.<lb/>
In his remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Byers, was obviously intending to lead to the suggestion that an incomes policy should be imposed. We do, of course, realise that this is a cardinal plank in the Liberal Party's economic platform. In this country we have tried an incomes policy on repeated occasions since the end of the war and every one of them has ended in failure. In fact, the period of readjustment after the end of an incomes policy has always been one of great difficulty and accelerating inflation. If anyone doubts that, let them remember for a moment the facts of last winter, when the final phase of the then Government's incomes policy broke down, ushering in a period of unparallelled industrial disruption and ushering in also a period of rising inflation. In fact, contrary to what the noble Lord said, an increase in the rate of interest is not inflationary. It is deflationary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02792"><member>Lord BYERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it puts prices up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02793"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is deflationary; it restricts credit and in this
<col>1410</col>
way it will ultimately bring down prices. It is the greatest protection against excessive wage increases and unless one has a strict monetary policy, which needs to be backed by an appropriate interest-rate policy, the effect will be to allow excessive wage increases to be matched by excessive rises in the money supply, this resulting in accelerated inflation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02794"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, once again I want to ask the Minister a question. He did not answer any of my previous questions. As he has made a major point of inflation, will he please answer this specific question: Does he disagree that inflation could reach 20 per cent. or more next year I should like to have an answer that is on the record.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02795"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not prepared to join the noble Baroness in the forecast that she is making. She must be responsible for her own forecasts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02796"><member>Baroness BIRK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what is the noble Lord's forecast?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02797"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the forecasts under the Industry Act will be published shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02798"><member>Lord KALDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no doubt about the Government's honesty in wishing to fight inflation. However, I am equally convinced about their total inability to do so due to a complete failure to understand both the causes of inflation and the means necessary to control it. As the noble Lord, Lord Byers, said, this 3 per cent. addition to the rate of interest is equivalent&#x2014;as stocks are turned over twice a year&#x2014;to a 1.5 per cent. increase in the prime costs of industry. Therefore, it is the same as a 3 per cent. increase in VAT. In what way does the Minister think that an increase in costs will reduce inflation, if there is nothing to prevent it from being passed on in higher wages?<lb/>
I want to ask the Minister why the purely cosmetic changes in the borrowing requirement, on the one hand, due to the holdup of the payment of telephone bills and, on the other hand, due to the advance payment of the petroleum revenue tax, could in any way affect, favourably or unfavourably, the level of demand, the course of prices or the rate of change in the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0714"/>
<col>1411</col>
money supply? Finally, if the Government believe that the money supply is a controlling factor of inflation, why have they not studied the methods that past governments have adopted in controlling the money supply both during and after the war?&#x2014;which were infinitely more effective than this very ineffectual policy of trying indirectly to control it through the rate of interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02799"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is, of course, a fundamental difference between the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, and the present Government on questions of economic policy. We reject <i>in toto</i> the kind of economic policy with which the noble Lord is associated. We believe that it is that economic policy which gave rise to the disastrous inflation from which this country has suffered particularly over the last five years, when prices more than doubled. We are determined under no circumstances to repeat the kind of mistakes which were made by the previous Administration based upon the theories of the noble Lord.<lb/>
We believe that if the money supply is restrained, it will prevent excessive wage settlements and if wage settlements are made at a reasonable level, this will be the major factor in holding prices down. The noble Lord referred to what he described as purely cosmetic changes affecting the public sector borrowing requirement; namely, the delay in the payment of telephone bills and the new proposal to advance the date of payment of petroleum revenue tax. Neither of these is a cosmetic change. A shortfall of &#x00A3;1 billion in the payment of telephone bills&#x2014;and this is a matter of enormous importance&#x2014;has a dramatic effect on the public sector borrowing requirement and, therefore, upon the money supply. Equally, if the Government secure an additional &#x00A3;700 million this year from advanced petroleum revenue tax, that will reduce the public sector borrowing requirement and the pressure on the money supply. We believe that it is the rate of interest which in the end rations the use of credit, and in that matter also we differ completely from the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02800"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister not agree&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<col>1412</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02801">Several noble Lords: Order!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02802"><member>Lord ROBBINS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, without in any sense subscribing to the pure milk of extreme monetarism, I ask the Minister to confirm my belief that no major inflation has taken place without an increase in the money supply? May I ask him secondly to indicate the relation between the money rate of interest now proposed and the prospective real rate of interest?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02803"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Robbins, for what he says. I agree with him that no major inflation has occurred without an inflation in the level of the money supply. This is why we are determined that there shall be no inflation in the level of the money supply now. The noble Lord went on to ask how the money rate of interest&#x2014;that is the nominal rate of interest&#x2014;compares with the rate of inflation; the difference between the two of course representing the real rate of interest. The present minimum lending rate is only marginally above the last figure for the increase in the retail price index. Currently, therefore, it represents an extremely small real rate of interest. From this point of view of course the effect on investment is of very great importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02804"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the Minister's anxiety to blame Labour Adminstrations for the rate of inflation, I presume that, as he did not mention the period of policy during which Lord Barber was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he regards those Conservative policies as wholly deflationery, and the appalling problems which faced the Labour Administration in 1974 were presumably also imaginary. I should like to ask one other question. Has the noble Lord ever considered one simple fact? Over the centuries, the British people have solved all problems. They faced Napoleon; they faced Hitler; they faced the Kaiser, and they pulled through, but there was always one essential commitment, and that was national unity. This Government, if they do not know it, ought to realise that in six months they have smashed all hope of national unity. They have demonstrated, by the policies they have introduced, that those policies are not only inflationary but are a deliberate and major attack on the standards
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0715"/>
<col>1413</col>
of ordinary people. If the answer cannot be found, if defence cannot be found through the normal political ways, a defence will be found, and this Government are smashing their head against a hammer that has broken more than enough Governments&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02805">Several Noble Lords: Question!</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02806"><member>Lord WIGG</member><membercontribution>: &#x2014;and it is going to smash this one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02807"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord refers to the need for national unity. On that point, and that point alone, of course I agree with him. But if he seriously thinks that the deplorable events which occurred this last winter under a Labour Administration were a demonstration of national unity, f think he ought seriously to reconsider the ordinary use of the English language. The greatest evil, and the most divisive influence that this country faces, is inflation. It is only by the conquest of inflation that we shall be able to re-establish national unity; that we shall be able to re-establish progress in this country; that we shall be able to re-establish industrial peace; and that we shall be able to offer all of our people a better future. It is for those reasons that we are prepared to face the problems that we do face, to deal with them, and in the end to overcome them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02808"><member>Lord MORRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister whether any consideration was given to the efficacy of restricting bank lending quantitatively in parallel with the raising of the minimum lending rate?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02809"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a suggestion which has been made on a number of occasions. The problem that one gets into, quite simply, is that the more direct controls of this sort one imposes the greater the ingenuity of the financial community in finding ways around them. We believe, therefore, that the best solution is the one we have put forward; namely, the increase in the minimum lending rate. But there will of course, as I have said, be a discussion paper published shortly on various means of controlling the money supply, including the interesting suggestions which have been made about the use of a form of monetary base control.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02811"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his intervention. It was the failure of incomes policies as well as of other devices which brought it home not only to the Government but to most people that there was no alternative to a strict monetary policy, supported by a proper fiscal policy, as the means of controlling inflation. We shall continue with our policy, and we shall continue with it to the end of defeating the menace of inflation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02814"><member>Lord BALOGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister will agree with me, I hope, that the incomes policy pursued by this country has been defective because it was pursued as a momentary intervention in a crisis with the intent to revoke it as soon as possible. On that basis obviously all incomes policies must fail because the whole thing returns. Does the Minister not agree with me that his incomes policy is what one might call promiscuous? It is promiscuous because it tends generally to affect many people who are not really important in causing inflation. Does the Minister, for instance, think that the coal miners will be restrained by 17 per cent.? The very fact&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02819"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Balogh, asked me whether I agreed with him. The short answer is that I do not agree with him. Most of the proposals he put forward and the arguments he advanced were proposals for dealing with the symptoms of inflation. We believe that, as with any other disease, the correct thing is to deal with the cause, and if you cure the cause the symptoms then disappear.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02821"><member>Lord O'BRIEN of LOTHBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for many years&#x2014;from 1951, when we raised bank rate tentatively from 2 to 2&#x00BD; per cent.&#x2014;I have been concerned with the conduct of monetary policy and, later, with its formulation. Is the Minister aware that the Government's present policy in the monetary field has my very strong support?&#x2014;the more so because for the first time for many years it is being fully supported by fiscal policy, as indeed it should be, because monetary policy alone cannot do the job, but the two together, resolutely conducted as the present Government are conducting them, and I hope will continue to conduct them will in the end I believe do the job. I give them my full support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02822"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for his support and for the comments he made. On a personal note, I too remember well the occasion when bank rate was increased from 2 to 2&#x00BD; per cent., as I was then working directly for the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Saffron Walden, who was my senior sponsor when I came into your Lordships' House. It is of course entirely true that a monetary policy needs to be supported by an appropriate fiscal policy, and it is the Government's determination to go on so doing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02823"><member>Lord DENHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, has been trying for some time to intervene. I think it might be the feeling of the House that after he has asked his question and my noble friend has replied we might pass on to other business.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1416</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02824"><member>Lord STEWART of FULHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the Minister would explain this to me: If it is so important to restrict borrowing, why are banks always putting out advertisements urging us by means of Access cards and other devices to buy things we cannot afford with money we have not yet got? Is there not something to be said for distinguishing between borrowing to increase personal consumption and borrowing to help the productive process?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02825"><member>Lord COCKFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's remarks might well de drawn to the attention of the banks, because I felt very much that they were intended to be helpful in a most difficult situation that we all face. We believe the best way of rationing credit is through the price mechanism, that is through the rate of interest, rather than going in for direct control of individual kinds of borrowing, which would require among other things a considerable administrative bureaucracy to operate it and which is unlikely in the end to be satisfactory. The true rate of interest which is paid by people who use these special forms of borrowing&#x2014;I was about to use a different term but I was very careful&#x2014;such as Access is in fact very high.</membercontribution></p>

I thought it would be useful if I said a few words on the procedure connected with the Bill, as it is a Private Bill and not a Public Bill, and in particular to remind your Lordships that there is a distinct difference between giving a Second Reading to a Public Bill and to a Private Bill. In giving a Second Reading to of a Public Bill, your Lordships are in fact approving of the principles underlying the Bill. But in the case of a Private Bill this is not so and all that your Lordships will be doing, if you give this Bill a Second Reading, which I hope you will, is agreeing that it should go to the appropriate committees.<lb/>

<title>LEGAL AID (SCOTLAND) (FINANCIAL CONDITIONS) (No. 2) REGULATIONS 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02836">4.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02837"><member>Lord LYELL</member> rose to move, That the Regulations laid before the House on 1st November, be approved. The noble Lord said: My Lords, in speaking to these Motions I hope it will be for the convenience of the House if I speak at the same time to both regulations. These two regulations alter the income limits both for legal aid in civil proceedings and for legal advice and assistance. It has become the practice in recent years for the financial limits to be increased annually in line with such increases as take place in supplementary benefit. The limits were increased considerably in April of this year as part of a package of improvements intended to help to restore the extent to which legal aid is available to the population to the level which was provided when legal aid schemes were originally introduced. The regulations which are under consideration in the House today ensure that the real value of the limits achieved in April of this year is maintained. I would remind the House that your Lordships approved the equivalent English and Welsh regulations on 30th October of this year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02838">The Legal Aid (Scotland) (Financial Contributions) (No. 2) Regulations 1979 increase the upper disposable income limit above which a person does not qualify for legal aid from &#x00A3;3,600 to &#x00A3;4,075. Perhaps your Lordships would appreciate a definition of the term "disposable income". It is a notional net figure which is arrived at after deductions have been made for tax and rent or mortgage and other necessary expenses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02839">They also deal with the lower&#x2014;or "free" limit, as we call it&#x2014;the level below which a person is not required to make a contribution from income, and in this regard there is one point to which I should draw the attention of the House. This limit currently stands at &#x00A3;1,500 and it is proposed by these regulations that it should be increased to &#x00A3;1,700. However, it has been found that Section 3(1)<i>(a)</i> of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1967, which was recently amended by Section 9 of the Legal Aid Act 1979, does not now in terms confer the power to increase the
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0718"/>
<col>1419</col>
lower limit. Prior to the amendment made by the 1979 Act, the Secretary of State had the explicit power by regulation to raise the lower income limit, and indeed it was not intended that this power should have been removed by the 1979 Act. I understand that it is intended to take steps to restore the power to vary when a suitable opportunity occurs, which I believe will be fairly soon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02840">But in the meantime the powers which are available to the Secretary of State for Scotland enable him by regulations to alter the maximum contribution from income payable by a person who is receiving legal aid, and to make different provision for different amounts of disposal income. Regulation 3<i>(a)</i> of these legal aid regulations provides that the maximum contribution required from an applicant for legal aid whose disposable income lies in the band between &#x00A3;1,500 and &#x00A3;1,700 shall be the merely nominal sum of &#x00A3;1, while the maximum contribution from a person whose disposable income exceeds &#x00A3;1,700 shall be an amount equivalent to one quarter of the difference between his disposable income and the figures of &#x00A3;1,700. These regulations, which I accept are exceedingly complicated, achieve an almost exactly similar effect to those regulations which were made earlier this year in respect of England and Wales by the Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02841">I should now like to speak to the second set of regulations which I shall be moving presently: the Legal Advice and Assistance (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) (No. 4) Regulations 1979. These raise the upper disposable income limit for those persons who are seeking legal advice and assistance from &#x00A3;75 to &#x00A3;85 a week&#x2014;income limits, my Lords. Another set of regulations&#x2014;which we are not discussing this afternoon, and which are not subject to Affirmative Resolution&#x2014;raises the lower disposable income limit below which no contribution is payable from &#x00A3;35 a week to &#x00A3;40, and amends the scale of contributions payable for persons with incomes between that lower limit and the revised upper limit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02842">I think that it would be for your Lordships' convenience if I were to mention that the allowances which are made for dependants in both legal aid and legal advice and assistance schemes also have to be increased. At present
<col>1420</col>
these are fixed at one and a half times the corresponding supplementary benefit scale rates and these were therefore automatically increased when the supplementary benefit rates changed at the beginning even of this week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02843">We estimate that legal aid is now available to approximately 70 per cent. of families with children, and I am sure that your Lordships would be interested to know that in the year 1978&#x2013;79 about 15,000 full certificates were issued for legal aid in civil proceedings, and that about 34,000 payments in respect of legal advice and assistance were made to solicitors. All this was in Scotland. The net cost of civil legal aid, and of legal advice and assistance, was about &#x00A3;3 million excluding the costs of administration. The changes proposed in the regulations which are before us this afternoon are intended to ensure that numbers of people who without legal aid or assistance would be unable to enforce, or even to defend, their legal rights are not diminished by inflation. For that reason T commend the first set of regulations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02844">Moved, That the regulations laid before the House on 1st November, be approved.&#x2014;<i>(Lord Lyell.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02845"><member>Lord BOSTON of FAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for introducing the regulations and explaining them so clearly. I must apologise to him for having missed the first part of his opening remarks. I was called out of the Chamber to take an urgent telephone call and I am afraid that I did not return in time. As the noble Lord the Minister has explained, the regulations that he has introduced for Scotland are similar to those which were introduced on, I think, 30th October this year by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, and we had then from this Bench an opportunity to welcome the introduction of those two sets of regulations.<lb/>
I would wholly agree with the Minister that it is right that these financial limits should be increased in line with inflation and so that they remain in line with any increases that take place in supplementary benefit as well. Your Lordships would probably also be encouraged to hear what the noble Lord had to say about
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0719"/>
<col>1421</col>
the plans concerning the power to vary as the occasion arises, which I believe will introduce a welcome flexibility.<lb/>
I do not need to detain your Lordships this afternoon. As I indicated earlier, we had an opportunity from this Bench a fortnight ago to welcome the last sets of regulations, and I take this opportunity to welcome these two sets of regulations, too, so far as it is proper and not presumptuous of an Englishman to welcome two sets of regulations concerning Scotland. However, I am encouraged by the thought that I understand that those of my noble friends who are from Scotland would take the same course. So I would join with the noble Lord the Minister in commending these sets of regulations to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS DEVELOPMENT BOARD AREA EXTENSION ORDER 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02850">4.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02851"><member>Lord LYELL</member> rose to move, That the order laid before the House on 23rd October, be approved. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that the order laid before the House on 23rd October 1979 be approved. The purpose of this order is to extend the area in which the Highlands and Islands Development Board exercises its statutory responsibilities to include the islands of Great and Little Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde. The Cumbraes&#x2014;both of the small islands&#x2014;have a population of approximately 1,100, and they lie approximately two miles
<col>1422</col>
off the North Ayrshire coast. Until 1975 these islands formed with the other islands of Arran and Bute the local government unit of Buteshire, but since then they have been administratively part of the district of Cunninghame. The Highlands and Islands Development Board was established in 1965 to assist the people of its area to improve their economic and social conditions, and to enable them to play a more effective part in the economy of the nation. The board's original area was confined to the former crofting counties, but the 1965 Act enabled the Secretary of State for Scotland to designate additions to that area by an Order made by Statutory Instrument and approved by each House. In framing such an order the Secretary of State is still required to have regard to the character of the area to be included and to its existing proximity to the area of the board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02852">In 1975, with the reorganisation of local government, the board's area was extended to include the whole of the new Highland Region as well as the islands of Arran and Bute, which after 1975 became part of Strathclyde Region, and this measure left the Cumbraes as the only island community (on the two islands) off the West Coast of Scotland which remained outside the scope of the responsibility of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. The Government of the day decided that because the islands were linked to the economy of the adjacent part of mainland Scotland, the case for their inclusion within the Highlands and Islands Development Board's area was not in all respects so strong as that of Arran and Bute. But since then the people of the Cumbraes, supported by Cunninghame District Council, have pressed for the 1975 decision to be reversed, and they have presented convincing reasons why the islands should come within the board's remit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02853">We have recognised the force of these arguments, and the Conservative Party's election manifesto for Scotland contained an undertaking that the status of the two islands of Cumbrae would be changed in this way. Our conclusion is that the economic and the social conditions of the islands are much nearer in character to that of Arran and Bute, and indeed the rest of the Highland area, than they are to those of the mainland of Scotland, particularly in the Cunninghame district.
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0720"/>
<col>1423</col>
The evidence which is available to us shows that the community on the Cumbraes is probably more precarious and fragile&#x2014;in its numbers, I hope not in its physical sense&#x2014;than are those on their neighbouring islands, which are already under the care of the Highlands and Islands Development Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02854">The population of the two islands of the Cumbrae has declined for several decades, and regrettably it is still falling. A high proportion of the population is over retirement age, and the proportion of the active employed group is unusually low, even for the Highlands, indicating that the young people of the two islands of Cumbrae are emigrating for jobs. Indeed, some 80 per cent. of all existing employment in these two islands is in the service industries, which are almost entirely dependent on tourism, with its seasonal fluctuations. Since 1975 the number of local jobs has fallen with the completion of certain construction projects. Indeed, the employment opportunities on the mainland have, lamentably, also declined. This was recognised by the upgrading of the adjacent mainland area (which I think is covered by the Largs employment office area) to special development area status earlier this year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02855">Assistance can now be given to individual developments on the Cumbraes under the Industry Act, and indeed from the Scottish Development Agency and the Scottish Tourist Board, but the Highlands and Islands Development Board is capable of tackling the problems of rural committees in a very full and comprehensive way, and we believe that it has much experience in this task. The board will also be equipped with wide-ranging powers to give support and stimulus to any entrepreneurs and private businesses which may wish to set up in any sectors of the local economy. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that the measure which I am proposing this afternoon would be beneficial to this island community, and I hope that your Lordships will welcome this small extension to the board's responsibilities. The addition to the board's responsibilities of the islands of Cumbrae will make a relatively small additional demand on the board's resources, and this is going to be found from within the approved estimate for grant-in-aid to the board and within future financial provisions.</p>
<col>1424</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02856">By the terms of the Treaty of Rome the Government have to inform the Commission of any intention to extend the regional aids which are administered by the Highlands and Islands Development Board. We have been informed that the Commission has no objection to the changes proposed by this order, and with that conclusion I would commend it to your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02857">Moved, That the order laid before the House on 23rd October, be approved.&#x2014;<i>(Lord Lyell.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02858"><member>Baroness STEDMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will indeed be grateful to the noble Lord for explaining to those of us who do not come from North of the Border exactly how the Scottish Highlands and Islands Development Board works, and the advantage that this will be to Great and Little Cumbrae. Again, it is presumptuous, perhaps, for an English person to speak on behalf of her Scottish colleagues, but from this side of the House I am delighted to welcome this very small extension to the duties of the board.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES (NORTHERN IRELAND) ORDER 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02866"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Administration of Estates (Northern Ireland) Order 1979, of which a draft was laid before the house on 23rd October, be approved. The Administration of Estates Order will fulfil a recommendation made by the committee chaired by the former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord MacDermott. This committee reported in March 1970 on the administration and structure of the Supreme Court. The order will fulfil the recommendations by drawing together provisions at present contained in about a dozen separate enactments dealing with probate and administration matters, some of which date from the 16th century. Although the language is technical, the order is primarily one of consolidation, and I do not think that your Lordships would wish me to go through it in detail. I should, however, draw attention to some of those provisions which are new to the law of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The order is divided into five parts. Part I deals only with the title and commencement of the order, and with its intrepretation. Part 11 is concerned with the powers of the High Court and, in
<col>1426</col>
contentious matter relating to small estates, of the County Court. These powers are to make grants of representation to the estates of deceased persons. It is largely a re-enactment of the provisions of Part III of the Administration of Estates Act (Northern Ireland) 1955, which generally applies only to the estates of persons dying on or after 1st January 1956. For this reason, Article 3 provides that, in the absence of a contrary stipulation, the provisions of Part II of the order apply only in relation to the estates of persons dying after the end of the year 1955. Article 4 adopts modern practice by providing in paragraph (1)<i>(b)</i> that, in normal cases, the order of entitlement to a grant of administration will be governed by rules of court. At present, the selection of an administrator is determined in accordance with directions issued by the probate judge. This change should make the relevant information more readily available.<lb/>
Part III deals with the powers and procedures of the court preliminary or incidental to the making of grants. This part of the order consolidates provisions which are at present contained in the Probate and Letters of Administration Act (Ireland) 1857 and the Court of Probate Act (Ireland) 1859. Part IV of the order relates to the rights and duties of executors, administrators and other persons who, although not authorised to act as personal representatives, assume the responsibilities of such. It contains some provisions which are new for Northern Ireland. For example, Article 29 clarifies the position of a person who, having been appointed by a will as both an executor and a trustee, renounces probate or otherwise loses his rights of administration. In that situation his rights as trustee will automatically determine at the same time.<lb/>
Part V of the order contains one article of special interest. Under the present law the surviving spouse of a person who dies intestate is entitled to the first &#x00A3;25,000 or &#x00A3;55,000 of his estate, depending upon whether or not the deceased left issue. This entitlement is known as the surviving spouse's statutory legacy. Section 7 of the Administration of Estates (Northern Ireland) Act 1955 stipulates that this statutory legacy is to bear interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum from the date of death to the date of payment. This has become a wholly unrealistic rate.

Accordingly, Article 41 provides that an alternative rate may be specified by order. This will provide the machinery to stipulate a more realistic rate, and at the same time give the flexibility to enable future moves in interest rates generally to be taken into account.<lb/>
My Lords, this order will meet a long standing criticism that the law on these matters is scattered over too many different enactments. It is principally a measure of consolidation but, as I have indicated, the opportunity has also been taken to clarify certain elements of doubt and fill in a number of gaps in the existing legislation.

<title>LEGAL AID, ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE (NORTHERN IRELAND) ORDER 1979</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02873">5.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02874"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Legal Aid, Advice and
<col>1428</col>
Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 be approved. The object of this draft order is to make improvements to the Northern Ireland Legal Aid Scheme similar to those recently enacted for the rest of the United Kingdom by the Legal Aid Act 1979. The changes concern legal aid in civil proceedings and are similar to those contained in the 1979 Act. As that Act was considered by this House in February of this year, I will confine my remarks to the main provisions of the order.<lb/>
The first major change is contained in Article 3 of the order, which would reduce the maximum contribution which may be required to be paid to the Legal Aid Fund by a legally aided person. At present a maximum contribution equivalent to one-third of the excess of a person's disposable income over &#x00A3;1,700 a year is required. This order would reduce the maximum contribution fraction from one-third to one-quarter. This should enable more people to avail themselves of legal aid. And I should perhaps mention here that, as some of your Lordships may have noticed, the maximum sum of &#x00A3;1,700 differs from that which appears in Section 4 of the 1979 Act, as it has just been increased from &#x00A3;1,500 by regulations which took effect from 12th November this year.<lb/>
The Secretary of State would, by virtue of the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954, have power to fix by regulations different maximum contributions for different cases or classes of case. The exercise of this power would, we hope, help reduce the unnecessary collection of contributions in certain cases. For example, when an applicant has succeeded with his case, the contribution paid by him to the Legal Aid Fund is often returned. This occurs more frequently in certain types of case, such as personal injury proceedings. It is wasteful to collect substantial sums by way of contributions in such cases only to return them at a later date.<lb/>
The second major change concerns representation in court. At present representation by solicitors or barristers can normally only be obtained under a legal aid certificate issued after an assessment of the applicant's means by the Supplementary Benefits Commission and consideration of the merits of the case by the Incorporated Law Society of Northern
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0723"/>
<col>1429</col>
Ireland. These time-consuming processes are justified in the case of proceedings which may cost large sums, but are less so in smaller cases, particularly where the contribution required may be minimal or represent only a fraction of the total cost. In fact, in very many cases, particularly those involving separation and maintenance, no contribution at all is required.<lb/>
Article 5 of the order would therefore enable the Secretary of State to extend by regulations the much simpler administrative procedure of the legal advice and assistance scheme to include representation in court in particular cases, or classes of case. The first use of this power would be to allow representation under the legal advice and assistance scheme in matrimonial proceedings before Magistrates' Courts.<lb/>
Article 6 would enable the Secretary of State to prescribe the maximum contributions payable by those receiving advice or assistance in the same way as Article 3 does for legal aid. This power would be used for example, to adjust the cost limits of representation in different types of proceedings.<lb/>
There are also a number of minor or consequential amendments in Article 7. One of these relates to the penalties for breach of the secrecy provision and for misrepresentation, and increases them from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;500. Also included is a technical extension of the terms of reference of the Legal Aid Advisory Committee. We have also taken this opportunity to make some minor amendments and repeals to facilitate a consolidation of Northern Ireland legal aid soon to be undertaken.<lb/>
I am sure your Lordships will welcome this extension to Northern Ireland of the improvement in the provisions of legal aid that were enacted for the rest of the United Kingdom earlier this year by the Legal Aid Act, and which could make legal aid, advice and assistance more readily available to the public. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02877"><member>Lord BLEASE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must express gratefulness to the noble Lord for the clear and concise way he has explained
<col>1430</col>
the order which is before this House. In so far as the measures provide for the parity principle and bring legislation in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, the order has support from this side of the House. However, there is one point in the order which I should be grateful if the noble Lord could clarify. It is Article 5. As I understand it, Article 5 amends the principal Act, the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Northern Ireland) 1965, to provide for legal representation for tribunals and statutory inquiries for eligible persons. The Minister has already indicated one area immediately brought under this provision, that is, matrimonial proceedings in magistrates' courts. It would be important if the Minister could indicate when the larger extent of the provisions will be effectively available or if there could be a list of the various tribunals and statutory inquiries that may come under the ambit of these provisions. It leads to confusion if a person considers that representation before a tribunal is available and then finds that some tribunals have been omitted from a particular list.<lb/>
There is a further point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. It arises from the principal Act to which this order refers. I have been told by community workers, trade union representatives, solicitors and lawyers that, to persons who are directly involved in using and operating this Act, its provisions have become incomprehensible, and that while they welcome this order, it will add to the complexity. Therefore, may I ask the Minister whether he could give urgent attention to making readily available a revised handbook dealing specifically with the measures and provisions for legal aid, advice and assistance as now consolidated in the two main proposals? I am pleased to support the measure before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02878"><member>Lord ELTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Blease, for his welcome to this order and the endorsement of the principle of parity. I am also grateful to him for the notice that he was kind enough to give me of the questions that he proposed to ask on this rather technical matter. That is something which must be taken into account.<lb/>
Of course, there is another matter which has to be taken into account and which
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0724"/>
<col>1431</col>
will have become much more apparent in this House since the repetition of the Statement made by my right honourable friend the Chacellor of the Exchequer in another place: that is, the problem of finding the necessary finance to cover the extension of the advice and assistance service to include representation before tribunals. The matter will therefore require further study in the light of the comments of the Royal Commission on Legal Services on this subject. I am afraid I must ask the noble Lord to be contented with that reply on this matter.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked, with understandable passion, whether there could be some handbook or guidebook available not only to those who are users of the provisions but also to the practitioners who assist them. I agree with the noble Lord that the numerous amendments to the Legal Aid Act since its enactment in 1965 make it desirable that the legislation should be consolidated. I am pleased to say that work on the consolidation is in hand but at present there is not a legal aid handbook available. It might be less necessary when the consolidation is completed. I appreciate the point that a handbook would be useful, particularly for practitioners in Northern Ireland; and, although from the production point of view it is a small market and it would be difficult to make such an exercise cost-effective compared with the larger number in Great Britain, I will none the less ensure that the matter is brought to the attention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in what I might call "approving terms".</membercontribution></p>

<title>FLUORIDE IN WATER SUPPLIES</title>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02880">5.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02881"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will consider action to restore the optimum percentage of fluoride, for protecting teeth, in water supplies in those areas where it has for centuries existed naturally, but where that optimum percentage has been diluted as an unintended result of amalgamating water systems, in order that families shall not be deprived of the benefit previously experienced in their districts. The noble Lord said:
<col>1432</col>
My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. I raise this subject because the time is approaching when all the information should be available, enabling decisions to be taken upon adding to, or subtracting from, the fluoride which exists naturally in all water supplies in Britain. After at least 20 years of trials, schemes in parts of this country and elsewhere and searching investigations, progress in one direction or the other should be made. My interest in this subject arises because, as a Minister of Health for nearly four years, from 1970 to 1974, I was naturally committed heart and soul to trying to improve and assist the health needs of the 5 million people within my responsibility. That was, of course, when I was Secretary of State for Scotland and one of several of my functions was Minister of Health for Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02882">Because fluoride exists in natural sources of drinking water supplies in Britain, in greater or less proportions, I am asking the Government to consider the position of families where fluoride has for centuries existed at approximately one part per million or more, until the modernisation of water systems and amalgamations diluted the proportion of fluoride. It is accepted by the large majority of medical and dental authorities in the world that if drinking water contains about one part per million (1 ppm) of fluoride by weight, the incidence of caries&#x2014;the disease of decay in teeth&#x2014;is greatly reduced, particularly in children.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02883">The families who have lived in parts of Essex, South Shields and the Hartlepools, for example, have had the benefit of that protection. In some of those areas the introduction of wide distribution systems has incidentally diluted the fluoride to less than the ideal level. I am therefore raising the subject for a minority, but a very substantial minority, of people in this country: such people, I suggest, have just as much right to object to interference with their natural water supplies&#x2014;perhaps even more right&#x2014;as those people who have objected to small additions to the existing fluoride to bring it up to the ideal level in other areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02884">How should the decisions on this matter be taken in this country? Because the amount of fluoride varies naturally from area to area, my view is that decisions should be taken separately in different
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0725"/>
<col>1433</col>
areas. That is the position that exists today in Britain; but I believe it is the task of Government to provide all the relevant information and to ensure that the interested public have the latest facts. The Government, rightly, wish to be completely satisfied about safety, and in particular about possible links with cancer. My honourable friend Dr. Gerard Vaughan, the Minister of State for Healh in England and Wales, announced last month that a further inquiry into safety was being undertaken. I assume this is an internal inquiry within the DHSS and I would ask my noble friend Lord Cullen of Ashbourne, who is to reply, if he can tell us on behalf of the Government when it is likely to be completed. I would remind him that the Royal College of Physicians carried out a special inquiry over a period of three years, and that its committee reported as recently as 1977. Is the new inquiry to go over the same ground, or is it to go on from that report?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02885">All the necessary information should become available soon to enable definite conclusions to be reached on whether fluoride in water, naturally or artificially, has any dangerous side effects, or whether its particular benefits to health make it, in the optimum quantity, a friendly aid to man's passage through life. If one is concerned to reduce pain for humankind, and in particular suffering among children, one cannot simply ignore the overwhelming recommendations in favour of arranging for 1 ppm in water supplies. I say "arranging" because, as I pointed out, in some areas naturally there is more than 1 ppm and therefore "arranging" is the correct word.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02886">The British Medical Association, the British Dental Association and the Royal College of Physicians are quite clear in their recommendations that arrangements should be made for 1 ppm of fluoride in water supplies. Also the Royal Commission on the National Health Service, which reported only last July, recommended unanimously that fluoride should be added in order to bring the amount up to approximately 1 ppm. That Commission were not asked to make such a recommendation within their terms of reference, but they none the less did so because they felt it important to draw attention to this. They felt that an immense improvement could be made in
<col>1434</col>
health as a result, and they were impressed by the large scale of the accompanying relief to the hard pressed health services. No one could surely suggest that all 16 members of that Royal Commission were in some way duped or deluded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02887">On the international scene, the World Health Organisation has recommended the same thing. There are now about 100 million people in the United States and Canada who enjoy the benefits of fluoridated water. Nor, my Lords, should anyone ignore the warnings of those who are worried about safety. Of course they should not be ignored. The facts must be set out, and the conclusions of those best equipped to interpret them made clear. For example, any suspicions of a connection with an increase in cancer must be scrupulously and fully investigated. The medical profession were definite and explicit in finding links between smoking and an increase in lung cancer, but the inquiry of the Royal College of Physicians has stated otherwise where fluoride is concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02888">There are two reasonable doubts about arranging for the optimum 1 ppm in water supplies. First is the possibility of dangerous side effects, particularly cancer. On this the Royal College, as I have stated, have categorically said that there is no evidence of any harmful effect to the water or the environment by adding fluoride to the 1 ppm level. The second doubt which is sometimes raised is whether, in principle, authorities should "doctor" the main water supplies for whole communities. All water from natural sources on land contains dissolved substances, including fluoride. For many years, several additions of further substances have been made by water authorities&#x2014;for example, chlorine&#x2014;with the object of rendering the supplies wholesome and palatable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02889">If adjustment of the fluoride content will result in the elimination of toothache and much suffering by children on a massive scale, without increasing risks of cancer or other dangers, why are we waiting? If I were to start a charity for this purpose, in this International Year of the Child, to reduce pain and increase health, money would surely pour in. I would call it something like Save the Children Pain Campaign. But money is not needed. That is the paradox.</p>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0726"/>
<col>1435</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02890">Indeed, the process of fluoridation, if adopted all over the United Kingdom, would save about &#x00A3;80 million for the health services, for a cost of about &#x00A3;4 million. The money saved could be spent on kidney machines, extra hospital beds or be sent to the starving in Calcutta, if you like. It could be available for other purposes. Must many children, in the years to come, have to suffer pain and dentistry which could be avoided, in order to defend a principle? That question is there and it will not go away. I believe that decisions on it should be taken democratically in different parts of the country. Provided that the ideal quantity of fluoride is proved to be completely safe in water supplies, I would encourage people to vote in favour of it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02891">As for the principle of tampering with water supplies at all, some additions are made and some processing is carried out, anyway, to avoid upset stomachs or other ill effects of a supply which would not otherwise be wholesome. As I have indicated, the organisation of supplies over wider areas has unintentionally diluted the quantities of fluoride, where it was above what is regarded as the ideal level. That, of course, would be satisfactory in certain places. For example, in the Mersea area of Essex the amount naturally there is about 4 or 5 ppm, and if that were reduced to 1 ppm by dilution that would be satisfactory. But elsewhere, where it has been about 1 ppm, the dilution has of course had the effect of taking away the benefit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02892">May I point out, in passing, that most fish contain 4 to 5 ppm of fluoride, and that the sea itself is at the state almost all over the world of about 1 ppm of fluoride. Anyone drinking a cup of tea at the normal strength is imbibing it at the rate of 1 to 2 ppm. In fact, if they chewed tea leaves they would find themselves taking it at the rate of about 100 ppm.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02893">I understand the attitude of those who say: "This should be left to the individual". In fact, they would have to say "to the individual family", because it is not really a choice for a child under about 6 or 7, which is the most important time of his life so far as this subject is concerned. Of course, a contribution can be made by fluorided toothpaste, but it is nothing like the protection from decay which is achieved by water supplies.</p>
<col>1436</col>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02894">There is a r&#x00E9;gime of taking tablets, but to be effective that has to be daily from birth, or shortly afterwards, until the age of 12 or 14, taking small portions of a tablet each day until a certain age and then, eventually, a whole tablet a day. That is feasible in the case of extremely conscientious mothers. In practice, research has found that few, even though they started in earnest on this, have been able to carry it out fully for at least 12 years, with a dose a day to a child from about six months or even younger. Then, of course, there is the danger that the child will find the bottle and swallow about 100 or 200 at a time. That has already happened in various cases, and that is a danger which is not there when it is supplied in water.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02895">It has also been pointed out that much decay in teeth could be eliminated if the population as a whole deliberately shunned sweets, sugar and similar food. I believe that that situation is virtually impossible to bring about. Again, it reveals a state of being completely out of touch with the conditions of family life, particularly in the more populated urban areas, to suggest that such a rigorous disciplinary diet could be generally adopted and adhered to. It would certainly be regarded by the children as an unnecessary hardship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02896">Anyone who, like me, has been involved in social work and conditions in areas such as the Glasgow conurbation, where there are over 2 million people, knows that many mothers are already over-taxed in coping with ordinary life and looking after the basic bringing up of their children. Some are also doing jobs during the day. The idea that many of them could apply a tablet r&#x00E9;gime for 12 to 14 years continuously is simply not practical. It has also been suggested that this task might be given to school teachers during the periods when children are at school. I really think that that is not a starter either. School teachers already have enough tasks given to them to do, which are not wholly connected with teaching, and I would quite understand their feeling that they should not be asked to do this as well.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02897">I would remind your Lordships that there were similar fears and warnings at the time when vaccination and inoculation were first being considered, 70 and more years ago. Of course, safety then had to be thoroughly investigated, and it still
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0727"/>
<col>1437</col>
has to be; but the boon of the virtual elimination of diphtheria and smallpox, and now the massive reduction of polio, has ended that controversy. We should remember that there were vigorous campaigns against vaccination and inoculation at the time, besides the ordinary anxiety about safety, which was right and was to be expected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02898">What worries me is that there are some who are putting out anti-fluoride material which is specially selected and slanted. I completely understand and respect, as I think I have indicated, the view that, as a principle, such a substance should not be added or subtracted. That is a view, though I do not share it myself. Should millions of unborn children suffer pain and unnecessary loss of teeth during their lives, as a penance for that principle? Should it be a penance? Should it be the price of supporting a principle?</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02899">What seems to me to be inexcusable is to distort facts concerning safety and cancer. I was naturally interested in the comparison made by Dr. Dean Burk, a retired American biochemist, and a colleague of his into the incidence of cancer in cities in the United States and also in this country, particularly Birmingham, where water had been fluoridated, in contrast with cities where it had not. The results in both cases appeared to show a connection between fluoride and increased cancer. But those results have been demonstrated to be invalid by the British Royal Statistical Society in the work commissioned by them and carried out by Professor Newall and Dr. Oldham.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02900">They were invalidated for the reason that Dr. Burk had not taken into account the changes in age groups and other demographic changes in cities which affect cancer rates in a given size of population. For example, seaside towns in Britain where many elderly people settle in retirement have a higher than normal cancer rate. Cancer is more prevalent in the over 60s than in the under 40s. That kind of fact was ignored. Dr. Burk has been invited to travel widely in the world giving warnings, but his cause is damaged when facts are withheld. For example, a body calling itself the National Anti-Fluoride Campaign has circulated something which I think has come to many noble Lords. In paragraph 17 it says:
<col>1438</col>
<quote>"It should be noted that Dr. Burk was one of several witnesses who gave evidence last year in an American court case, the sole purpose of which was to determine whether or not there was a fluoridation-cancer link. The court found in favour of the evidence given by Dr. Burk and his anti-fluoridation associates. His credibility was well-established in these matters".</quote>
Paragraph 17 failed to add that that court's finding was later set aside as a result of a ruling by the United States Supreme Court. Surely that important point should have been included. Its exclusion causes one to have doubts about the objectivity of those putting out this material.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02901">Some objectors have alleged that there is a difference between substances introduced and those existing naturally in water&#x2014;a difference, for example, between calcium fluoride and sodium fluoride. But in the very small quantities in water which we are discussing, complete ionisation takes place. So we are speaking of the fiouride ion in water, and the differences alleged between these substances have no validity whatever.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02902">On the procedure for taking local decisions, I would draw attention to the fact that there are three types of bodies involved. First, there are the water authorities responsible for the mechanics and physical supply. I am very glad to see that my noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford is to speak in the debate because of his knowledge of the water industry. Secondly, there are the health authorities. Their members are appointed. Then there are the local government councils who are elected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02903">I should add that the organisation and the system are different, as one would expect, in Scotland. In 1972, I, as Secretary of State, carried out the reform of the Scottish Health Service a year before reform was carried out in England and Wales. Incidentally, I adopted a single tier of health authorities. In Scotland, there is only one tier of health boards. When there is criticism now about the two-tier structure and people say that one of them should be taken away, I hope they will remember that that applies only South of the Border because this seems to have been one of those occasions in Scotland when we got it right the first time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02904">It means that there is a difference as to how the decision is taken in Scotland. The effective decision on fluoride lies with
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0728"/>
<col>1439</col>
the local government councils&#x2014;the elected representatives. I understand that the situation is different in England and Wales. At present the situation is very well reflected in Scotland where the regional council of Strathclyde has a decision impending, and all the health boards in its area have recommended in favour of I ppm of fluoride.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02905">Before I conclude, I must draw attention to a press release&#x2014;which I understand has also been circulated to a large number of noble Lords&#x2014;because it seems to be about me. First, it takes just a few words from my Question. My Question amounted to only five lines, but instead of just reproducing my question the press release takes about 1&#x00BD; lines out of it and then, in four lines, tries to give its meaning&#x2014;and, of course, gets it wrong. It then goes on:
<quote>"If what Lord Campbell says were true as a general statement, then his Lordship would have provided a most interesting and original argument in favour of fluoridation. But what he says is untrue".</quote>
Of course, anybody looking at my Question sees that it was not a general statement because the words are:
<quote>"&#x2026; the optimum percentage of fluoride &#x2026; in water supplies in those areas where it has for centuries existed naturally &#x2026;".</quote>
I was making no general statement. Having got my wording wrong, they then go on to imply that I am being used by private interests,
<quote>"to promote the implementation of fluoridation by spreading yet another false statement in its favour".</quote>
That Press release comes from a body with headquarters at Thames Ditton.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02906">I think that anybody who knows me will recognise that this is a nonsensical allegation. I have no private interests in fluoridation, and no private interest has prompted me to raise the matter. I understand that the private interests which they have in mind are industrial companies who might be able to sell some fluoride waste products. But that, as anybody who knows anything about this will recognise, is a derisory and minimal aspect and could hardly be of any great interest to industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02907">I need hardly say that I am raising this subject in the same spirit in which I helped to start the parliamentary campaign for
<col>1440</col>
the severely disabled 14 years ago in the House of Commons. That was in 1965 and 1966 when I was fortunate in winning some ballots. I had to declare an interest then, because, as I think noble Lords know, I myself am 80 per cent. disabled as a result of the passage of a bullet through my middle. I am glad to say that that campaign was successful. I started it over three years before Mr. Alf Morris told me that he was going to take up the subject when he came first in yet another ballot in November 1969. I was able to assist the late Megan du Boissons to start an organisation called DIG&#x2014;the Disabled Income Group&#x2014;and its counterpart in Scotland. I rehearse this because it may recall memories to certain members of this House who were in another place in those days and who know the reasons why I raise subjects of this kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02908">The selection of particular words from my Question on the Order Paper, the presentation of it then as a general statement&#x2014;which was wrong&#x2014;and the suggestion that I am misleading this House with a falsehood for the benefit of private industry I can only describe as a childish and outrageous distortion. It completely discredits anything else in that Press release which has been circulated and also the body which produced it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02909">I am very pleased that several noble Lords with special qualifications to speak have found the time to be here today and take part in the debate, including the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kidding-ton, who is a distinguished and successful chairman of a health board, the noble Lord, Lord Lovell-Davis&#x2014;because I know of his special interest in children's welfare&#x2014;and my noble friend Lord Colwyn who is a practising dentist. I look forward also to hearing the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Yarborough.

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02910">I appeal for more courage in public life. Once all the facts are clear the Government should make them widely available. Communities in different areas should be enabled to take their own decisions because of the quantities of fluoride already existing in the natural supplies there. It must be pointed out that children

and grandchildren as yet unborn are those who will be most affected by decisions taken now. They will not thank us, nor will they bless us, for being timid and dilatory. The facts should be brought before the interested members of the public before decisions are taken by their representatives. Men and women in public life should not run away from this subject nor should they delay decisions on it indefinitely. The safety question is&#x2014;I repeat&#x2014;a vital one; but, if that is finally answered, a councillor in local government could well look back 20 years hence and realise that in one decision he had brought about more good for his area in measurable health standards and in saving resources than all his other council decisions during that period added together. That is the scale of the benefits that are involved.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02912"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like warmly to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, on his introduction to this important debate which, if I may say so, was animated by common sense and by a sense of compassion for the hundreds of thousands of people who have to suffer unnecessarily as a result of our failure to implement fluoridation in this country. I should like to begin by declaring an interest because I am president of the Fluoridation Society, a post which I have held for some years, and the subject which the noble Lord has raised is one which has interested me ever since I first came into another place in 1962 and when I studied carefully the evidence which arose from the studies in Watford, Anglesey and Kilmarnock, and equally I studied the evidence (such as it was) which was presented to us by the opponents of fluoridation.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, that at a time when the National Health Service is by no means flush with resources the prevention of disease should be given far greater emphasis than it is. My noble friend Lord Winstanley emphasised this point yesterday in introducing the debate on the National Health Service generally, when he said that people give three loud cheers every time that preventive medicine is mentioned although they are not always prepared to do something about it. The fluoridation of public water supplies is,
<col>1442</col>
of all preventive public health measures, the most thoroughly tested in history. My noble friend Lord Winstanley said yesterday:
<quote>"No public health measure has ever been so exhaustively studied and found so free of undesirable side effects or consequences, and demonstrated to be so capable of making a substantial contribution to the public health".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report;</i> 14/11/79, col. 1261.]</quote>
My noble friend is, of course, a general practitioner and, in saying that, he was echoing the views of the overwhelming majority of general practitioners in this country.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, has reminded us that millions of people in different countries of the world have been the subject of extensive studies over many years in respect of fluoridation, and these have all reached the same conclusions, that adjustment of the public water supply to a content of one part of fluoride per million of water by weight reduces tooth decay very substantially while, as the World Health Organisation report emphasises, this is:
<quote>"the only sign of physiological or pathological change in lifelong users of optimally fluoridated water supplies".</quote>
Apart from the number of persons drinking fluoridated water in the United States of America, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, there were in 1969 13 million people in the USSR drinking fluoridated water; in 1971 there were 4.9 million in Australia; in 1969 there were 3.6 million in Hong Kong. One might carry on with this list but I would not wish to weary your Lordships with a recital of the numbers of countries and the many millions of people who have been drinking artificially fluoridated water for many years without a single sign of ill-health resulting from that measure.<lb/>
The scientific evidence for the safety of fluoridation is massive and overwhelming. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, has mentioned that in the United Kingdom the Royal Commission on the National Health Service and the Royal College of Physicians most recently endorsed this measure. One could add the British Dental Association and numerous other bodies which have published authoritative endorsements of this as a public health measure. It is hard to imagine what additional information is likely to be provided by the study to which the noble
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0730"/>
<col>1443</col>
Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, referred. One fears that this is simply another device to put off making the decisions which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, has called upon us now to take.<lb/>
Therefore why is it taking so long for this country to realise the enormous benefits which undoubtedly would accrue for the dental health of the people, at a negligible cost? The noble Lord touched on what I think is one of the main reasons; that is, the effect on public health of anti-fluoridation propaganda. The allegations made by opponents have included an increased incidence of mongolism, arthritis, allergies and cancer. As soon as one false statement is knocked on the head then, like a hydra, another one appears and has to be refuted. The anti-fluoridationists are continually abandoning one position and turning to another, but there is no doubt that over the years of all the allegations which I have mentioned the one which associates the fluoridation of water supplies with cancer is one of the most powerful weapons in the armoury of the anti-fluoridationists; and of course the suggestion carries added weight when it is made by persons who appear to have some scientific qualification.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, mentioned the work of Dr. Dean Burk which has been used as the keystone of the literature and propaganda of the anti-fluoridation campaign. Dr. Burk, with an associate, Dr. John Yiamouyiannis of the National Health Federation of Monrovia, U.S.A., published evidence which claimed to show that where public water supplies had been fluoridated in the United States of America there had been a substantial increase in cancer death rates. It was said that because of the power of the vested interests behind fluoridation these two doctors had not yet been able to get official recognition of their evidence. I am quoting from the propaganda put out by the National Anti-Fluoridation Campaign. I think it is important to emphasise that neither Dr. Burk nor Dr. Yiamouyiannis are medical doctors&#x2014;they are both biochemists; that the so-called National Health Federation is a front organisation in the United States of America for quacks and mountebanks who try to foist useless treatments on gullible sick people, such as the use of a
<col>1444</col>
substance called Laetrile which is derived from apricot stones and is alleged&#x2014;quite falsely&#x2014;to be a cancer cure.<lb/>
As it has been alleged that fluoridation led to increased morbidity from cancer, it was clearly essential that epidemiological studies should be undertaken, as indeed they have been, to refute these allegations. In Britain there was a comprehensive study published by Dr. L. Kinlen in 1975, comparing the incidence of cancer of the breasts, bladder, colon, rectum, kidney and thyroid in a population of approximately 1.3 million people living in fluoridated areas with an equivalent matched population of similar size drinking unfluoridated water, and no differences were detected. The same result has been found wherever this comparison is made, in the United States, in Holland and in New Zealand, for example.<lb/>
Dr. Dean Burk, however, published a critique of this study of Dr. Kinlen's purporting to show, by reanalysing the data in a different way, large increases of cancer in the fluoridated areas and pointing out the remarkably large difference in the absolute rate of cancer between two of the tables in Dr. Kinlen's paper which he said were unexplained. In fact, this was due to an elementary misreading of the tables, because they related to data which was accumulated over different periods of time and were thus not comparable, as Dr. Kinlen himself had clearly explained in a footnote. I think this illustrates the kind of propaganda we have to deal with when those who are analysing statistical data are not themselves even capable of reading the footnotes to tables.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0402P0I0731"/>
<col>1445</col>
mentioned by the anti-fluoridationists, is so strong that people do not look very carefully at the evidence and do not go into analysis of claims made by persons such as Dr. Dean Burk and Dr. Yiamouyiannis. They merely see that in the anti-fluoridation literature these people are represented as having scientific qualifications. If one reads the pamphlets one sees an enormous list of papers published by this gentleman which at first sight look very authoritative and make one think that anything he says should be taken extremely seriously. It is a fact of psychology that people do take these claims made by the anti-fluoridationists seriously. This is why it is important to examine them, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said, but that we should refute them in a scientific manner rather than simply telling people not to read them.<lb/>
Perhaps I can refer the noble Earl to a very interesting article in the American consumer reports for July 1978. The author of this article says that,
<quote>"' the real goal of anti-fluoridation groups', explains an American Dental Association official, 'is to create the illusion of a scientific controversy and to this end the facts are incidental '."</quote>
What we are trying to do and what we ought to be trying to do is to bring it hack on to a scientific plane. That is why one should look carefully, for example, at the information which is provided by Professor Sir Richard Doll, the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who confirms the original study of Dr. Kinlen, that his findings were correct. He writes in fact that Dr. Burk's methods of analysing them were quite improper. There has indeed been an increase in cancer in Birmingham, which accounted for the vast majority of the 1.3 million people in the study, but as Sir Richard says, his colleague, Mrs. Cook-Mozzafari, looking at cancer mortality over a longer period and bringing the figures right up-to-date, confirms that increases have been recorded in all provincial towns with more than 400,000 inhabitants, a factor which Dr. Burk totally ignores in his analysis.<lb/>
But, my Lords, when all these technical arguments have been demolished the anti-fluoridationists fall back into their hunker of alleging that this adjustment of the fluoride content of water is a violation of civil liberties. I take this very seriously,
<col>1446</col>
as someone who was formerly chairman of the parliamentary Civil Liberties Group over a period of seven years, and who is still extremely interested and concerned to ensure that the British people maintain and uphold the civil liberties that we have always enjoyed. When this matter has been dealt with by the courts of law the argument has failed, because it is based on the false assumption that fluoridation is a method of treating disease and is therefore a form of mass medication for a condition which individual patients ought to be allowed to deal with in accordance with the method of their own choice, on professional advice, which, of course, they are free to seek or not.<lb/>
But the medical and dental authorities have made it absolutsly clear that fluoridation is not effective as a method of countering tooth decay when it has already occurred. It is a means of preventing that decay, and it is only one of as many as 38 chemicals which may be added to the water supply for improving its quality or safety. But we do not say that the addition of any of these other substances to the water supply is an invasion of our liberties. Nor have we demanded anything like the standard of proof of their safety which has been required in the case of fluoridation. Yes, by all means, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, let us give people the opportunity of objecting. But the fact is that by preventing or delaying a measure of proven effectiveness, against which not a shred of valid evidence of harm has ever been produced, the anti-fluoridationists are denying to the public at large the relief from suffering and improvement in wellbeing that a reduction of over a half in tooth decay would bring.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02916"><member>The Earl of YARBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have delayed rather longer than usual, addressing your Lordships for the first time in, I think, something like 10 years, but I would crave the indulgence which customarily your Lordships accord to someone in my situation today. I know what I ought to do; I should be brief and non-controversial. As my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy said, it is a little difficult to be non-controversial on this highly controversial subject. But I am comforted by the thought that at least it has no party political undertones. I
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0732"/>
<col>1447</col>
would expect divergent views on this subject from all parts of your Lordships' House. I am just about to introduce the divergence on this side&#x2014;at any rate the first divergence on this side of the House.<lb/>
Perhaps I might be allowed to state, first of all, my general stance in regard to the whole matter, which is that I have been an opponent of fluoridation since the idea was first mooted, for the basic reason&#x2014;and this has been touched upon already&#x2014;that it interferes with what I at any rate conceive to be the liberty of the individual. So far as I am concerned, it has nothing to do with making the water pure and treating the water as such. I regard it as medication. I think the intent of fluoridation is to create a pathological change in those, or at lease some of those, who drink it, and that to my mind is medication, and one can call it mass medication certainly. So I find it unacceptable that a public service like the water supply should be used to convey any substance. It happens in this case to be sodium fluoride, but I would object just as strongly if it was anything else. Given the intent, and I think the intent is important, to put what I regard as a medicinal product in it, intended to affect the body of the recipient, I would regret anything being put in it for that purpose, however good the result might be. It is perhaps a somewhat purist view, but it is, I think, a view which my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy said he respected, although the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, does not really think very much of it.<lb/>
I object particularly strongly because I lean rather heavily towards the homeopathic approach to medicine. As your Lordships know, under that approach everything is done to provide what a particular individual may need on an individual basis. That type of treatment is the exact reverse of what is proposed. However, I recognise that not everyone will take that view and so I shall put that behind me, having stated that it is the fundamental reason for my holding the view that I do hold.<lb/>
In the Question and indeed as regards what has already been said, optimum levels have been considered. The first thing I should like to know is optimum for whom?&#x2014;given that we are all different; that we all drink different amounts of
<col>1448</col>
liquid in which there may or may not be fluoride; and that we all eat different foods in which, as has been pointed out already, there is very often fluoride. Presumably if we were considering a middle-aged person with dentures the optimum would be nil. The optimum might very well be nil for the great majority of the population.<lb/>
Let us consider for a moment those to whom fluoridation is directed&#x2014;that is, children between, let us say, seven and 14. I read some figures which seemed to indicate that there was a factor of eight as regards the difference between the bottom and the top of what they might consume, at any rate in liquid form. What is one to do? Just put the pin in the middle and say, "That's it"? I suggest that that is a rather unscientific and haphazard way of reaching an answer.<lb/>
What of the other members of the population who do not need fluoride? The vital question is: how safe is it? I do not want, especially on this occasion, to engage in a battle over statistics or who said or did what. But it is my sincere understanding that there are medical grounds for at least suspecting it&#x2014;leaving it as vague as that&#x2014;especially as regards mongolism, genetic change and certainly the incidence of cancer. I have read a number of different opinions. I would only say tonight that I am very concerned that there is a safety problem. There needs to be more research especially on what may be the long-term effects of fluoride. If we put it in all the water supplies it will be a life sentence&#x2014;we must have it.<lb/>
I should like to consider the situation which has obtained for a number of years. The whole area of fluoridation has resembled nothing so much as a battlefield. Skirmishes have taken place throughout the country with local authorities and health authorities. Sometimes the result has gone one way and sometimes the other way. Sometimes decisions have been reversed and sometimes they have been upheld. I should like to suggest that the pressure be taken off and that we have a cease-fire or perhaps a moratorium.<lb/>
I was delighted to learn that there is to be another inquiry. I did not know that until I came to your Lordships' House this evening. However, I suggest that it should
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0733"/>
<col>1449</col>
be a judicial inquiry and not an internal inquiry. There is so much disagreement and suspicion of each side's motives&#x2014;although I am prepared to accept that most of it is unfounded, it does exist&#x2014;that what is needed is some judicial body to hear the evidence and to weigh it, because that seems to me to be a judicial function. All the experts could give evidence. Their evidence would doubtless conflict as it normally does when there are two or three experts together. It would be the function of this commission, body or whatever one might call it, to come out with its findings.<lb/>
Already this evening examples have been quoted of what occurred in America. What I read was rather different from the picture painted this evening. It was my understanding&#x2014;if the case quoted was the case in Allegheny in Pennsylvania&#x2014;that it was found proven that fluoride was a danger to health. I know that there was some legal wrangle about jurisdiction but I thought, on the facts presented by a number of experts, that that was the finding and that the facts had not been challenged but merely the jurisdiction of the court to grant a temporary injunction. However, I could well be wrong. In any event that exemplifies the difficulties of the matter.<lb/>
One must also have regard to what has happened in other countries, especially Europe. We are the only country, apart from Eire, that now has fluoridation. Other countries have tried it. For example Sweden tried it and did away with it in 1971. Holland had it, but got rid of it in 1973. I am sure that all those countries have gone into the question of safety and in some cases they have concluded that it is a potential health hazard. Therefore, I do not think that all the evidence points in one direction.<lb/>
One reason why I suggest that we should have some judicially based body, is that it is difficult to escape the feeling&#x2014;and I do not want to be critical especially on this occasion&#x2014;that those in the Health Service and the Department of Health have over the years adopted an entrenched position. Those of us who have tried individually and in groups to influence these issues and let the other side of the case be heard, have found them perhaps a little unresponsive. As came out earlier they have also been somewhat dismissive.
<col>1450</col>
Whether your Lordships think that I am a nut case this evening, I do not know, but I shall no doubt be told in due course. There have been some fairly rude aspersions cast at anybody who&#x2014;I assure your Lordships in my case very sincerely&#x2014;opposes the whole idea of fluoridation.<lb/>
In conclusion I should like to say that I am entirely sympathetic with the motives of those who want fluoride. I understand perfectly what they are trying to do. I would question&#x2014;because I think that there is some doubt&#x2014;how effective it is. It certainly has an effect on children's teeth. My understanding is that all it does in fact is to delay the incidence of caries and that it does not prevent it. However, that is something with which I am sure other noble Lords will deal.<lb/>
In this age in which we live our environment is heavily dependent on chemicals in one way or another, and deeply involved with chemicals. We have them in our food in the form of colouring; we have additives; and preservatives; we have chemicals in our drinks; they are in the soil and in the air. I know that there are specified bodies whose duty it is to monitor those matters and I am sure that they do their job admirably. However, there seems to me to be a great danger in adding to the number unless it is absolutely necessary.<lb/>
I would include fluoride in this category of potentially dangerous substances. We may set a safe limit for the vast majority of people but there are always those on the fringe who, for some reason, are particularly sensitive to some chemical or another. If we add to the numbers of such chemicals that are potentially dangerous, it increases the likelihood of those people who are particularly sensitive encountering one that will be severely damaging to them. Turning to the Question, and holding the views I do, in this particular instance I believe that the water authority has done a service by reducing a naturally high level of fluoride to one that is lower and I would therefore suggest safer.</membercontribution></p>

on making it on a subject as controversial as this. His was an interesting and reasonably-stated contribution to the debate and it is, of course, right that he should state his views and reservations as clearly as he has. I feel sure that, if his future interventions are as non-controversial, we can look forward to hearing them keenly. I shall now proceed to disagree with him totally!<lb/>
I am not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, as a member of the Government party, is testing the water but I am glad that lie has raised once more this too long debated matter. Perhaps our debate this evening will encourage some action. If it does, millions of people&#x2014;in particular children&#x2014;will lead happier and healthier lives. Everyone in this House must have suffered toothache and, as a result of dental caries, had fillings and extractions, and experienced the pain that dental treatment often causes. Probably everyone, too, can remember how much worse it all was in childhood. I can, vividly.<lb/>
For children the experience can be traumatic and can create a lifelong fear which makes many adults&#x2014;and I know several&#x2014;simply let their teeth go, avoid the dentist's chair and finally opt for false teeth. Treatment is much better today and involves far less discomfort, but only the overconfident or masochistic face a visit to the dentist without some sense of fear. I do not want to dwell on this aspect of the subject, although I want us to achieve a position where the need for dental treatment is dramatically reduced, where that treatment is simpler and where suffering and fear are replaced by real interest in preventing dental disease. Much the worst aspect of it, of course, is the unnecessary loss of teeth&#x2014;often complete loss in childhood.<lb/>
I intend neither to discuss the cases for and against fluoridation nor to comment on the documents that we have received from an address in Station Road, Thames Ditton, except to say that in telling us where our duty lies, the language is exaggerated and the tone strident, if not almost hysterical. They remind me of nothing so much as a re-run of that once fiecrely debated question "Can man live at 100 miles an hour?"<lb/>
<col>1452</col>
I have weighed the evidence myself; it is the best that I can do. As a member of your Lordships' House, it is my responsibility to do so and then, if I feel strongly about the subject&#x2014;as I do in this case&#x2014;to put my view before the House. My view is that we should put into effect a programme of water fluoridation. I have been persuaded to this point of view by a number of considerations, and not least by the findings and recommendations of two important reports. One, entitled <i>Fit for the Future,</i> is the report of the Committee on Child Health Services under the chairmanship of Professor Donald Court, which was published in December, 1976. Pointing out, in a section on dental health, that fluoridation is
<quote>"one measure that would prevent a great deal of dental caries without individual effort",</quote>
it says:
<quote>"The presence of fluoride, to a level of one part per million in all water supplies, would substantially reduce dental caries in children and restrain it in adults, and the procedure is safe, effective and cheap".</quote>
On safety, it quotes the 1976 Report of the Royal College of Physicians which concludes, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, have pointed out, that there is no evidence that the consumption of water containing one part per million of fluoride in a temperate climate is associated with any harmful effects. On the other hand, the effectiveness of fluoridation is indicated by, among others, the case of New Zealand, where there has been a dramatic decrease in the need for dental care since fluoridation, and the average number of fillings inserted annually has fallen from five to three per child.<lb/>
Why, the Court Report asks, do only
<quote>"8 per cent. of the people of Britain enjoy the benefits of fluoridation",</quote>
while 92 per cent. are deprived? It concludes that:
<quote>"The real obstacles are public apathy, minority prejudice and governmental reluctance to impose a political solution. The cost in unnecessary disease, personal pain and discomfort, misuse of professional resources and national expenditure has been immense".</quote>
The committee's recommendation is unequivocal:
<quote>"We recommend that immediate steps should be taken to introduce fluoridation on a national scale, if necessary with new legislation".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0735"/>
<col>1453</col>
The second report, which has already been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, is that of the Royal Commission on the National Health Service, under its chairman, Sir Alec Merrison, which was published in July of this year. The section on fluoridation is quite lengthy and I shall not delay your Lordships by quoting extensively from it. I should like simply to quote one short section, which reads:
<quote>"We are not simply convinced of the wisdom of introducing fluoridation, if necessarily compulsorily; we are certain that it is entirely wrong to deprive the most vulnerable section of the population of such an important public health measure for the sake of the views of a small minority of adults for whom its benefits come too late".</quote>
The Commission's recommendation is as direct as that of the Court Committee. It is:
<quote>"the Government should introduce legislation to compel water authorities to fluoridate water supplies at the request of health authorities".</quote>
Finally, I am greatly impressed by the views of dentists themselves, such as the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, who, it seems to me, display professional responsibility of the highest degree in pressing the case for fluoridation. I not only support the request of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy; I would go further and ask the Government if they will accept the recommendations I and others have referred to&#x2014;and recommendations such as the resolution of the 28th World Health Assembly in 1975&#x2014;and take action to introduce fluoridation on a national scale. By doing so they will not only save children and adults unnecessary suffering, but will also save the nation's professional resources and its money.</membercontribution></p>

I am sure that there are many subjects on which we could agree, but on this one I must take the opposite view. I was going to finish my remarks with a certain statement, but I think I shall start them with it. It seems tragic that on a question as im-
<col>1454</col>
portant as this, the voice of the anti-lobby is heard so much more loudly than the voice of the pro-lobby. This is true with many problems that face us. The people who are in favour tend to keep quiet. I am therefore delighted that so far in this debate we have had one, two, three, and this is the fourth speech in favour, and only one against so far. I think it is our duty, if we believe in fluoridation of water, for us to go out and say so as loudly as the anti-lobby.<lb/>
I was tremendously sad not to be able to be present yesterday at the debate on the Health Service. Many speakers in that debate referred to the problems of the finances of the Health Service itself, and to the fact that if ever we are to be able to meet the costs of the needs of this nation from a health point of view, we must concentrate on preventive measures which can, and will in the long run, reduce the cost to the nation and to the service. Here, I agree, is one measure which could demonstrably help to save money, and it could do that at the same time as it would prevent suffering for a lot of young people.<lb/>
There has been a great deal of reference to the question of safety. Various reports have been quoted. I want only to add one thing to that. It is interesting to see that in Australia, to which my noble friend Lord Avebury referred, there are 4&#x00B7;9 million people drinking fluoridated water. In Australia they have recently carried out a research project into the suggested connection between cancer and fluoride, the outcome of which has been that the Director-General of Health has lately issued a report supporting fluoridation in that country. That is one additional support for the safety angle.<lb/>
I really want to talk about the problems of implementation as they affect a regional health authority. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said that he felt that the decision should be taken locally and that individuals locally should have a right to participate in the decision-making. In actual fact that is what happens at the moment, because it is the responsibility of the health authorities to consult as widely as they can with interested bodies before they take a decision to recommend fluoride.<lb/>
May I talk about my own region. Every single area in my region has taken
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0736"/>
<col>1455</col>
the decision, and so has the region, that we should like fluoride added to the water supply within our region. For a number of years we have attempted to get this done. The problem is that there is no enforcement order between the health authority's recommendation and the water authority's need to comply with those recommendations. I believe that on the whole the water authorities are resistant to this recommendation because of their responsibilities under the Water Act to produce clean, wholesome water. If they are worried about it, I think they should refer to a case that was brought in 1964 to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The noble Earl, Lord Yarborough, will perhaps be glad to hear that it was a judicial committee that considered the subject. It was a case brought from the New Zealand courts by the Attorney General of New Zealand against the Lower Hutt City Corporation. The judicial committee decided that the addition of fluoride added no impurity and that the water remained pure water, and that the corporation, as a water authority, was empowered to make the addition. I know that this case does not apply to this country, but at least it is something to which we can refer.<lb/>
Since the setting up of the new regional health authorities, the only water authority in this country to comply with the health authority's recommendation to add fluoride to the water is the Yorkshire Water Authority. The Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council began an action to prevent the Yorkshire Water Authority from implementing the area health authority's decision, and the water authority accepted the Secretary of State's immediate offer of indemnity, and so the case was to go forward. This all happened in the middle of 1978, practically a year and a half ago. So far the case has not been heard, and no date has even been set for hearing. If we want to test the case, surely the hearing should be brought forward.<lb/>
I recognise that the previous Administration did almost all they could to help the health authorities implement their desire to have fluoride added to the water under the present system. They went to great lengths to give indemnity assurances to the water authorities, but that was not enough. There were, therefore, strong
<col>1456</col>
requests from health authorities that legislation must be introduced, because when questions were asked in the other place about enforcement the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment in the last Administration, Mr. Denis Howell, said:
<quote>"I have no powers to give such a direction [to a water authority]. As I have made clear on a number of occasions, I have encouraged water authorities to comply with requests made by area health authorities to add fluoride to water supplies, where it is technically possible to do so".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 8/3/78, col. 637.]</quote>
But he had no power.<lb/>
At the end of the life of the last Administration the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Health and Social Security, Mr. Eric Deakins, on 29th June, when addressing the National Association of Health Authorities, admitted that we had come to the point where introducing legislation was probably the only answer, but he said that it was impracticable for that Administration to do so at that late stage. Well, I agree with that.<lb/>
I speak in this debate because I should like the present Government to give strong consideration to introducing legislation to enforce decisions taken by health authorities, because I believe that the consultation that health authorities carry out before they come to the decision that fluoride should be added is very wide, and is adequate for pressure groups in the population of that area to make their wishes known. I would ask the present Government to consider this very seriously.<lb/>
As a regional chairman I am always interested in funds for the Health Service. About four or five years ago a special fund was created in the department to help health authorities with the setting up of fluoridation schemes, and &#x00A3;500,000 a year was set aside centrally for that purpose. It will cost health authorities quite a bit of money, and as the years go by the cost will be higher. I sincerely hope that that fund is sacrosanct, and if we get the power to introduce fluoride that the money will be forthcoming from the department.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02922"><member>Lord NUGENT of GUILDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy for introducing this interesting subject for us to discuss
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0737"/>
<col>1457</col>
and I congratulate my noble friend Lord Yarborough on his very interesting maiden speech. In this particular field, which is controversial, up to date he has found himself a single voice on the side of those who oppose fluoridation, but he has comfort to come because I see the noble Lord, Lord Douglas of Barloch, in his place and I know he is a doughty warrior among those who wish to keep fluoridation out of our water. He will therefore have substantial support there. And of course it is a fact, as noble Lords well know, that outside the House there are many people who feel passionately on this matter and therefore it is right and proper that we should debate it here and listen with great attention to those who sincerely feel opposed to it.<lb/>
I am making a brief intervention from the point of view of the water industry primarily, for which I was responsible until this time last year. The position is that water supply is now in the hands of what is, in effect, a national water industry composed of 10 regional water authorities and 28 water companies, and substantially the position in regard to the fluoridation of water is that it is unchanged by the new structure which came into existence in 1974. It is substantially unchanged in regard to fluoridation; that is to say, the new water authorities have carried on with fluoridised supplies where they existed in the past and substantially have not made any change. The noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington, is right in saying that the Yorkshire Water Authority were preparing to introduce fluoridation in supplies in their area, but so far as I know they have not yet done so, but Calderdale have taken out a writ against them and, so far as I know, that is still lying there, so that physically the position has not significantly changed.<lb/>
Three years ago we, through myself as chairman of the National Water Council, had considerable discussion with Ministers on this matter. It was perfectly true that Ministers in the last Government wished to see an extension of this treatment and the position is, as the noble Baroness said, that the regional health authority would make the request to the regional water authority and then it would be for the regional water authority to carry it out if they thought it was the proper thing to do. The difficulty for regional water
<col>1458</col>
authorities was that in their judgment the law was not sufficiently clear to authorise them to proceed to give the fluoridation treatment to water supplies within their regions as the law now stands.<lb/>
Therefore, we explained to the Secretary of State for the Environment that we were unable to make this treatment unless the Government were prepared to legislate, first, to clarify the statutory authority of regional health authorities to make this request; secondly, it would oblige regional water authorities to carry it out; and, thirdly, there would be complete indemnification for regional water authorities against anybody who took an action against them in damages.<lb/>
We felt that that was the only proper course we could take in this very controversial field where action could be taken from either side, either by those who felt that regional water authorities should be so treating the water or by those who were bitterly opposed to it. In the event, as the noble Baroness recorded, the last Government were not able to legislate in this field, and so the position remains substantially unchanged.<lb/>
In regard to the technical point in my noble friend's Question&#x2014;that the effect of the regionalisation of supplies might dilute previous fluoridised supplies&#x2014;that has not significantly happened, although of course regional networks of water supply have been developed and were substantially completed following the emergency of the drought in 1976. The position remains thus. I wish to deal with the point which Lord Yarborough dealt with so cogently, which is of course one of the major objections to the fluoridation of water&#x2014;namely, that it would amount to an unwarranted medication of water by introducing a chemical into the water and so adulterating it. The present practice is, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, rightly said, that many chemical substances are added to water, the four main ones being chlorine, copper sulphate, aluminium and calcium; but there are many others as well and these are added first to make the water safe and secondly to make it palatable.<lb/>
We must not overlook the fact that a very large part of our water supply has mixed with the natural supply what is called re-used water. If we take, for instance, the supply of excellent water we
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0738"/>
<col>1459</col>
drink in London every day, this comes as two-thirds from the River Thames. The water in the River Thames has been used by millions of people living on the banks of the Thames, from the large towns of Swindon, Oxford, Reading and many smaller towns all the way down its banks. However, by processes of very carefully controlled treatment, these sewage effluents are made perfectly safe so that by the time the water comes to London it can be finally treated by the Thames Water Authority. This water is supplied through the pipes to us safe and clean and in every way palatable. What has gone into that water from factories and homes by the thousand is every sort and kind of chemical and impurity. However, these can be cleaned up and the water can be made perfectly satisfactory and palatable to use. We must therefore have a sense of proportion about this. It just does not make sense to say that one small chemical addition of fluoride will so adulterate the water as to make it completely objectionable.<lb/>
This has brought me away from the position of complete neutrality which I took, I thought advisedly, when I was chairman of the National Water Council. I then thought I should be completely neutral and I have never before expressed in public a view about the merits of fluoridation. But now that I am, so to speak, a free man and can do so, I declare that I am entirely convinced by the evidence both in this country and throughout the world that the case for fluoridating the water is absolutely unanswerable. I may say that I am fortified in this view because my wife has for nearly 30 years been a governor of the Eastman Dental Hospital and therefore I am freely and well-advised at home by my ever-loving wife of the truth of this matter.<lb/>
If one looks at any of the documents which have been so lucidly quoted today by many noble Lords, one sees that the scientific evidence is really compelling, and I shall refer to only a few points. One that struck me most forcefully was from a report of the Royal College of Physicians in 1976; that 37 per cent of the population of this country over the age of 16 have no teeth at all left in their heads&#x2014;they have nothing but dentures&#x2014;and in Scotland, where my noble friend comes from, the figure is 44 per cent. This
<col>1460</col>
really is terrible and, as the noble Baroness will know well, unfortunately in over half our households a toothbrush never appears. But if before they were born their mums were drinking water with fluoride in it, these children would have natural protection against this miserable disease which costs the National Health Service &#x00A3;140 million a year as well as inflicting a great deal of pain and suffering. The greater part of this would be saved.<lb/>
Experience throughout the world&#x2014;the World Health Authority has been quoted&#x2014;shows that in no less than 30 countries this treatment is given to water, covering a population of the order of 150 million. The WHO made a firm recommendation to consider fluoridation of water "as a proven health measure". They said that in 1969 and they reiterated it in 1975. That is really convincing evidence. It has been tried worldwide by over 100 million people and found to be satisfactory.<lb/>
We have of course all this scientific evidence to show that the health dangers about which the opponents are so con-cerned&#x2014;particularly cancer&#x2014;are simply non-existent. I quote only one sentence from the report of the Royal College of Physicians:
<quote>"There is no evidence that fluoride increases the incidence or mortality of cancer in any organ".</quote>
and they deal with various other possible afflictions, too.<lb/>
So I conclude my few remarks by saying that I hope it may be possible that this Government, who are full of such splendid purpose, and who have many other things to put right, can include in their programme this splendid piece of legislation. In a few areas there is natural fluoridation of the water, and there the population are enormously lucky. I should like to see that splendid natural benefit spread to the whole country, and I hope that my noble friend will find time for this legislation.</membercontribution></p>

him again. If I do not make myself heard, will someone prod me&#x2014;I am suffering from the aftermath of influenza.<lb/>
Fluoridation is one of the greatest delusions that has ever afflicted the medical and dental professions. It started with some statistical surveys made in the United States and published in 1942, comparing the incidence of dental decay in children of 12 and 14 years in areas which had varying amounts of fluoride in the water supply. The author of this report said that his figures showed that there was a reduction of 50 or 60 per cent. in dental decay. That is totally untrue. The statistics showed quite clearly that there were enormous variations between places which had the same amount of fluoride in the water supply&#x2014;differences of up to 50 per cent.<lb/>
This is typical of the way in which people have approached this subject ever since, because they have made the tacit assumption that the only factor that affects the level of dental decay is the amount of fluoride in the water supply. That indeed is exactly where the Royal College of Physicians' Report starts off in its very first sentence by saying:
<quote>"It has been shown in many parts of the world that the amount of dental caries in the population varies inversely with the amount of fluoride in drinking water".</quote>
That statement is not true. There are very many other factors which affect the incidence of dental decay.<lb/>
There is at any rate one case in which some allowance was made for the fact that other causes might be at work. That was in an experiment carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Health in which the precaution was taken of having a survey in the year preceding fluoridation in order to ascertain whether the area to be fluoridated was comparable to a control. After 11 years a report was published on the results of the experiment, and it showed that at age 8 there were on average in the permanent teeth of children two decayed teeth in the control area and 1&#x00B7;2 in the study area; a difference of 0&#x00B7;8 of a tooth. At age 14 the difference was exactly the same. Dental decay had increased by equal amounts in both the control and the study areas. A saving of decay in less than one tooth for one year is not a substantial contribution to solving dental decay, and still less is it a
<col>1462</col>
contribution to solving the problem of teeth, because after the age of maturity the loss of teeth is mostly occasioned by paradontal disease, not by dental caries, and that will not be altered at all by fluoridation. The result will be that there will be almost exactly the same situation as at present.<lb/>
After all, what has happened in the United States, where 90 million people are having fluoride in their water supply? The cost of dental treatment is going up every year. The amount spent on research&#x2014;millions of dollars&#x2014;is also going up every year. This panacea has not altered anything substantially.<lb/>
Let me point out, first, that fluorides are not nutrients. They are in this connection drugs. Of course drugs are not necessarily medicinal. They may also be preventive, and this is well recognised. I shall quote one well-known authority, Vruton and Simmonds' <i>General Bio-chemistry.</i> They say:
<quote>"Bromide and fluoride &#x2026; are generally considered non-nutritive and toxic for higher animals".</quote>
In a book written by the late Lord Horder and Sir Charles Dodds, it is pointed out that,
<quote>"fluorine is an extremely powerful enzyme poison".</quote>
This is what we are asked to add to the water supply and therefore we certainly ought to be extremely careful.<lb/>
It has in fact been known for a very long time that fluorides have detrimental effects. In 1937, Colonel H. E. Short, FRS, conducted a series of investigations in India showing that fluoride (in, I agree, somewhat higher amounts) had caused serious skeletal disability, pain and so on; and in the same year there was published in London and Denmark a classical study by Dr. Roholm, who collected all the information relating to his book, and who described his own personal experiences and experiments with regard to fluorides.<lb/>
The conclusion to which he came was that they were very toxic, and that they should on no account be added to any foodstuff. He pointed out, in particular, that their effect upon the enamel of teeth was, on the whole, detrimental; and this was found in the United States at an early stage, because it was found that teeth with dental fluorosis were brittle and difficult
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0740"/>
<col>1463</col>
to repair. Observe that at this so-called optimal level there are going to be quite a number of children who will have some fluorous teeth. The figure of one part per million was not chosen as an optimal or desirable level. It was chosen as the maximum which should certainly not be exceeded, as many water suppliers were exceeding it, although even at that level 10 per cent. of children would develop dental fluorosis. This, as the Medical Research Council has said, is the first detectable symptom of chronic fluoride poisoning, and so it is a serious warning.<lb/>
In 1924, the Ministry of Health Departmental Committee on Preservatives in Food made a report in which they said that fluoride and formaldehyde were the most toxic substances which had been proposed as food additives; and during the last 50 years, in this country, it has been illegal to add fluoride to foods, with one minor exception. Unfortunately, under our legislation water is not classified as a food, but, nevertheless, the inference is very clear. There are other indications of injury from fluorides. I will not say that everybody will develop symptoms, but we are at a point where some people will.<lb/>
A very extensive survey was carried out in the United States by a very competent doctor, Dr. Rapaport, of the incidence of births of children suffering from a mental disorder popularly known as mongolism, or Down's syndrome. He found that the number of cases was correlated with the amount of fluoride in the water supply. This was an investigation in four American States and a second one in one of these over a different period of years. I took the trouble to calculate what the odds were that these results were credible. I found that the odds were 62&#x00BD; million to one that this was not due to chance. This research has been brushed aside on most trivial grounds. One member of the American Public Health Service said he had made a survey of some of the area covered by Rapaport, and had found that any difference was probably due to chance. But that investigation has never been published. No data are available, and yet it is quoted all over the world as evidence. It is not evidence of anything at all; and this is the way in which many of these matters have been handled.<lb/>
<col>1464</col>
My Lords, there is a very large amount of evidence. There is, indeed, a memorandum of the Medical Research Council on goitre which indicates that fluoride may cause goitre. This has been verified in various parts of the world&#x2014;in this country, in South Africa, in India and elsewhere&#x2014;and a very eminent Austrian doctor called Gorlitzer von Mundy&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02927"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I intervene briefly? I merely want to make sure that when people read the noble Lord's remarks in <i>Hansard</i> they also appreciate that the work which he has mentioned, of Rapaport, alleging a connection between fluoridation and mongolism, has been refuted; for example, by Berry, WTC, in a study of the incidence of mongolism in relation to the fluoride content of water, in the <i>American Journal of Mental Deficiency,</i> 62: 634 (1958). So anybody reading the noble Lord's remarks will also have the reference to the article in which they are refuted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02928"><member>Lord DOUGLAS of BARLOCH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am perfectly familiar with that paper, and the conclusion to which Berry came was that the incidence of mongolism in this country was not well indicated by a count of cases being cared for in institutions. That was intended to be a criticism of Rapaport, who included those and others. Since then, Berry's statement has been quoted as a refutation. It is nothing of the kind.<lb/>
My Lords, I was going to quote Dr. Gorlitzer von Mundy, who conducted thousands of animal experiments and afterwards treated very many cases of goitre by the administration of small doses of fluoride. What he said was that fluorides should not be administered indiscriminately, especially to young children whose need of iodine was very great. These observations have never been refuted.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0741"/>
<col>1465</col>
Let me say just a word about this question of cancer. It is becoming acutely controversial. Dr. Dean Burk and his colleague produced a very impressive paper which showed a connection between fluoride and cancer as a result of a survey of 10 of the largest fluoridated cities in the United States and 10 of the largest unfluoridated ones. The United States National Cancer Institute and Professor Newall in this country have said that insufficient adjustment has been made for the effect of age, race and sex. They produced a calculation which purported to show that fluoridation had not increased the incidence of cancer.<lb/>
I do not want to go into the technique of this statistical argument. What I will say is that the method which they adopted, and which they said was the only valid method of correcting crude statistics, was used by another American investigator, Dr. J. D. Erickson whose paper was published last year in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine.</i> This survey covered an even larger population of 46 cities of over 250,000 people, about half fluoridated and half not. Crude death rates were higher in the fluoridated group. Dr. Erickson processed the figures in the way which these critics have said is the only proper and valid method and he still had an excess of cancer deaths in the fluoridated cities. He then processed the figures for length of schooling and percentage of open space, and came up with a different result. If anybody believes that the latter operation was a valid method I am surprised. Certainly nobody ever demonstrated a connection between the incidence of cancer and the number of years people had been at school.<lb/>
Now let me go back for a moment to this question of a so-called optimal level of fluoride in the water supplies. As I said, it was never adopted for that purpose. The World Health Organisation in its resolution in 1969 recommended Member States to introduce, where suitable, fluoridation in public water supplies where the intake of fluoride from all sources was below an optimal level. There are many sources besides water supplies; more probably may come from food or from drinking tea.<lb/>
Anyhow, the simple point is that every individual is different, his consumption of water and many other things is different.
<col>1466</col>
There is no such thing as an optimal level for a population. There might or might not be one for an individual, but for a population not at all. Therefore the resolution passed by the World Health Organisation is absolutely meaningless. Nobody could ever carry it out because one cannot ascertain how much every member of the population is consuming. Nor can one determine how much more one will get if one puts fluoride into the water supply. This, like many other authorities which are quoted, is a meaningless statement which can carry no conviction for anybody who thinks about what it implies.<lb/>
The report of the Royal Commission on the National Health Service certainly made the recommendation which has been quoted, but I do not know what evidence they received. I do not know whether they heard anybody who had any criticism to make of fluoridation; and it certainly was not in their terms of reference. That is a rather strange circumstance. Reference has been made to a case heard in the United States asking for an injunction to prevent fluoridation in which the judge, after hearing evidence for and against of the most eminent kind, came to the conclusion that fluorides were dangerous to health and liable to induce cancer. That judgment still stands. The decision to issue an injunction was appealed against and it was decided by the higher court of Pennsylvania&#x2014;not the Supreme Court of the United States&#x2014;that the injunction ought not to be issued. But the substance of the finding has been unassailed.<lb/>
Reference has also been made to the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in this country on an appeal from New Zealand. All that the Privy Council did was to confirm the judgment of the court below, which was based, as it said, on the assumption that fluorides are naturally found in water supplies and that the water supplies of New Zealand were deficient. That finding was made entirely upon the evidence advanced by the promoters of fluoridation, because the plaintiffs did not call any evidence. They assumed, it would seem, that the case was so to speak, self-evident. So that judgment clearly has no bearing upon the controversy which we are considering.<lb/>
Always appeals are made to emotion&#x2014;about children having dental treatment
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0742"/>
<col>1467</col>
and suffering from pains in their teeth&#x2014;and appeals are made to authority in the shape of bodies such as the Royal College of Physicians' Committee. I pointed out that it started off on the wrong foot and anybody who reads the report can see that the conclusions are quite unbelievable because, although they quote evidence of injury from fluoride they quote other people who said they had not found it. If they had said that on balance they thought there was no damage to the human body from fluoride, one could possible have believed it. But to say in chapter after chapter that there is no evidence, when the evidence is palpable&#x2014;I have given some examples tonight&#x2014;is certainly not a scientific way of going about things. I am reminded of what Galileo said; that in matters of science the opinion of one informed person may be worth that of thousands of others.<lb/>
There are a great many eminent scientists all over the world, including Nobel prize-winners, who have objected to fluoridation, and on health grounds. After all, there still remains the ethical question: What right has any Government to impose a method of treatment upon people against their will? It has been a cardinal principle of the National Health Service since its beginning that no compulsion would be exercised on doctors as to their method of treatment. If they are not to be compelled, their patients certainly are not to be compelled. It is quite improper that they should be.<lb/>
It is all very well to say that fluorides are found naturally in some water supplies. Very rarely are they in amounts such as are proposed. Lots of other things are found naturally in the water supplies&#x2014;radioactive materials, for example&#x2014;but it does not prove it is a good thing that they should be there: far from it. So I say once more that it is totally wrong that anybody should impose a treatment of this kind.<lb/>
Reference was made by one speaker to vaccination against smallpox. Smallpox was never so rife in this country as at a time when vaccination was most stringently enforced on the population. The elimination of smallpox from the world has come about, not by vaccination but by the simple plan, known for a century or so, that what you need to do is to isolate the
<col>1468</col>
contacts and prevent the disease from spreading. That is an illustration of a medical myth which is still believed everywhere. I hope it will not be so for long.</membercontribution></p>

I agree it is high time something was done about this subject. We have heard some interesting speeches and I should like to include my contratulations on the maiden speech of the noble Earl, Lord Yarborough, although I did not really agree with anything he said.<lb/>
I appreciate that fluoridation is a very emotive subject and I have no doubt that our deliberations this evening will have reprecussions for many weeks to come. When society is involved in vigorous, acrimonious and frequently apparently irrational debate on a topic which admits of no compromise, the time comes to stand back a little from the detailed battle and review the general position. Such a topic is the great issue before your Lordships' House today.<lb/>
Over a number of years I have practised dentistry myself. I ought to have declared an interest, although just before the debate started the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, reminded me that perhaps it was not an interest to declare since if everything goes through I shall have no work to do at all! I shall not go into all the minute details about how many teeth are saved,
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0743"/>
<col>1469</col>
and what happens to this or that, because I, too, could go on for two to three hours and bore your Lordships.<lb/>
The scientific arguments for fluoridation are no longer in question. There is no room for scientific doubt that the addition of one part per million of fluoride to the public water supply is astonishingly effective in reducing the incidence of tooth decay. The apparent irrationality of some of the arguments offered by those of us who are against fluoridation and their consequent difficulty in defending them, must not lead those of us in favour of fluoridation to be too contemptuous, especially on occasions such as this, for it is often the case that in human affairs such a response is indicative of a deep socially important sense of duty which is not always rationally expressed by those who hold it. Indeed, such people may not even realise the nature of the deep-seated reason for their opposition to an innovation which looks to so many other citizens as overwhelmingly desirable.<lb/>
The experience of the City of Birmingham, for instance, where the introduction of fluoride has now resulted in there being not enough children with decay for dental students in the hospitals to practise on, is just the most recent dramatic example of the effectiveness of fluoride. It may be that this particular episode in the nearly century-long history of knowledge of the effectiveness of fluoride in caries reduction will prove the ultimate clinching argument which will turn the balance of public opinion in the direction of fluoridation of the public water supply.<lb/>
Current dental practice is very much aimed at prevention. We hear of topical applications, of fluoride rinses, of fissure sealants, and my noble friend Lord Campbell mentioned fluoride tablets. In fact, I disagree with him. They have to be taken for only six years, because teeth actually start forming six years before they appear in the mouth, so that if they are taken at conception and finish at around the age of six, that is sufficient protection. It is also a fact that correct oral hygiene&#x2014;that is, cleaning of the teeth&#x2014;done properly, will completely also eradicate dental caries.<lb/>
But the present scope of dental treatment is just not reaching the vast majority of the population of this country. Only 40
<col>1470</col>
per cent. of us regularly visit our dentist, and 60 per cent. hardly go at all ! Only 30 per cent. of the population of this country have a functional toothbrush. That is a sobering thought. If everybody decided in the next week or so that they would go and see their dentist, the dental services just would not be able to cope with the patient demand.<lb/>
Why do so many dentists&#x2014;and I number myself among them&#x2014;tend now towards private practice? It is because, under the health system, we were dealing with between 40 and 60 patients a day with dental decay. That is hard work, and as you get older is just impossible to deal with. We cannot cope with this epidemic problem. Perhaps the introduction of fluoride in the water supplies would enable far better use to be made of our National Health Service.<lb/>
Before us we have a proved and effective treatment reaching the entire population. I have seen the children who suffer. It is all very well saying that they should clean their teeth and that we should take their sweets away from them. But it is not until you have had to hold down a screaming four-year old child, anaesthetise it and pull out baby teeth that you realise the difficulties and the immorality of not initiating a proved comprehensive treatment plan that will prevent untold cases of future suffering. Never has so much research been put into a single preventive programme. There are 158 million people in 38 countries who now drink fluoridated water. The scares and the correlation of fluoride in one part per million to detrimental health have been shown to be totally untrue. I have papers here&#x2014;hundreds of them&#x2014;showing not a single correlation between any of these diseases. The connections between cancer deaths are as vague as showing that cancer deaths in London are related to the frequency of No. 11 buses.<lb/>
To be slightly light-hearted for a minute, in March, 1977, the <i>Sunday Times</i> warned us of the dangers of a new fire-fighting agent called "water"&#x2014;a wonderful and total extinguishing resource. Its effectiveness in dealing with fires had been thoroughly tested and proved. But what of its dangers? Despite its efficiency, we must not store it in open spaces for people might fall in. If anyone accidentally immersed his head in a three-gallon
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0744"/>
<col>1471</col>
bucket, it would prove fatal in three minutes. A reservoir might hold enough water to fill 500,000 of these buckets. If a bucket was used 100 times, there is enough water in one reservoir effectively to kill the entire population of the United Kingdom. Risks of this size should not be allowed, whatever the gain. If the water were to get out of control, the results of Flixborough or Seveso would pale into insignificance by comparison. What use was a fire-fighting agent that could kill men as well as fire?<lb/>
I do not see fluoridation as compulsory medication. It is merely a process of supplementation or adjustment of a normal constituent of most natural waters to its optimum content, from the standpoint of public health. In any organised community, some sacrifice of personal liberty for the general good is inevitable. Insistence on absolute personal liberty is compatible only with anarchy. It seems to me to be possible that some, at least, of the strength of feeling of those against fluoridation has been due to the attempts of those, such as myself, to comment on the possible dangers of fluoride in too authoritative or too derisory a manner. Authority is all very well and is, of course, necessary in what we call a free society&#x2014;by which term we mean a society in which the individual is not really free to do anything he feels inclined to do, but has to observe the restraints necessary to allow the rest of us to be free. But it is all too possible in these days, when we are already over-administered, to take authority too far, even to the extent of inciting a backlash. It seems to me that this point may well have been reached some years ago in the continuing fluoride debate.<lb/>
The ordinary citizen has become more than a little tired living in a society which is usually described as free, but which he knows all too well is not, because he has to spend a great deal of his life filling in official forms, which become more and more intrusive as the years go by, and being careful to observe all manner of regulations the purpose of which is not always clear to him. The state of mind induced by this kind of experience, which we all share, is bound to induce in some the urgent need to express themselves as opposed to yet another intrusion upon their freedom.<lb/>
<col>1472</col>
Where such a climate of opinion exists, it is really no wonder that some opposition will be of the diehard variety, and completely deaf to what those of us who are convinced of the benefit of fluoridation feel sure are reasonable arguments, such as the presence already in our water of various additives to make it wholesome as the law requires health and water authorities to supply. Their ears will also be closed to statements that we consider true, such as that fluoride in the strictly limited amounts necessary is perfectly safe.<lb/>
One of the most noticeable facets of the important and continuing debate is that, in the main, the politicians keep out of it. They know how votes can get lost. Some Members of the other place have shown that they know it, by publishing their names in this circular which we have from Thames Ditton. On the other hand, the dental and medical professions, out of true compassion for the children and adults whose teeth could be spared the purges of decay, appear sometimes to move beyond their specialised and expert permit, and to enter further into the political arena than is their place or is likely to advance their cause.<lb/>
In conclusion, I think I speak for most of my colleagues when I say how distressed we are that progress towards fluoridation has been so slow. I urge the Government to introduce legislation to compel water authorities to fluoridate our water supplies at the earliest opportunity.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02936"><member>Lord COLWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is quite correct. The fluoride in the water certainly has a beneficial effect on the formation of teeth. But it is quite possible&#x2014;and research is still going on&#x2014;that the existence of fluoride may well have some kind of inhibitive reaction on the bacteria which actually cause decay. So that I would not necessarily agree with the noble Lord's statement.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02938"><member>Lord WELLS-PESTELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the length of time that this Unstarred Question has taken, I am sure it will be of interest and pleasure to your Lordships to know that as I have to catch a particular train I shall not be speaking in this debate. There are, however, just one or two comments that I want to make. First, I should like to congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Yarborough, on his maiden speech, and of course I hope that he will not wait the same number of years before he delivers his second speech. Speaking for myself, it was rather a joy to hear my noble friend Lord Lovell-Davis again, and the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, and I hope that we shall hear them more often than we have heard them recently.<lb/>
I remember that on 12th March 1975 the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, raised a question on this matter in your Lordships' House. He drew attention to a survey which had been carried out in Anglesey. Fluoride had been introduced into the water and the survey showed conclusively that the dental health of children there was much better than the dental health of children in Bangor and Caernarvon. I mention that for one reason and one reason only.<lb/>
When I was talking to my noble friend Lord Cledwyn of Penton today, he happened to remark that at that particular time the decision to introduce fluoride into the water was taken by the county council. There seems to have been a change, either in recent months or in recent years, for it is now done by the area health authority. I was not aware of this, and I am wondering whether this ought not to be done by the elected representatives.<lb/>
I am also wondering whether the noble Lord could find time to write to me at a later stage and let me know whether this is done exculsively by the area health authorities in this country. Certainly it is not done by the health authority in Scotland because I understood the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, to say that it is done by the local councils. It seems to me that it is a decision which should be taken by them.<lb/>
The only other matter I want to raise is this. The noble Earl, Lord Yarborough, made some reference to the Department of
<col>1474</col>
Health and Social Security. I think he said that the health authority appears to have taken an entrenched position. I take "the health authority" to mean the Department of Health and Social Security. I spent some five years in the department and got to know it very well. I came away with the deepest and greatest respect for the ability and competence not only of the department generally but of the medical division in particular. If there are experts anywhere, they are to be found there. They would not have advised any Secretary of State or, for that matter, anybody else to take a particular course of action unless they were perfectly satisfied that what they were suggesting was based upon sound medical and, if I may say so, scientific evidence, because they also had on their staff a very distinguished scientist. I do not want to say anything more about that because it is terribly important that we should hear what the noble Lord the Minister is going to say by way of answer to this debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02939">7.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02940"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASH BOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry that we are going to be denied hearing a little more from the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell. However, it is getting late. I shall be as quick as I can, but I am afraid it will take me a little time. I am sure that the whole House is grateful to my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy for introducing this debate and to those who have spoken from their knowledge of this subject, with its implications for dental health and hence the general health of the whole community. I am sure that attention will be paid outside this House to the remarks of noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, especially those with expert knowledge of the subject.<lb/>
The score is 7: 2 at the moment. I imagine that the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, is on the side of those who are in favour of fluoridation. Those seven in favour would like me to be able to say that the Government will wish to legislate during their term of office. The other two would like me to say that an inquiry will be held. I am afraid that I shall not satisfy any noble Lords. However, I can tell my noble friend that the announcement of an inquiry by the Minister of State is not accurate. Ministers are continuing to encourage fluoridation and their professional advisers will continue
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0746"/>
<col>1475</col>
to examine carefully any material about fluoridation which gives adequate information on data and methods. I noticed in the newspaper today a report which said that a plan for legislation on fluoridation had now been scrapped. In point of fact, there was no plan. So these Press reports have to be very carefully looked at.<lb/>
I was asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington, whether the fund was still in existence, the fund of &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million a year. The fund is still in existence and intact. I am afraid that I am bound to be rather repetitive, but I have quite a lot to say. Much of it will answer points which have been raised by noble Lords. As to my noble friend's Question, I understand that nearly all water supplies contain some fluoride, but that in Scotland&#x2014;where he has served with distinction as Secretary of State&#x2014;some 95 per cent. of public water supplies are derived from surface water with a low fluoride content. I am advised, therefore, that it is most unlikely that there are any areas of Scotland where the optimum proportion of fluoride is present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02941"><member>Lord CAMPBELL of CROY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if my noble friend will give way, I tried to make it clear that the areas were South of the Border. There are no areas in Scotland. I mentioned some of the areas: Essex, South Shields and Hartlepool. I want to make it clear that I was not raising it in a Scottish context because it does not apply in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02942"><member>Lord CULLEN of ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that I shall be mentioning some of those, too. In England, which my noble friend has in mind, there are only a few water resources which contain naturally one part per million or more of fluoride. These are groundwater sources&#x2014;as my noble friend says, occurring mainly in Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Essex, Dorset, Derbyshire and Cleveland. With the exception of one major area, these sources are relatively minor and those which contain more than one part per million are either diluted with low fluoride water or are only used as emergency supplies. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment is not aware of any sources of supply which naturally contain the optimum level of fluoride but which
<col>1476</col>
are intentionally or unintentionally diluted to below the optimum before being put into supply or into distribution. It would, however, take a disproportionate effort to establish this for certain.<lb/>
The major area with a natural fluoride level of rather more than one part per million of fluoride is Hartlepool in Cleveland, to which I shall refer later. The water is supplied by the Hartlepool Water Company to a population of about 100,000 and the fluoride level is 1&#x00B7;3 to 1&#x00B7;4 parts per million. Although there are relatively few water supplies naturally containing the optimum level of fluoride, the better dental health of communities in areas served by such sources directed the thoughts of medical and dental research workers some 40 years ago to the possibility of devising a means of reducing the prevalence of dental decay&#x2014;one of the commonest diseases&#x2014;not merely in individuals but in the whole community.<lb/>
These workers found that the greatest dental benefit occurred when a community's drinking water naturally contained about one part of fluoride per million parts of water. In temperate climates this was therefore regarded as the optimum proportion mentioned by my noble friend. Since, as I have said, nearly all water supplies contain some fluoride, the research workers considered that similar beneficial dental effects would be obtained by adjusting to the optimum level the fluoride content of supplies deficient in it naturally. Such adjustment was termed "fluoridation". Studies which began in the United States and Canada in 1945 showed that fluoridated water in the study areas, by comparison with low-fluoride control areas, also produced the protective effect against dental decay which had been observed in the areas with a satisfactory natural level of fluoride. For the greatest protective effect, fluoridated water had to be consumed from birth during the years of tooth formation; that is, to 14 years of age.<lb/>
These results stimulated interest in this country and, on the advice of the Medical Research Council, the then British Government sent to the United States and Canada a mission consisting of dental, medical and scientific experts to study fluoridation in operation and to advise whether fluoride should be added to those
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0747"/>
<col>1477</col>
water supplies in the United Kingdom which were deficient in it naturally. The mission reported in 1953 that fluoridation was a valuable public health measure through its effect in reducing dental decay, but that in this country fluoride should be added to the water supplies of some selected communities before its general adoption was considered.<lb/>
Studies accordingly began in three areas of the United Kingdom in 1955&#x2013;56, and reports published in 1962 and 1969 on the first five and 11 years showed substantial dental benefits in children who had consumed fluoridated water from birth, compared with children of the same ages in low-fluoride control areas. My noble friend will know that a study area in Scotland, Kilmarnock, decided to cease fluoridating its water supply in 1962. I am sorry to say that by 1968 experience of dental decay in five-year-old children, having previously improved, had in consequence increased to substantially the level of the unfluoridated control town. An expert Research Committee, set up to supervise the studies, concluded in the report on the first 11 years:
<quote>"The fluoridation of water supplies at the level of a part per million of fluoride is a highly effective way of reducing dental decay".</quote>
Later studies of children brought up in fluoridated areas have confirmed the substantial benefit to their dental health compared with children in unfluoridated areas.<lb/>
The reports of the official studies and of others in the United Kingdom could examine the effects on dental health only of children, bearing in mind that fluoridation in the areas concerned had not been in progress long enough for older people to have consumed fluoridated water during their early years. Fortunately, however, the areas with about the right level of fluoride naturally in their water supply provided an opportunity to study the effect of the optimum level of fluoride in water consumed during childhood on dental health later in life.<lb/>
Studies in Hartlepool, for example, have shown substantially better dental health in adults who have lived all their lives there compared with people of the same ages in low-fluoride York. In one such study it was found that in dentate persons aged 45 and above the
<col>1478</col>
number of carious sites in teeth was 44 per cent lower in Hartlepool than it was in York. Such results disprove the suggestion that fluoridation merely delays the onset of dental decay. On the contrary, a satisfactory intake of fluoride in childhood confers protection against dental decay which persists during adult life. Experience has shown that other methods of providing an adequate intake of fluoride&#x2014;for example, fluoride tablets or drops&#x2014;are less effective than fluoridation, principally because it is difficult to ensure the necessary regular administration in all children over a period of years. However, other methods have a place in areas where the water is not yet fluoridated or where it is not feasible to do so.<lb/>
My Lords, some of you will know that some years ago the Royal College of Physicians decided, as an independent body concerned with public health, to review the evidence on the fluoridation of water supplies. A committee of the college carried out a comprehensive review and reported in 1976 that fluoride in water, added or naturally present, over the years of tooth formation substantially reduced dental caries throughout life. There was, moreover, no sound evidence at all of harm to health. One chapter of the report dealt with an alleged link with cancer and concluded that there was no evidence that fluoride increased the incidence or mortality of cancer in any organ.<lb/>
This and similar conclusions have attracted criticism notably from two United States biochemists, Drs. Burk and Yiamouyiannis, who have claimed that cancer mortality increased more in 10 American cities than it did in 10 unfluoridated cities in the same period. This claim was carefully examined by recognised cancer epidemiologists and medical statisticians in this country and North America, who have independently concluded that there is no difference in the changes in cancer mortality in the two groups of cities when appropriate corrections are made for different changes which have taken place in their age/sex/race compositions. Drs. Burk and Yiamouyiannis have since announced the results of further analyses, although without the necessary supporting evidence at certain critical points or in some cases at any point. Moreover, this material has not
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0748"/>
<col>1479</col>
appeared in the usual scientific Press, where it would have been open to assessment by other scientists.<lb/>
Dr. Burk has also re-examined data published in a 1974 paper from Oxford University about differences in cancer incidence in various organs between certain fluoridated areas and certain similar control areas, and between sets of areas with varying levels of fluoride naturally in their water supplies. I understand that differences reported in the Oxford paper could have arisen by chance and, as the author himself concluded, do not indicate an association between cancer incidence and fluoride in drinking water, whether present naturally or added artificially. It is notoriously easy to mislead by the inappropriate use of statistics. I have been advised that the persistent attempts to persuade the public by the use of figures which take no account of the demographic composition of populations under study is without justification and bound to mislead. I know that this judgment would have the widest and most vigorous support from expert epidemiologists and medical statisticians.<lb/>
Because of the allegations of Drs. Burk and Yiamouyiannis many other studies of this question have been undertaken by appropriately qualified persons and published in scientific journals of good repute. The results of none of these studies support the allegations. Furthermore, reviews by experts in this and other countries have concluded that animal and other laboratory tests do not support the view that fluoride is a carcinogen; no properly authenticated tests have supported the assertion that fluoride salts, as used in fluoridation, are a mutagenic hazard to man.<lb/>
My Lords, reference is often made to a case brought by local residents before the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to require a water authority to stop fluoridation in part of Pittsburgh and some outlying districts. The judge, sitting alone, said he was "compellingly convinced" of the plaintiffs' evidence, based largely on claims by Drs. Burk and Yiamouyiannis of a link between fluoridation and cancer. He therefore issued a preliminary decree until the court held a final hearing or until the matter was dealt with by the Pennsylvania
<col>1480</col>
Department of Environmental Resources. The court's jurisdiction is still the subject of an appeal, but meanwhile the Department of Environmental Resources, having considered the evidence given to the court, has directed that the water authority should continue to fluoridate. Fluoridation also continues in the rest of Pittsburgh, where it began in 1952. The case has therefore had little local effect, and the implications claimed for it are not convincing.<lb/>
A commission appointed by the Governor of Minnesota also considered the claims of a link with cancer, including the evidence given in the Allegheny court. The commission issued a report last February concluding that claims of carcinogenic and other adverse health effects&#x2014;
<quote>"were not supported by the preponderence of available scientific data".</quote>
More recently still, a working party of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has reviewed the evidence available up to mid-1979 on possible adverse effects of fluoridation. The working party summarised its conclusions as follows:
<quote>"The evidence suggesting various adverse effects, and in particular the recently much published allegations that fluoridation leads to an increase in cancer mortality, does not stand up to scientific scrutiny".</quote>
It is perfectly apparent that there is an overwhelming weight of evidence and of properly qualified scientific judgment that fluoridation is not a cause of cancer and is safe.<lb/>
My Lords, on behalf of my right honourable friends the Health Ministers I must emphasise that the Government's professional advisers will continue to examine in the normal way the whole question of fluoridation. However, I hope my remarks have shown that there is no good reason to disturb the conclusion of the Royal College of Physicians and others that there is no evidence that the measure is associated with any harmful effect.<lb/>
Noble Lords may have heard that the Quebec Government has declared a moratorium on fluoridation. I understand that this consists of the suspension by the present Quebec Government of the previous Government's measure to require all municipalities in the Province to fluoridate their drinking water, as distinct
<image src="S5LV0402P0I0749"/>
<col>1481</col>
from the general position of encouragement of fluoridation by the Federal Government, while leaving the decision to individual municipalities. I gather that some Quebec municipalities, representing about 14 per cent. of the urban population, are continuing to fluoridate, and that about 46 per cent., which is about 8 million people, of the total urban population of Canada now receives fluoridated water.<lb/>
We and the Republic of Ireland are at present the only EEC countries with fluoridation, and the reasons why the process is not more popular in Continental Europe are not entirely clear. I understand that comparable studies to our own were undertaken in the Netherlands with comparable results, but that fluoridation had to be discontinued because of a Supreme Court ruling that a separate unfluoridated water supply should be provided for those who wished to have it, This, of course, was technically impracticable. The measure continues on a substantial scale in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, I should like to assure my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy and others that the Government, like their predecessors of both main parties for many years, continue to support the fluoridation of water supplies as a valuable preventive health measure. Our support stems from the results of our own properly controlled studies which have been endorsed by reports from independent workers and from medical and dental organisations, both here and abroad. We will, of course, continue to consider carefully any propely supported contrary claims which may be made. My honourable friend the Minister of Health will, I am sure, read with great interest the speeches made by your Lordships today. The Government will, however, be considering the recommendations of the Royal Commission on this, together with many other issues.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS: INTERVIEW TIMES IN DACCA</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02967"><member>Lord AVEBURY</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02968">Why all applicants attending for interviews in connection with settlement applications at the British High Commission in Dacca, Bangladesh, are required to attend at 7.30 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02969"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member>: Between 10 and 20 per cent. of the families invited to attend for interview fail to turn up. It is not possible to allocate families to each interviewing officer until those present have been identified; and the length of each interview varies considerably. All applicants are therefore asked to arrive early on the day of their appointment.</p>

<title>IMMIGRATION: INSTRUCTIONS ON MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS</title>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02977">What instructions were given to the medical adviser to the British High Commission in Dacca following the British Medical Association's Annual Representative Meeting's decision of 26th June 1979&#x2014;
<quote>"that this Association considers that medical examination to determine virginity and radiological examinations carried out solely for administrative and political purposes are unethical and instructs Council (<i>a</i>) to convey this view to the General Medical Council and (<i>b</i>) to make the strongest possible representations to the Government to ban these practices",</quote>
and on what date these instructions came into effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02978"><member>Lord CARRINGTON</member>: No instructions were issued following this meeting. These matters seem to be within the scope of the inquiry being conducted by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Security, in connection with the review of medical examinations in the context of immigration control, the findings of which will be announced to Parliament in due course.</p>

<p id="S5LV0402P0-02989">On what basis the cost of providing special police protection on the occasion of the National Front conference at Great Yarmouth on the 26th and 27th October, is divided between the central Government, the county of

Norfolk and other counties as providing contingents of police to make up the required strength.</p>
<p id="S5LV0402P0-02990"><member>Lord BELSTEAD</member>: Where one police force assists another, the charge to be raised against the assisted force is a matter for agreement between the two police authorities concerned. The cost of this operation is therefore essentially a charge on the county of Norfolk police fund, assisted by central Government grant on the usual basis.</p>
