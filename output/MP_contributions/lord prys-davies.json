["<cs> my lords i can quite truly say that it is with no small degree of awe that i rise to address this distinguished house for the first time <e> <s> i am the more diffident in that i am intervening in a debate to which so many of your lordships have so much to contribute and i have so little <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm whether or not the secretaries of state for wales and scotland are to establish a team for their respective countries parallel to this management inquiry team <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i must declare an interest in the paper whether it be green or black because my firm has been associated with the national union of mineworkers south wales area and its predecessor the south wales miners federation since the latter was founded in about <e> <s> but being in a frank frame of mind i would assure the house that personally i have not been involved with the union for the last years <e> <s> as we have heard this afternoon the national union of mineworkers is scrupulous in the manner in which ballots are held and in the manner in which the decisions are accepted <e> <s> however i am sure that the national union of mineworkers will have some special interest in this paper but i speak for myself <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully adopt the arguments which have been canvassed by my noble friend i find that i am in difficulty with clause <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all particularly grateful to the noble lord lord harvington for having given us the opportunity of debating the problems of the deaf <e> <s> the noble lord puts the figure at million people the royal commission puts it lower at between million and million people and from some to children and their families <e> <s> they are people who are in isolation who no longer hear the ticking of the clock or the song of the birds <e> <s> my reading has taken me back to two basic documents the report of the sub-committee on <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a major challenge to follow the noble lord lord goodman but i shall do my best <e> <s> my complaints against the bill are threefold <e> <s> first it extends the right to buy to tenants of charitable housing associations and the house has rightly been very preoccupied with clause <e> <s> secondly it extends the concept of shared ownership which after no more than eight years is still an untried concept <e> <s> thirdly it offers self-regulation in place of regulation by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> this particular clause has also given me some difficulty <e> <s> as i understand it by virtue of the act the secretary of state already enjoys the power to intervene when he considers that a tenant is having difficulty in exercising his right to buy effectively and expeditiously <e> <s> those are considerable powers and i can assure your lordships that many owners of leasehold dwellinghouses who are qualified to purchase the freehold reversions of their homes under the act would wish that the secretary of state had a similar power to intervene on their behalf when they are having difficulty in purchasing the freehold reversion expeditiously and effectively <e>", "<cs> yes my noble friend <e> <s> we consider it an unreasonable demand <e> <s> the position of the staff will be intolerable if they are bound to comply with the notice from the secretary of state in breach of their instructions from their employers <e> <s> therefore we have a real conflict between their loyalty to their employers whom they serve and their loyalty to the requirements of the state and it would be unreasonable to put officers in such a position <e> <s> we are also concerned about the electorate and their elected representatives who seem to be having their job taken from them <e> <s> therefore the tendency enshrined in this proviso drives a wedge between officers and councils <e>", "<cs> i asked specifically that the secretary of state should establish that he has a case to demand this additional power <e> <s> the minister has not replied to that question <e> <s> as i understand from the comments of the minister when he spoke to an earlier amendment the secretary of state has been asked to intervene on only two occasions <e> <s> we have heard of thousands of houses which have been sold since but he has had to intervene on only two occasions <e> <s> are those the grounds upon which he requires the additional powers because he has had to intervene on two occasions in the matter of the sales of some thousands of houses <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this probing amendment of the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> it seems to me that we need an explanation as to whether the landlord is holding the deposit as a stakeholder and whether if the transaction does not proceed the deposit plus the interest will be repayable to the tenant or if the transfer is completed whether the interest which would have been earned over two years will be applied in part reduction of the purchase price <e> <s> that is the question that has been put and i shall be interested to hear the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i value the essays very much because they have identified in an objective sense the problems which face all the health care systems be they private or public and they have established in an objective way that the major problems are common to all health systems <e> <s> those problems are efficiency escalating costs limited resources an unequal distribution of services which favours the better off and some groups and regions at the expense of others and unlimited demands from the medical profession and from the public <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to be able to support the amendment for the good reasons advanced by my noble friend <e> <s> as the subsection stands an admixture of bodies will be designated by the secretary of state as approving bodies <e> <s> as my noble friend has remarked the snag is that their standards rules and criteria differ <e> <s> the various bodies representing different specialties and different disciplines could designate persons whose standards are not comparable <e> <s> this leads us to the conclusion that a single body drawing upon the expertise of all the appropriate professions should be set up to designate the approved inspectors <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made a very valuable point and i must confess that i had missed it <e> <s> who is empowered to take away the powers from the approved inspector <e> <s> i should have thought that he who gives the powers can also take the powers away <e> <s> if the body mentioned in clause <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord swinfen said <e> <s> i should have thought that there is a great deal of common ground between what we are saying on this side of the committee and what he has just said <e> <s> from listening to the noble lord the conclusion that i have reached is that there is an interdependency of the specialities <e> <s> if that is so that should be reflected in the designating body <e> <s> we are asking for all the disciplines to be represented on this body <e>", "<cs> i would very much like to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that time after time in this bill we are in grey areas <e> <s> under the existing law we are on pretty firm ground <e> <s> the rules have been built up over the years <e> <s> now we are moving forward into uncertainty and to uncertain ground <e> <s> i should have thought that in the conditions envisaged in clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord the minister to deal with the three scenarios which i mentioned first that in or years time it becomes necessary to demolish the building or in to years time a defect emerges <e> <s> where will one find the plans of the building in or years time <e> <s> there is no provision anywhere in the bill that the plan will be deposited at a permanent registry so where does one go in or years time in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i had a feeling that the noble lord the minister had a great deal of sympathy for the case but obviously sympathy is no substitute for acceptance <e> <s> we have a duty to the future and i have a feeling that if we go along without the detailed plans then we are stoking up a great deal of trouble for the future <e> <s> therefore i think i must press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give positive support to the bill which has been introduced by the noble baroness lady faithful because i am satisfied that the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are again grateful to the noble baroness lady faithfull for her continuing contributions in this field <e> <s> in response to her initiative it is good to return to this difficult subject albeit a small subject <e> <s> in the debate on th may i ventured to express the view that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to ask for the forgiveness of the house should i have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i have to keep an appointment early tomorrow morning and so i have to be back in south wales at a reasonable hour of the night <e> <s> the transition from school to work those are the words used by my noble friend lord blease is a vital and difficult period in any young persons life and it is doubly difficult if his society is also in course of transition at that time <e> <s> we have to accept that there have been changes and that there are continuing changes in the traditional pattern of employment and training that we have grown to know and to accept <e> <s> with the advance of technology time after time the <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the minister and obviously i shall have to read very carefully in the official record what he said <e> <s> principle speaks very clearly of personal data being obtained <e> <s> i do not see anywhere in the provisions of the bill a reference to the collection of data <e> <s> indeed can we have any data before it has been collected <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask two questions of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he speaks of the national interpretation of the principles <e> <s> first does the convention itself include an interpretation section <e> <s> secondly when national parliaments have adopted the principles have they also included in the legislation an interpretation clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome funds becoming available from a building society for the kind of project that the minister has in mind <e> <s> but can the noble lord also say whether funds will also become available from the building societies to assist first-time buyers to buy old terraced cottages in the old industrial valleys cottages with outside toilets for which it is extremely difficult for first-time buyers to obtain a building society advance <e> <s> will facilities be available from the building societies to assist such borrowers to buy such properties <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and fascinating debate which has inevitably concentrated on clauses and <e> <s> may i first hasten to pay my tribute to the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe on his maiden speech <e> <s> we know of his distinguished public service <e> <s> that is appreciated on all sides of the house <e> <s> we thank him for a thoughtful speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i was making the point that the consultation had been too restricted to the cla and nfu <e> <s> it may be that within the nfu the consultation went from presidential level to the grass roots but the basic point that i was making was that it was too restricted <e>", "<cs> my lords i was speaking of the century not of the last four years <e> <s> the point which has been made by speaker after speaker has been primarily because of the operation of fiscal policies by successive governments <e> <s> we on these benches value the right given to a qualified person to claim succession <e> <s> it was introduced by a labour government in and we stand by that principle a principle which is as true and valid today as it was in <e> <s> there is no reason why we should give way on this principle <e> <s> good husbandry of the soil is not something built up over a few years of activity <e> <s> it requires the patient activity of generations long-term investment to put heart into the soil <e> <s> that is why we think it important to the economy and to the rural scene of england and wales that tenant farmers who put their energies and capital into the land should be encouraged to do so in the sure knowledge that only in very special circumstances can their families who have also farmed the land lose their occupancy of the farm <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service gives service to man when he is at his most vulnerable <e> <s> i fear that i may not be in my place when my noble friend lord molloy and the noble lord the minister come to wind up this debate <e> <s> i have to return to south wales to keep an appointment tomorrow morning and i apologise to my noble friend to the minister and to the house <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the house welcome the movement away from the open market <e> <s> i am not so sure that the criticism which has been levelled at clause is always right <e> <s> i acknowledge that difficulties will always arise when one attempts to codify in too much detail the guidance to be given to the arbitrator <e> <s> on the one hand there is value in detail it makes for certainty but on the other hand it can make for inflexibility <e> <s> as the noble earl lord caithness said one cannot always legislate in ones code for all positions <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the last speaker that the words open market must find their way out of the clause <e> <s> i should very much like to pay my respects to the wording offered by the noble lord lord renton subject to the words open market being deleted from the clause <e> <s> it could give us a formula which would be fair to landlord and tenant and i agree very much with the noble lord lord stanley that it must be seen to be fair to both parties <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl lord caithness a question <e> <s> perhaps only a particular occupier possessing certain special skills and possessing a holding in the area can turn the potentiality to account <e> <s> because this individual has the special skills which will enable him to turn the potentiality to account does the amendment mean that he has to pay an additional rent <e>", "<cs> i would have thought that although we are comparing a hill farm with a hill farm or a lowland farm with a lowland farm the rents do vary up and down the country for the same type of holding <e> <s> nevertheless i will not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a matter of interest there come to mind further uses of the term scarcity in various legislation <e> <s> there is reference to substantial scarcity of accommodation in the rent acts <e> <s> in the act on rating we have marked scarcity <e> <s> here for the first time we have appreciable scarcity <e> <s> i shall not press the point any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find myself very much in support of what the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> says <e> <s> the amendment contemplates that the surplus can he divided between the landlord and the tenant in accordance with a pre-determined formula <e> <s> experience shows that that is not the case <e> <s> a pre-determined formula should not be allowed to govern the distribution of the surplus <e> <s> what is required is not a fixed pre-determined formula but a conclusion that is fair as between landlord and tenant having regard to their circumstances and their individual effort <e>", "<cs> we very much agree with the minister that this is a severe amendment <e> <s> we believe that it is retrospective <e> <s> since many tenants have relied on the act and they have acted on the strength of its provisions <e> <s> moreover being induced by the expectation that an eligible member of his family will probably succeed to the tenancy a tenant may have embarked in good faith on liabilities and altered his position by borrowing or by expenditure on his farm <e> <s> therefore we submit that since the act has created in a tenants mind the expectation that a member of his family would succeed to the tenancy on his death technically parliament should not allow that expectation to be defeated <e> <s> if this amendment were carried it would allow that expectation to be defeated <e>", "<cs> what i said was that induced by the expectation it is probable or likely that the tenant will have embarked upon liabilities and expenditure and indeed will have continued to farm <e>", "<cs> there have been so many hunches <e> <s> when i asked ministers for evidence that section has produced ill effects i was told that there was no firm evidence there was no comprehensive assessment of the ill effects of the act <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord john-mackie will be able to rely on his own experience in the farming community and produce evidence where tenants have incurred liabilities on the expectation that they would have the benefit of the act <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is no <e> <s> the act was not meant to be an experimental act it was not meant to be a temporary act it was meant to be long-standing <e>", "<cs> we on these benches cannot bring ourselves to advocate compulsory retirement but we see considerable merit in our amendment no <e> <s> in the amendment of the noble lord lord northfield and in the amendment which is before the committee <e> <s> we reject the principle of compulsory retirement because that would cause hardship <e> <s> if we were to single out for retirement a farmer who is conducting his own business that would be the only example of a self-employed person being compelled to retire <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i fully understand the significance of all the amendments but for that i blame myself rather than my noble friends drafting <e> <s> certainly one goes along with any amendment that will help to clarify the law and make clear that which is unclear <e>", "<cs> i have one question for the noble viscount <e> <s> i followed his argument with a great deal of interest but what becomes of the smallholdings tenant if he receives a notice to quit between the seventh and tenth years and he is without an alternative tenancy <e>", "<cs> i am in sympathy with the ministers response <e> <s> we are all in favour of encouraging retirement but compulsory retirement as a deliberate act of policy is very much another matter <e> <s> certainly compulsory retirement should not be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has given the house a full explanation of the major provisions of the draft order which is now before us <e> <s> we understand that there have been consultations with the institutions in northern ireland including the citizens advice bureaux which will be affected by the order and that in general they welcome it <e> <s> we on these benches think it is important that we should see the problem as it is perceived in northern ireland and the fact that the order is acceptable to such organisations is in itself a good reason for approving its terms <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since the s the case for regional investment in an area such as south wales has always rested on an admixture of economic and social reasons <e> <s> indeed the steel plant was located in ebbw vale in the s primarily for social reasons <e> <s> but south wales is

pay proper regard to social considerations as well as economic considerations and secondly that the government accept that they have a continuing <e>", "<cs> i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord howard for not being in my place when he began his arguments in support of his amendment <e> <s> i understand that the national farmers union is uneasy about the amendment fearing that it may be a recipe for unnecessary litigation and expense <e> <s> on the other hand the resolving of a dispute between landlord and tenant as to the rent payable by referring the dispute to arbitration does of course deprive the citizen of his common law right of access to the courts <e> <s> we should be clear about that <e> <s> it is therefore arguable that there should be a right of appeal to another source of authority such as the lands tribunal an authority which has the confidence of the farming community <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the noble lord lord renton speaking in support of his amendment <e> <s> under the existing legislation that is section of the act the minister is empowered to make rules for expediting or reducing the costs of proceedings and arbitrations full stop <e> <s> that is as far as we go <e> <s> when i first read the amendment i thought that it was a fairly sweeping amendment that it gives to the lord chancellor by order the authority to make rules for the conduct of arbitrations <e> <s> i was in some difficulty in defining the phrase conduct of arbitrations but the noble lord lord renton has helped the committee considerably <e>", "<cs> on this occasion we are unable to support the noble earls amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl has conceded this amendment echoes the opting out provisions contained in the landlord and tenant act relating to business tenancies but we cannot compare an agricultural tenancy with a business tenancy <e> <s> we are not comparing like with like <e> <s> with a business tenancy which was provided for by the relevant section in the act as amended the parties have in mind a short-term tenancy <e> <s> it may be a weekly tenancy a monthly tenancy or a quarterly tenancy but it is the firm intention of the parties that the tenancy shall not exceed a period of six months <e> <s> they have in mind <e> <s> in general a short-term tenancy <e>", "<cs> almost all speakers in these debates which have extended over many days agree enthusiastically that it is in the long-term interests of the industry and of the country that there should be a substantial let sector <e> <s> we have been reminded that the northfield committee recommended that it should amount to per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of the total agricultural area <e> <s> what has also become clear is that the agricultural case for preserving the let sector merges into the social argument <e>", "<cs> may i just get one point clear <e> <s> is the noble viscount saying that because there are difficulties in drawing up a licence for a five-year duration that the legislation ought to provide for a fixed-term tenancy of up to five years because that would get around the technical difficulties of drafting a licence <e>", "<cs> so the tenancy for a fixed term of five years drawn under this section would be deprived of any protection given by the agricultural holdings act <e>", "<cs> in the sense presumably that he will have occupation of that land as a tenant for five years and that will be indisputable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a very brief question <e> <s> can the minister inform the house whether the government intend to make a similar statement in respect of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords we are proud of the state education system in this country <e> <s> in the past education was for many of us the way out of an inheritance and environment of poverty and a <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the question that was addressed to the noble lord by the noble baroness lady nicol <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether there is evidence of undue delay in the hearing of cases before magistrates courts <e> <s> if so it would be a cause for concern because justice delayed is

brompton gave me about months ago when i became a member of your lordships house <e> <s> although i very much appreciate the historical references in his speech i regret that on this occasion i am unable to accept the guidance which he has tendered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a question <e> <s> can the noble earl say whether the expenditure at bronydd mawr over the next year and the following year is of a capital nature and non-recurrent <e>", "<cs> my lords it appeared to me that the noble earl was setting off the expenditure at bronydd mawr against the revenue cuts at the welsh plant breeding station aberystwyth <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear to me that the new scientific posts at bronydd mawr will amount to two or at most four whereas at the welsh plant

committee <e> <s> however we were right to return to the principle embodied in this amendment and i say that for two reasons <e> <s> the noble lord lord middleton has hinted at one of them <e> <s>

is agriculture but it touches according to my rough count on about two dozen agricultural subjects <e> <s> it is important for northern ireland because it is the largest single industry in the province <e> <s> that province has its own crop of problems in this field <e> <s> i am particularly pleased that this order has been discussed by the agriculture committee of the assembly <e> <s> the assembly received written evidence it heard oral evidence and the report of the committee was accepted by the assembly without amendment <e> <s> so on behalf of these benches let me say that we see here the northern ireland assembly at work <e> <s> this really is an excellent example of the assembly at work and a justification for its existence <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord the minister has given a full explanation of the order before the house <e> <s> it has again a single theme fines but it has required paragraphs and schedules to cover the ground <e> <s> we agree with the minister that the fine is an important penalty <e> <s> it is imposed i believe on about half the offenders sentenced for indictable offences in the magistrates courts and it is imposed on the great majority of those sentenced for summary offences <e> <s> therefore as the noble lord has said the fine should not be undermined by inflation so that it becomes no more than a token payment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that information and for the assurance <e> <s> however on th march the scottish research institute advertised externally for a scientific officer to work on chemical evaluation of the brassicae belonging to the cabbage family and the brassica breeding material programme although that post had not been advertised within the service since the budget-led cuts were announced in december last <e> <s> secondly the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this post was advertised externally to the service although it had not been advertised within the service <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is very difficult to justify a policy which de-commissions a programme at one research institute with consequential redundancy while another research institute considers that very programme warrants a sufficient degree of priority to cause them to advertise and recruit externally <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise to the minister for the fact that i was not in the house <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment and i will be brief <e> <s> the standards of dispensing in this country are high <e> <s> they are high because the dispensing optician has been well trained <e> <s> last year there were students who sat the final dispensing examination of the association of dispensing opticians <e> <s> of the only passed and failed <e> <s> if this bill is passed the who failed can next year dispense glasses on the open market <e> <s> to allow that to happen in the case of those who have failed to equip themselves with the necessary skill and knowledge will lead inevitably to the lowering of standards and that would be a retrograde step <e> <s> that is why i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much wish to support this amendment in the name of the noble lord lord cullen and my noble friend lord ennals <e> <s> the government will be aware of the considerable unease about the possible adverse effects of this legislation and of the risks which are inherent in the position <e> <s> therefore the lack of a reference in the bill to any monitoring system is worrying <e>", "<cs> the minister has referred to the protection available under the sale of goods act <e> <s> i made two criticisms of the provisions of that act first that it was slow moving and secondly that it was expensive <e> <s> the litigant would have to call expert evidence and that too would be expensive <e> <s> has the minister received advice from the department about how long it would take to take proceedings under that act and what would be the cost <e> <s> my fear that it is a totally unreal solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> i am particularly interested in the ministers reply to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the fpc will be a constituent part of the nhs <e> <s> it should follow that we should have one universal complaints procedure which will apply throughout the nhs in every part of the country to every constituent part of the nhs and to every complaint which arises within the nhs whether it arises in the surgery in the health center or in the hospital <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has galloped through that brief <e> <s> we really need time to consider its contents <e> <s> it seems to me that first of all he is acknowledging that the government are not contending that the gp services have suffered under the existing system <e> <s> he is it seems content to acknowledge that they have not suffered and i should have thought it necessary to leave well alone <e> <s> then the minister acknowledges that the aim of the bill is to ensure budgetary and manpower control <e> <s> he is convincing on that point <e> <s> so far as i know this is the first time i have heard specific reference to cash limiting the service to the expected savings on the fpc service but i am sure that that is the principal aim of clause <e> <s> that will have grave implications for the fps which has been geared to meet the oncoming demand <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his response and explanation <e> <s> as to the second part of the amendment the noble lords comments are acceptable but we shall need to read carefully his remarks in respect of the first part <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord ennals because at least half of the members will be representatives of the skilled groups <e> <s> they will represent the point of view of their particular interest <e> <s> within those skilled groups the dominating section will be the medical profession <e> <s> if the medical group can carry the support of the other skilled groups they will control the workings of the fpcs <e> <s> that is why there is a strong feeling i have been approached about it that in those circumstances the chairman should not come from a skilled group <e> <s> he should not be a representative of a skilled group and should he seen to represent the community for which the service exists <e> <s> this is almost a piece of syndicalism as it is <e> <s> the chairman ought to have an unbiased approach and he able to offer judgment and qualities of leadership <e> <s> i reinforce the point made by my noble friend lord ennals <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock and to the noble baroness lady cox for their support of the principle which i tried to express in this amendment <e> <s> i accept that it is very imperfectly worded and will take it back and have consultations <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister is really withdrawing from his first position <e> <s> his first position was that they will become members of the committee by administrative action <e> <s> but he now says that he hopes that they will become members of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew my noble friend lord fitt long before i had met him <e> <s> his reputation had gone before him <e> <s> i admired him for his strength and his fortitude <e> <s> obviously the house must listen very carefully to what he has to say <e> <s> he belongs to that community and he has experienced the chaos of that community and therefore we must listen carefully to what he has to say <e>", "<cs> that is a disappointing response if i may say so <e> <s> the noble earl said that there is no good reason why the chcs should not be given this authority <e> <s> in the hospital service the chcs are expected to visit hospitals in order to do their job properly in terms of reporting on conditions which they see within the hospital service <e> <s> they report on what their eyes have seen and their ears have heard <e> <s> this is a job which they do very well for the benefit of the hospitals and of the patients <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to reinforce the point that has been made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> if officers are to be encouraged to develop their skills within the national health service they should be encouraged to move through the entire organisation <e> <s> that is almost a prerequisite for developing effective service managers <e> <s> that seems to me the positive argument for this amendment which would make that possible <e>", "<cs> will the minister explain and identify the group of employees who would be at a disadvantage if the benefit of the individual employment laws as to continuity of employment was to be extended to the national health service <e> <s> which group would be disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> does not the act extend its provisions as to continuity of employment to local authorities <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord ennals is unable to stay for the end of todays proceedings and <e>", "<cs> again i should like to support the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> our attention has been drawn to the fact that the experience of the industrial and war disablement assessment shows that those suffering from chronic mental illness tend to get a very low percentage assessment <e> <s> that may suggest that the process of assessment is inappropriate and inadequate

per cent <e> <s> of the total cases <e>", "<cs> one does not require a great deal of foresight to see that in practice the test of per cent <e> <s> is likely to be felt to be unjust by a large number of disabled people <e> <s> we are really building up problems for the future <e> <s> i was impressed by a number of the questions asked by one of the organisations for the disabled relative to the application of the per cent <e> <s> test <e> <s> that organisation asked whether one can measure with any degree of accuracy the loss of faculty suffered by people with congenital handicaps such as the mentally handicapped <e> <s> that was one of the questions <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord wells-pestell drew on the evidence of the last decade <e>", "<cs> my lords the house as well as the disturbed or dangerous mentally disordered offender and possibly the non-offender who could benefit from psychiatric treatment in hospital owe a debt of gratitude to the noble earl lord longford

speaker <e> <s> we believe that concern to be well-founded <e>", "<cs> my lords on the th july when the house debated the northern ireland act interim period extension order my noble friend lord underhill anticipating the evening when this very lengthy diverse and complex order would come before your lordships house once again voiced criticism of procedures of government which rely on orders-in-council which are not exposed to detailed scrutiny and which are unamendable <e> <s> indeed this is the essential criticism which is constantly levelled against the use of orders-in-council

posed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to speak on behalf of these benches except to congratulate the noble marquess lord reading on his distinguished and forceful contribution <e> <s> i have been asked by my noble friend lord ennals to apologise to the house for his absence but he is obliged to keep another appointment <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would not claim that i have

minister for explaining the order to the house <e> <s> we feel sure that it will be a significant contribution to consumer protection in northern ireland and for that reason we are delighted to

interest in the province where the voice of the consumer is silent <e> <s> but all that will change <e> <s> the independent advisory group under the chairmanship of professor colin campbell reviewed

report even though we have a majority and a minority report <e> <s> it is undeniably easy to be negative about any northern ireland constitutional issue <e> <s> in fact it is the message of the last decade <e> <s> that is possibly because in northern ireland we are dealing not with a nation with a traditional sense of unity but with an artificially created province containing opposing forces <e>

wide-ranging reviews since the beveridge report of years ago <e> <s> but they have also been described as being far removed from the beveridge report <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make one or two very brief comments in support of the amendment which has been so ably moved by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> my noble and learned friend referred to the principle of equal validity of the two languages in the courts of wales a principle enshrined in the welsh language act <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor himself declared in your lordships house on

qualified wife of a general practitioner be employed by him to meet the need upon the same terms as any other person who may be employed to meet that need <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate this evening has been significant on at least two counts <e> <s> first it has been prompted by the noble lord lord henderson who speaks with the authority and independence of the cross-benches <e> <s> it is

am allowed to speak a second time <e> <s> i understand that i am and so perhaps i should say that we heard at committee stage and we have heard again today that an insistence on the recruitment of

quality <e> <s> all i wish to say is that i doubt very much whether that would be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that my noble friend lord underhill is not in his usual place this

government elections in northern ireland <e> <s> i shall be brief <e> <s> my message is that the opposition welcome the order <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for explaining clearly the main purpose of the order <e> <s> i have read the recent reports of the northern ireland standing advisory commission on human rights <e> <s> i note that some of its suggestions have been incorporated in

at once that i am grateful and i am sure that many people outside the house will also feel grateful to my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for asking this question tonight on an important subject a subject which could flare up overnight and one which is a cause of concern for many people <e> <s> if i may say so i thought that his speech showed not only his background knowledge of the subject and his grasp of detailed evidence but also his deep concern that there should be in the country a body of persons who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the criminal courts <e> <s> this concern of my noble friend has emerged in three questions which he has addressed to ministers during the past two months <e> <s> my noble friend is saying that the position is unsatisfactory and he therefore calls on the government to <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been told that this is a bill to amend one of the articles of the road races northern ireland order <e> <s> it is a modest bill <e> <s> it is not a supercharged bill but it may be better for not belonging to that category <e> <s> it often seems to me that in the midst of the draconian and alien emergency legislation and the lawlessness of the

same for his lens to meet his requirements whether it be a simple lens or a complex lens <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord longford in a strong and powerful speech has drawn the attention of

for sectors of the public in both the catholic and protestant communities of northern ireland <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is right to bring the matter before the house and we are immensely

anyone else outside the security forces how the system is working <e> <s> i believe that his report will soon be a work of reference <e>", "<cs> i would not wish it to be thought that the noble lord lord nugent was the sole voice on this issue <e> <s> he has dealt very forcefully with the technical arguments <e> <s> the point i would wish to make is that if the decision whether or not to introduce fluoridation is to be vested either in the health authority or in the water authority then it should be entrusted to the health authority for the reasons which the noble lord has given in

way clear to accepting the principle of this amendment <e> <s> that would be some evidence that the government are prepared to act in full understanding of the unease which has been expressed <e> <s> the wording of this amendment may not be correct but unless the government can assure the committee that there is already in the dhss effective monitoring machinery then they ought to act in full understanding of the publics unease and go along with the principle behind this amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like very much to support the amendment <e> <s> it is a simple improvement and i hope that it will be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that if a person establishes as a fact that he has suffered ill health as a consequence of drinking fluoridated water he will automatically be paid damages or will he have to go to the court and establish that the health authority was negligent <e> <s> the force of this amendment is that he ought to receive compensation

consultations with the local authorities and the public <e> <s> we suggest that there should be thorough consultation before the authority decides on balance that it should apply for fluoridation <e>

be urgent action taken to outlaw commercial surrogacy <e>", "<cs> although this amendment is moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning and has the support of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies i find that i am persuaded by the arguments of the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord for the amendment but i fear that it is too widely drawn at least at this stage <e> <s> we agree that all aspects of commercial surrogacy should be unenforceable at law that they should not be converted into a contract enforceable by the courts <e> <s> but i am not so sure that every feature of non-commercial surrogacy should be outside the law of contract <e>", "<cs> i wish to adopt all the arguments advanced by the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> the minister has indicated to the committee time and again that the object of the bill is narrow and that it is primarily aimed at the commercial agencies and at the risks of exploitation of women and of commissioning parents by agencies <e> <s> it appears to me that it would be very harsh if the mother and the commissioning parents were also punished for being the victims of exploitation <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the penalty provided in the bill is too lenient <e> <s> it does not reflect the gravity of the offence <e> <s> it is not likely to hurt the defendant financially especially as this is an offence where the offender has profited by its commission <e> <s> it will not help to make it a really effective penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the minister in welcoming my noble friend lord underhill back to his seat in the house <e> <s> no one is more pleased than myself to see him back by my side <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i was drawing that conclusion <e> <s> it appeared to me that with the power-sharing executive there was not this recognition of the fundamental irish identity <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the government for this bill <e> <s> henceforth it will be a criminal offence to operate a commercial surrogacy agency and as the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies has very clearly pointed out it will be an offence to advertise any surrogacy service <e> <s> these are important developments which have been supported by all those who have spoken in the debates at second reading and in committee and which have indeed been acknowledged by the noble lord lord denning this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords northern ireland has lived with emergency legislation for a long time <e> <s> i well recall my noble friend lord fitt telling the house that throughout his lifetime in northern ireland he had lived under emergency legislation <e> <s> i thought that a fairly sobering and revealing observation <e> <s> thus this debate on the renewal of the present emergency legislation is obviously not without precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords with this order we sail into a religious haven we hope <e> <s> however the amount of the fund allotted under the order is very small <e> <s> that must be obvious to all of us <e> <s> as demand is likely to be great the funds are likely to be inadequate <e> <s> even though the money will be spent on a religious building it will not work miracles <e> <s> we do not therefore expect results overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has illustrated that this order covers a wide range of activities to be exercised by local authorities in northern ireland <e> <s> it contains an admixture of powers for the well-being of the community <e> <s> they deal with entertainment licences gipsy sites bus shelters powers of auditors voting procedures burial grounds and crematoria payments for deceased officers of councils and so on to name but a few <e>", "<cs> my lords we are particularly grateful to the minister for that interesting review of the credit union movement the principal features of the movement and its history <e> <s> we are also particularly grateful for the detailed explanation of the various provisions of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble and learned lord the chancellor for reviewing the effect of the amendments which appear complicated and which were passed in the other place <e> <s> the amendments strengthen the bill <e> <s> we wish that it had been possible by a suitable amendment to ensure that the custody orders obtained in scotland would be enforceable in england wales and northern ireland and vice versa <e> <s> their non-enforceability was described by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones on

ireland <e> <s> many people believe very strongly that this should not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords this lengthy order of articles has been described by ministers in another place as one of the most significant pieces of legislation in social policy to be produced for a number of years and which will influence social policy up to the end of the century and into the next <e> <s> some may say that if that be a true description of the order it is a sad commentary on social policy in the province <e> <s> the underlying philosophy is clear enough it is the philosophy of the royal commission on gambling which reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are happy to support the provisions of this order which are similar although not identical and i would wish to emphasise that point with the relevant provisions to be found in statutory instrument no <e> <s> which applies to england and wales <e> <s> the order extends the act to include nursing homes used for treatment by a specially controlled technique <e> <s> those are the words used in the order <e> <s> the order goes on to define the meaning of the phrase used <e> <s> by this phrase as used in this order there is meant a <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord ennals for his comprehensive survey of the state of the nhs <e> <s> i was very impressed by his speech which was constructed without the aid of a special adviser or a research assistant <e> <s> it demonstrated the contacts that he has with the people who are at work in the nhs <e> <s> therefore it appears to me that where my noble friend lord ennals gives a warning to the government or alerts the government to a risk they should take note of his message <e>", "<cs> my lords with these regulations the noble baroness arrives in calmer waters <e> <s> the regulations are indeed straightforward and are approved by the general dental council and the representatives of the dental auxiliaries on that council also go along with them <e> <s> even now under the new provisions the charges will probably be far cheaper than the cost of maintaining the register and therefore we go along with and support the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is but it has always been an uphill struggle to achieve political consensus in or about ireland in or about northern ireland <e> <s> for centuries this has been an elusive goal <e> <s> i think we will all agree that to seek to make political progress in the province is a goal which is worth struggling for <e> <s> my noble friend lord cledwyn has handsomely acknowledged the courage of the government and of dr fitzgerald in working towards a practical arrangement which could be beneficial to both communities in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for introducing todays debate and for initiating the debate on this complex area of policy <e> <s> it has given the house an opportunity to acknowledge advancement where there has been advancement and also to give expression to troubled reflections or as the right reverend prelate the bishop of saint albans said to give expression to our anxieties <e> <s> i should also like to thank the right reverend prelate for a contribution which showed his understanding of the human problems which are faced by the citizen in accommodating himself to a progressive policy for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare an interest <e> <s> i am a practising solicitor though i am without experience in criminal law <e> <s> nevertheless my firm has a criminal law practice <e> <s> i can tell the house that there is very serious concern about the costs of the proposal for the category of non-arrestable offences <e>", "<cs> my lords i may need to be corrected but i have based my figures on the information that i have received from the man who has been administering the pilot scheme for the past few months and he may be nearer to reality than the lord chancellors department <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief but it appears to me that the proposed amendment introduces rigidity into the bill and that ought not to be the aim <e> <s> of course we would expect the licence-holder to act within the spirit of the guide and to observe the letter of it but the point has been well made that with the passage of time and the advances in knowledge it may well be demonstrated that a particular situation will arise which has not been foreseen at this stage <e> <s> in that event you would not be able to keep pace with a development without introducing more amending legislation <e> <s> therefore we think there are very good reasons why this amendment should be opposed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee will allow a layman to venture to express an opinion <e> <s> i note that the noble lord is not pressing the last part of his amendment <e> <s> he says that he is not concerned with weapons and that that has already been discussed but in fact it has not <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> referred to the study of wounds inflicted by weapons <e> <s> i had understood that the noble lord was concerned with measuring the destructive powers of weapons <e> <s> be that as it may if he had in fact pressed the latter part of the amendment i think he would have found a great deal of support for it because it is difficult to justify causing harm to an animal in order to measure the destructive power of weapons <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question of the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> if the personal licensee or the day-to-day care officer of the establishment fails to act in the circumstances sketched out in the first paragraph of the amendment will they have committed an offence under this bill <e>", "<cs> i am in sympathy with my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it is important that the inspector who advises on the grant of the licence or certificate <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that there cannot be an unconditional licence because if one has regard to clause one sees that it is subject to certain provisions <e> <s> there are a minimum of two conditions set out in clause <e>", "<cs> i would find it difficult to go along with my noble friends amendment <e> <s> he invites the committee to pin the label inviolate termination to the condition imposed by clause <e>", "<cs> this amendment goes some way to allay ones fears that the discussions in the animal procedures committee might accept too readily the assumptions in favour of laboratory users <e> <s> to that extent i welcome it <e> <s> but there are difficulties with the amendment <e> <s> what are the objects of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that we shall hear more about that when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> having given the amendment a qualified acceptance i am very much more in sympathy with the amendment of the noble lord lord beaumont which i think is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but i wonder whether clause requires clarification <e> <s> the animals committee can offer advice when it is sought by the secretary of state but can it also offer advice when it is not asked <e> <s> that is my first question <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i also had read the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act and the relevant wording is to be found in section of that act <e> <s> the act provides for the welfare of livestock and to that end it provides that the code of conduct can be relied on in proceedings <e> <s> so we have in the act a very relevant precedent unless the minister can point out that the act has not worked out in practice <e> <s> all the evidence known to me shows that it has done so <e> <s> as the bill itself is not a comprehensive code dealing with regulating procedures and deals only with the framework we think that if the code is to bite it must be connected to that act <e> <s> we think that the act gives the minister a very sound precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his explanation of the bill which amends the act <e> <s> the minister described it as a technical financial measure but it is also of the greatest importance to the economy and the life of northern ireland <e> <s> the increased borrowing limit of the northern ireland consolidated fund will be used for on-lending to the beneficiaries named by the minister <e> <s> i should like to refer briefly to two or three of the beneficiaries <e>", "<cs> my lords as the order is a consolidation measure this is not the opportune time to raise substantive points relating to the subject <e> <s> therefore we are pleased to approve the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord dunleath for <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also refer to the ministers words on second reading at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing at all so far as i can see the minister will no doubt correct me if i am wrong in clause to authorise the testing of the wounding effect of weapons <e> <s> there is nothing at all in clause to authorise the appropriate licence <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i wish to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> indeed i endorse all he has said in support of it <e> <s> as i understand it one of the objects of the bill is to reduce if not to eliminate the unnecessary use of animals in scientific procedures <e> <s> this is one way of achieving that end <e> <s> i do not want to anticipate what is ahead of us but assuming that amendment no <e> <s> which reflects the thinking of the government is acceptable to your lordships house it appears to me that this amendment is almost consequential on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i support the amendment on the grounds that this is one way possibly the best way of ensuring the objects of the bill <e> <s> if it is not acceptable to the government what real significance do we attach to the objects as set out and as reflected in amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall come <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord houghton i do not see that this amendment complicates the bill

adopt the powerful argument advanced by my noble friend lord houghton without descending into details about whether any further amendments ought or ought not to be canvassed <e> <s> my noble friend has delivered a powerful warning to the government that if they insist on this amendment they are moving into a critical and highly contentious area of policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully support the three subsections of the amendment <e> <s> of course the codes of practice should be published <e> <s> indeed i should have thought that their very purpose requires that they be published <e> <s> the people who will be affected by the code must have the means of knowing its contents <e> <s> this amendment does not require any particular form of publication <e> <s> that is a matter to be left to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the principle of the amendment but i am not so sure about the form of words <e> <s> clause is very widely drawn and it appears to me that it ought to be qualified <e> <s> clause creates a criminal offence <e> <s> lord melchett suggests that recklessness be an element in that offence but i am not sure what is the meaning of recklessness

weekly on our television screens <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords two of my questions are outstanding <e> <s> i asked whether there ought to be a uniform business rate for wales specifically for wales <e> <s> i asked that question <e> <s> i also asked for an undertaking or an assurance that the reform will not be introduced in wales earlier than it will be introduced in england <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate that reports and communiques are made available in the library <e> <s> we also appreciate that there may be areas where the government would not wish to go public <e> <s> nevertheless would the government agree that an opportunity should be given to the house periodically to discuss the progress made by the conference so that we do not have to rely on the debates on the appropriation orders <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord airedale has told your lordships that the principle of this amendment has been discussed at committee stage and on report but that the noble lord the minister was not sympathetic <e> <s> the trouble is that the principle contained in this amendment is in fact contained in most of the acts of parliament which authorise the issue of a code of practice <e> <s> if that is so and if i am wrong no doubt the minister will correct me why should not this bill incorporate the common type of provision enabling the prosecution to rely on the codes of practice to the extent indicated in the amendment <e> <s> why should the courts have to rely on an assumption that the principle will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble viscount

his right honourable friend but we do not welcome it <e> <s> we deeply regret that another public authority is being dismantled <e> <s> in his statement the welsh secretary of state seems to be slavishly following the policy lead proposed by the department of the environment <e> <s> it is a disappointing statement and in opposing it one would adopt the whole range of arguments that were advanced by the water experts in your lordships house in the debate on nd april last arguments that have been convincingly summarised by my noble friend lady nicol <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sure that the church in wales is grateful to mr donald coleman for having initiated this private legislation in another place and indebted to the noble lord lord gibson-watt of the wye in the district

noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord for the content of the statement and to express our steadfast support for the statement amounting as it does

policy of defiance and obstruction is unlawful <e> <s> not only is it unlawful but it is extremist and irresponsible irresponsible because it puts important services which the minister has mentioned

notice of the publication will be made to the general public of the area and not merely to organisations which are active in that area <e> <s> secondly the press itself will be aware that an application has been submitted to the appropriate committee and we can be fairly sure that it will follow the history of the application and the final adjudication <e> <s> it appears to me that the fact that the press will be aware of the application will report its history and will report its adjudication will go some way to make certain that the committee itself will ensure that its decision is fair <e> <s> after all the decision would be taken behind closed doors and this is yet another safeguard which we are seeking to build into the bill <e>", "<cs> can the minister be a little more specific <e> <s> will the community health council have a representative on the practices committee appointed by itself <e> <s> i am not certain i probably misunderstood her but did the minister also say that the community health council will have a right of appeal against the decision of the practices committee <e> <s> they would have the two things <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers observations <e> <s> i have not seen the regulations but the noble baroness seems to be saying that the regulations do not exclude or restrict the right of access to the court and in any event they could not do that and therefore the right to appeal to the court remains <e> <s> if that is the position then i for my part would be content <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can elaborate a little on his reply <e> <s> on th june the secretary of state said that he would listen carefully those were his words to any proposal put forward by the irish government relating to the advantages of a bill of rights <e> <s> but in the communique issued on th october after the last meeting of the intergovernmental conference it was recorded that the government saw some difficulties with the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a second question to the minister <e> <s> the standing advisory commission on human rights in northern ireland with the financial support of the government and other support is undertaking a major review of human rights in northern ireland and of the laws and institutions protecting the citizen against discrimination <e> <s> that is a major review <e> <s> will the minister confirm to the house that the government will take no decision concerning human rights in northern ireland which would require legislation until the report of the standing advisory commission on human rights has been presented to the government in months time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for explaining the background to the order and also for the information which she has given the house about the board and the allocation of the fund between the republic and ulster <e> <s> we welcome the fund and the draft order and particularly the draft order because it gives legal personality to the international fund <e> <s> in our view it is one of the happier consequences of the anglo-irish agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assist <e> <s> can he give us an indication in terms of weeks or months as to when the board will be active in the market place <e>", "<cs> my lords that information is given i believe in article of the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank your lordships for the debate and i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in it <e> <s> their contributions and analyses have sometimes been based on immense knowledge and experience of the teaching hospitals <e> <s> on other occasions they have been based on experience and understanding of the role of the medical schools in our community <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for focusing attention on new tobacco products and what should be the states response thereto <e> <s> usually we have to continue to live with long established habits shared by millions of people even though those habits are known to be pregnant with risk to the health of the individual <e> <s> but that is of course no reason why a country should allow or encourage the growth of new habits which will create conditions for addiction to grow ever wider and wider and which will handicap the generation of tomorrow <e> <s> it is against that setting and with particular reference to this remarkable new product skoal bandits that the noble lord lord hunter argues the case for government action to prohibit the manufacture and sale of new tobacco products <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord northfield returns tonight to a basic issue raised during the committee stage of the patents designs and marks bill last april <e> <s> the house must be grateful to my noble friend for the series of detailed questions he has addressed to the government <e> <s> i shall deal in turn with each of the three separate parts of the main question <e> <s> first there is the issue of what further action the government propose to take to protect patients from the potential risks to health from parallel-imported medicines <e> <s> i will not traverse the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords was there a backlog of applications <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has explained this order contains a wide range of miscellaneous amendments bringing the health legislation of northern ireland into line with the health legislation of great britain <e> <s> we warmly welcome article which makes it an absolute offence to sell tobacco products including new tobacco products such as skoal bandits to young people under the age of years <e> <s> we are sure that this article will be endorsed by the organisations and parents in the province who are concerned about the prevention of cigarette smoking by children <e> <s> similarly we welcome articles and which strengthen the controls available to reduce the spread of those diseases which can be a danger to public health <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for taking us through the main provisions of the draft order and for explaining their significance <e> <s> i hasten to say that we support the order and i am sure that it will be welcomed from all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for his introduction of the order for describing the security position in northern ireland and for referring to the evidence which justifies the existence of emergency legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever be the special factors that work in northern ireland do we have the ministers assurance that those factors will not and could not lead the government to advocate for northern ireland preventive measures different from those advocated on this side of the water <e>", "<cs> my lords flowing from the reply of the minister to the first part of my noble friends question is the department satisfied that this coordinating committee will have the resources the budget to advance the campaign that is necessary in northern ireland <e> <s> ought there not to be a special health authority for northern ireland charged with this function <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to take up the time of the house on the first of the two northern ireland orders <e> <s> i am not aware of any controversy surrounding this order which amends the electoral law relating to local elections in northern ireland in the way which the noble lord lord lyell has described so clearly <e> <s> the amendments comprised in the order are straightforward and sensible <e> <s> we are therefore pleased to support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords this order in effect seeks to apply the principles of the education act to northern ireland in order to achieve the integration of pupils with special needs into mainstream schools <e> <s> we wholeheartedly support the principle of education because all the evidence suggests that the aims of education of children with disabilities are the same as for all other children <e> <s> we therefore welcome the draft order <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to thank the noble lord lord hylton for having given us the opportunity for this debate tonight <e> <s> i am also sure that the minority rights group and the authors of report no <e> <s> are grateful to the noble lord lord hylton for the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has just explained this is yet another draft order which seeks to approximate the law in northern ireland more closely with the law in great britain <e> <s> it makes sense that there should be uniformity of audit principles though not necessarily of audit arrangements between northern ireland and great britain <e> <s> although the order is modelled on the national audit act which set up the national audit office its provisions in a number of respects are not identical with those contained in the act <e> <s> indeed the minister has already referred to the differences <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for taking us through the order and for his explanation of its main features <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that his explanation was helpful <e> <s> the minister referred in his opening <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to be associated with the tribute paid by the noble lord lord lyell to the memory of the late lord brookeborough <e> <s> although he was opposed to the central thrust of the governments policy towards his beloved ulster he continued to come to your lordships house until he was laid low with sickness <e> <s> here he continued to represent the interests of the people of ulster according to his light <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for his clear exposition of the detailed provisions of the order <e> <s> the provisions make major changes in the law on industrial relations in northern ireland <e> <s> i should also like to thank the department of economic development for the helpful background material which it was good enough to <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify one point <e> <s> it is not really a question of how the trade union that is based in the republic can be sued in northern ireland <e> <s> the question is whether the commissioners for sequestration sequestrate the funds of a dublin-based union if the funds are in the republic <e> <s> that is the question <e>", "<cs> my lords for over four hours we have been debating a subject of vital interest to the people of the four countries of the united kingdom because we are all patients or potential patients <e> <s> we are grateful to my noble friend lord ennals for the opportunity to focus attention on the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord lord lyell for repeating a statement made in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for her explanation of the bill and for giving us this brief but interesting history of the trust to which it relates <e> <s> it is indeed a unique trust <e> <s> the minister went out of her way to underline the fact that its specific purpose is the provision of homes in the north and south of ireland for irishmen who served in the first world war <e> <s> it honoured the pledge given by field marshal sir john french <e> <s> she also pointed out that the act which established the trust and which is therefore a trust instrument contains no provision for the disposal of its surplus funds or for its eventual dissolution <e> <s> indeed the need to extend the powers of the trustees has been before parliament in and again in <e> <s> however this bill is very different from the earlier amending legislation because it provides for the distribution of the surplus funds and it also provides for the eventual winding up of the trust <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to my noble friend lord stallard for his explanation of this short but important bill and its background <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord trafford a distinguished doctor for and congratulate him on his illuminating speech with admixture of realism and hope <e> <s> by any standard the speech of the noble lord lord trafford was a major contribution to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say at the outset that we welcome this important and long overdue bill although we are sad that there is a need for it <e> <s> a bill relating to the affairs of northern ireland makes a very rare appearance indeed in your lordships house <e> <s> in the lifetime of the present parliament this is the only northern ireland bill to have come before it <e> <s> that is not to say that there has been no legislation relating to northern ireland <e> <s> in the past months about a dozen orders in council made their contribution to the life of the province dealing with such important matters as education local government social need mental health and public order but orders in council as has so often been observed in your lordships house cannot be and have not been amended <e>", "<cs> my lords the order which is before the house is an important one for northern ireland but it is a complicated order <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for explaining its complicated provisions and i am sure it will pay us to read and reread his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister the noble lord lord lyell for the assurances that he has brought to the house this afternoon <e> <s> of course we are saddened that it is still necessary to have emergency provisions legislation in northern ireland <e> <s> but the bill which amends the current legislation in a number of respects will be an improvement on that legislation <e> <s> it gives greater protection to the individual citizen without causing damage to the requirements of security <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my first pleasurable task to extend a warm welcome to the noble lord lord lyell to his office in the northern ireland department <e> <s> those of us who regularly attend to northern ireland business in your lordships house appreciate the courtesy patience and help at all times of the noble lord lord lyell and indeed the help which we have always received from his private office <e> <s> the noble lord knows that he can draw on a fund of goodwill from your lordships house but he has never to my knowledge taken advantage of his position <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse the reservations of my noble friend lord fitt about legislation by order in council <e> <s> from these benches we have been consistently critical of legislation by orders in council <e> <s> it is one of the penalties of direct rule and it is a matter to which we shall return during the debate on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell has once again given the house a comprehensive explanation of the provisions of the order and of its significance <e> <s> the enduring powers of attorney act was welcomed in every corner of your lordships house when it was introduced in <e> <s> i am sure that relatives friends and professional people who have charge of the property and affairs of elderly people in northern ireland will similarly welcome this important draft order <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has reviewed the current situation in northern ireland and has made out the governments case for the renewal of the northern ireland act for yet another year <e> <s> sadly we accept that the order must be passed and we on these benches give it our support <e>", "<cs> my lords substantial deposits of lignite have recently been discovered not far from belfast <e> <s> that must be very good news for northern <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt to state what i believe is the position <e> <s> is it not the position that it is for the department to decide whether or not the lignite-based power station contract will be given to a private contractor or to the electricity service <e> <s> secondly whatever terms are agreed between the electricity service and the generator they will have to be approved by the department and we do not know upon what criteria the department will give or withhold its consent <e>", "<cs> my lords a week ago tonight in the debate on the renewal of the northern ireland act i referred to a paragraph relating to northern ireland in the queens speech <e> <s> unlike the previous speeches it contained no commitment to tackle unemployment and the economic difficulties of the province which remains the poorest region in the united kingdom with very high unemployment even though it is slightly lower than a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for having described the background to this important order and for explaining many of the provisions some of which are without parallel in britain certainly in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the point is that unless the court is satisfied that he is a fit person then the registration certificate will not be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining the order and showing that it involves an issue of principle as well as law enforcement <e> <s> i propose to be brief but i want to say a word or two about the main issue of principle the extension for the first time since of the permitted hours to enable a public house at the option of the publican to open on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for taking us through the articles of the draft order which is before the house <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out the order is based in part on reports from the assembly and in part on the charities act <e> <s> we support the order subject to one reservation concerning articles and <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not at all dissent from that contribution <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was whether the department had had consultations with the charity commissioners and whether in the light of their experience they were satisfied with the thresholds in the act or whether they thought that the time had come to increase them <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the articles of this order have a familiar ring about them <e> <s> if the terms of the order were amendable i am sure it would attract the volume of criticism which was addressed to the water fluoridation bill in <e> <s> if that were the position we would have a re-run of the many amendments which were tabled when that bill was before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one simple question for the minister and he may well have provided the reply in the early part of the statement <e> <s> we are glad to learn that there have been very few stock losses <e> <s> what is the position where a farmer has suffered a stock loss or damage to produce and the loss is uninsured and will not be compensated by the local authority <e> <s> will the government compensate him for his loss and if so by when does he have to submit his claim <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by echoing the gratitude which other noble lords have expressed to my noble friend lord lovell-davis for giving us this opportunity to debate this challenging report by the national childrens bureau <e> <s> the bureau its policy and practice review group professor philip graham and dr kurtz are to be thanked for their valuable contributions <e> <s> we have heard that this report is the first review of health services for children since the court committee reported in <e> <s> it has been produced by professionals involved with childrens health and their voice is therefore authoritative <e> <s> thanks to the report we now know that it was high time that the whole field of child health was reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are particularly anxious that the governments sympathy for haemophilia/aids victims should be translated in the short term into practical support <e> <s> will the minister confirm to the house that the inquiry will consider the following three questions <e> <s> as the haemophilia/aids victim has to meet exceptionally heavy additional expenditure because of his two life-threatening diseases will the government consider introducing a special weekly benefit to haemophilia/aids victims <e> <s> secondly as a large number of haemophilia/aids victims have family dependants <e>", "<cs> will the government consider how that dependency can be met during the onset of the disease and after the death of a breadwinner <e> <s> finally <e>", "<cs> are the government satisfied that the quality of counselling and the facilities available to haemophilia/aids victims are consistent with their right to dignity and privacy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his explanation of the terms of the draft order in council <e> <s> it springs from the report of the boundary commission for wales dated th may <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that the queen elizabeth hospital renal dialysis unit is adequately funded to provide services in accordance with the dhss criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain to the house why the government refuse to acknowledge that their failure to provide satisfactory health services for all people wherever they may live is more costly to the state in terms of increased social security benefits an increased nhs drug bill and time lost from work than is a few pence taken off income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for his explanation of the contents of this third appropriation order of <e> <s> its scope is narrow being limited to defraying expenditure between now and the end of next march on the three items which the noble lord has explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain the house over this order <e> <s> it is an important order and we welcome it <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for describing the background for explaining its main strands and for identifying the areas where the law on adoption in northern ireland will depart in some material respects from the law in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place <e> <s> the minister will know only too well that the under-funding of the nhs has in recent weeks been the subject of frequent constructive and well-informed exchanges in your lordships house <e> <s> fortunately the nhs and the patients have friends in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the immense benefit of listening to the noble baroness lady warnock taking us carefully through her analysis her assessments of the arguments and the values which led to the main conclusion of the majority report of her committee <e> <s> i believe that many people who had been agonising over and seeking an answer to the complex ethical and moral problems which face us and which were really in existence before the committee of inquiry was set up will have been helped considerably by the noble ladys illuminating speech <e> <s> i also believe that they will have been helped by the compelling speech of the most reverend primate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i speak personally on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the opponents of restricted research on human embryos claim that the early embryo has the status of human life from the day of fertilisation and that the sanctity of that life must be protected <e> <s> that is a particular standpoint or belief based on moral or religious principles and i accept that it is deeply and firmly held by many people <e> <s> i respect that belief and for the reasons that have been given by the most reverend primate it must be taken into account when designing legislation <e> <s> but i regret that the opposition to restricted research has sometimes been expressed in vivid and emotional rhetoric which can so easily be used or exploited to generate an emotive response and possibly unfairly influence public opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by joining with the noble lord lord dunleath in congratulating the noble viscount lord brookeborough on his well reasoned and well researched maiden speech <e> <s> by any standards it was an excellent speech <e> <s> his late father was a regular contributor to the debates on northern ireland affairs in your lordships house <e> <s> he brought to our debates a certain unionist perspective which must always be taken into account by the legislator <e> <s> we knew that here was a man whose heart and soul was in northern ireland <e> <s> we hope that the noble viscount lord brookeborough will maintain his familys long tradition of service to the province and that henceforth his rational voice will be often and regularly heard in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that if the traffic flow over the existing bridge continues to grow at the record rate for the designed maximum carrying capacity of the bridge will be reached in the early s and not in the middle of the s <e> <s> in that event the existing bridge would become overloaded with all that that implies <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> it is a sad statement which we have heard <e> <s> while clearly we welcome the statement so far as it goes we fear that it will not make a substantial contribution towards fostering a climate of confidence among the catholic community in northern ireland in the ruc or in the rule of law or in the anglo-irish conference <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the the noble lord has just said if it is decided by the police complaints authority that it will investigate the conduct of very senior officers will mr kelly have the authority to investigate their conduct <e> <s> does he have the status to investigate their conduct or should that be entrusted to a judicial figure of the highest standing and authority <e>", "<cs> my lords long gestation has produced a very short order but i am glad to say that it is as uncontroversial as the bill which the house has just been discussing <e> <s> we welcome the order <e>", "<cs> my lords if the attorney-general or the director of public prosecutions decide for reasons of security that proceedings will not be taken is not that officer above the reach of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i should at the outset declare an interest <e> <s> the law firm with which i am associated acts for the welsh development agency <e> <s> we give this short bill a very warm and unqualified welcome <e> <s> the record to which the minister has referred has demonstrated that the setting up of the welsh development agency in was an event of enormous significance to the economic life of wales <e> <s> we were not then to know that the years which lay ahead would be so harsh for many of the older welsh industrial communities <e> <s> but of this we can be sure that if the wda had not been in position and working flat out in partnership with the welsh office and welsh local authorities the scars of the recession would have been far more deeply embedded right across the face of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his tour through the main expenditure adjustments covered by the order and for underlining its salient features which we support <e> <s> i welcome his reference to the contribution from the international fund of ireland and for the additional support to meet the costs of repairing the flood damage caused last october <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we are grateful to the secretary of state for taking the earliest possible opportunity to express his outright condemnation of the appalling atrocity which was committed in milltown cemetery belfast yesterday <e> <s> we also wish to convey our sympathy to the families and friends of those who were killed to those who were wounded and to the bereaved who wished to bury their dead in dignity <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i come to the dispatch box for the second time in four days to condemn atrocity in northern ireland obviously we on these benches join unreservedly in the condemnation of the horrific murders of the two young soldiers in west belfast last saturday and we express our utmost sympathy with the bereaved relatives <e> <s> we also condemn the murder of yet another policeman in londonderry earlier today and extend our sympathy to his family <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford for his contribution to the debate <e> <s> we are grateful for his expression of appreciation of the commitment of health workers and for his unqualified support for the principles of the national health service <e> <s> i trust that noble lords on the government front bench will heed the right reverend prelates warning that he finds evidence of falling morale in the nhs <e> <s> those are his measured words <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this short order is to abolish the standard capital grants scheme in northern ireland which is as the noble lord lord lyell pointed out similar to the regional development grant in the rest of the united kingdom and is also in the process of being abolished by the regional development grants termination bill which will receive its second reading in this house tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that his reply to that question depends to a considerable extent upon whether the assistance will be treated as capital or as revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords although i speak from the front bench i assure the house that i speak in my personal capacity and not on behalf of my noble friends on these benches <e> <s> this subject must be left to the individual beliefs of noble lords <e> <s> it was a great pleasure to hear the speech of the distinguished noble and learned lord lord brightman <e> <s> with masterly skill he sketched in the background explained the committees recommendations and the reasoning on which they are grounded <e>", "<cs> my lords does it follow from the ministers reply that the department or the fpcs do not currently collect information about the quantity and range of medicines and drugs prescribed to children <e> <s> on the other hand if they do collect the information is it being fed back to the general practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the waiting list initiative is not having an adverse effect on the specialties which do not benefit from that particular initiative in that they do not have to give up beds and release theatre time in favour of the initiative <e> <s> are those waiting lists building up to an unacceptable level <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by welcoming the order which as the noble lord explained gives more generous consideration to the victims of violent offences <e> <s> as the crime rate has grown there has been a growing public concern about the manner in which the innocent victims of crime are treated by the law <e> <s> therefore there has been a growing demand in northern ireland as in the rest of the united kingdom that the scope of the current criminal injuries compensation scheme should be expanded <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for introducing this short order <e> <s> this is again a complex field and he has explained with clarity the background and the main features of the order <e> <s> it is very much in line with the recommendations of the th report of the law commission and the provisions of the minors contracts act <e> <s> it is not controversial and we welcome its provisions <e> <s> i have no questions to ask on the order itself but i am prompted to raise one matter <e>", "<cs> i note that the minister has resisted amendment no <e> <s> very strongly and at this hour of the morning i shall not take the view of the committee on the merits of the amendment <e> <s> we shall study carefully the ministers words and take advice from the many bodies in wales which have supported the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister two short questions <e> <s> first can he confirm that both his department and harland and wolff have the organisation and the accounting systems which will be necessary to properly monitor and handle the contractual relationships which harland and wolff may enter into in respect of the venture given its magnitude and complexity <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to thank my noble friend lord molloy for having chosen such a worthy motion as the basis for this debate and for giving us this opportunity to discuss the conditions of employment of nursing staff in the nhs <e> <s> as one would expect my noble friend has spoken with deep feeling and conviction about the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords when i pleaded with the government not to attempt a reduction in expenditure

the conditions in that area <e> <s> my noble friends question to the government is necessary and appropriate <e> <s> my noble friend lady ewart-biggs has authorised me to say how sorry she is that she is unable to stay for the debate and to join with my noble friend and others in pressing the government for a satisfactory response <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to my noble friend lord basnett for giving us this opportunity of discussing this important subject <e> <s> we thank him for his comprehensive review of the problems of the mentally handicapped and the mentally-ill patients and the problems of their families and for presenting that review in an outstanding speech <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fair point <e> <s> whether the patient is to be returned to a local community or a distant community the health authority ought to satisfy itself that the facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that suggestion <e> <s> i shall consider the matter and possibly offer advice on the basis of that intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords although the bill is a short one many of its provisions are far-reaching <e> <s> my noble friend lord ennals has made it clear that we welcome some of the provisions <e> <s> on the other hand the bill is strangely silent on a number of issues which have been identified <e> <s> but the debate has clearly brought out genuine worries on all sides of the house about the most far-reaching of those provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was seeking to make was that the option of scrapping the eye test and the dental test fee was not set out in the discussion document <e> <s> on that point the document was silent <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the explanation of the noble lord in support of the redrafting of clauses to of the bill <e> <s> he knows better than anyone what this bill seeks to achieve <e> <s> if he is satisfied that the amendments which are now before the committee give better effect to the underlying provisions of the bill or to its structure we are content to accept his judgment and his guidance <e> <s> we do not oppose any of the amendments <e> <s> it may therefore be appropriate for me to make a few observations on two or three of the amendments if that is in order <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will have to listen to my contribution in the meantime <e> <s> i am not an academic nor am i a doctor i am just a lay person who happens to have a special interest in the national health service <e> <s> whatever may be the ministers standards those are my only qualifications for speaking in this very important debate <e>", "<cs> my lords this short bill of three clauses relates to the community health councils <e> <s> the community health council is the voice of the consumer in the national health service <e> <s> the council is separated from the decision-making body the district health authority <e> <s> on the assumption that the separation of functions is correct each district should have its own health council <e> <s> it is at this level that one must ensure that the services are interlocking effectively and being delivered effectively <e> <s> as the bill enhances public participation in the business of the community health council or possibly removes obstacles to such participation we on these benches give it our full

the regulations to be made thereunder <e> <s> i am just wondering whether the minister can confirm that the draft regulations will be the subject of consultation with the bodies involved with welsh

case that we made out in committee <e> <s> i appreciate the fact that the minister of state at the welsh office mr wyn roberts saw the noble lord lord hooson and myself yesterday afternoon and discussed our concern about the definition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i understood the thrust of the noble earls supplementary question <e> <s> however will the minister confirm that it is a feature of the capital programme that beds will also be closed <e> <s> can he tell the house how many acute beds will be opened and how many acute beds will be closed under the programme <e> <s> secondly can the minister ensure that the district health authorities concerned are guaranteed sufficient revenue to bring the capital projects into full operation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the cost of the capital programme he has outlined to the house will be paid out of general taxation and that the cost is such that the role of private medicine can never be anything more than marginal <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with sadness that we from these benches are bound to agree with the government that there is a need to renew this act an act which is described in its title as being an interim period act <e> <s> this is the fourteenth year of renewal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for his presentation of this order and for his explanation of the background of its main provisions <e> <s> i am sure that most of the articles in this order will be warmly welcomed in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord winstanley and adopt his arguments <e> <s> i believe that it is important that the opinions of the public and in particular those members of the public who have a special interest in the health service should he voiced within the successor company <e>", "<cs> the national interest <e>", "<cs> this means that not only will the terms of a lease be honoured by the successor company but where there is an existing loan the loan cannot be called in and the terms of the loan cannot be varied by the successor company <e>", "<cs> we want very strongly to support the arguments advanced by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> it seems to me that there are at least two main grounds for concern which have been advanced by the noble earl <e> <s> first the very existence of the power to prohibit or to delay publication whether or not it is exercised is damaging to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trafford has overlooked the fact that clause f has to be read in conjunction with subsection <e> <s> certainly if clause f stood on its own i would not be unduly concerned but what worries me is that you have to read that in conjunction with subsection which gives authority to the secretary of state to impose directions <e> <s> one direction would be to prohibit publication <e>", "<cs> the minister has withdrawn his name but we still hope to convert him to the wisdom of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> it will be helpful if the minister can explain to the committee how the phrase to a <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee will have to consider carefully what the minister said in reply to our amendments <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend lord wallace that i was not in my place when he moved this amendment <e> <s> i want to echo the words of appreciation expressed by my noble friend lord ennals of the contribution of my noble friend lord wallace <e> <s> my noble friend lord wallace is right to draw attention to the role of the voluntary organisations and the charitable societies in the nhs since <e> <s> every hospital up and down the country has been the recipient of voluntary help and financial aid since it was built <e> <s> prior to all our hospitals were voluntary hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the supplementary question asked by my noble friend lord molloy will the minister assure the house that if it emerges that the nurses feel that they have been unfairly or unjustly treated his right honourable friend the secretary of state would be prepared to have discussions with the leaders of the nursing unions to resolve the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining the background to the order and for taking the house through its provisions <e> <s> it brings us face to face with the need to serve the homeless in northern ireland <e> <s> i believe that to be its overriding consideration even though it contains other matters which we also welcome particularly those in part iii <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make this point clear <e> <s> i want to know whether the loan will be interest free <e> <s> i understand from the minister that it will not be interest free but that the rate of interest will be agreed between the housing executive and the voluntary body <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the house would allow me to put one question to the minister about the welsh language fourth television network <e> <s> am i correct in assuming that the government are not committed to the preservation of the existing broadcasting and financial viability of the welsh language fourth channel station <e> <s> in other words will the station henceforth have to depend on the income that it can generate from advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for his full explanation of the terms of this important but difficult order <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the outset that we readily recognise the great difficulties facing the government and their ministers in northern ireland and the difficulties which face the police in the province <e> <s> we understand their sense of frustration as the emergency in the province appears to be unending in the foreseeable future or at all <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady birk explained clearly at the beginning of the debate our essential concerns about the home secretarys directions to the broadcasting authorities on th october last <e> <s> my noble friend showed why the official opposition are taking a different view from that of the government <e> <s> she foreshadowed criticisms which have been powerfully voiced by other speakers in particular by the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester and the noble lords lord bonham-carter and lord harris of greenwich <e>", "<cs> we have great sympathy with the principle of the amendment <e> <s> what is important however is that the expressed wish of the child should be genuine and freely arrived at <e> <s> that is one of a number of considerations <e> <s> i agree with my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones that that idea should not be converted into a provision in the bill <e> <s> what is important is that when the magistrates or the court come to decide the issue they should be aware of the childs view which should be a genuine view <e> <s> we on these benches believe that that matter can best be provided for in the amendment tabled by my noble friend lady david which we shall be discussing later <e>", "<cs> the words that worry me are that the parental responsibilities can be surrendered or transferred <e> <s> i follow the reasoning if we are confining ourselves to parental responsibility with delegation of some duties to another person <e> <s> if there is delegation then we have the relationship of principal and agent and ultimately the parent remains responsible <e> <s> however if he is permitted to surrender where at the end of the day is the responsibility <e>", "<cs> that would certainly be the position if the critical word in the subsection were delegation but here the critical word seems to be surrender <e> <s> if the parent surrenders the power does that mean that his responsibility vanishes <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had anticipated the argument that the noble lord lord meston would advance against the amendment that there are unlimited demands on the resources of the court and the probation officers <e> <s> however i thought that i had suggested a way that one could possibly reconcile the real world with the ideal world <e> <s> however i accept the guidance that the noble and learned lord the lord <e>", "<cs> we will clearly have to consider the very convincing answer which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has given us together with the suggestion offered by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> in the circumstances i will not take up the time of the committee further and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think for one moment that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor wants assistance from these benches <e> <s> however we do not consider that to lower the period from three years to one year as suggested in the amendment would improve the bill <e> <s> a period of one year may appear to be long enough and months is a long time in the life of a child but it soon goes by <e> <s> we suggest that it would be too short a period in which to know whether the child would settle down with the foster parents with siblings and in a new school <e> <s> therefore we consider the period of one year to be too low <e>", "<cs> i believe that this kind of order is relatively rare but i understand that when the court comes to consider the making of such an order it takes into consideration the need for a secure home and the need to consider the childs siblings <e> <s> that is the convention <e> <s> however we agree with the noble lord <e> <s> lord meston and other speakers that it would be extremely helpful if the need to give consideration to these two factors were expressed on the face of the bill <e> <s> therefore we wish to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i respond to the guidance and the explanation given by the noble and learned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving us that explanation and his reasons for resisting this amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to the members of the committee who have supported the amendment <e> <s> in the circumstances we shall have to consider the matter and decide whether to bring it again before this chamber <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we fully support the principle that notice of intention to remove a child should be given to the other parent or the person who has parental responsibility <e> <s> however i am not so sure that there should be a hard and fast rule about the length of the notice <e> <s> the parent who has the residence order may suddenly be faced in practice with a crisis in the family <e> <s> he or she may be left with no time let alone three weeks in which to give the notice <e> <s> therefore while we strongly support the principle that notice should be given in the circumstances we consider that what is required is reasonable notice <e> <s> that would obviously depend on the circumstances <e>", "<cs> we are once again very grateful for the explanation which the noble and learned lord has given the committee <e> <s> the essential point we were making is that there is no point in making this kind of order unless one is assured of the co-operation of the person named <e>", "<cs> we accept that the schedule does not have inferior status and that it is an integral part of the bill <e> <s> however the point has been made by my noble friend lady david that professional <e>", "<cs> that is reassuring <e> <s> we hope very much that the amendments will be tabled in this chamber <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the explanation given by the noble and learned lord confirms the belief which i had been nourishing during the past half hour namely that the provision is already included within the framework of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are graceful for the possibility of a concession <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful that we are making progress <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord at this stage confirm whether or not the regulations will set out the broad terms which the agreements should cover <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord for the assurances and the information he has given the committee <e> <s> clearly this is an issue that we shall have to consider with the organisations which have a special interest in the area <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> there are children in care who do not have a plan for the future <e> <s> one of the dhss-sponsored research studies revealed that social workers did not actively plan what should happen to children when they entered care <e> <s> the study revealed that the plan which most social workers tend to adopt is a wait and see policy <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief in what i have to say but i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lady david <e>", "<cs> as i see it there remains a possible conflict between the local authority social service department and the application of the social security legislation <e> <s> we should have thought that this would be an opportunity to seek to resolve that possible conflict <e> <s> it would be helpful if the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would be good enough to draw the attention of his right honourable friend to that possible conflict and ensure that some guidance is issued so that the payments made by the local authorites do not automatically reduce the level of income support that will be paid by social security <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i do not propose to press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the organisations that have written to us in support of this amendment tell us of the difficulties experienced by young people in ascertaining their entitlement to benefits and services <e> <s> i am very grateful for the response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and certainly we shall return to these organisations for further guidance as to how we can possibly improve and indeed perfect the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether amendment no <e> <s> really addresses the problem presented by the noble baroness lady faithfull namely that there should be a complaints procedure manager <e> <s> we shall of course come to that aspect later <e> <s> i hope that then we can deal with the problem that worries the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> at the moment i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i have not received any particular guidance as to where this complaints manager is to be located <e> <s> as i understand it the important thing is that one knows that there is a complaint procedure and who the complaints manager is <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome the last few words of guidance which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has given to the committee <e> <s> we readily acknowledge that this clause represents a step forward and that the word representations is wide enough to include complaints <e> <s> however if the amendment is resisted at the end of the day i cannot help feeling that the government are not paying adequate attention to the message which we have received from so many organisations <e> <s> for the time being however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the response from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is a little worrying at least i find it so <e> <s> the details to be covered by the complaints procedure are not spelt out apart from the need for an independent element which is contained in subsection <e> <s> that is in sharp contrast to the matters which are to be covered by the review cases procedure <e>", "<cs> we are of course concerned with a representation which is a complaint <e> <s> i should have thought that merely to call on the local authority to give due regard to the consideration could be pretty meaningless whereas in our amendment we are asking the local authority to direct its attention to a remedy or a relief or a redress <e> <s> it may in some circumstances be no more than an apology but i agree with the noble lord lord meston that to press the local authority for a redress or a remedy or a relief where the situation is capable of being remedied is stronger than asking the authority to give due consideration to the findings <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his response <e> <s> we were particularly anxious that the procedure should be made known to parents and children because they are the people who will probably originate the complaints <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord has referred to schedule and we shall have to consider the provisions in the schedule <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply <e> <s> he reminded the committee that relevant guidance was issued last year in respect of case conferences <e> <s> but we have been pressing for guidance on parental participation to be incorporated in the bill or in regulations <e> <s> it would appear that notwithstanding the advice which has been issued local authorities are on the whole slow and unenthusiastic about following the guidance <e> <s> however i note the reference of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to clause of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that that will be helpful <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will help the committee if i now speak to amendment no <e> <s> because that goes along with the emphasis which my noble friend placed on the need for protection <e> <s> we believe that it is important that the word protection should be inserted in the subsection to ensure that the court considers not only the care available to the child but the degree of protection which will be available to him <e>", "<cs> in the course of the last minutes at least three different meanings have been attached to the phrase <e> <s> this suggests that clarification is desirable even for the magistrates <e> <s> otherwise there could be here a fruitful source of difficulty <e> <s> i am content with what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> this matter will be reconsidered and i very much hope that either the amendment of my noble friend lady david or the words suggested by my noble friend lord mishcon will be acceptable <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment has been prompted by the fact that the religious creed of a child or a young person is given a special place in subsection a <e> <s> on reading this clause one forms the view that it is all-embracing but the lord chancellor has referred us back to clause <e> <s> that will not be immediately apparent to people when they read subsection a <e> <s> it will become apparent if one has mastery of the bill <e> <s> we shall have to read and study what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said and see whether we are content with the reply <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have correctly understood the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> do we therefore have the following assurance <e> <s> where the child is in voluntary care and there is a dispute about access which cannot be resolved parents can nevertheless apply under section for a contact order <e>", "<cs> i believe that the explanation that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has given to the committee is reassuring <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness please repeat the first point <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that as regards the first question the relatives would be exempt by virtue of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> as regards the second question i meant to make it clear that emergency fostering such as the noble baroness had in mind would be excluded from the provisions of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and for its tenor <e> <s> basically we seek a common objective and i think it is now for those who have consulted us to consider very carefully the points made by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we shall then decide whether we should come back on this amendment or a variation of it <e> <s> i am particularly grateful that the lord chancellor has in mind that the regulations to be made under the bill will cover most of the matters which we have mentioned on these amendments <e> <s> as i said on the face of it this could be a common area so we shall consult and possibly come back to your lordships at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very conscious that i have not obtained the smallest concession from the noble and learned lord on the complaints procedure up to now so i am particularly grateful for that assurance in the circumstances it gives me great pleasure to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we have a good bill but the conflict over the use of scarce resources will continue <e> <s> priorities will have to be established between conflicting claims <e> <s> we may find that there will be relative neglect of some facilities <e>

and frequent report <e> <s> such a report by the centre would be inductive and the lack of such attention to what is happening at ground level would be worrying <e> <s> it gives me great pleasure to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i read with interest what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said in the discussion on amendment no <e> <s> put forward by my noble friend lord irvine <e>

magistrates court level <e> <s> then a decision will be taken by an authority perhaps the clerk to the magistrates or the magistrates court itself whether or not that case is to be transferred upwards <e>", "<cs> will the lord chancellor confirm what he had in mind when he said in col that it is the intention to provide by order that at least at first applications for care should be made to the magistrates <e> <s> does that mean that when the new procedure comes into existence that is the way in which it will be seen at first but that in the light of experience it may be subject to

explained is not confined to deeds relating to the sale of land it will help in a small way to achieve the <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish also to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for

discussed in committee we have heard from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i want very much to support the amendment we think it an important one <e> <s> it emerged in committee that although the bill often appears to place a duty on local authorities in relation to children in care or their families on closer examination that duty is found to be framed in such a general way or the local authorities have been given so much discretion that they can in practice decide not to exercise it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his helpful response to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that he will also have regard to amendment no <e> <s> and the suggestion that the age limit should be eight years rather than five <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble and learned lord for his reply to the debate on these amendments <e> <s> we believe that the amendments identify a mischief <e> <s> it is a disgrace that children should he separated from their families because of homelessness or the state of their housing <e> <s> we should have thought that amendment no <e> <s> which is certainly our second best amendment might have been accepted because it merely points to the need for local authorities to exercise their duty under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation of the shortcomings of the regulations which were issued last december <e> <s> i also note the undertaking given in that respect <e> <s> i anticipated that the noble and learned lord might well take the point that our amendment was potentially too restrictive <e> <s> we should gladly and willingly come back with an improved amendment if we thought it would be acceptable to him <e> <s> it appears to those whom we have consulted that they accept that partnership underlies much of the thinking upon which the bill has been built and that an agreement along the lines indicated in the amendment would reinforce that partnership <e>", "<cs> my

miscalculated the pace at which the committee was proceeding <e> <s> i apologise to him <e> <s> at the same time i thank him for taking us through the provisions of this short but important bill and for drawing our attention to its two central proposals the extension of the franchise for district council elections and the requirement that district council and assembly candidates must sign a declaration statutorily expressed as a declaration against terrorism that they will not by word or deed express support for proscribed organisations or acts of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that any person could apply to the court for a declaration that a councillor is in breach of a declaration against terrorism <e> <s> are not the proceedings confined to a council a member of the council or a member of the electorate of that particular council so that a person from belfast could not apply for an order against a councillor from londonderry who has spoken in londonderry or anywhere else in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister elaborate on the reply that he gave to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> will the risk of rats spreading salmonella and the lethal weils disease be tackled by the recently-announced inquiry under the prime ministers chairmanship into the whole question of food hygiene and public health <e>

government prepared to pay his bill or will they insist that it be paid by the consumer by industry or by anybody other than mrs thatchers government <e>", "<cs> my lords only about a year ago the department of health said that hospitals for the mentally handicapped were scheduled to close by and that hospitals for the mentally ill were scheduled to close by <e> <s> is that still the position <e> <s> will the minister place in the library a list of the hospitals for which a closure date has been agreed and a list of the hospitals for which a closure date is still subject to consultation

my lords as i followed the reasoning of my noble friend lord ennals his concluding advice to the house was that presented by the noble lord lord hunter that one should proceed to test the hypothesis before we apply the plan nationally <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in expressing my grateful thanks to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for having <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his response and in particular for drawing our attention to clause and the appropriate subsection <e> <s> the subsection deals with an objective test of intention <e> <s> there can be a subjective test of intention <e> <s> we believe that in electoral law we should refer to a subjective test rather than an objective test of intention <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lords amendment and amendment no <e> <s> are addressed to the definition in the bill of the word terrorism but the definition of the word

place that the definition had been used in two other acts of parliament and it had not led to any difficulties <e> <s> i do not challenge the judgment of the noble lord lord lye i am sure that it is correct <e> <s> however it does not follow that the definition is appropriate in the context of this bill which deals with electoral law <e>", "<cs> the minister may have missed the point of the intervention of the noble lord lord fitt <e> <s> we could introduce into the amendment the words organised and physically damaging <e> <s> kneecapping is physically damaging <e> <s> would that be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> but knee-capping surely implies a measure of organisation <e> <s> it requires first that one identifies the candidate for knee-capping and secondly that one assembles the forces necessary to knee-cap that person <e> <s> that requires organisation and it comes within the definition of the noble lord lord monson if the noble lord is prepared to extend that definition to include the words physically damaging conduct <e>", "<cs> what worries me about the ministers response is that this kind of amendment has been around the place for two or three months so the government have had time to reflect <e> <s> i am not convinced that further reflection will persuade the government to support the amendment <e> <s> indeed the minister said at the end of his speech that he did not believe that the introduction of the office of the attorney-general would make any difference at all <e> <s> i am depressed when the minister says look the attorney-general cannot bring these proceedings because he was not in the council chamber when the councillor said this or that <e> <s> the police are never present at the scene of the crime when the crime is committed <e> <s> someone has to go along to the police with a complaint and the police act on that complaint <e>", "<cs> there was no undertaking by the minister to have discussions with peers from

extent one could have had as it were a class action where five or or more could bring proceedings <e> <s> however subject to what the minister will say to your lordships committee the department was

our gratitude to the lord chancellor for bringing forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that the government have set their face against this amendment <e> <s> we felt that without this

able to offer the appropriate guidance and advice to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her support and for drawing the attention of the house to the difficulties experienced in lincolnshire <e> <s> i thank the noble and learned lord for his response <e> <s> i had not appreciated that we cannot introduce the word shall into the legislation unless

the noble and learned lords message <e> <s> in the light of experience with the foster children act he will recognise that this matter deserves high priority <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by thanking the minister for introducing the order and for speaking to the consequential order <e> <s> apart from one provision which the minister mentioned and to which i shall refer later the order harmonises the law in northern ireland <e> <s> in so doing the order proposes at least theoretically some significant changes in the law relating in particular to financial provisions on divorce <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has quite rightly drawn the attention of the house to the fact that the joint committee on consolidation bills is satisfied that this draft order is pure consolidation <e> <s> therefore it would be quite improper for me to comment on the contents of the order as it is a consolidation measure <e> <s> nevertheless

have access to the articles of that company to know how the company is to authorise the document <e> <s> that is the problem which i see if we abolish the need for the seal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord blease for introducing this bill to your lordships house <e> <s> indeed it is deserving and fitting that a bill which will enhance the services for the disabled and which recognises the human dignity of the disabled person should be presented to this house by my noble friend <e> <s> he has toiled tirelessly throughout his life for the disadvantaged people of his native northern ireland to which he is always so loyal <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government see a need for the operation of the anglo-irish agreement to be open to greater public scrutiny subject always to the overriding consideration of the security of the province <e> <s> is there any good reason why the government should not wish to be associated with such a helpful and constructive idea <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that interested parties would be encouraged to submit proposals to the anglo-irish conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to add to or to modify in any way the speech which i made on second reading <e> <s> we on this side welcome the bill <e> <s> i urge the department to ensure that its provisions are applied without waiting for a lead

opportunity to rub in just one or two messages which can be read if not heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for introducing the order and throwing light on its provisions <e>

treatment of juvenile and young offenders in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that we on this side of the house are pleased to support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am standing in for my noble friend lord ennals who is unfortunatey unable to be here as he is keeping a conference engagement abroad which was arranged a long time ago <e> <s> my noble friend would

of the northern ireland act for a further months <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that more and more parents belonging to both traditions are anxious that their children should have access to integrated education <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm the information which i have received from the department of health that the terms of reference of this new policy board will not be agreed until a meeting on th july <e> <s> if that is so that gives the government an opportunity to review the criteria for membership in the light of the terms of reference which are yet to be agreed

to know that we are now anxious that the government should obtain clearance from brussels for the arrangement that has been negotiated as that is in the interest not only of the workforce in shorts but of the people of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the plea that the government should have another look at the timetable for this important bill <e> <s> my noble

i speak on behalf of all noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for responding so favourably to the amendment <e> <s> we are content to rely on his words so that by the time we come to report stage we shall have an amendment or a series of amendments which will be acceptable <e> <s> we rely on the words of the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> and really for the same reasons to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in order to promote equality of opportunity of employment surely the commission should be studying and analysing the up-to-date statistics of unemployment <e> <s> without that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lyell has rushed us through these amendments <e> <s> we shall have to study what he has told the committee <e>", "<cs> that is what we say is the defect in the procedure <e> <s> the commission will not be entitled to ask for an undertaking which it can enforce <e> <s> if an employer decides not to give an undertaking the commission will have to launch a full-scale inquiry under clause assuming that it has the facilities and resources available to undertake that investigation there and then <e> <s> if the tribunal finds an unsatisfactory state of affairs and puts out a marker about the practices of the employer to which the employer does not respond a year will be lost before an investigation can be set in train and then completed <e> <s> that is a weakness in the procedure which the minister is asking the committee to accept <e>", "<cs> let us assume that the commission receives from the tribunal evidence which persuades the commission to exercise an opinion that it should now ask the employer for an undertaking <e> <s> the employer refuses to give an undertaking <e> <s> where then does one go <e> <s> what power does the commission have to persuade the employer to change his practices there and then <e> <s> the commission has no power except to launch a full-scale inquiry which may take months or more to conclude <e>", "<cs> the weakness flows from the inadequacy of the definition of indirect discrimination <e> <s> if the government were to see their way clear to refining the definition the problem would not arise <e> <s> the minister has referred to the regulations and to the contents of the regulations <e> <s> can he say whether the regulations are already in draft form and whether we may have sight of them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bonham-carter has advanced the arguments for this amendment admirably <e> <s> i should only like to say in support that it is also based on the recommendation of the standing advisory commission on human rights in northern ireland which is of course the governments own advisory body in this field <e> <s> therefore we are especially anxious for the reasons which have been well advanced by the noble lord lord bonham-carter that the government should look sympathetically at this amendment <e>", "<cs> if it is the governments case that the high court judge may be too divorced from the world of industry and practice have they considered whether it would be appropriate for a high court judge to sit with two assessors when the court is considering an appeal <e>", "<cs> it may be of some comfort to the minister that once again i come to his support <e> <s> we cannot support the amendments <e> <s> we think it is important that the tribunal should have effective enforcement powers <e> <s> it seems to us that to accept the amendment would weaken the enforcement powers of the tribunal and to that extent would undermine the bill <e> <s> for those reasons we cannot go along with the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help <e> <s> we have listened with great attention to the contributions of members of the committee to the debate on the amendment <e> <s> it had been my impression that section of the act was working pretty well in northern ireland <e> <s> can the minister help the committee <e> <s> does he know how well section has worked in practice <e> <s> for example has there been any application to the commission to review the exemptions under section <e> <s> can he explain how clause will assist <e> <s> it is my understanding that it will reinforce the exemption in section <e>", "<cs> the minister described this as quite a simple amendment <e> <s> in fact it is a worrying amendment <e> <s> it is worrying because it limits the provisions for the monitoring of applications to those situations where the vacancies have been advertised <e> <s> that is completely unacceptable to these benches <e> <s> of course the monitoring of applications is invaluable in determining whether equality of opportunity is taking place and in assessing whether an employer should be making more efforts to attract applications from the under-represented community <e> <s> but the amendment restricts the monitoring of applications to those posts which have been advertised <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> does the minister get the point that because the amendment is confined to advertising in publications it provides an employer with an incentive not to advertise posts <e> <s> that is what we are getting at <e>", "<cs> i support the point which has been made by the noble baroness <e> <s> surely the definition must be such that it also catches the individual who takes the initiative to go knocking at a factory door and is offered employment

have his assurance that he will look at it again <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is connected to amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we are uneasy about amendment no <e> <s> because it will remove the power of the department to fix by regulation the form in which the monitoring returns should be made <e> <s> the minister rushed through amendments nos <e> <s> and and prepared to go on to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he may say that this amendment is merely of a technical nature but it is far more important than that <e> <s> if the department is not entitled to fix by regulation the form in which the returns are to be made then we on these benches believe that opens the way for wrecking tactics <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> i point out that the significance of this particular amendment is that it leaves out the words form of the returns <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee <e> <s> the criticism that we have levelled at

amendments nos <e> <s> and stand in the name of my noble friend lord blease <e> <s> i shall deal with them in reverse order <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lyell has introduced two major amendments and has described them as merely drafting amendments <e> <s> they are far more important than drafting amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> i regret to say is another example of the government chipping away at and eroding the existing provision in the bill relating to the purpose of periodic reviews by employers to determine what progress has been made towards providing equality of opportunity <e> <s> far from being just a technical amendment the amendment has worrying implications for the scope of affirmative action and of the reviews <e>", "<cs> the minister has been very helpful and we look forward with keen anticipation to the amendment to be tabled by the government before we arrive at the next stage of the proceedings <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are extremely worried about the last line of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment restricts the right of the commission to apply for information for a second time within six months of its original application <e> <s> that part of the amendment therefore restricts the ability of the employment commission to require employers to supply information <e> <s> we believe that that is another example of the government attempting to restrict the role of the commission and as such is unacceptable <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect i must say that the minister has not met the edge of the criticism made by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> surely it is a waste of resources and undermines the legislation if the commission cannot go back with a request for further and better particulars <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> we do not know whether an employer is embarking upon delaying tactics <e> <s> all we know is that the commission cannot come back for six months for further and better particulars <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble lord lord mottistone has said <e> <s> however i fear that we cannot agree to this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord has explained very clearly that if the amendment is agreed to it would prevent the commission from disclosing the decision of an employer to take affirmative action until a <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee but i must place on record that the objections that we have raised to the government amendments to clause apply with the same force to this amendment <e>", "<cs> we have listened to the noble lord lord lye repeating an argument that we have already heard <e> <s> if our arguments in respect of amendments nos <e> <s> and leave those amendments untouched clearly the definition of advertised is not sufficiently compehensive <e> <s> i wish to emphasise and repeat that point <e> <s> the government intend to give protection to advertisements by way of mouth so that they are monitored <e> <s> if the action of a person calling at a factory on his own initiative and obtaining employment as outlined by the noble baroness earlier is not monitored then the definition is inadequate <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for his defence of the governments position <e> <s> he seems to suggest that it will be for

the noble lord lord mottistone for whom i have every respect <e> <s> i am especially saddened because i am sure that he does voice the view of a powerful section of opinion in northern ireland <e> <s> i believe that all the amendments which have been moved by the noble lord would weaken the effectiveness of the commission and therefore the effectiveness of the measure <e> <s> if that represents and reflects the views of industry in northern ireland then i am indeed saddened <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord lord mottistone says and indeed what he has said <e> <s> however i am still saddened that there is this lack of trust on the part of industry as regards the commission <e> <s> it seems to me that the cumulative effect of these amendments although they are only exploratory at least creates the impression that the commission does not have the support of industry to the extent that i should like to see it enjoy such support <e>", "<cs> the point that i made was that under paragraph b siting a training centre in a certain area say the falls road area will benefit a certain community <e> <s> it could therefore be argued by those who are hostile to the legislation that because it favours that community it is in breach of paragraph a which prohibits benefiting a class of beneficiaries framed by reference to religious affiliation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond <e> <s> as i understand it an affirmative action scheme designed to increase the proportion of females securing promotion could also in the circumstances of northern ireland lead to a rise in the number of catholics securing promotion <e> <s> as the clause stands in our submission that would be unlawful because it would be discriminatory <e> <s> that is why we say that we have to work hard on this clause to get it right <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief indeed <e> <s> i think that the significance of the argument this evening is that it shows that there is immense uncertainty about the validity of the governments amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord lyell that we seek common aims <e> <s> however we do not think that the governments amendment will attain the desired result <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee except to emphasise once again that this is a core provision <e> <s> it is probably the most important provision in the entire bill <e> <s> for the reasons that i have given we believe that the governments amendment is flawed <e> <s> i have a feeling that after studying the words of the minister we shall still have to return to this clause at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great sympathy to my noble friend lord blease who has by his own example sought to work in partnership with members of both communities in northern ireland <e> <s> this amendment intends to ensure that non-protestants and non-catholics are not damaged by the affirmative action programmes <e>", "<cs> i am sure we accept that the certificate is only issued after the most careful consideration <e> <s> our amendment is not based on any evidence that that is not so <e> <s> but concern arises on the part of individuals who believe that they have been discriminated against <e> <s> it is their case that the certificate should be open to scrutiny by an independent third party <e> <s> we suggested judicial review because that is the procedure which applies in the case of certificates issued under the sex discrimination northern ireland order <e>", "<cs> again relying upon the ministers words and with the leave of my colleagues whose names were tabled in support of this amendment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much wish to support what the noble lord lord bonham-carter has told the committee <e> <s> our amendment in

initiative that led to the new order <e> <s> the northern ireland law society welcomes the order and wants to lose no time in getting it duly sealed and delivered <e> <s> i shall therefore not delay

blease for having supported the amendments as they did <e> <s> it occurred to me that if this amendment were acceptable to the house it would go a long way toward enhancing the status of the legislation and that of the commission since there would be a commission which is directly answerable to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much welcome amendment no <e> <s> and the subsequent amendments <e> <s> they give effect to the promise made by the minister in committee that this power to appoint the president should be transferred to the lord chancellor <e> <s> we are satisfied that this amendment and the others in the same vein will strengthen and improve the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord mottistone i should like to emphasise that we

government have fully recognised the mischief which their own amendment has created <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to the ministers explanation for these three amendments <e> <s> however the amendments are not confined to the situations mentioned by the minister <e> <s> we would point out that the purpose of this group of amendments is to provide employers with yet another line of defence where they have failed to carry out the orders of the tribunal <e> <s> it appears to us that once again the department is coming to the aid of the potential discriminator <e> <s> for that reason we are unable to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not find the ministers explanation to be totally satisfactory <e> <s> indeed considerable dissatisfaction was expressed in another place <e> <s> the minister refers to the power which i think is found in clause which will enable the department to vary the limit of hours <e> <s> however that power enables the department not merely to raise the limit but also to lower it which we find amazing <e> <s> i do not propose to press the amendment to a division but we shall wish to consider what has been said by the minister <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed that the minister has been unable to see his way clear to accept this amendment <e> <s> in support of the amendment i should tell the house that the weakness in the definition was spotted as long ago as by the standing advisory commission on human rights in northern ireland which is the governments advisory committee on human rights in the province <e> <s> that was the commissions view in but the government seem to have set their face against widening the definition <e> <s> therefore we believe that the bill will not work as well as the government hope <e> <s> it is an issue on which we should take the view of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to explain the position <e> <s> the amendment contains a reference to subsection <e> <s> however that is a mistake on our part <e> <s> earlier today we complained about being rushed into preparing our amendments on friday <e> <s> afterwards i realised that there should be no reference in this clause to subsection because it is to be a recommendation which is not accompanied by a penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i presented the case eloquently <e> <s> i fear that i failed to convince the noble lord of the essential nature of this amendment <e> <s> in any event the tribunal will have the power to make the recommendation <e> <s> that is part of its inherent jurisdiction and it will have that power <e> <s> there would be no need for this amendment had the government accepted our definition of indirect discrimination but that they have failed to do <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously a difficult and complex area of the bill <e> <s> there is a significant difference between the governments position and the position of the official opposition <e> <s> we believe that affirmative action programmes designed to rectify religious imbalance in the composition of the workforce must inevitably contain an element of direct discrimination on religious grounds <e> <s> but according to the bill employers are not allowed to take this factor into account when pursuing affirmative action <e> <s> we believe that in practice the governments position is untenable <e> <s> we are at a loss to understand why <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord for introducing this amendment to the bill but we are concerned about the proposal <e> <s> on second reading and again in committee we pressed the government to include redundancy procedures within the context of promoting equality of opportunity <e> <s> we thought that the progress towards fair participation should not be weakened or compromised by redundancy schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house will the minister indicate precisely what part of his amendment deals with the practice of last in first out <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for a few crumbs of comfort <e> <s> i have had a quick look at clause to which he has referred but i do not see the term defined there <e> <s> notwithstanding what the minister said it is puzzling why this definition was adequate when the white paper was published but is now no longer adequate <e> <s> that is not at all clear to me <e> <s> indeed if i may be frank we on these benches are left with the impression that the governments real reason for refusing to adhere to the definition in the white paper is possibly connected with their unwillingness to set themselves targets for reducing the staggering differential rate of unemployment between catholics and protestants <e> <s> that is the uneasy conviction which is growing among us <e> <s> however i shall not press the matter further this evening <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord lyell said <e> <s> it is a disappointing response bearing in mind that on the governments own evidence they have been considering the procedures since before the bill arrived in this house <e> <s> we did not say that the government had issued too many certificates <e> <s> we did not make that point <e> <s> the point we were trying to make was that whether the certificates were in number or not there was no means by which an individual who felt that he had been wrongly discriminated against could call for that certificate to be the subject of judicial review <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another amendment which causes us considerable concern <e> <s> the minister has explained the background <e> <s> it is designed to meet the difficulty which he identified <e> <s> the governments solution is to seek to get around the difficulty where there is a conflict between the two pieces of legislation by suspending the proceedings under the sex discrimination order until such time as the proceedings under the fair employment legislation including possible appeals have been concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his lengthy explanation of clause <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear asked the simple question how will the clause affect the principle of last in first out <e> <s> that is a practice deeply rooted in custom and history <e> <s> as i understand it a substantial part of the difficulty in northern ireland is how to overcome such practices <e> <s> the minister failed to answer that simple question <e> <s> the clause fails to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i wish to support the amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i wish to emphasise that it is the duty of the secretary of state for northern ireland when issuing a national security certificate to act fairly and to be seen to act fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord bonham-carter replies to the minister perhaps i may point out that the amendment moved by the noble lord and supported by me leaves intact the power of the secretary of state to do any act and that includes issuing a certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the ministers response <e> <s> the argument is highly technical and we shall have to reflect upon his words <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has said this is a very important bill for northern ireland <e> <s> it has provided us with an opportunity not likely to be repeated for many years to come to remove a major mischief namely unfair practice in employment in northern ireland <e> <s> it is also a complex bill containing baffling clauses and many interrelated provsions <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of these benches and in particular on behalf of my noble friend lord graham of edmonton and my noble friend lord underhill who was the principal spokesman on northern ireland affairs until a few years ago i should like to express our appreciation for the work of the noble lord lord lyell at the northern ireland office <e> <s> he was a man generous of spirit and he was genuinely interested in the well-being of the people of ulster <e> <s> throughout the five years he was at the northern ireland office he spared no effort to ensure that the concerns of these benches were always fully accommodated <e> <s> i should like to place our appreciation on record <e> <s> of course we wish the noble lord lord skelmersdale well in his new role and we know from our experience of him that he will bring a sense of fairness and conscientiousness to his office <e>", "<cs> my lords i have looked at this instrument and it is to be welcomed <e> <s> i have no questions to ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the provisions of this short but important order affecting the licensing laws of northern ireland <e> <s> it seems that the order can be viewed as the third package of the recent reform of the licensing acts in northern ireland the other two having been introduced in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for explaining the provisions of both orders indicating the disparities that will remain between the jurisdiction in northern ireland and the jurisdiction in england and wales and pointing out that the relevant part of the companies bill is still being discussed in another place <e> <s> i have consulted my colleagues who have responsibility for this specialised branch of the law and on their advice and in the light of the advice and information given to the house by the minister i am pleased on behalf of this side of the house to welcome both orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord nathan for not being in my place when the debate started and he introduced the report <e> <s> i too understood that the debate would not commence before <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has explained this brief order gives effect to a recommendation made by the noble viscount lord colville of culross when he reviewed in and again in the operations of the emergency provisions act <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the provisions of this order <e> <s> although we welcome the order i propose to spend a little time in commenting on some of its provisions <e> <s> i do so partly in order to obtain clarification and information and partly in order to illustrate once again the inadequacy of the order in council procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i said lectures <e> <s> i am not lecturing the house on that <e> <s> again we would have attempted to insert the word film in article c <e> <s> these are small points but they are matters that we could have tested had this order been subject to a bill procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord misunderstands the position <e> <s> it is not just the case that a northern ireland spokesman on these benches is desperately unhappy about the procedure <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i understand from the order that the youth council will require the approval of the department for its scheme for appointing staff generally <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the amendment which established in clause the opening clause of the bill the principle that a delay is likely to be prejudicial to the interests of the child <e> <s> we welcome that principle and that it should be established in clause of the bill <e> <s> it has been estimated that the bill will increase considerably the number of cases that could come before the courts <e> <s> mindful of the present delays in the courts we are bound to ask whether adequate resources will be made available so that the courts can cope with the increased volume of work without lengthening the delays <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord can tell the house now or possibly later at a more convenient stage how much thought is being given to the need for additional resources <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord lord mottistone and others <e> <s> however i am in a little doubt whether the amendment if it were accepted would be in conflict with subsection <e> <s> that subsection appears to me to override any agreement between the parties <e> <s> as i understand it we cannot at this stage amend subsection <e> <s> we could not therefore have two inconsistent provisions in the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether the department would <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> we on these benches are delighted that the government have accepted the amendment <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has said the noble lord lord henderson of brompton raised <e>", "<cs> my lords again i very much welcome amendment no <e> <s> with its central <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the purpose of this amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> is to convert the power contained in commons amendment no <e> <s> into a duty to give assistance <e> <s> i should point out that should that be acceptable to the house the duty to give assistance will be confined to assisting those young people who have left care but who qualify for advice and assistance under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house and of the noble and learned lord if i were to raise some anxieties about the guardians <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble and learned lord for the information that he has given us <e> <s> i am sure that those who are concerned about the independence and effectiveness of the panel will welcome the news that the government propose to secure a reserve power <e> <s> that is moving in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady david i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> my noble friend has asked me to apologise for the fact that she was unable to stay in the house to move the amendment and to speak in support of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his response to this amendment which as i said at the beginning is a probing amendment <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lady david and my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones will read with great interest the words spoken by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> they will be studied <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to come to the assistance of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> az <e> <s> if it is convenient to the house i shall speak at the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> bz to hz a c and d in general we welcome amendment no <e> <s> but there is concern about the fixing at eight years the age at which the legislation is to be applied <e> <s> there is also concern about the fees that are charged for registration and inspection <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should have mentioned that the amendments which i moved and which were supported by members of the house were and are supported by about voluntary organisations which have an interest in this field <e> <s> so there has been and continues to be widespread concern <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord mottistone said there is general support for the thrust of the regulations and the updated regulations <e> <s> nevertheless this concern remains <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much support the plea made by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> these are complex amendments to a complex bill <e> <s> it seems to me that time will show how well the bill is fitting together <e> <s> i hope that time will also show that it heralds the beginning of a family court <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord mishcon i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the contribution of the noble lord lord renton and i follow the emphasis which the noble and learned <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a valuable and constructive debate <e> <s> i am sure that the government will give serious consideration to the constructive suggestions and ideas expressed by almost everyone who has spoken <e> <s> at the outset i join other noble lords in paying full tribute to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having initiated the debate <e> <s> the noble lord has done so much over the years to bring to the attention of the house and through this house to the attention of the public the problems which exist in this area and which have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make it clear that although i speak from this bench i do so in a personal capacity <e> <s> it will be of some comfort to the house to know that i do not propose to detain it for long <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been waiting patiently for over half an hour for this opportunity of thanking the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his summary of the supplementary estimate which this order will approve <e> <s> we have been told by him that the substantial part of the special funding requested of parliament by the department of economic development is committed to two very important privatisation programmes completed earlier in the year <e> <s> and it is agreed that it is vital for the economy of belfast and the economy of northern ireland generally that short brothers plc and harland and wolff holdings plc should be trading successfully and at least maintaining their present labour force <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i thank the minister for explaining the contents of the order which is before the house <e> <s> it is a long order containing about articles and nine schedules <e> <s> indeed the minister correctly described it as a major piece of legislation <e> <s> i agree that there have been many changes since the first proposals were published <e> <s> but i must say to the minister that there is in general much criticism of what has been described as the inadequacy of the consultation which attended the preparation of the draft order although i appreciate that he has described the consultations as having been exhaustive <e> <s> that criticism is not simply confined to the ulster teachers union it is a pretty general criticism <e>", "<cs> we are grateful for the assistance of members of the committee who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> i have listened carefully to the authoritative advice given to the committee by the noble and learned lords <e> <s> however the fact remains that many people believe that it is difficult to obtain a judicial review of a decision <e> <s> we accept that we are talking about a judicial review and not a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the minister for his introduction of this very short but important order which we are asked to approve <e> <s> it is important because as the minister explained it enables the department and northern ireland electricity to take the necessary steps to pave the way for the transfer of the electricity industry in northern ireland from the public to the private sector although of course privatisation itself is an issue for another time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining as briefly as he has the terms of this order <e> <s> we on this side of the house very much welcome the order <e> <s> we would do well to remind ourselves that there are circumstances where a special statutory agency can play an important role in improving health care <e> <s> we have seen in england and wales how such an authority can stimulate interest in the problem promote co-operation between professionals and statutory authorities and of course help to mould public opinion <e>", "<cs> in support of my noble friend perhaps i may say that i also have read the shipping case <e> <s> the decision was taken at in the evening <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor tell us exactly what interests are covered by clause d <e> <s> the term is extremely wide <e> <s> it could cover a social moral financial or legal interest <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord explain what interest one has in mind <e>", "<cs> the amendment would place the matter beyond dispute <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has referred to the anton piller procedure <e> <s> that is an example of where an order can be made without the party having an opportunity to make representations <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment but we reserve the right to come back to it if clause remains part of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i said that in addition to reflecting the present position the amendment would extend the jurisdiction so that it applies to all other legal representatives and not merely to solicitors <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support which the amendment has drawn perhaps on grounds which i did not advance <e> <s> i am not convinced that the amendment should be withdrawn nevertheless i shall withdraw it <e> <s> we shall read carefully what has been said and consider whether the amendment should be brought back in a more perfected form so that the present principles will apply to all legal representatives <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from these benches we would very much like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is also my impression that subsections a b and c do not go far enough <e> <s> therefore we believe that the scope of clause ought to be widened so as to include the two categories of proceedings mentioned <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his response <e> <s> we must consider in particular whether his reassuring words address the mischief which those who instruct us believe should be met by the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the noble and learned lords the lord chancellor and the master of the rolls <e> <s> there is no less concern at the law society as to the rights of solicitors who qualify after the bill becomes law <e> <s> clearly the law society will have to consider carefully the advice that has been delivered in reply to the amendment <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> by virtue of clause the membership of the board will be balanced and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor must have regard to appointing persons with experience in or knowledge of the provision of conveyancing services and the financial arrangements associated with conveyancing <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for the support which this amendment has received <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans of claughton in particular has expressed the deep anxiety that exists in relation to this clause <e> <s> we fully support paragraph b to which the noble and learned lord referred <e> <s> our amendment fits in which paragraph b <e> <s> it does not detract from it but merely establishes that priority should be given to the maintenance of standards of integrity and fair dealing between the parties <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that response <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my patience has indeed been rewarded <e> <s> i am especially grateful for the noble and learned lords response <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we shall obviously have to read the reply of the noble and learned lord carefully <e> <s> however it seems to me that there is a clear difference between paragraphs b and c <e> <s> in the latter paragraph the bill requires the transaction to be <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask a further question following on from the comments of my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> if an employee of an authorised practitioner is also acting for the borrower is there not a special need to protect the confidentiality of the information which the employee has collected in the course of a conversation with the borrower <e> <s> otherwise is there not a possibility that the employee might be tempted to disclose that information to his employer in breach of privilege <e> <s> i am conscious of the decision given by the court of appeal two years ago in the case of <e>", "<cs> following the valuable contribution made by the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls i wish to mention another aspect which causes me some concern <e> <s> to some extent the interests of the employer and those of the borrower coincide because both are interested in acquiring a good and marketable title to the property <e> <s> but unlike the building society or the borrower the borrower-purchaser will be vitally concerned with the terms on which he acquires the title <e> <s> the lender may be less interested in the terms provided he gets a good and marketable title <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord for that encouraging reply <e> <s> it seems to us that it is not clear from clause as it stands that the regulations would cover this point but we are grateful for the response and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for an indication of the noble and learned lords thinking <e> <s> i do not propose to pursue the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdrawn the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has come <e>", "<cs> although i speak from the front bench i do so in a personal capacity <e> <s> i do not find the amendments helpful <e> <s> there are difficulties about the status of a person <e> <s> is it to be the status of a child is it to be the status of a fetus or what there are difficulties also over the status of a chattel <e> <s> the term is used in legislation for example in the sale of goods act but none of us would dream of using the term chattel in the sense that it is used in the sale of goods act <e> <s> i do not think the amendments are helpful and they should not be pushed any further <e>", "<cs> i very much respect the sincerity of the noble lord lord ashbourne but this amendment is a worrying amendment <e> <s> it really represents the most restricted and constrained approach towards the treatment that would otherwise be available under the bill <e> <s> it is restrictive and we must emphasise this in two ways <e> <s> first because the treatment is restricted to parties of a marriage whose union has been formalised either by a civil or a religious ceremony and the treatment would not be available to cohabiting couples or to a single woman <e> <s> i do not want to anticipate the debates that will be coming up later on the amendment in the name of the noble lady lady saltoun but we are entitled to ask why should treatment depend on marital status and why should the law discriminate against cohabiting couples or even single women <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the committee of a point made by the noble lord lord winstanley in response to an earlier debate today <e> <s> he made the very good point that the single woman who will seek treatment under the provisions of this bill will have thought deeply over the issue before deciding to receive treatment <e> <s> under the bill she will receive counselling and will have satisfied herself that she is adequately prepared for parenthood and all its implications <e> <s> that point should not be overlooked <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the supportive speech of the noble lord lord grantchester <e> <s> he described his amendment as being a minor one <e> <s> however if i understood him correctly it seems to me to be a major amendment <e> <s> i say that because it enables the secretary of state to restrict the activities which are listed in the schedule <e> <s> on any grounds having listened to certain representations if he believes that he ought to restrict the activity then he can do so <e> <s> this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for introducing the order and for his brief explanation of its main purpose <e> <s> i am sure almost everyone will agree that openness in government is the standard we must aim for <e> <s> the flow of information is essential in a democracy if there is to be informed criticism of government policies and actions and the use of public resources <e> <s> that point must be continually stressed <e> <s> i am sure the minister is aware that many people are critical of this government for not doing as much as they should to achieve the aim of open government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help the house just a little further <e> <s> i understand that the government come to the view that a matter is of national interest but in fact is that assessment open to challenge in the courts <e> <s> that is the first question <e> <s> the second question arises really from my few comments on the order <e> <s> am i right that it is the civil aviation authority that has the power to destroy documents <e> <s> i asked the minister in what circumstances and under what conditions it would destroy documents <e> <s> is the noble earl able to help the house on that second issue <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that the government form the view that a matter is in the national interest <e> <s> is that self-assessment open to challenge in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the point but i shall not detain the house for long <e> <s> in that case of the three authorities named in schedule which one is empowered to direct the disposal of documents <e> <s> i had assumed that the disposal of documents meant the destruction of documents <e>", "<cs> we have had a discussion on an odd mixture of about amendments <e> <s> there is not always a common theme among those amendments <e> <s> i am not surprised that the noble and learned lord lord jauncey got his papers mixed up at one stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the government are mindful of the fact that many couples who are desperate to have a child can ill afford to pay the fees <e> <s> it is recorded that people who are not well-to-do have mortgaged their homes in order to pay for the treatment <e> <s> the government should bear in mind that in addition to the burden of infertility people often have to mortgage their homes in order to pay for the treatment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord walton gave helpful guidance to the committee namely that one should draw a distinction between a licence for treatment and a licence to undertake research <e> <s> if the amendment had been in place if this had been the law of the land would robert <e> <s> edwards of cambridge and anne mclaren of the mrc have been able to make the contribution they made <e>", "<cs> initially i found the amendment attractive but i ran into difficulties because i believe that there is a precedent for the clause in section of the family law reform act which deals with artificial insemination <e> <s> for the sake of consistency therefore i would follow the wording of the bill <e>", "<cs> i too have difficulty in understanding clause <e> <s> will the husband who has given consent for his sperm to be used in the assisted fathering of his own child by his wife be treated by the bill as the father of the child <e> <s> the clause appears to provide two different answers to that question <e> <s> by virtue of clause he will be treated as the father <e> <s> however as was said by the noble baroness lady elles by virtue of clause a he will not be treated as the father <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord skelmersdale has explained that the order is purely a consolidation measure <e> <s> i assume from that that the licensing law in northern ireland works pretty well and that there is no mischief that needs to be addressed in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support the powerful case that has been presented by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> he referred to the possible evil that may flow unless this clause is amended <e> <s> the real fear must be that where the authorised practitioners services are provided by its solicitor agent the client will be denied independent legal or financial advice <e> <s> if that were to happen it could open the door to the evil to which my noble friend has referred or at least to a diminution in the standard of service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat dismayed by the response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> we believe that we are possibly exaggerating the financial burden which would be borne by the authorised practitioners <e> <s> i am told that any company or firm offering conveyancing services would almost certainly need to instruct an accountant for various other purposes such as the companies act auditing and the production of accounts for tax purposes <e> <s> the accountant instructed for these purposes is unlikely to charge the institution a considerable additional sum if he is instructed to produce a report certifying that the institution had complied with the regulations made under clause f <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his favourable response <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble and learned lord for his reassuring response <e> <s> i take the point that he does not consider that the law societys powers are a precedent in that respect but we are nevertheless pleased that the matter is being given further consideration <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we were very pleased indeed to read the amendments tabled by the noble lord the lord chancellor and we are grateful that he has moved to meet the concerns that we expressed in committee <e> <s> i understand that the law society is also pleased with the amendments though it believes that they may not go far enough to meet its anxieties <e> <s> however i understand that it proposes to study the amendments further and it may well be that the other place will come back to this amendment for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that the amendment does not include coroners who are merely medical practitioners <e> <s> i am delighted with the noble and learned lords response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the response of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am sure the fault must be mine that i did not make it sufficiently clear that the amendment was aimed at a lender or a supplier who advertises or otherwise gives publicity to his offer of a combined service <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall consider carefully what the noble and learned lord said and decide whether or not this is a matter to which we should return at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ashbourne acknowledged that the amendment comes up against the point of principle that we discussed in committee namely that treatment should be available to all who can benefit from it subject only to proper counselling and clinical advice prior to treatment <e> <s> both those aspects have been emphasised in the two amendments which have been moved and accepted this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the objection to the amendment on two grounds <e> <s> although the amendment gives an option to the mother or the father to register an entry in the birth register it does not overcome the objection that it would be unfair and unjust to the child that for the rest of his life he must carry the label that he is a child by donation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for having given the house a fair summary of the contents of the order <e> <s> i propose to confine my comments to a few items which are related to the votes of the department of economic development the department of health and social services and the department of finance and personnel respectively <e> <s> it is appropriate that i start with the economy <e> <s> the strengthening of the northern ireland economy continues to be a major priority of the government <e> <s> there is nothing between the political parties on the importance of that objective <e> <s> we know that unemployment remains exceptionally high <e> <s> it is at an average of about per cent <e> <s> of the working population compared with an average of about per cent <e> <s> on the mainland <e> <s> we know that the growth of output is still disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the response of the noble and learned lord is a little worrying <e> <s> it leaves the door open for regulations to be made in the future which would enable the identification of the donors to be made available <e> <s> it is feared that that could have a serious impact on the supply of donors <e> <s> nevertheless at this stage i do not propose to press the amendment to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords some noble lords may have overlooked clause <e> <s> a young person under the age of years who intends to marry may appoint an agent to apply to the authority for the information which is required <e> <s> as i understand the matter the authority will disclose the information to the young person <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the amendment moved by the noble viscount is wise and should be supported <e> <s> under paragraph of the schedule the authority may appoint inspectors but the point of the amendment is that it should be under a statutory duty to do so <e> <s> the authority should be under such a duty first in order to ensure that the licence holders comply with the terms of the licence <e> <s> the inspectors would be the eyes and ears of the authority <e> <s> secondly we need the provision in order to reassure the public <e> <s> for those two reasons i very much support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the th annual report of the law society is the last report which will be issued by that body <e> <s> we should thank the law society for its stewardship of the legal aid system for or is it years <e> <s> it seems that it was left to the lord chancellors advisory committee to draw attention to our misgivings and to the areas which are the justified cause of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment which has been moved by the noble lord lord hacking for the reasons which he has advanced and which i shall not repeat <e> <s> however i can confirm that it is the custom and practice in my part of the world for our county court judges and registrars to permit solicitors clerks to be heard in chambers in the county court <e> <s> we believe that the opportunity should now be taken in this bill to confirm that convention and custom <e> <s> i am pleased to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the principle of the amendment <e> <s> it would establish a fiduciary relationship between the authorised <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to welcome this amendment <e> <s> it is more or less in line with the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mishcon at report stage and so we welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his sympathetic response to the principle of the amendment <e> <s> he has gone a long way to meeting the concern of the national consumer council and of the law society <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for the manner in which he moved this brief but not unfamiliar order <e> <s> he rightly refreshed our memories about the range of the emergency and anti-terrorist powers which are to continue in force for yet another year <e> <s> they are powers of fundamental importance to the freedom of the individual the privacy of his home and to the rule of law <e> <s> the need for their renewal after two decades of violence and direct rule must be a source of sadness <e> <s> whether it is necessary to renew each and every one of the powers or to do so without modification or without stronger safeguards are matters which rightly exercised many of my colleagues in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to us to address a gap in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for introducing this long overdue order <e> <s> i am sure that all of us share its principal objectives except that article will not be agreeable to trespassers and article will not be agreeable to fare dodgers as they will have less comfortable and more expensive journeys in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press the matter further but it would have been of assistance to have made clear on the face of the order the circumstances in which the department can revoke a permit <e> <s> if the department will reflect on that point i am content <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his explanation of this fairly technical but nevertheless important order <e> <s> from the inquiries which i have made from trade unionists in northern ireland it seems that there may be mixed feelings about the value of this order though it is fair to say that on balance they give it a cautious welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the position of staff employed by training boards who have not at this stage opted for transfer to the department but may in future opt for their functions to be transferred to the department <e> <s> will the staff employed by those training boards be eligible for transfer to the northern ireland civil service <e>", "<cs> a shadow board my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for responding to most of the questions i raised <e> <s> however he has not indicated or explained why we should only have two trade union representatives on the board whereas there are five representatives from industry <e> <s> perhaps he can explain the reason for this formula <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining the order and for giving the house some information about the iplo <e> <s> he also reminded us of the statutory consequences of the act of proscription <e> <s> a heavy penalty is imposed on a person who belongs or professes to belong to the organisation on a person soliciting support financial or otherwise for the organisation or on a person who carries out its directions <e> <s> as i understand it the order adds to the list of the organisations proscribed under the act <e> <s> there are now eight such organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate is in a sense as the minister said a routine debate but nevertheless we are approving for northern ireland an important order which authorises the expenditure of billion of public funds on services in the province during the financial year <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his full explanation of the main components of the order although one cannot go along with the governments underlying optimism about the state of the northern ireland economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation of the principal contents of this wide-ranging and very detailed order <e> <s> on my rough count it repeals over provisions in seven earlier pieces of legislation <e> <s> in addition the tortuous schedule and schedule a contain about amendments to two principal acts and two orders <e> <s> i have not been professionally involved in planning law but i am sure that the practitioners in northern ireland would be delighted if the department could now introduce an order to consolidate the legislation in this area <e> <s> i wonder whether that legislation is likely to be put in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i was drawing a distinction between the making of a plan and the alteration of a plan <e> <s> i had understood that in the making of a plan a party who would be affected would be notified <e> <s> however when a plan is altered such a party is not notified <e> <s> one merely serves notice of the proposed change <e> <s> i thought that there was that distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be brief on this matter <e> <s> we unquestionably back this order <e>", "<cs> my lords the existence of the initiative is at least an acknowledgement that the valley communities of south wales face severe problems <e> <s> can the minister tell the house what part of the million to which he referred is new money which has been channelled to the initiative <e> <s> secondly are we to conclude that at present the department has no specific objectives for the initiative to be achieved by <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady birk and to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for their unqualified support for the amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful for the sympathy shown towards it by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his comprehensive review of government policies in northern ireland during the past months <e> <s> i welcome his encouraging words <e>", "<cs> to move towards peace and reconciliation in the s almost a quarter of a century ago <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not pay that tribute three weeks ago when we last discussed northern ireland business in the house <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the tenor of his response <e> <s> he quite rightly identified the critical question whether clause c provides an adequate defence for the national identity and culture of scotland wales and northern ireland <e> <s> i am content that the government should consider the application of clause ci to the traditional regions of england <e> <s> obviously one must study carefully the ministers reply but as he has undertaken to review the clause i am pleased to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i reserve the right to come back on report if by then we are not satisfied with the response of the government <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly welcome clause and regret that i did not welcome it when we discussed an earlier amendment last week <e> <s> however i have two questions for the minister merely for information <e> <s> one relates to amendment no <e> <s> a and the other to amendment no <e> <s> d <e>", "<cs> the bbc may not wish to draw on the fund <e> <s> ought not the committee to have the power to spend part of its funds in support of gaelic language programmes produced by the bbc <e>", "<cs> i very much support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord blease <e> <s> the amendments to which he spoke are fully consistent with clause <e> <s> they are also consistent with the positive policy which the government have adopted towards the irish language in northern ireland during the past two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read the report of the discussion in another place it appeared to me that worries had been expressed about this new clause and in particular about subsection <e> <s> as i understand it the effect of the clause including subsection is to ensure that the legal rights of a disabled child born as a result of an ivf pregnancy will be precisely the same as those of a child born after natural pregnancy <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord confirm that interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation <e> <s> i am sure that it will reassure all those who have expressed concern about the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister of drawing the attention of the house to the two effects of this very brief but important order <e> <s> as the law now stands the review would be undertaken in and then every years thereafter <e> <s> as a result of the order the commissioner will be appointed within weeks instead of having to wait weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i was present during the discussions on the governments amendment and on the amendment tabled by my noble friend lady white at report stage <e> <s> i did not speak in the debate because at that stage i was not unduly worried by the governments amendment <e> <s> i agree that in general it is desirable that there should be consistency in terminology <e> <s> i was also impressed by the fact that section of the wales act contained wording almost identical with that contained in the governments amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment <e> <s> it meets fully the concerns that we expressed at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i thank the noble and learned lord for promoting the coroner to be an office-holder eligible for appointment as a circuit judge <e> <s> we are grateful for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the manner in which she has introduced the bill <e> <s> she has given the house a brief outline of the history of the island of caldey <e> <s> for that i say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his explanation of the order <e> <s> although the articles of the order do not have the merit of simplicity its main underlying objective is simple <e> <s> it is right in principle as i am sure your lordships will agree <e> <s> that principle is that the offender should be relieved of the profits of his crime so as to remove the financial attractiveness of the offence <e> <s> that principle has been adopted in recent legislation as the minister explained <e>"]
