["<cs> my lords this white paper is a very short policy paper but important and notable for all that <e> <s> we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy for bringing it to the attention of the house <e> <s> the initiative the sense of direction and the influence which the msc has generated are in my view to be welcomed <e> <s> the speed at which it gets things done is politically attractive but and there is a but there is also considerable suspicion hostility and bitterness towards the msc by some of the local authorities as they see the commission usurping their powers <e> <s> all this has not been helped by the high-handed manner the high-handed approach of the government to local authorities as demonstrated by lack of consultation over this paper <e> <s> indeed this has been referred to in a number of speeches this afternoon <e> <s> it is also to be regretted that although the msc is building on the platform constructed over decades by the local authorities this is not recognised in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we warmly support this amendment <e> <s> the voice of the disabled and in relation to the needs of the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill the voice of a near relative or a friend or those voluntary bodies which have evinced shown and demonstrated an interest in the services for the handicapped should be heard effectively in the commission <e> <s> it would appear to us that the dialogue with the disabled should be accepted as central and should therefore be reflected in the commission <e> <s> we consider that the amendment represents a considerable improvement and we are pleased to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considerable respect for my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> i wish to express my appreciation of his contribution <e> <s> we are greatly indebted to him <e> <s> indeed the house must be grateful to all those who have been tilling the soil in committee <e> <s> i regret deeply that i was unable to assist at that stage <e> <s> i appreciate fully that there are members of your lordships house who are well qualified to express a considered opinion on this measure and who are unable to go along with its provisions <e> <s> i accept their position <e> <s> i appreciate their point of view <e> <s> indeed the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> from these benches we give full support to the measure and welcome its provisions <e> <s> i am sure that the house will be interested in the ministers response to the important questions which have been posed by the noble lord <e> <s> lord winstanley <e> <s> i do not propose to address any awkward questions to the minister this evening <e> <s> we consider the bill to be valuable and non-controversial <e> <s> it is acknowledged that there is a need to make adjustments to the law governing the issues in this delicate field and to update the law in the light of the experience encountered since and and the advances made during the last century in medical knowledge <e> <s> it merely remains for me to thank my noble friend lord rea for introducing the bill and for having explained in broad outline its provisions and its historical background <e> <s> my noble friend was well qualified to discharge the task <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord longford was unable to stay for the report stage and has asked me to apologise to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for his absence but nevertheless to express his support and his sympathy for the bill <e> <s> there are very few people who would challenge or even question the principle of participation embodied in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the bill is improved by the inclusion of the definition of the word discrimination <e> <s> it is not an easy word to define in the context of the bill and it is therefore helpful that the bill should contain a definition which is built on the concept of adverse conditions and less favourable treatment <e> <s> definitions can make for rigidity that is the risk with definitions <e> <s> but the definition proposed by the noble baroness contains room for flexibility in both paragraphs <e> <s> moreover if the circumstances of which a disabled person complains cannot be brought within either of the conditions specified in this definition it may well be brought under the heading of disadvantage with emphasis on detriment and loss <e> <s> therefore i am glad to support the amendment <e>"]
