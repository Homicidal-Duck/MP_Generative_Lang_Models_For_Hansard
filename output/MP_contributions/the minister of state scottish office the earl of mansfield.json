when my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy has had opportunity to consider all the implications he will make a statement on fast reactor policy <e> <s> the governments objective is to ensure that the country has access to the technology necessary to enable the fast reactor to be introduced on a commercial scale as and when the country needs it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord asks a rhetorical question and not strictly rhetorically perhaps i may answer it here and now <e> <s> of course i did not mean the noble lord <e> <s> but equally he will acknowledge that he does keep some pretty strange company <e>", "<cs> my lords the organisation of ballot votes of the membership of the national union of mineworkers is a matter for that union <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy is making in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows with permission mr speaker i wish to make a statement about the privatisation of britoil <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture and fisheries in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> if i may begin on a personal note it gives me pleasure to recall that some years ago my father rose in his place in your lordships house to speak in support of what was to become the mental health scotland act <e> <s> he spoke with some authority having been for many years chairman of the board of management of a large mental hospital <e> <s> the confidence with which i recommend this bill to your lordships is enhanced by the knowledge that it would have met with his wholehearted approval <e>", "<cs> my lords the fast reactor is of major and strategic importance for the united kingdoms and indeed the worlds future energy supplies <e> <s> therefore on behalf of the government i welcome this opportunity for debate which the noble earl lord halsbury has given the house <e> <s> i congratulate him on the exceptionally lucid manner with which he explained matters which at first blush are extremely complex technical and too much for the lay citizen <e> <s> coming within just a few days of the fast reactor policy announcement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy his motion is especially timely and appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill makes provision for the statutory limit on the borrowing of the scottish electricity boards to be increased from million to million <e> <s> the boards operate a joint generating agreement to enable them to run the most efficient power stations in scotland at any one time to meet demand throughout scotland and it is therefore appropriate that as has been the case since there should be a joint statutory limit on the borrowing required by both boards to finance the programme <e> <s> also in accordance with established practice the bill makes provision for an interim borrowing limit of million which may be exceeded only once an order to extend the limit has been made <e> <s> such orders are subject to affirmative resolution procedure in another place <e> <s> the interim limit which is likely to be reached during may either be increased directly to the final limit of million or increased by a smaller amount leaving the move to the final limit to be made by order at a later stage <e> <s> the opportunity is therefore provided at these times to review the boards performance in relation to the borrowing limits <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the valuation plant and machinery scotland order a copy of which was laid before the house on th january be approved <e> <s> when the house considered the local government and planning scotland bill on th may last year i indicated that the government wished to use the powers contained in that bill to exclude from valuation certain external plant and machinery as early as possible <e> <s> our purpose was to remove the anomaly which at present disadvantages scottish industry whereby plant and machinery situated out of doors is rated while similar plant either indoors in scotland or anywhere in england or wales is excluded from rating <e> <s> the order gives effect to this intention <e> <s> assuming approval by the house it will bring about broad parity of treatment so far as valuation for rating is concerned for external plant throughout great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are aware that the current economic recession has caused difficulties for the industries indigenous to islay <e> <s> however our policies have achieved a substantial reduction in inflation which will help industry generally and we have increased support both for agriculture and for the highlands and islands development board <e> <s> the board has extensive powers to assist a very wide range of economic and social development and will continue to encourage and support potentially viable developments on islay <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the scottish valuation advisory council have looked at possible changes to the valuation system in scotland with regard to these and related matters <e> <s> my right honourable friend is considering their advice and will decide what action should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to introduce changes in the law governing the relationship between agricultural landlords and tenants in scotland changes affecting the procedure for determining rent in rent review cases which go to arbitration and the arrangements for succession on the death of a tenant <e> <s> the house may find it helpful if i briefly describe the background to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee upon the bill <e>"]
