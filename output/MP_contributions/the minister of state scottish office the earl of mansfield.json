["<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord has said this amendment is consequential to the previous amendment no <e> <s> which was agreed to on a division on the last occasion upon which this bill was considered on <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision to site the borders district general hospital at huntlyburn was taken in when the site was acquired <e> <s> i am not aware that there was any opposition from the royal fine art commission for scotland at that stage <e> <s> the decision was endorsed at the end of by the borders regional council as planning authority after full consultation with all interested parties and the consideration of representations <e> <s> their representations included a suggestion by the commission that the site be changed to tweedbank <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state is satisfied that huntlyburn is the best location for the hospital and planning on this basis is at an advanced stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could answer the point made by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> if he can contain himself for about a year scotland will have its own scheme <e> <s> the reason why we are a little behind the sassenachs here is for this reason that a consultative paper was issued at the end of last year to all independent and grant-aided secondary schools and to a number of interested bodies such as the main teaching associations the scottish council of independent schools cosla and the stuc <e> <s> the consultation period does not end until st march the end of this month and therefore the details of the scheme cannot be fully considered until later in the year <e> <s> but the plan is that a separate scheme on similar lines to the english one is being planned and it is hoped that it will commence simultaneously in august or september <e>", "<cs> my contribution is in no sense of the word a summing up or winding up of the debate <e> <s> it is just another small scottish input which probably would have been more appropriate after the speech of the noble lord lord ross but for a short while i was deflected from intervening <e> <s> it is not perhaps inappropriate that i should intervene at this juncture because noble lords from scotland will appreciate that part of my ministerial responsibility embraces the highlands and islands <e> <s> there is no part of the united kingdom which more enjoys if that is the right word a more fragile economy than that beautiful comparatively unspoilt but sad part of the united kingdom <e> <s> at the same time there is no part of the united kingdom which does not merit more greatly and which in fact enjoys the governments concern <e>"]
