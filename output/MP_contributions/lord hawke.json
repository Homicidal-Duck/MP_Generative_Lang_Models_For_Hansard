["<cs> my lords i certainly agree with some of the things that the noble lord lord jacques said and i hope the government will listen to his remarks about employment in hong kong and south korea and i would add in other far eastern countries as well because their industries are a positive menace to anything we have got in europe <e> <s> in the past i have sometimes noticed that a government coming to power with a decent majority can go through a state of euphoria and then are apt to relapse into arrogance but i do not think this government are going to do that because they face such daunting problems and at any rate we know that we have a foreign secretary in this house who will listen <e>", "<cs> my lords has any consideration been given to turning surplus eec sugar into motor spirit as was done in brazil during the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point may i remind him that a great deal of british output is produced by small proprietary firms <e> <s> these are the people who will now benefit <e> <s> at present if they back a loser they go bankrupt but if they back a winner the government take all <e> <s> those firms will benefit greatly by this budget <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell me exactly what subsection means <e> <s> to a lay reader of the bill it looks as though a fraudulent director can issue fraudulent shares <e> <s> nothing in this subsection will prevent the validity of those shares <e> <s> that cannot be right i am sure i must have misread it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he can say what happens to hovercraft which are not owned by the railways board <e> <s> do they have by-laws already <e> <s> is this to apply to them or are they to have new by-laws <e>", "<cs> my lords may i confirm what my noble friend lord onslow has said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer will be received with the greatest regret by all the inhabitants of west sussex <e> <s> does this mean that any bargain done with the aid of a government agency can be repudiated by the central government if they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is time for two minutes from me though i apologise for not putting my name down in advance <e> <s> i am by no means a tee-totaller but i recognise that there exists an awful problem <e> <s> we cannot fail to recognise it as we go about the countryside <e> <s> we see young men with pot-bellies doing various jobs and the odds are that they have been caused by drinking too much beer <e> <s> in fact in talking with them you find that they have all got their capacity taped to the nearest pint and they tell you they are men of seven pints or pints a day <e> <s> i even heard of a foreman who went up to pints a day <e> <s> that is absolutely intolerable <e> <s> we all know of executives who have been corrupted by the occupational hazard of having to indulge in too many business lunches where drink being completely free flows freely and is imbibed in larger quantities than is really wise or necessary <e> <s> we know about the absenteeism that results from over-indulgence <e> <s> we see the huge rows of cars outside the pubs every night knowing that practically every one of those drivers is over the legal limit but they never seem to be caught <e> <s> and we know that almost every act of vandalism or hooliganism in the country is caused generally by young men who cannot hold their liquor <e> <s> we do not know really what can be done about it <e> <s> when such people get to the stage of being pronounced alcoholics a medical society or some such organisation may get to them and try to cure them but then it is really too late <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain exactly what is meant by an alcoholic <e> <s> there must be some way of defining an alcoholic and it would be helpful to know <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government agree that for strategic purposes it is absolutely essential to maintain both a cotton and a woollen textile industry of a reasonable size in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords are her majestys government aware that they are innocents living in a world of artful dodgers and that unless they find some better method to protect our textile industry then this industry which is vital for strategic reasons will just die <e>", "<cs> my lords is any survey for mineralisation taking place in the mountains of north yemen <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord moves away from clause can he explain to us laymen exactly what circumstances obtain when these multiple damage judgments are given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord arrange for some kind of television documentary on how to prepare a safe quarter in the house <e> <s> that would get round much more quickly than pamphlets <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord wigoder has made the point which definitely decides me against the amendment that lawyers who specialise in getting criminals off the hook will certainly tell their man in general terms always make an awful row in the police station and say stop beating me <e>", "<cs> my lords have her majestys government ever considered putting an extra tax on the purchase by foreigners of property in this country <e> <s> a tremendous amount of property is now changing hands and is being bought by arabs dutch people and others <e>", "<cs> i was thinking of saying a few words but i will postpone them until after the statements <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have ever spoken in such baffling circumstances <e> <s> i wanted to say one or two words about the background to the detail that has been dealt with so ably by my noble friend lord sandys <e> <s> for a number of years i have viewed with concern and interest the tussle going on in this country between the producers and the non-producers the producers being those in work and the non-producers being the people at school the old age

lords will her majestys government consider a suggestion that i have made more than once in the past namely that this aid to developing countries should be on a lease lend basis rather than on a cash or loan basis <e> <s> because as her majestys government well know almost to a man these countries are completely broke <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend has not made it absolutely clear that one of the objects of this exercise is to reduce the public sector borrowing requirements which are extremely high and to get down the frightful rate of interest <e> <s> i have stayed occasionally in british rail hotels and it is quite obvious to me that an awful lot of money needs to be spent on them to bring them really up to date <e> <s> also of course the cross-channel ferries and so on are an absolute sink for money <e> <s> the government would have to put in very many millions of pounds in both those directions to bring all the services up to date so why not bring in some private capital whether by shares debentures or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say whether there is any limit to the size of a harem for which a person can claim supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the recent heavy fall in the retail price of english lamb has been at the expense of the hill farmers or not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for just one minute <e> <s> as one who lived on lord keynes staircase at kings for seven years i am perfectly certain that he would have exposed professor friedman as he exposed the versailles treaty if he had been alive today <e> <s> but i am perfectly certain he would never approve of borrowing thousands of millions of pounds at anything between and per cent <e> <s> he would have regarded government investment in all these things at per cent <e> <s> as appropriate today <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that whatever the complications of the sheepmeat rgime may be at least it has enabled the british consumer to buy british sheepmeat at a reasonable price and cheaper than imported new zealand meat <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down on the list of speakers but i did not know until one oclock that i was going to be here today <e> <s> the subject of energy conservation is an admirable one and we are all in favour of it <e> <s> as to whether this particular bill is necessary for that purpose i have grave doubts myself but if it is necessary for us to be able to sell our machines in the common market then so be it let us have the bill <e> <s> the great waste that is going on as the noble lord lord wynne-jones has just said was started off by the offices shops and railway premises bill a good old conservative nannying bill and since then all the young men in offices have always worked with their coats off they are so hot <e> <s> what is more in the case of almost every shop you walk into after minutes i want to go out again because i am completely overheated <e> <s> how the unfortunate assistants stand it i do not know but that is where savings are to be made <e> <s> also of course one goes into the city of london today and sees these hideous jungles of blocks of concrete inhabited by international bankers all of them air-conditioned and putting a very heavy load on the electricity grid <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government join opec and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that he will have to have a tower of babel at gatwick judging by the passengers i see every day i come up to london <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way and before he leaves that point i have been listening to such speeches for over years and there have been several opportunities for governments to set up this wonderful body that will co-ordinate everything and tell everyone how to do it but no one has succeeded in doing so <e> <s> how does the noble lord think that he will do it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to illustrate one point <e> <s> i am all in favour of his thesis and the money is to be provided by private persons who presumably will provide it at the interest rates of the day <e> <s> is the noble lord satisfied that a capital programme can make such savings today as will pay for the enormous rates of interest extant in the market today <e>", "<cs> it would help if the noble lord would say what they are going to get out of the extra pound if they become sick or unemployed <e> <s> it is to some extent an insurance scheme <e> <s> is the rich man going to get any more benefit than the a week man <e>", "<cs> i have attended your lordships proceedings quite regularly for about years and i must say that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has raised a point that is new to me <e> <s> i think he is right and that we should have thought of it before <e> <s> what clinches the matter for me is that these contributions are raised in the same way as income tax and probably the same cheque from the same person covers both and for that reason i believe it is merely a branch of income tax <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend to deal with one point because i do not think he has really dealt with the question of whether it is to be historic or current cost accounting <e> <s> presume the directors of a company can choose which they like at the moment and say that it is a fair view but the results may be markedly different <e> <s> which in practice is the fair view <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment may i ask my noble friend to look at it again because as an ordinary investor i should very much like to see these things in the company accounts <e>", "<cs> i quite appreciate that but will my noble friend remember that we investors are rather inclined to be lazy-minded and we do not like having to do arithmetic in order to discover the facts that we want to learn <e>", "<cs> i spotted this too though not from the technical angle that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has done <e> <s> one realises of course that it is only proper that profits realised by for instance hire purchase people should come into their profit and loss when only they have actually got the cash in hand <e> <s> but what about a bank that lends money <e> <s> if a bank lends money i presume at the moment it brings into its profit and loss account the interest on that money quite regardless of whether or not the loan has been paid back <e> <s> if i am right i think the noble lord lord bruce must be correct in suggesting that realised is not quite the right word for this paragraph <e>", "<cs> it might well be that the interest had not been paid the loan is still outstanding and perhaps the interest is only paid after the date of the balance sheet <e>", "<cs> i again approach the matter as an ordinary investor and in that capacity i am rather disappointed with my noble and learned friends reply <e> <s> from the investors point of view if some companies adopt historic and some current cost accounting it will be most muddling and it will be impossible to compare the results <e> <s> suppose a person is thinking of making an investment in say the engineering section and he finds that half the companies are doing historic cost and half current cost he will not know where he stands without doing a tremendous amount of arithmetic <e> <s> whereas if as the noble lord lord bruce of donington says they were bound to show the historic cost figures and could then show the others if their accountants thought them more relevant at least he would know where he stands in comparing the results of one company with another <e>", "<cs> i suggest to my noble and learned friend that the answer to that one is that it depends on which firm of accountants is doing the accounts one firm will favour historic and another may favour current <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend explain the difference between a listed investment and a listed investment on a recognised stock exchange <e> <s> that is what is rather defeating me at the moment <e>", "<cs> i do not want the noble lord to waste pen and ink in writing to me i want him just to look at the bill and see whether it is necessary in some way to redefine them because i still do not understand why some are listed and some are listed on a stock exchange <e>", "<cs> may i repeat that i still do not understand the difference between a listed investment and one which is listed on a recognised stock exchange <e> <s> the ones that are just listed what are they listed on <e>", "<cs> no i merely want the bill to be put right if it is wrong <e>", "<cs> i really would suggest to my noble friend then that he should insert in the bill some phrase such as <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend because i was the secretary of the conservative committee in this house which considered the act but i am afraid i have forgotten the contents of section <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend would consider replacing the word listed in line by the word corporate it might make things a little clearer <e>", "<cs> supposing ian smith charles robinson and ian stewart band together in a partnership can they register themselves as ici <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether his figure includes only those houses which are habitable at present or whether it also includes those very many houses which could be made habitable if money were spent upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords undoubtedly the figure of causes concern but to me it is an incredibly low figure if it includes those houses which could be put into operation if some money were spent upon them <e>", "<cs> as one who lives at the edge of a fairly large forestry commission estate i would regret it if it were ever sold and went into private hands <e> <s> i am sure that the first thing that would go up will be the trespassers will be prosecuted boards <e> <s> it is the favourite dog walk area for most of the large town of horsham <e> <s> as my noble friend lord inglewood has said i do not think the amendment is quite practical because we have access at the moment to this forest only by courtesy of the forestry commission <e> <s> to give anybody a legal right to go there would be inimical possibly to the growing of timber <e>", "<cs> i have two questions which i should like to ask about the scope of this clause <e> <s> i think we have been talking on clause stand part for a long time now but i have reserved my questions for this <e> <s> it seems to me that if we get the world of science fiction as foreshadowed by my noble friend lord robbins who knows more about these things than i do we may get power transmitted from a central <e>", "<cs> i am greatly unreassured because i understand the noble earl to say that if we succeed in broadcasting power it will be covered by the monopoly of this body <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i think that some of the arguments put forward by the noble lord are probably special pleading on behalf of the post office people rather than the telecommunications people <e> <s> in the long run if you consider the future of this industry the telecommunications people will be on to a winner and the others will be on to a loser <e> <s> it stands to reason that those who are on to a winner stand to receive better pensions than those who are on to a loser <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend about one point that rather troubles me <e> <s> living in a rural area with some extensions to the telephone many people are in the same boat of course those extensions belong to and are rented from the post office at the moment <e> <s> after the passage of this bill the post office will presumably come and mend my main telephone free of charge as they do at the moment but will it be incumbent upon them to come and mend the extensions free of charge as they do at the moment or will they be able to levy a charge for doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister sits down may i just ask him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe my noble friend quite got the point <e> <s> i was asking whether there would be a charge in respect of existing ancillary services those that are being maintained free of charge at the moment <e> <s> i refer to those cases where british telecom own the apparatus and rent it out to the subscriber <e> <s> in future after this bill passes will there be a charge <e>", "<cs> i take some interest in this part of the bill because i would have had to qualify together with one of my children under this clause <e> <s> i think i would have qualified under <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that owing to the rise in the price of oil dozens of countries all over the world are virtually bankrupt and if we are to continue to trade with those countries the rates of the ecgd will have to go up a great deal as otherwise those reserves will vanish very quickly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord certain that the figures given by british airways are correct and not exaggerated <e> <s> because the facilities at gatwick are so much better than at heathrow and the labour relations are so much better <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will bear with me for one minute <e> <s> i voted for this country to go into the common market a to stop european wars and b to have a ring fence round million people which would stop the far eastern imports coming in free because i knew from experience that we could never compete with the far east <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is a great shortage of rolling stock in southern africa generally and in this country we are desperately short of jobs using steel would her majestys government consider priming the pump by placing orders for locomotives in this country and hiring them out to those other countries basing the rent on the price of copper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> i have a bag of coins in a drawer labelled one penny <e> <s> may i start to use them after the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is relevant to take an english analogy for scotland <e> <s> does an itinerant metal dealer in scotland comprise the gipsy who in england carries on a flourishing business in breaking up motor cars <e> <s> he certainly does not go around from house to house collecting his motor cars <e> <s> they sometimes descend into his lap by some mysterious means <e> <s> he guts them of all saleable parts and then leaves the rest as an eyesore to be removed eventually by the council if one is lucky <e> <s> is there any clause here which covers that gipsy or do gipsies not exist in scotland <e>", "<cs> will it be necessary to have a street trading licence for anybody who wishes to sell anything on a public highway <e> <s> in other words when the farmers wife puts out some eggs on a little platform outside the farm gate must she have a street traders licence to permit her to do that <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will have a good read of that on the quiet because i do not read it the same way as he does <e> <s> it would be ridiculous if the bill was to stop this kind of petty trading that goes on the whole time would it not <e>", "<cs> both but particularly page <e> <s> i read the public highway as coming within the category of the places where one is not allowed to sell without a licence but i am not a lawyer <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could i ask him to give some guidance to those of us who are in receipt of these benefits whether it would be proper for us to vote one way or the other on either of these two amendments <e>", "<cs> could the minister or the proposer of the amendment say whether they have any statistics as to the number of explosions or other harmful occurrences that have taken place in these laundrettes <e>", "<cs> if i was in the unfortunate position of having to use these places i would far sooner have the existing system than the one proposed by the noble baronesses <e> <s> in the existing system the inspector from the council can visit at frequent or infrequent intervals just as often as he likes <e> <s> apparently in manchester he has been round quite often and declared closed quite a number of premises which seemed to be working all right <e> <s> but to leave it to the proprietor to get a certificate so that when anybody complains he will wave a certificate at them and say that it is valid since it is months and days since its last inspection is really not good enough <e> <s> the person who has to inspect this equipment is a service engineer employed by the owner and so long as he is going round there it will be kept in reasonable order but to leave it to a certificate from some insurance inspector at -monthly intervals is i think quite frankly a hit of a nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in what the noble baroness is saying but who exactly are these people in whole-time work who are earning less than a week <e>", "<cs> my lords are they not all in part-time employment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might interrupt my noble friend for one second is there not another method which is to give business people a vote so that they can turn out extravagant councillors <e>", "<cs> may we be told who will train the army of gas fitters <e> <s> presumably the finance for that is provided at present by the profit on the sale of appliances <e> <s> it would seem that there will be nobody in a big enough position to train all the necessary fitters <e>", "<cs> my lords have her majestys government noticed that the british fruit industry has steadily declined ever since bird preservationists persuaded parliament to pass bird preservation orders and small boys no longer collect birds eggs <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend

commercial basis would be subject to exactly the same kind of vagaries <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what was the increase in population over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords is the

authority to reconsider and if its mind is made up he will not get justice <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that in all these trade questions the critical factor is the exchange rate and that we suffer from too high an exchange rate because we are a great financial centre and the bankers like a high exchange rate as against the manufacturers who need a low one <e>", "<cs> my
