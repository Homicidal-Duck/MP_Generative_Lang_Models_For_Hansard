["<cs> my lords first i begin with an apology to noble lords and particularly to my former colleague the noble lord lord cockfield for not being able to stay for the end of the debate <e> <s> this is due to the change in date of our debate and to a long-standing engagement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord cobbold has said as our deliberations on the united kingdoms contribution to the budget progressed in the sub-committee it became increasingly clear that this was a matter of crucial importance not simply to this country but to the future of the community itself and one which calls for a political solution at the highest level <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale to whom we are most grateful for introducing this debate claimed that he was no lawyer <e> <s> neither am i i am only an industrialist and if in expressing the very real concern of industry about the proposals of the royal commission i sound critical of those proposals this does not mean that industry is not very conscious of its need to accept its real responsibilities in this field <e> <s> neither am i being critical about members of royal commissions or government committees of inquiry <e> <s> were i to do so perhaps i would be condemning having wasted a good many years of my own life <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for that reply may i ask whether he can say whether the government are satisfied with the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord scarman said that this was a difficult and complex subject <e> <s> if it is difficult for the noble and learned lord how much more so for the layman and the industrialist <e> <s> but as an industrialist i welcome the statement on her majestys governments policy made in another place last week <e> <s> it was right to take time to come to a conclusion <e> <s> industry in general and the cbi in particular are glad that their representations have been taken into account in spite of the persuasive and lucid arguments against them in various official reports those of the law commissions and the pearson commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether i have understood the noble lord but is he implying that the committee recommended that there should be direct access to brussels and to brussels bureaucracy <e> <s> because that was exactly what the committee did not recommend as it would create an enormous bureaucracy which could not possibly work <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and most interesting debate on this subject and the number of noble lords who have taken part is an indication of the interest in regional policy generally <e> <s> most speakers have expressed dissatisfaction with the working of the erdf <e> <s> however all appear to wish to improve its working and various suggestions have been made to that end and not to abolish it with the exception of the noble lord lord bruce of donington who in his usual inimitable and forceful way appeared to be discussing a report other than the one that we are discussing this evening because he appeared to suggest that we were setting out to deceive the country by advocating symbols and that moreover there was no possibility whatever of the regional fund offsetting the amounts that have to be paid to the common agricultural policy <e> <s> i think that in almost the last words of my speech i said do not let us be deceived into believing that any reform or increase that is possible in the regional fund can in any way be a substitute for reformation of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to congratulate the noble lord lord wolfenden and his committee on having produced this admirable report which brings into the open much about this subject of consultation much of it contradictory <e> <s> i speak as someone who believes strongly i might almost say passionately in the development of consultation and discussion in industry because without this positive development and extension we shall not get the regeneration of british industry for which we all wish <e> <s> but when one turns and looks at the proposals of the vredeling directive it seems to me they were drawn up by people who had very little or no experience of how british enterprise is managed nor indeed of what it is that people on the shop floor really want to know <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should begin by declaring an interest an interest by association <e> <s> i was until the end of january last year chairman of the police complaints board i was deputy chairman of the edmund-davies inquiry into the police chairman of the home office working party which looked at certain proposals for handling complaints made by the police complaints board and i am still chairman of the police negotiating board which settles their pay and conditions <e> <s> therefore over the last few years i have had a very considerable amount to do with the police <e> <s> but this afternoon i want to confine my remarks to the handling of complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate in which differing views have been expressed forcefully and persuasively <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble earl lord airlie and the noble viscount lord chandos on their maiden speeches <e> <s> they put forward somewhat differing views delicately gently and persuasively and i hope they will not delay in joining us in further debates in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords as an industrialist i welcome this report and i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord scarman for the lucid and powerful way in which he opened this debate <e> <s> much that comes out of the european community can be likened to the curates egg good in parts <e> <s> it is good that the commission should endeavour to promote economic activity throughout the community by fair competition but as so often the methods and procedures it adopts to execute its policies can hamper and even injure the organisations that produce the wealth upon which all else depends <e> <s> this is succinctly described in paragraph of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff said he hoped he would not be regarded as presumptuous for opening this debate <e> <s> far from being so regarded i am sure that noble lords will be grateful to him for having done so <e> <s> we already have had clarification of some of the problems particularly local problems from the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos lord o hagan and lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i must confess as will be obvious from our report that my committee felt that virtually everything that could usefully be said about regional policy in the short term had been dealt with in our debate last year <e> <s> already this debate will have shown that more has been added to it <e> <s> that is my view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking noble lords for the tribute they have paid to the reports which we have been debating this afternoon and in particular to thank the members of sub-committee d for the undeserved but very nice things they have said about my chairmanship <e> <s> i hope they will continue to treat me with the indulgence that they have done hitherto and continue to educate me in the problems of the agricultural community <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord chapple on his maiden speech <e> <s> i was the chairman of the committee of which he was a member and about which he spoke and i can assure your lordships that he was both provocative and constructive and i am quite sure that when he speaks in your lordships house he will be both provocative and constructive <e> <s> i hope that he will speak often <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble lord misunderstood me <e> <s> what i said was that it was the result of the -mile limit which prevented the distant-water fishing fleets of britain and germany from fishing off iceland norway canada and so on <e>", "<cs> it was not due to our entering into the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate and in particular to thank lord boothby for speaking from his wide experience of the fishing industry <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy and the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith who took part in our consultations and brought a wealth of experience which none of the rest of us could possibly match <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his comprehensive reply to the debate and all those who have taken part in it <e> <s> one thing on which everyone agrees is that the common agricultural policy is in a state of crisis and that something must be done in order to deal with it <e> <s> otherwise as the committee said it will run away and may jeopardise the whole working of the common market itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am privileged to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord clitheroe on his thoughtful and constructive speech <e> <s> i know that i speak for your lordships when i say that i hope he will find the time to speak often in your lordships house <e> <s> i say that with particular pleasure because his father was a close friend he was associated with me in business for or years and was a friend for much longer than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare a past interest because in i was appointed the first chairman of the atomic energy authority <e> <s> i want to congratulate the noble viscount lord torrington and his colleagues on a most excellent report that we are discussing <e> <s> the committees report is an important step in building confidence in the future of nuclear power <e> <s> i have been encouraged greatly by listening to all who have spoken in the debate and who have accepted the views of the committee and not those of those people who wish to slow down the development of nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reassurance <e> <s> i am reassured <e> <s> however the reactor which the noble lord lord marshall mentioned and which is mentioned in the report to which i attach most importance in the long run is the fast breeder reactor <e> <s> one was started at dounreay in the fifties and i understand that the progress made has been very great <e> <s> within reasonable time therefore an economic and safer reactor can be put into use <e> <s> it has the great advantage not only of better safety but that it can use the spent fuel from the thermal reactors <e> <s> i understand that there are stocks today which if used in a fast breeder reactor are equivalent to the nations recoverable coal reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other speakers in congratulating the noble lord lord wyatt on his maiden speech <e> <s> my only criticism is that he said a great deal of what i wanted to say myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot remember at this time of the night exactly what the noble lord did say but what he is presumably telling me is that he did not mean that we should close down the existing power stations <e> <s> in that case i should think that my analogy with st augustine is correct <e> <s> however i will not pursue that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should begin by declaring a past interest as i was appointed as the first chairman of the atomic energy authority as long ago as <e> <s> nuclear power no longer has the ready acceptance that it had at that time <e> <s> the reasons are many and some we have heard today but perhaps the most important are the accidents that took place at windscale at the time i was chairman of the authority three mile island and chernobyl <e> <s> i believe that attitude will change in time as people come to understand more clearly the damage that the burning of fossil fuels is doing to the worlds atmosphere and the effect that it is likely to have on the worlds climate the so-called greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare an interest <e> <s> from to my wife was the vice-chairman of the bbc and from to she was chairman of the iba <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make clear the reason that i have put my name to the amendment <e> <s> i was appalled at the interpretation of the bill with regard to advertising <e> <s> the provision can do nothing but add confusion and worse in that field <e> <s> i have no personal knowledge of the way in which the system of the iba works <e> <s> however i have considerable knowledge of regulatory bodies in other fields <e>", "<cs> my lords not enough attention has been paid to the points raised by the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> a limited amount of money is available from advertisers <e> <s> we want to ensure that it is devoted to issues in which we believe <e> <s> we accept that channel will be much less a public channel than it is now <e> <s> the real point is how much less that will be and what will be endangered by the change <e> <s> as the noble lord lord norrie said the itv programmes which the noble lord suggested are unduly restrictive have met a demand by thousands of people for more information on educational and social matters <e> <s> it is quite possible to quote a great many instances but i shall not do so <e>"]
