increased charges when the service is getting rapidly much worse <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government are looking at this question will they bear in mind that in the case of a shotgun for which a certificate is necessary the police have to be satisfied that the owner of the shotgun has somewhere to use it <e> <s> if he has nowhere to use it he will not get a certificate he can be only a poacher or trespasser <e> <s> at present one can buy an air gun and if one is to use it at all one is almost certainly either trespassing or poaching <e> <s> will the government bear this fact in mind

surprised to find me making a speech because they may know that many moons ago i decided never to make another speech i merely interrupt if i think i can be tiresome <e> <s> it was not out of

a home office bill and although i never dealt with the matter as such when at the home office it is a matter that has always interested me and i realise the complications <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble and learned lord to tell him that it is simply because of the fright we have of the scots <e>", "<cs> my lords does the pursuit of this question really help matters at this particular moment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am not completely out of order by referring to an earlier question do the statistics not show that question time has been going on for minutes <e>", "<cs>

will explain in a moment but it is not without precedent <e> <s> the only case i can find which happened fairly recently was in but the history of this amendment is really rather exceptional <e> <s>

have been assured i cannot be more accurate than that by the other place that the bill will not be held up by this action <e> <s> i cannot actually promise the chairman of committees that the next

he is talking about a ministerial whim does parliament never have whims <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not just as important to have some regulations about the actual safety of the seat belts themselves

my lords when the noble lord says before long does he mean before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a strong suspicion that that may be a moderately satisfactory reply <e> <s> but does my noble friend not agree that as in the near future her majestys government will probably make it a criminal offence not to wear a seat belt they are at least morally responsible for seeing that seat belts are safe and is my noble friend aware that at present for a large number of smaller people below shall we say feet inches a great many of the seat belts cannot be worn with safety <e> <s> further is my noble friend aware that years ago i was told by two motor-car manufacturers at the time i was chairman of the british road federation that there is no difficulty at all in designing a belt which is adjustable in the way i want but it is slightly more expensive to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords

drafted this amendment means that we would give an undertaking to belize in perpetuity <e>", "<cs> one cannot enter an agreement in perpetuity <e> <s> some future government will say this amendment is in the bill but there is nothing to say that it is in perpetuity and as far as we are concerned we do not want to go on with it <e> <s> a future government are much more likely to abide by an undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords it was quite clear that my noble friend was talking about control of television by the television authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is not john o groats being forgotten

nothing to do with the question on the order paper is it in order to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but would he not agree that this is developing into a debate

friend realise that in the last year there seems to have been a great improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that in my part of yorkshire second-class post has been improving very rapidly and first-class post has been getting worse very rapidly and that usually the second-class now arrives before the first-class <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene in the debates on the bill in any way although i was occupied with the subject for many years <e> <s> i suggest with respect that the speech of the noble lord lord bishopston was in the nature of a second reading

my lords if the noble lord lord jenkins is entitled to ask the question which undoubtedly he is whether one likes it or not is there any reason why my noble friend the minister should alter his original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not abundantly clear by now that this is one of the most important questions that has come before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble leader satisfied that all those who examine and select candidates particularly for the senior grades of the civil service are sufficiently qualified and lacking in prejudice to select the best candidates <e> <s> if she is so satisfied is she aware that my information is quite to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that my noble leader has misunderstood me it is entirely my fault <e> <s> i was referring to those candidates who are not yet in the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it that scientifically-minded noble lords always try to turn question time into a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt my noble friend of all people but i would remind him that this is report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not remarkable that in minutes we have

before your lordships <e> <s> he has not been here very long to know what is the custom of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friends baptism of fire somewhat excessive and therefore hard-hearted <e>", "<cs> my lords are not both starred questions and supplementary questions as laid down in the <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what on earth this question has to do with her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords before noble lords give this bill a third reading may i ask who invented this most extraordinary title to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the leader of the house for her support of my question <e> <s> could we not try to enforce the old custom this applies particularly to ministers that when a minister was making a winding-up speech and a previous speaker was not present for the winding-up the minister or whoever was winding-up never referred to anything which that previous speaker had said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether that question is in order <e> <s> it does not seem to have anything to do

scottish friends by drinking more whisky <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but this is not a committee stage and the noble lord is clearly out of order <e> <s> we cannot expect the minister

answers that supplementary as i am sure she will does she feel that a starred question provides a suitable time for a full-scale debate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to my noble friend the leader of the house that if we lengthen the period of question time it would be very bad for the temper of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend think it a proper idea that old-age pensioners should be able to claim a refund of tax <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not unfortunate that this has turned into a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather unfortunate that we have had to listen to five major speeches at question time on one question <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord hatch abusing the privilege of this house by asking the same question time after time even though
