["<cs> my lords the noble lord should not anticipate my speech and i rise simply to tell him that i shall also be saying what i have said before namely that planning agreements are totally indefensible anywhere and i have never agreed with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion so effectively moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i could hardly do otherwise because the measures so far adopted by her majestys government after all bear at least some resemblance to the proposals fought for by the confederation of british industry under my presidency and that of my successor <e> <s> so i have a natural anxiety that they should succeed <e> <s> yet i should like to echo what my noble friend lord thorneycroft has just said success requires a greater degree of response from management and men than any government have so far achieved in the last decade or perhaps since the war <e> <s> that is the measure of the task which my noble friends face and i am sure they realise it <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord peart for raising this very important issue and i think it is only natural that he and the noble lord lord blease should highlight the problems of particular regions <e> <s> it so happens that when i was parliamentary secretary to the ministry of labour i was asked to make a special study of regional unemployment because to show that despite what some people say nothing changes the then conservative government had inherited a serious unemployment problem from the preceding labour government <e> <s> i was asked to go to lancashire and north-east scotland and many other places to look into the problem <e> <s> i shall not bore your lordships with what i found but shall say only that i became convinced then and i think i remain convinced now although that study took place a long time ago that regional problems are dependent on the health of the economy as a whole <e> <s> i certainly agreed with my noble friend lord gowrie when he said that and other noble lords have also said it <e> <s> but by that i do not mean to try to minimise what i believe is a very serious moral problem and i think that it is high time your lordships house discussed it at length <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to add my very sincere congratulations to two very remarkable maiden speakers upon their speeches and hope with others that we shall hear them here often again <e> <s> i am very glad to follow the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i am not sure i can quite emulate his absolutely dramatic shortness and succinct approach but i agree with every word that he said <e> <s> it goes very well with what my noble friend our noble leader said in opening this debate <e> <s> we are examining not so much economic policy as such but the fundamental changes that underline it changes that are bound to affect our lives and those of our children <e> <s> therefore one finds it a little depressing sometimes that the general economic debate across the nation seems so often to illuminate the confusion rather than come to any agreed conclusions which might lead to action <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of the noble lord lord brockway are well known to your lordships house <e> <s> i know that he holds them with great sincerity and he and i could debate matters for a long time without merging our respective views <e> <s> but i should if i may as a past minister of defence like to say something about the speech by the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> i see that he is not in his place <e> <s> i do not think that he was expressing the sense of this house in his personal attack on the white paper and on my noble friend lord duncan-sandys who produced it <e> <s> that is perhaps not very important <e> <s> what is important is the implication that might be drawn from his remarks that our forces now on their way to the falklands were not as well equipped as they might be and all the rest <e> <s> that is just not so <e> <s> i want to say as plainly as i can that i believe that those forces are well adapted to the task they are going to undertake <e> <s> i believe that they will give an exceedingly good account of themselves if they have to do so and i hope that this house sends to the men and women in the task force their very best wishes and their total support for what they may have to do if so ordered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am probably out of order but i thought that we were to have the pleasure of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first warmly to congratulate the noble lord lord murray on his speech <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords will agree that it is a great benefit to your lordships house to hear someone with the unique experience of lord murray in industrial affairs <e> <s> i hope that we shall often hear him again <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i add as a personal note that over many years i have seen the noble lord in his previous avocation and i never doubted that he was doing the best that he could for the nation in his own inimitable way <e> <s> i hope that we shall often hear him again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord derwent for his most effective maiden speech and if i may be permitted to say so i do it in very affectionate memory of his father <e>", "<cs> fair enough my lords <e> <s> we do not disagree about the basic cause but i think we may have a slight disagreement about remedies <e> <s> i should like to underline what my noble friend said <e> <s> i hope that british bankers will read what he said and try to do something about it <e> <s> at the moment i think that is one of our biggest disabilities in getting more overseas trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> i shall send him a copy of the cbi paying document which he perhaps has not seen and which will give him a rather different picture <e> <s> i admit that it is a document intended for use on the shop floor but what it says is that we are paying ourselves an per cent <e> <s> per annum increase in earnings and we are not justifying that by a sufficiently increased level of productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords after the bills passage through the other place it was not very surprising that the parties opposite in your lordships house should have what good clean political fun they could get out of it <e> <s> i am quite happy to leave the rebuttal of their arguments to the noble lord lord wyatt who has just sat down and who better to do it than he <e>"]
