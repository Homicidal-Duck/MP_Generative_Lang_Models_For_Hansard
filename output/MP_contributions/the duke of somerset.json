["<cs> my lords i beg your lordships indulgence as i address you for the first time this evening <e> <s> i should also like to declare an interest as a woodland owner <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the sub-committee i find that this report makes rather gloomy reading <e> <s> that is not a criticism of the drafting but a comment on the commission document on which the report is based <e>", "<cs> my lords as a woodland owner i also think it right not only to thank the noble lord lord carter for initiating this important debate but also the government for giving us so many proposals for the future of the industry even though everybody does not recognise forestry as an industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness and to the house for not putting my name to the list of speakers at the correct time <e> <s> i shall be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my thanks to the chairman the noble lord lord gallacher for his skill and expertise and the manner in which he organised the assimilation of the evidence in this report as in past ones <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from tonights debate and from outside discussions that the most important aspect of the proposed introduction of irradiation into the uk is that of safety <e> <s> if that could be established without argument other considerations would be of lesser importance <e>", "<cs> in the scenario painted by the noble lord lord ashbourne if i had just been told by my mother about aid i would consider how good it was to be alive because if it was not for the donor i should not even exist <e>", "<cs> my lords as a landlord with several let farms i have been dismayed to observe the gradual decline over the years in the availability of this excellent system of tenure <e> <s> as british agriculture faces the increased competition of the single european market and of the slide towards world prices and the various directives from the commission it is a shame that the industry cannot agree on a formula to arrest that decline and so share on broader shoulders the responsibility of returning to a vigorous and prosperous agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to the noble earl lord carlisle for his forthright speech <e> <s> in the words of the secretary of state for scotland the industry is still going through a transitional period after the budget changes so this is a suitable time to take stock <e> <s> the question is whether we should be looking to plant more trees or whether we should be stopping in our tracks <e> <s> after all timber consumption in the uk is of the magnitude of billion per annum of which per cent <e> <s> is imported <e> <s> that is the equivalent of one-third of the current trade deficit with the constriction industry contributing most significantly to that element of the deficit <e> <s> the projection is for the uk demand to increase by at least per cent <e> <s> over the next decade <e> <s> the trade deficit must be borne in mind when the overall picture of forestry is looked at <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene because this is an important clause and it is similar to the one which i shall be moving later <e> <s> it allows a financial incentive for those who seek to divert waste from landfill in favour of recycling and reclamation <e> <s> it is important to ensure that any schemes competing or applying for financial credits can do so on equal basis <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his comments <e> <s> on the basis of the governments new amendment tabled subsequent to mine and of his explanation i am happy to withdraw the amendment at this stage in order to examine what the minister has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment of the noble earl lord peel <e> <s> it is rather more all-embracing but similar to an amendment i wish to move shortly <e> <s> the noble earl has put the case very adequately but i should just like to establish one point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers comments <e> <s> as regards the commitment to spend money the choice for the government or their agency to enter into a management agreement is entirely optional <e> <s> expenditure on environmental projects could be controlled or cash limited on the same way as any other public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the purpose of the amendments <e> <s> i gather that the nccs records show that per cent <e> <s> of sssis which are reported to have lost their scientific value have done so because of a lack of proper management <e> <s> some form of failsafe mechanism needs to be in place to prevent britains prime sites falling into neglect <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords have covered the amendment fully <e> <s> it is similar to the amendments that i shall move a little later <e> <s> it is more wide-ranging and more general but i should like to give it my support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for what the minister has said and for her full reply to all the points that i raised <e> <s> i am particularly glad that perhaps the welsh and the scots will be able to benefit from this initiative in due course <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too rise as a member of the sub-committee that produced this report <e> <s> i feel that the document under discussion produced by the commission is to be warmly welcomed <e> <s> todays debate on the select committee report occurs at a most appropriate time when the worldwide debate on gatt and public concern for the countryside are reaching a crescendo <e> <s> as the report makes clear the commissions initiative is a good start but it needs flesh added to it and it needs objectives clarified <e> <s> it is significant that the ec finds it difficult to agree its own negotiating position in uruguay <e>"]
