["<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to the government that we welcome these amendments <e> <s> they will know that we had already considered putting down an amendment to achieve very much the same effect although with nothing like the complexity and skill of the government and indeed lacking the help of the resources available to the government in moving such amendments <e> <s> i have to confess that the amendment appears to us very much a second best <e> <s> it had been our wish throughout that there should be directory inquiry services of the type described by the noble lord available free of charge to all subscribers as they have been made available historically by british telecommunications and i assume by the hull telephone undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords in most of what he said the noble lord lord mottistone appears to be referring to systems of electronic mail <e> <s> i may have misunderstood him and if so i shall gladly <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i shall withdraw the guarded welcome that i was about to give to the amendment <e> <s> if it is to be concerned primarily with electronic mail i do not think anyone could have any objection <e> <s> after all electronic mail systems operate primarily through data networks <e> <s> it is not my understanding and here i would be glad of the governments confirmation that they would be considered to be part of telecommunications systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of wearying the house by repeating the arguments made on this at report stage particularly as the arguments have been made so effectively and freshly by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in his admirable and quite ingenious amendment <e> <s> it seems that this bill has various layers of protection moving down from the first part of clause to the second part of clause a long way down to clause and way beyond that to unprotected licence conditions <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble lord would give effect to the assurances given by the government when they rejected the amendment which we moved at committee stage <e> <s> it would seem logical and rational for them to accept the amendment which is now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble and learned lord not only for the amendments but for the very clear way in which he moved them <e> <s> i cannot avoid noting that on nd march the noble and learned lord wrote to the society of telecom executives using the words with which he now proposes to amend the bill and in that sense i suspect he was rather jumping the gun on the position as it stood at that time <e> <s> but these are improvements <e> <s> they overcome some of the difficulties that we foresaw with some of the government amendments when they were moved earlier and we indicated that we did not think the government were making these difficulties intentionally <e> <s> we are glad to have it confirmed that this is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord persuaded the house at report stage that it was desirable that there should be this possibility of civil action <e> <s> but i have to say that he did so on the basis of the wording of his amendment <e> <s> that provided for very strict restraints on the litigation that might otherwise be possible <e> <s> the first of those restraints was that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to facilitate the creation of parishes in urban areas <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has just said the last five speeches have been about the problems of the third world and the impact on the third world of interest rates <e> <s> i hope it will be taken as evidence of my own incapacity rather than any reflection on the importance of the subject of the third world or indeed on the quality of the speeches if i turn completely from that subject to what is literally a parochial subject namely the burden of interest rates on local authorities which is included in the admirable motion of my noble friend lord beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to the noble viscount lord eccles the minister referred to the need for what is in effect rate capping during the first three years of the new authority <e> <s> may i ask him in what sense this is a new authority <e> <s> is it the governments intention that the staff of the inner london education authority shall lose their jobs and have to reapply for them <e> <s> is that the position of those with responsibility in schools <e> <s> surely the governments intention cannot be to cause disruption among staff and in the schools and in that sense is it meaningful to talk about a new authority <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> can he point out the reference to an inquiry in the amendment <e> <s> i cannot find it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with the government and in particu-lar with the ministers who have the job of steering this bill through your lordships house <e> <s> here they are they have brought forward a bill couched in calm neutral tones an administrative measure and what do they find <e> <s> they find that noble lords on all sides of the house react to it in an emotional way <e> <s> noble lords from these benches and from the alliance benches are concerned to defend the social services the under-fives the unmarried mothers and their families <e> <s> they are concerned about voluntary organisations none of which are referred to anywhere in the bill <e> <s> i cannot think where they got these references from <e>"]
