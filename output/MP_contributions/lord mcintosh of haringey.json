["<cs> my lords it is already clear that this debate is going to go very much wider than the issue of the establishment of a trading fund for the ordnance survey <e> <s> my noble friend lord shackleton has already eloquently expressed the views of the many users of the ordnance survey who have been consulted and have objected to this proposal and the noble lord lord foot has referred to the unanimity of these views and the fears of everybody concerned that there may be a diminution in the standards provided by the ordnance survey <e> <s> the white paper as a conclusion itself talks about the establishment of a trading fund but it does so in the context of the control and reduction of public expenditure <e> <s> that indeed i suspect is what is behind the proposal which we are debating today <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the noble lords answer about awarding contracts to those who put in the lowest tender <e> <s> will he extend that principle to the prohibition which the government have placed on direct labour organisations from competing on equal terms by imposing extra financial constraints upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was unkind enough to describe the bill as a mouse presumably in the hope that we on this side of your lordships house would let it scuttle in and out of its small hole and we would not see it as causing severe damage to the fabric of our society <e> <s> the trouble with mice is that they tend to breed <e> <s> indeed i rather think that this mouse has been bred from the local government planning and land act and other legislation introduced by this government and it is evidence if further evidence were needed of the failure of that act and of other legislation and administrative activity to secure the clampdown on local government expenditure which is the object above all of this government <e> <s> i want to suggest that just like previous legislation this bill is seriously defective it is defective in terms of historical analysis on which it is based and particularly defective in the claims it makes and the inadequacy of its content to meet those claims <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister suggesting that there should be further legal challenge to the balanced fares policy of the glc which has been approved by the divisional court <e>", "<cs> as one who deals closely with codes of practice in his own business the marketing research business i confess that i am wholly unconvinced by the arguments of the noble lord the minister about the complexity of codes of practice <e> <s> in my business we indeed have codes of practice for individuals and for companies undertaking survey research which seek to protect the clients and the practitioners themselves <e> <s> these have been going for some years now <e> <s> but the work that was involved in codes of practice at the outset and years ago has been by no means continued as the codes of practice have been extended to new kinds of research as they have become international and as they have applied generally to new conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> the objection which i and a number of others have to this clause and why i rise to support my noble and learned friends amendment is because of the definition of the words national security <e> <s> if they meant what all members of this house have by oath or affirmation solemnly sworn to adhere to and support there would be no problem <e> <s> the difficulty arises from the fact that over the years national security has increasingly come to mean internal surveillance <e> <s> for example it means surveillance of political and trade union activists <e> <s> it means a great deal more than the words in the bill <e> <s> this gives rise to very severe problems about the liberty of the subject in this kingdom which are put right only to some extent by my noble and learned friends amendments <e> <s> i believe that the issue goes even further <e>", "<cs> i too shall be very brief <e> <s> i confess that the noble lord the minister lost me in his construing of subsections and and therefore my remarks are genuinely directed at the whole of clause <e> <s> my question about the whole of clause is one which i confess does not appear in the wording at the moment <e> <s> i can quite see the reasons why information relating to a criminal investigation should not be made generally available in such a way as to damage the course of that criminal investigation <e> <s> but i suggest that a large number of the queries which may arise about criminal records will not be about criminal investigations which are in the course of being pursued but will come from those who may find themselves on criminal records and will be about the accuracy of those records <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister used the word general and he defined that word earlier in this committees consideration as being available to other people <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> what i said was that the person who suspects that there may be an entry on a criminal record about himself or herself should have the right of access to that record in order to check whether or not it is inaccurate <e> <s> that is not access to the criminal fraternity in general <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone in moving his amendment said that his intention was to widen the scope of subsection of this clause <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the reverse of what was needed <e> <s> my question to the noble lord the minister is this <e> <s> in what way could the scope of this subsection he any wider <e> <s> specifically i am asking him about subsection <e>", "<cs> may i too refer back to second reading when the noble lord lord bellwin expressed great indignation at the nature of some of the protests made by the metropolitan authorities and by those who lobbied members of this house about the threat as they say saw it to concessionary fares for old people and the disabled <e> <s> whether or not he was justified in that indignation the fact is that children and those in full-time education are not treated in this bill in the same way as the elderly and the disabled <e> <s> i want to ask the noble lord why should this be so only for the metropolitan counties <e> <s> may i remind him that the public service vehicles travel concessions act which is still in force does include children and those in full-time education in the same category for travel concessions as those other categories of the elderly and the disabled <e> <s> therefore the shire counties who are not covered by this bill do have the same rights to extend travel concessions to children without financial penalty <e> <s> yet the financial penalty in the terms of the protected expenditure level covering childrens fares is proposed to be enacted in this bill <e> <s> i would like the noble lord to tell us why the metropolitan authorities are being treated differently from the shire counties <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> where in the bill occurs this ceiling limit to which the noble lord has just referred outside which local authorities shall not go <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord the minister but i wonder whether he will give way again <e> <s> he said just now that the secretary of state can take into account any benefit <e> <s> would he agree with me that the memorandum that has been issued from the department of transport to the metropolitan authorities and the greater london council setting out the benefits which were to be included in the model for determination of the permitted expenditure level also included those which were not to be included <e> <s> would the noble lord agree with me that the benefits specifically excluded are the social and environmental benefits to which the amendment refers <e>", "<cs> i am be able to help the minister here <e> <s> annex a to the note <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has in his speech gone some way beyond the wording of the bill <e> <s> subsection says that <e>", "<cs> in common with some of my noble friends i have been involved in the preparation of submissions for a tpp over a number of years <e> <s> it is quite true to say as the noble lord lord bellwin does that the initial work on the preparation of a plan for public transport has to rest with the executive there cannot be any doubt about that <e> <s> they are the professionals they have the job of looking at the options and costing them before submission to the authority <e> <s> but it is not true to say that there is no way under the terms of the amendments moved by my noble friend that that cannot be achieved <e> <s> there is no reason why with goodwill on both sides there should not be an effective co-operation of those who have the responsibility for preparing and costing transport alternatives and those who have the responsibility of representing the electorate in the area concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he confirm or deny whether this is happening already <e> <s> are civil servants from the department of transport already rooting around in the executives asking detailed questions about their operations <e> <s> that is the gravamen of the charge in these amendments <e>", "<cs> will the minister read on <e> <s> where he said <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would agree that in the advice that has already gone out from his department it is suggested with the laudable intention of minimising extra demands on authorities and executives that the information provided in the plan in other words the more restricted information which is now required should supersede that at present required in connection with bids for government support <e> <s> so if i understand the noble lord correctly those proposals which are not of course final will now themselves be superseded by the statements that he is making today <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister has said on more than one occasion on this <e>", "<cs> i thought that the minister made a most extraordinary speech and some of its extraordinary nature has been brought out by my noble friend <e> <s> we are finding ourselves fighting cotton wool in this debate <e> <s> every time that we say that the secretary of state central government is interfering too closely in the affairs of the executive and in the plan prepared by the executive the minister says dont worry this is a matter for the authority in the end to decide <e> <s> every time we ask on what principles and on what basis is the secretary of state or local government intervening in the planning process <e> <s> the government say dont worry we will make up our minds as time goes on on what those principles will be <e> <s> meantime the government say they will oppose any attempt from this side of the committee to introduce into legislation the principles on which they will intervene <e>", "<cs> i am sure that what the noble lord the minister has said will be read word for word and letter for letter by the greater london council and the metropolitan authorities in considering what they have to do about fare levels over the next three months or so <e> <s> he has given some encouragement for them to think that if advice is given late there is not very much and i use the ministers words they can do about it <e> <s> i remind him that once <e>", "<cs> keeping to <e>", "<cs> the difficulty with the statement of the noble lord the minister is that the general duties under the and acts are still on the statute book and they are still therefore incumbent upon the passenger transport authorities and the greater london council <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the importance in particular of paragraph <e>", "<cs> i take the liberty of returning to one particular point still not made clear <e> <s> in a conciliatory speech yesterday in response to an amendment moved by the noble lord lord teviot the minister was good enough to say that he recognised the limitations of restricting the analysis of benefits to potential users <e> <s> yet in what he said today he spelled out what the clause says unamended <e> <s> it refers back to subsections and of clause and to the additional paragraph <e> <s> there must be a simpler way of saying that <e>", "<cs> may i ask a very simple question of the minister <e> <s> i will not allow myself to concede that there might be a conflict between the advice or guidance given by this government and the duties laid upon local authorities by the or acts <e> <s> i am sure that they are far too conscious of their responsibilities <e> <s> we have heard from the noble lord the minister over and over again of his concern for the independence of local government and we take him at his word <e> <s> therefore from this government there can be no conflict but from a possible future government there might be conflict <e> <s> in these circumstances may i repeat the question which is to be master <e> <s> is the particular regard which is to be paid to these provisions in this bill to take precedence over the general duties under the and acts or not <e>", "<cs> i will go along this far with the noble lord the minister that although he did not observe his own self-denying ordinance it would be undesirable to repeat the arguments which we had yesterday <e> <s> therefore i shall not concentrate on that part of the amendment which refers to the guidance which it is proposed that the secretary of state should give on acceptable levels of revenue grant <e>", "<cs> by all means <e> <s> what i wanted to do and i am sure that the minister will be able to respond to both points at the same time was to refer to the last few lines of the subsection which it is proposed should be replaced by the words in the amendment <e> <s> i would remind the committee of them <e> <s> the secretary of state shall indicate to the authority <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would recognise a distinction between the analysis about which i was talking and the political decisions resulting from that analysis <e> <s> he is of course at liberty to criticise the political decisions but surely he is not advocating a duplication of the analysis <e>", "<cs> i was directly challenged by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to say whether i went along with him in his assertion that it would be right to avoid duplication or triplication of analytical work and that this should be taken away from the local authorities and the executives <e> <s> the answer is that i do not go along with him <e> <s> if he is suggesting that i hope he will be repudiated by the government front bench <e> <s> what he is proposing is an incitement to illegal action by the greater london council and the metropolitan authorities as i think he very well knows <e> <s> it is the duty of the authorities to consider and take into account all the factors which are put forward by the executive for the proper running of a public transport system <e> <s> it is then their duty to take into account the other things which are within their remit the issues of road policy of other transportation expenditure and so on and to come to a conclusion about it in terms of the revenue grant that they propose to make <e>", "<cs> i have noted that in his speeches on the last amendment and in his reply to my noble friend on this amendment the noble lord the minister has not made any attempt to deny the allegations made by my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> if the committee will remember she gave examples of the kind of inquiries which are already being demanded of passenger transport executives inquiries about lead times and about routes <e> <s> she even talked about examining the stubs of bus tickets <e> <s> if that is not the case and if the civil servants are not getting into that sort of detail surely it is incumbent on the government to deny it and to give some convincing evidence that these allegations are untrue <e> <s> as it is i am afraid that the ministers response to this amendment is quite unsatisfactory and it is not any good pretending that it is in the interests of the authorities that these words should remain <e> <s> if it is really the intention of the government to fulfil their proper responsibilities with regard to the control of central government expenditure on public transport then we must accept that there is a limit to central government subsidy which is to be devoted to that purpose <e>", "<cs> even assuming the noble lords memory is correct that there are no <e>", "<cs> i confess to some puzzlement at the ministers reply <e> <s> he has constantly said in defence of earlier clauses that the words advice guidance and indication mean no more than that that they are not compulsions and that the final decision rests with the authority <e> <s> in particular when i used the words weasel words in referring to guidance he objected and thought that i was being unreasonable in reading into the words advice or guidance more than was intended <e> <s> yet here he is looking at similar words <e>", "<cs> if the minister will forgive me i refer back to the tpp and transport support grant <e> <s> he referred to capital expenditure <e> <s> it is true that the period for which capital expenditure is authorised has gone down from the five years when tpp was first introduced but it is still a two-year period and still more than months <e> <s> if it is possible for tpp why not under these procedures when it is only guidance and not a statutory requirement <e>", "<cs> i fear that the ministers reply has gone some way to shake my faith in his understanding of the running of an efficient business <e> <s> i deliberately did not refer when i moved the amendment to the possibility of a local authority borrowing in order to meet unforeseen emergencies <e> <s> i did not actually think that the minister would be so unwise as to recommend that that is what an executive should do <e> <s> it seemed to me to be self-evident that that would be an unbusinesslike procedure for most of the kinds of unforeseen emergencies which i envisaged when i moved the amendment <e> <s> yes one might say that a hard winter is a one-off occasion and one might say that a borrowing in one year would be a proper way to deal with the additional expenditure incurred <e> <s> one is taking the risk that there would be a mild winter next year but let us take that risk and let us not have any new elaborate procedures for extra financing for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i would be more convinced by that answer if the noble lord had not insisted on defeating a previous amendment which enabled the next accounting period to be extended and to have a rather longer and more realistic financial horizon for the undertaking <e> <s> however i accept that there may be difficulties about the wording <e> <s> we shall have to find some way of achieving the very essential objective of this amendment without arousing the fears which the government have expressed as regards its implications <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> i am very new in your lordships house and i have not found my way around the palace of westminster as well as some other members here <e> <s> when i try to escape from the building i take different routes and when i leave the peers entrance i go through a door i find myself going past some dustbins and i land up in a court which is called star chamber court <e> <s> this brings back to me memories of the early th century when it was possible for the sovereign to by-pass all the normal legal constraints which had been built up throughout the previous centuries and simply to say if i say this is illegal it is illegal <e>", "<cs> my noble friend invited your lordships to imagine that they were members of local transport authorities <e> <s> it is appropriate that i should rise immediately afterwards having been until today a member of a transport authority and having resigned from that authority only this morning <e> <s> therefore i have a keen awareness of being and of not being a member of such an authority <e> <s> i leave your lordships to guess as to the complexity of my feelings at no longer being such a member <e>", "<cs> it has to be said that behind the amendment is a lack of trust <e> <s> it is not a lack of trust of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> of course not <e> <s> it is a lack of trust of the intentions of the government in trying to include the clause in the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord had said that the government would specify publicly for all authorities and for all executives what information must necessarily be made available to the authority to the public and to the secretary of state in order that all parties could come to a reasonable conclusion about the right amount of revenue grant that might have been a different matter <e>", "<cs> i have to say that that document was one that my noble friend lord sefton and i had to draw to the attention of the committee <e> <s> it was not known to the government front bench <e> <s> we referred to it because we had to correct mis-statements made by the government front bench no doubt inadvertently about the nature of the information that is to be required <e> <s> we on this side of the committee have made the point very clearly that the information that it is proposed to demand in that consultation document goes into the most extraordinary detail about the day-to-day operation of passenger transport undertakings <e> <s> it is not the kind of thing that ought to be required by the government in making a decision about the level of public expenditure on public transport <e> <s> that is the essence of our case <e> <s> it is we on this side of the committee who had to draw that point to the governments attention <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the government front bench that we on this side were not responsible for the legislation <e> <s> we get our information from wherever we can <e> <s> we do not have the same resources that noble lords opposite have <e> <s> they are responsible for what they say and are responsible for knowing the answers to questions that are raised <e> <s> i have to say that there have been a number of occasions when noble lords opposite simply have not known the answers to questions which my noble friends have raised <e> <s> it is not good enough for a government front bench to be in that position on legislation which is to go on the statute book <e>", "<cs> but in the meantime legislation will go through and it will go through with imperfect information <e> <s> i think there is a difference in the responsibility <e> <s> however the noble lord the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord answers those questions i wonder whether he would undertake to give consideration to the point which seems to arise from my noble friends amendment and the ministers reply that many other parts of the bill could be thought to prejudge the decision of the interdepartmental committee <e> <s> i wonder therefore whether the noble lord would undertake to go through the bill with the usual fine toothcomb and come back to the house on report and indicate what other parts of the bill would be affected in this way and whether or not they ought to be withdrawn as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a simple question to ask the noble lord the minister some might call it a naive question <e> <s> it does seem to me that this amendment so far from being as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said in opposition to the intention and spirit of the bill is very much in line with the intention and the spirit of the way the government propose to enforce the bill <e> <s> i come back with no apology to the document <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister be good enough to indicate in what way he thinks that inflexibility has arisen from the use of the same formula as that used in the case of the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i introduced this amendment in a very low key way expressing a modicum of hope that the statements which the noble lord lord bellwin made in committee might have borne some fruit that he might be prepared to go in for further consultation with the local authority associations that he might recognise that there is a real difference between accepting that there should be common principles applying to all authorities and saying that every full-stop comma word and letter should be the same for all authorities and that we might see some hope of progress or movement on the part of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to amendment no <e> <s> which my noble friend is asking your lordships to consider together with no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to refer to what the noble lord the minister has said in reply on this <e> <s> he said that it would be an infringement of the rights of an individual local authority if the secretary of state were to consult the <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the point i wished to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister appears to take two steps forward and steps back again <e> <s> i do not think we are getting a great deal further because i do not think the nature of the issue has been fully comprehended with great respect <e> <s> the provision in the bill that authorities shall be required to work within the grants so far as is practicable is still subject to the provision that the protected expenditure level shall be considered taking one year with another in other words one year with the next <e> <s> if an executive overspends in one year the presumption must be that the pel will be reduced for the following year by a comparable amount <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i will gladly give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a very important point which does need to be clarified <e> <s> i would be grateful if the noble lord would agree as i am sure he will to find some way of clarifying it before the bill leaves your lordships house <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord mean that any overspending is not necessarily taken off the protected expenditure level for the following year <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly helpful <e> <s> that certainly was not clear to me i do not know whether it was to my noble friends <e> <s> that encourages me to think that perhaps the noble lord the minister has taken only steps back <e> <s> under those circumstances in view of what the minister has said to my noble friend about considering the possibility of an amendment which would have the further proviso that the certification of an emergency would be subject to the approval of the secretary of state i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to understand why this alternative wording which is not more loose than the wording in amendment no <e> <s> should be more objectionable to the government than the previous one <e> <s> no authority or executive wants to admit that there are circumstances beyond its control just as no authority or executive wants to admit that it has to spend money on items of an emergency nature <e>", "<cs> my lords first on behalf of my noble friends we are grateful to the minister for the correction of an earlier obviously inadvertent misstatement and we accept entirely what he has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there are two principal reasons why the house should not accept the advice of the noble lord lord bellwin about section of the act <e> <s> first although it is undoubtedly the case that in the early years relatively little use had been made of section it became an issue in the merseyside judgment of mr justice woolf <e> <s> i should like to quote from the judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords in resisting the amendment the noble lord lord lucas is really trying to spring a trap not just for the opposition but also for the authorities and executives <e> <s> i invite the house to examine the issue from the point of view of the authority <e> <s> the authority has responsibility under clause to produce the best transport plan it can at the best possible price taking into account the needs of the mainstream transport users in its area <e> <s> it has all sorts of hoops to jump through to reach that stage going backwards and forwards between the authority and the executive and having to take heed of the guidance of the secretary of state <e> <s> in doing so the interests of what i call the mainstream users of the basic services must be paramount <e> <s> the best possible service at an acceptable price must be provided for those users <e>", "<cs> my lords on each of the occasions when the governments reply is given to amendments put forward from this side of the house i have a little bet with myself as to which of the two speeches the minister is going to make <e> <s> will it be the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would accept that i was not criticising the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for repeating his arguments <e> <s> i was merely criticising the content of those arguments and apologising for the fact that i myself was repeating the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in one respect in that i want to speak mainly about the amendment rather than about the bill <e> <s> all i will say about the bill can i think come from the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in my short experience i have seen that majority working very effectively <e> <s> there is a majority available to a conservative government which want to push through legislation with a deadline <e> <s> the deadline is more important than the wording or the effect of the bill <e> <s> that majority is available and during the last few weeks ruthless use has been made of it in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i did hear what the noble lord said and i do not disagree with it in any way <e> <s> i am not saying that the government exercise on every bill their power to achieve their intentions <e> <s> i am saying that when it is thought to be necessary by the government that when it is a relatively straightforward political issue let us not deny that this is an issue of political difference between the conservative and the labour parties i would not attempt to deny it at all and that when there is a deadline a majority is available and no attempt on this side of the house to make any reasonable changes has any effect whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two duties at the outset <e> <s> one gives me unalloyed pleasure and it is to express on behalf of the house our appreciation of the excellent maiden speech of the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> if i may say so i thought that she not only showed her professional knowledge but also the warmth which she feels about adult education students <e> <s> that was particularly valuable to us in this debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trefgarne in his opening speech gave a very lucid expose of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> what he totally failed to do was to give any business case for the very complicated measure which is before your lordships house <e> <s> he described the company which would follow the present british telecom the plc as <e>", "<cs> i shall be extremely brief because i want to make only one point which i believe has not yet been made in this debate <e> <s> the clause affects not only individual properties but also the viability of some whole housing associations <e> <s> i quote from a letter to me from the haringey educational housing association <e> <s> this was established says my correspondent <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has introduced objections to these amendments on a principle that is dear to his heart that nothing should be done for the first time <e> <s> however leaving that aside i fear that he has misconstrued the amendments in two serious respects <e> <s> first he has been talking as if the council proposed by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is to be a council of a body responsible for administration of british telecommunications <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the council is to be of the office of telecommunications which of its nature is a body small deliberately compact and concerned with relations with a large variety of outside bodies including trade unions but also particularly including existing and potential licencees <e>", "<cs> the distinction that i was attempting to draw was between the administration of the office a body of people and the administration of british telecom a body of nearly a quarter of a million people <e> <s> that is the extent to which i was saying that the officers were concerned with the outside world and that internal administration surely will be a very minor part of its activities <e>", "<cs> the minister in his several responses on this amendment has no doubt wisely exercised the better part of valour <e> <s> he has taken the amendment at its face value and he has sought to argue against it first i am sorry to say on the grounds of precedent and i shall come back to that in a moment and secondly on the grounds that it is difficult to say who the appropriate trade unions should be <e> <s> that second objection can readily be answered <e> <s> so far as the civil service element is concerned it should be the trade unions representing the grades who will be employed in the office of telecommunications <e> <s> in so far as the government have it in mind to recruit from outside the civil service possibly only on secondment but possibly on a longer-term basis this will most likely be from the telecommunications industry in its widest sense <e> <s> the appropriate unions would therefore include those unions recognised in the telecommunications industry <e> <s> this need cause no serious problems to the government at all <e>", "<cs> before the minister rises i have a simple question which he might like to take on board at the same time as he gives his other replies <e> <s> it has to do with the difference between financial control by the treasury and control by affirmative approval of both houses of parliament <e> <s> my question is this <e> <s> is a non-ministerial department of the kind proposed like the office of fair trading within the orbit of any of the select comittees of the other place <e> <s> is there any other opportunity than that proposed in this amendment for something more than financial control and for some real questioning by either house of parliament of the activities of the office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it may seem presumptuous of one who has been in your lordships house for fewer than four months to be so soon seeking your lordships support for legislation <e> <s> that presumption must be the more compounded when the legislation is concerned with the office of coroner which dates from the year years ago <e> <s> i can only ask that that presumption be excused <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> in doing so i must express my appreciation to the government and to the noble lord lord glenarthur for the welcome they have given to the bill <e> <s> i am particularly gratfule to the noble lord for making it clear that the government will attempt to simplify the introduction to the bill by simplifying the dates provided for in clause <e> <s> we are already indebted to the government for another matter namely the institution of rules by the attorney general for juries in other courts whereby the procedures drawn up by the royal statistical society for the random selection of jurors from the electoral roll have been brought into force by this government <e> <s> since it is the last week of this government it would seem churlish not to say so before they vanish into oblivion <e>", "<cs> i fully sympathise with the strength of feeling which has led noble lords to support this amendment indeed these two amendments <e> <s> but i beg the house to think of it from the penological point of view and from the point of view of the appropriateness of custodial sentences <e> <s> there are two kinds of people who are likely to commit offences under this bill first those who do it for gain and secondly those who do it for religious and/or cultural reasons <e> <s> the majority of those who do it for gain will presumably be qualified medical practitioners for whom it is correct to say that the threat of a fine may not be the overriding consideration <e> <s> but the condemnation of their medical colleagues will be inevitable if they are convicted of an offence under this act <e> <s> they will certainly suffer far more

this case will apply particularly strongly to medical practitioners <e> <s> the problem about back-street circumcisions is not really an issue of the kind of penalty that should be imposed but whether such people can be found <e> <s> i believe that is the consideration to which we should be confining ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would permit me before he leaves the question of restrictive practices and william allen in particular to ask this question <e> <s> would he not recognise that mr allens success in the esso refinery in fawley shows that it was management that was at fault rather than the unions restrictive practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to open by giving a very brief summary of the economic achievements of an administration going to the country after four years in power an administration in which real wages remained constant in which employment not unemployment increased by per cent <e> <s> in which real gross national product increased by per cent <e> <s> in which labour productivity increased by per cent <e> <s> all i think your lordships would agree good measures of successful economic management of an economy over a period of four years <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to address your lordships i console myself that i at least cannot be accused of repeating today what i said on second reading the last time because i did not have the honour to be a member of your lordships house at that time <e> <s> but i have taken the precaution of reading the debate and i hope that i have gained some benefit from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would accept that logically the two must be equal in the end <e>", "<cs> my lords in the governments further consideration of this matter and before the minister gives any more incautious replies will he give due weight to the views of mr alan greengross the conservative leader of the opposition in the glc who argues against the abolition of the glc not only on the grounds of democracy for londoners but also on the grounds that the alternative is likely to be more expensive and more bureaucratic <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone spoke against the amendment but his speech gave good arguments for the amendment <e> <s> the minister gave some genuine cases which would justify a distinction between a real intention and an expression of opinion and i accept that when he did that he was doing so entirely fairly <e> <s> but the noble lord lord mottistone made it clear in his speech that whether the expression of opinion was genuinely an <e>", "<cs> we too should like to support the amendment for exactly the same reasons as those given by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> it is not just the equipment which is changing week by week the capability of the equipment and the divisions between different categories of equipment are also changing week by week <e> <s> i am reminded of the long drawn out battle between the united states justice department and at and t no doubt noble lords will recall that at and t was told by the justice department that in pursuit of laws against monopolies it could not take part in data processing activities <e> <s> at and t started by fighting that decision of the justice department and eventually it realised that the only way it would get anywhere would be by seeking from the justice department a definition of what was data processing <e> <s> that took several months to obtain from the justice department <e> <s> when it was obtained at and t said thank you very much thats a marvellous definition <e> <s> it applies exactly to our main business of telecommunications <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the governments intentions are entirely admirable <e> <s> i can see from the way the noble lord the minister argues that he wishes to move in the same direction as the noble lord lord mottistone and other noble lords <e> <s> however it will not work if done in this way <e> <s> the word equipment is one of the few words in the clause that is not defined elsewhere <e> <s> how do the government see the word equipment being defined <e> <s> does it include for example both hardware and software <e> <s> unless it does in this area we shall get nowhere at all <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me may i point out that leporellos list did not contain any names it was sorted only by nationality <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister in defending the clause said that the interpretation here was neutral <e> <s> if we could all agree on that the purpose of the blanket amendment which my noble and learned friend has just moved would be to some extent diminished <e> <s> but i want to argue that in at least two cases the interpretation that we have very clearly diminishes the rights of data subjects and cannot possibly be said to be neutral <e>", "<cs> very briefly is there an answer to my queries about the provisions for correction of incorrect data <e>", "<cs> i welcome the terms in which the minister has answered this probing amendment because i believe that on several occasions in his speech he has given support to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i know that we are not finally discussing amendment no <e> <s> but it is in practice impossible not to look at the differences between the two in discussing the first of the two amendments <e> <s> the first issue the minister raised was that of practicality <e> <s> i assume that we are talking here about saving unnecessary duplication of effort unnecessary time and money on the part of the registrar data users or groups of data users or as would have been in the amendment of the noble lord lord digby the committee now not to exist in that form <e>", "<cs> unfortunately it does not do so as at present drafted <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> i shall not bandy examples with the minister <e> <s> obviously we could all find examples to prove our own case <e> <s> all i would say in support of the noble lord lord avebury is that there will be examples where the rights of the data subject will be diminished unless there is some pressure on the data user to declare in advance what kind of use he intends for the data <e> <s> as the minister says this is properly a debate which should take place on clause so i shall not pursue it <e> <s> but i want to make it clear that at that time i shall wish to support the noble lord lord avebury in making sure that any deficiency in clause as it emerges from this committee is corrected as far as possible by protection for the data subject by making the data user make up his mind and say as far as possible in public what intentions he has with regard to the data <e>", "<cs> i fear that in his reply the minister has shown scant understanding of the problems of the data subject who has the difficulty of finding out where he or she may be referred to and where it is in his or her interests to correct a record <e> <s> it is not enough to say that he or she the data subject will know which data user to look for he or she also has to know the nature of the data bank and the nature of the record <e> <s> it is as important to be able to scan across a variety of records across a number of data users as it is to be able to scan the different kinds of information registered by a particular data user <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me that question before i sat down and i therefore take it that i have a duty to reply to it <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord swinfen to the extent that it does not matter very much whether there is a separate application <e> <s> the important aspect is that it should be distinguished that it is for that purpose that the data are being registered <e> <s> i am not satisfied at the moment that that is being achieved <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> is not the interest of the data subject part of the purpose of the bill <e> <s> is not the convention concerned with the interests of the data subject <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether in his response the minister has failed to understand the nature of this amendment <e> <s> in his speech before the adjournment for dinner he raised some objections with most of which i agreed to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord digby <e> <s> he said that the requirements for any code of practice and i took great note of what he said because it was relevant to this amendment were that it should be practical which i took to mean should save the time and money of data users data subjects and particularly the registrar that it should not claim to be above the law and that it should be in conformity with the principles laid down in schedule to the bill <e> <s> with all of those requirements i think we should agree <e>", "<cs> some of us had mixed feelings about the previous amendment <e> <s> it was a badly drafted amendment to the wrong bill <e> <s> however it represented the view which many of us have held my former colleagues in local authorities will confirm that i have always held it that local authorities should not support party political activities <e> <s> to that extent there was some justification for the previous amendment <e> <s> in contrast the present amendment seems one of unalloyed wickedness <e> <s> i am not surprised that it should be moved by lord harris <e> <s> the noble lord has been a centralist all his life whether inside the labour party or outside it <e> <s> i am however surprised that the noble lord lord kilmarnock should have put his name to it because i thought that he was a libertarian <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me i think i stated clearly that throughout my time in local government i have been against expenditure by local authorities for party political purposes and i am now <e> <s> i thought i had made that clear <e>", "<cs> that was a very high-minded reply if i may say so and it removed from the governments argument for exempting payroll and accounting data the issue of practicality <e> <s> i should have thought that the prime argument for exempting payroll and accounting data from part ii of the bill was primarily one of practicality that these are universal types of data and that the inclusion of these data in the bill would have made the task of the registrar very much more onerous and would have made it much more difficult for the remainder of automatically processed data to be dealt with adequately by the registrar and his very limited staff as the noble lord lord mottistone said <e> <s> i would go along with that practical argument for exempting payroll and accounting data <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friends will be grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> i only want to point her in one direction in her reconsiderations and to say that i believe that she has made out a reasonable case for paragraph <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds to that reply i should like to add a single sentence in support of the minister by saying that it is not just a matter of who controls and uses the data and he is quite right in saying that the place where the data are processed is not the valid consideration <e> <s> the fact is that with the networking of computers many data users do not even know where their data are being processed <e> <s> the data could be going on to a network which operates in london in frankfurt and in san jose california and one really has no idea where it is being processed <e> <s> where it is actually being processed is simply a matter of availability <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for having repeated the statement made in another place but is he aware that if informed discussion is going to take place on these proposals and i have only had time for the most cursory glance at the white paper it will have to be on a good deal better basis from the government than any information we have either from the white paper or the statement at the moment <e>", "<cs> those were sweet words to hear from the minister at the outset of this debate <e> <s> no one dislikes having his previously expressed opinions adopted by the government <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mottistone will join me in that view <e> <s> at the risk of seeming slightly sour after the sweet words i have to say that in the opinion of my noble friends and myself this amendment is indeed necessary but it is not sufficient to rectify the difficulties that arise from subsection <e> <s> in welcoming the amendment it must be clear that we reserve our <e>", "<cs> my lords i am struggling to comprehend the meaning of a definition within a definition <e> <s> i am sure that there is something very subtle and searching in the words used by the noble lord and as he invited me to i shall indeed study his words in <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that interesting insight into personal relationships within the government may i presume to probe a little closer into the exact status of this statement and the letter to the chief executive of british rail <e> <s> am i right in thinking that this is a statement which is headed letter to british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will not be surprised to learn how much i disagree with what he has just said <e> <s> but i do not intend to rehearse it <e> <s> there was one thinghowever which really surprised me <e> <s> it was when he said that there was a large and rapidly increasing number of computers and data banks <e> <s> that is undoubtedly true but the question i have to ask is this <e> <s> can it be true that the number of codes of practice can exceed the number of computers and data banks <e> <s> the whole purpose of codes of practice is to reduce the burden upon the registrar of individual computers and data banks having to be reported separately <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has indicated that there is a possibility of further consideration even if for another place rather than in this house <e> <s> that is a small step forward and i am grateful to him for it <e> <s> when the government give the matter further consideration may i ask them to consider two things which were lacking from the noble lords statement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as we are at report stage would he say what the government propose to do about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the minister or his advisers have been carried away somewhat in the strength of his reaction to what is essentially a very moderate series of amendments <e> <s> it would have been possible to have started from a much more radical viewpoint <e> <s> i will not conceal from your lordshipsthat i feel that the power of data processing applied to police activities and applied to revenue activities unless it is checked can lead to as grave an injustice and sometimes a graver injustice than that which it seeks to remedy <e> <s> it is not so much the reporting of criminal offences as the ability of instant access to computers for non-criminal activities to be used particularly against young people <e> <s> anybody who has teenage children or perhaps children slightly older will know from them how often young people and particularly young blacks are stopped by the police and an instant interrogation is made of the police computer as to whether anything is known about them <e> <s> that is bad enough but we know that the very fact of their being stopped is itself being recorded in the police computer and they have a record thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would give the comparable figures for central government expenditure so that we can have a true appreciation of the meaning of his figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am one of those of whom a number of noble lords have spoken who have to stifle back the words mr mayor when rising to their feet in public <e> <s> i have served on the largest local authority in the country <e> <s> i have also been an advocate for many years of the small local authorities in the country the local councils <e> <s> i am delighted to have had recently the assurance of the support of the noble lord lord mottistone when i seek leave to introduce into this house a bill to extend to urban areas the rights which villagers have in their parishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the ministers resources available to me but i am sure he can find that figure more easily than i the comparison i wanted to make was not between capital and revenue but between the taxation levied by local <e>", "<cs> my lords the date of that report was august <e> <s> i accept that it is not as recent as i would like it to be but cipfa in its response to recent government white papers has produced very similar results <e> <s> i believe it would be constructive to compare those with the rather more anecdotal evidence produced by the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i only wanted to ask him whether with his vastly greater resources he could give us the same figures of capital versus revenue for central government <e>", "<cs> successful only because of its chairman my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that the national institute for adult <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords have shown great restraint in not going over the arguments that have taken place previously and i shall certainly not break that restraint except parenthetically to regret that my noble and learned friend did not close with a little more about the considerable achievement of himself and others in encouraging the government to remove the immigration exclusion clause <e> <s> but at this stage of the bill as it goes to another place it is not inappropriate to reflect about the position which it will have together with other legislation which is about to go before the other place and come before us in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to complete the answer to the noble baronesss question by giving the other element in the rates that is the amount of government grant <e> <s> will he indicate what part of the rate increase is accounted for by a decrease in government grant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept i am sure he will be able to confirm this by reading <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the noble earls answer to the last supplementary question will the government produce some evidence to show that employers are taking on fewer apprentices because of the wage levels <e> <s> all the evidence i have ever seen indicates that it is the prospect of a job at the end of the apprenticeship that counts <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that what some of us find most depressing is the negative aspect of his statement and what not just noble lords in this house but people in the country will be looking for is evidence that the day on which the present talks break down is the day on which positive plans must be made for the resumption of new talks <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have been gravely deceived by this debate <e> <s> i thought it was to be about the situation in the arts <e> <s> i had hoped that i would have some up-to-date news on the position of poets as the trumpets who sing to battle as the unacknowledged legislators of the world but no such thing <e> <s> the debate has been entirely about the economics of the arts and not about the arts themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be fair to say that we on this side of the house have the converse reaction to this order as compared with our reaction to the orders we have just been debating on social security benefits where my noble friends were less than welcoming of the implications for individual taxation and government funding for those regulations <e> <s> in this case as we understand it the purpose of the order is to restore the original intentions of the consumer credit act <e> <s> to that extent i think we will all welcome the upper limits that are now being revised in this way <e> <s> we accept that the government are right to do that and that in general the upper limits follow the original intentions of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i confess i find myself much more in sympathy with the noble lord lord hill of luton than with any other speaker i have heard today because i believe that the government are coming forward with an irrelevant bill at a particularly unfortunate and irrelevant time <e> <s> in the time available to me i want to show first that cable is a small part of broadcasting and will be a small part of broadcasting rather than a major part and secondly that broadcasting will be a small part of cable <e> <s> that is not as tautologous as at first it might appear <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin my speech by apologising to the house because in addition to my natural disabilities i am today without the use of a large part of my vocal chords <e> <s> therefore i hope that if your lordships have difficulty in hearing me you will so indicate <e> <s> i join with other noble lords who have expressed their gratitude to the minister for his succinct and lucid introduction of the debate <e> <s> i find myself in sympathy with much of what he said about the need for competition and efficiency <e> <s> the only problem with the noble lords speech was that it bore no relation to the bill that he was introducing <e>", "<cs> my lords any undertaking in which it would be grotesquely inefficient to duplicate the supply involves a natural monopoly <e> <s> water is a natural monopoly <e> <s> in various parts of the country there can be different companies or organisations competing with one another in regard to the standard of service <e> <s> but i say to the noble lord that for him or for me or for any other noble lord there is only one supplier of water <e> <s> we are not going to thank anybody for seeking to provide a second choice of water pipes into our homes nor are we going to thank them for a second choice of telephone service or gas electricity or any other such public utility <e> <s> indeed this is recognised in the united states where there have been further moves towards liberalisation but where they have taken the form of creating a number of regional monopolies instead of one national monopoly <e> <s> wherever they may be they are still monopolies <e>", "<cs> my lords i was well aware of the noble viscounts more general points <e> <s> i accept that those are the conditions under which any telecommunications industry will have to work in the future <e> <s> i suggest that there is nevertheless an obligation on the government <e> <s> while this is a public sector industry to be concerned about job losses to minimise them and to provide the best possible protection for the loyal employees of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in paying tribute to the noble earl lord bess borough for his foresight in raising this unstarred question before your lordships house <e> <s> i congratulate him too for he must feel very satisfied that he has attracted so many distinguished scientists <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept what the noble lord has said and indeed i was going to refer with admiration to what he had said about co-operation between industrial firms <e> <s> it is certrainly true that there is a wider spread of funding than would be the case if only a single industrial firm were concerned <e> <s> however that still does not meet my basic point which is that the japanese and alvey anticipated that there would be a single origin of a sense of priorities about the early programmes <e> <s> it is still the case that programmes are being put up by industry either individually or collectively rather than being demanded and directed by the people in charge of the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble and learned lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> he refers to the inquiry to be brought forward by the secretary of state and he also used the word portability <e> <s> surely portability means portability between employment and not between recipients of pensions <e>", "<cs> we wish in general terms to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for very much the same reasons as he put forward <e> <s> it is quite clear that the job to be done by the director general of telecommunications will be complicated <e> <s> by the way i wish that the noble countess lady mar would not refer all the time to this person as him or as i hope that it might be her <e> <s> the complication of the task to be undertaken by the director general is clearly very great <e> <s> it is not just a matter of monitoring the activities of british telecom and other operators <e> <s> the range of interests to be covered includes not only the operators but the manufacturers and in particular the consumers to whom other noble lords have already referred <e> <s> it is impossible to expect the ability to cover all these diverse interests to be subsumed in the shape of one person <e>", "<cs> we might as well start off right <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to rehearse arguments already made but i wish to express my gratitide for the comforting reassurance by the minister that he adheres to the venerable principle that nothing should be done for the first time <e> <s> he told us that the proposal here was entirely novel and indeed it is and he said that if it were to be adopted then it would have to be applied to for example the office of the director general of fair trading and no doubt to other offices as well <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lords story does not rebound against his own argument <e> <s> what he is describing is advice given by a member of your lordships house to a surgeon in other words he is describing a position comparable to the advisers of the director general or as it would have been if the first amendment had been passed the authority

"<cs> i feared when the noble lord lord donaldson said it was an obvious amendment that he was too sanguine <e> <s> my fears have been proved right <e> <s> it seems that the government have misunderstood virtually every aspect of what my noble friend said and have misunderstood the purport of the amendment almost entirely <e> <s> it is not the intention of the amendment it does not say so and it does not mean it that there should be negotiations exclusively with the appropriate trade union <e> <s> of course there will be other people likely to be involved <e> <s> it is not the intention of the amendment that the trade union should be involved in deciding what individuals should be appointed <e> <s> i cannot think how the minister reads that into the words of the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i accept that we have made some progress with the statement from the minister <e> <s> it is necessary for the committee to be told explicitly about the nature of the control through the control of expenditure <e> <s> but that does not answer the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> the example that the noble lord lord cockfield gives of the office of fair trading is not particularly reassuring <e> <s> i am not now talking about the functions of the office of fair trading but about the fact which was referred to by the noble countess lady mar on an earlier amendment that the office of fair trading at the end of last year had a staff of <e> <s> i am prepared to assert that at the time the office of fair trading was set up the figure expected by government was nothing like <e> <s> in other words the office of fair trading because it has only the financial control on its budgets and because it lacks the possibility of direct questioning of the secretary of state on its activities has grown in size and therefore grown in cost to the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for rising again but i was directly challenged <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is not desirable to have actual numbers laid down by statute but the necessity for us to ask for parliamentary scrutiny here arises because we have a quango being set up and because the minister cannot be directly questioned on its activities <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate today has ranged widely from the wellsprings of scientific discovery to the day to day problems of the applications of science and technology in industry <e> <s> my lack of either scientific or technical qualifications makes it essential that any contribution i can make shall be at the latter end of the spectrum <e> <s> i am going to talk almost entirely about the exploitation of science and technology with some wary forays into issues of technological and scientific policy which have been discussed today <e>", "<cs> we are entitled to ask the government to be a little more precise about this matter <e> <s> the noble lord himself in his reply used the words not impossible in respect of british telecom providing service <e> <s> if he thinks that is a suitable phrase then i am sure that my noble friends and i will be very glad to withdraw our amendment and allow its content to come up again in a government amendment at report stage an amendment to the effect that instead of the words reasonably practicable there should be inserted not impossible <e> <s> i am sure all of us will be perfectly satisfied with that form of wording <e> <s> but merely having it stated from the government front bench is not enough for us unless we can be assured that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl and i apologise for not having made myself clear <e> <s> i thought that i had said quite explicitly that it was not possible to distinguish between access and charges <e> <s> it is possible by a policy of high charges for an operator in effect to deny access to services even though the operator may not have the legal right to deny it <e> <s> one cannot distinguish between charges and the legal right regarding provision <e> <s> both must be protected if in turn the subscriber is to be protected <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i have listened with great care particularly to the contributions from the cross-benches and from the conservative benches <e> <s> i would be the first to acknowledge that the concern expressed by many noble lords does not amount to

question whether it would be right to have extremely isolated areas paying the same <e> <s> it is clear from the words of the noble baroness lady macleod of borve who asked for government assurances that there would be protection for rural reas <e> <s> the noble lords lord alport and lord spens and the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies who asked about the existing position on charges and so on were asking for assurances from the government that the well-meaning intentions which have been expressed in ministerial statements should be expressed in a way that could not be denied or got round <e> <s> i have to say this the government have given us no indication whatsoever that they are prepared to make any significant concession on the amendment <e> <s> we are not talking about a change in all licences <e> <s> when we suggested that the british telecom licence ought to be given statutory authority the answer given by the government was that there would have to be of them <e> <s> that is not the case here <e> <s> nobody except british telecom will provide these services to the rural areas <e> <s> it is therefore only the british telecom licences that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i agree with the minister that it is an important amendment <e> <s> i owe an apology to the committee for having moved it so briefly <e> <s> i thought that the government might be willing to consider it and place upon it the same value as i my noble friends and other members of the committee place upon it <e> <s> we find ourselves in the position that needs is in some way an alternative to the subsequent amendments which relate to the top of page of the bill <e> <s> they provide specific protection for directory inquiry services telephone directories and so on <e> <s> if the government had been prepared to accept the amendment their case for opposing the subsequent amendments would have been that much greater <e> <s> if the government are not prepared to accept the word needs as a criterion which the secretary of state must take account of we shall have to press each of these amendments which relate to the protection of individual services for the blind the disabled and so on <e> <s> we shall have to vote the government down as we voted them down half an hour ago <e> <s> i regret it <e> <s> i would rather have this dealt with in a tidy and logical way <e>", "<cs> the case has been very well put and i am confident that the government will respond sympathetically <e> <s> i only want to ask the minister one question referring to the british telcom draft licence <e> <s> it is true that the draft licence for bt does say that oftel will require bt to continue to provide a service for people recognised by the director as being prevented by reason of blindness or other disability from using paper directories <e> <s> but is it not true that the draft licence says that it shall be a free service or a service provided in return for appropriate and reasonable compensation <e> <s> if that is the case is not even the licence defective in protecting the needs of the blind and the disabled and the other groups to which this amendment refers <e>", "<cs> i owe the committee and particularly the lord chairman an aplogy for the confused manner in which i sought to introduce the amendment <e> <s> secondly i accept that there are deficiencies in the wording of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lords lord mottistone lord morris and others have pointed out what is well known that nothing is free <e> <s> the question only is whether an extra charge should be made <e> <s> i suggest that the question of telephone directory availability without additional charge is a matter of great public concern <e> <s> your lordships may remember that some time ago british telecom tried to reduce the availability of telephone directories in london by restricting them to the borough in which the subscriber lived rather than having the whole of the london postal area available to all subscribers in the area <e> <s> it may be necessary to provide rather more protection than the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe in his wise speech seemed to think was necessary <e> <s> nevertheless in view of the deficiencies of the amendment as now worded i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the minister has given us a great deal to think about <e> <s> the relationship between the two subsections in this clause is complex and requires further thought <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not in the bill in quite those terms <e> <s> what we are seeking in trying to amend subsection <e>", "<cs> there are other people engaged in commercial activities related to telecommunications <e> <s> there are the

the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord said whatever might be the case for bringing particular functions in other parts of the bill under this clause <e> <s> in his response to his noble friend lord

point in saying that the need for innovation goes beyond the question of research and techniques into the way in which businesses are run <e> <s> on the previous amendment noble lords were all falling over each other to show how sympathetic they were to small businesses and many of your lordships from personal experience <e> <s> i am a small businessman as well and i appreciate the necessity for innovation in the running of a business as well as in the research and technical side <e> <s> for that reason we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seems to have the impression that this is a soft-hearted amendment <e> <s> may i assure him that it is by no means a soft-hearted amendment <e> <s> it is intended as a totally hard-headed approach to the whole range of obligations of the director general and the secretary of state <e> <s> we are not here talking only about british telecom we are talking about all the employees in the telecommunications industry and i would imagine that the noble lord lord weinstock would come under this heading <e> <s> it is not only in their interests that their welfare should be protected it is in the interests of all of us <e>", "<cs> may i ask <e>", "<cs> if that is the basis of his argument then the minister has just said that nothing in clause will have any effect <e> <s> i cannot speak for the noble viscount but it is certainly not the intention of those of us on this side who seek to support the british telecommunications industry to write things into legislation <e> <s> the legislation is being brought forward by the government and the necessity to protect the british telecommunications industry only <e>", "<cs> i should merely like to echo the words of the noble lord lord ezra and to point out to the committee how modest an amendment this actually is <e> <s> we were criticised in moving amendment no <e> <s> which was about the wellbeing of the employees in the telecommunications industry for moving something that was vague and all-embracing <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which was the next amendment on the subject although it was not moved was restricted to the stable level of employment throughout the telecommunications industry still a tall order your lordships may think <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has made it clear that the amendment is technically defective and would not meet the requirements of the movers but in doing so he has made what at first sight seems to be an alarming concession or has anticipated an alarming concession <e> <s> he said if i understood him rightly that at a later stage in the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord replies may i particularly draw his attention to the words he used about a statement being made on report or third reading <e> <s> if a statement is made at the time of third reading that leaves no opportunity whatsoever for the house to consider what consequential amendments may be required from the governments own amendments <e> <s> that surely would be a serious abuse of the purpose of this house as a revising chamber <e> <s> if amendments come from the government at such a time that the house does not have a chance to consider them or to consider what to do about them or what its attitude should be to them what are we revising <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this matter is going from bad to worse <e> <s> as i understand from the noble and learned lords most recent words this proposed statement is intended to affect his noble friend <e> <s> it is seeking to get lord mottistone to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> in other words it is seeking to change the course of the committee procedures on the bill <e> <s> we are now told that the statement to be made is not itself to be incorporated into the bill <e> <s> that makes me wonder whether the government really understand the financial importance of the resale of leased circuits <e> <s> the basis on which leased circuits can be resold is absolutely critical to the financial viability of british telecom <e> <s> if british telecom is to be forced to sell circuits in bulk and to allow other people to cream off the profits by selling them at a higher price broken up the whole basis on which the prospectus is to be made to the public at the time of flotation is changed <e> <s> i suggest to the noble and learned lord and to the government that the problem that the government have about flotation will be immeasurably worse if any real change is proposed in this statement <e>", "<cs> before your lordships give leave for the amendment to be withdrawn apologise for intervening at this stage but i had not realised that it would be withdrawn so rapidly <e> <s> when i come to read the reply of the noble and learned lord i hope it will not be as favourable to the noble lord lord mottistone as the noble lord seems to think <e> <s> this is a much more serious matter than would appear from the technicalities of levels of communication <e> <s> this is not the case of one telecommunications operator dealing with another on equal terms <e> <s> it is a question of the way in which british telecom deals with other licence holders and they are by no means on equal terms <e>", "<cs> we entirely support the amendments <e>", "<cs> with the slight qualification that i find it difficult to understand how the addition of a word can be both superfluous and damaging i can see the thrust of the arguments of the noble lord lord glenarthur and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fear that i find that reply deeply disappointing <e> <s> of course i was well aware of the amendments proposed by the department of the environment concerning the general development order just as i referred in my speech on amendment no <e> <s> to the prospect that bt itself when privatised will lose certain planning exemptions <e> <s> but the noble lord has shown no understanding of the necessity to have conditions under which the physical environment is to be protected in one single place which can easily be found which i suggest must be in the telecommunications code <e> <s> if we follow the governments proposals we shall find that there are individual elements in each licence which will be concerned with the protection of the environment as the noble lord lord glenarthur has said with reference to the only licence of which we know anything which is the draft bt licence <e>", "<cs> it would be helpful if the government were to go slightly further and say that they are sympathetic towards the objective of securing that damage to the environment is not occasioned by a deal between an operator and an owner or occupier to buy out the rights <e> <s> that is the second part of the amendment <e> <s> it would be helpful if the government were to say that they would look at <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i do not wish to detain the committee <e> <s> i did say at the time that i was speaking to this amendment but not necessarily that i should not be moving it <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister is greatly exaggerating the potentially harmful effects <e> <s> this is only one possible way in which the operator may apply to the court to have a notice set aside <e> <s> it is no more than that <e> <s> it is simply widening the area of possible consideration by the court <e> <s> but i do realise that the government have rejected the basic argument which is that the telecommunications code is the place for this type of environmental protection and in the light of the necessity to come back to that at the report stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am grateful to the noble lord for these offers <e> <s> i hasten to say i have no intention of intervening in the family quarrel as between landlords and occupiers <e> <s> i do not think that in moving this amendment i was in any way putting myself at risk on that score <e> <s> but certainly the offer of further consideration on report of genuine convenants and i accept they have to be genuine convenants and not covenants produced for the purposes of obstruction is very valuable and if i and my advisers from the civic trust can play any part in that consideration we will be happy to do so <e> <s> on that basis i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> only up to a point <e> <s> the amendment refers to street highway or land and the noble lord has referred only to legislation in which refers to streets <e> <s> i wonder whether he can tell me what assurance there is for the restoration of land to its previous condition <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for those explanations and assurances <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that that answer is unsatisfactory in a number of ways <e> <s> first the noble lord has referred almost entirely to highway authorities and to the removal of telecommunications apparatus from the highway whereas as he recognised in his closing remarks the purport of the amendment goes much further than that <e> <s> it includes land other than the highway which may be private land and may be land owned by the authority or accessible in other ways <e> <s> the noble lord also appears to have failed to realise the importance of paragraph <e>", "<cs> i do not think any of us would wish to see delay for its own sake or to weaken the powers of the director general but what is proposed in this amendment does seem quite a remarkable instance of the latter being judge and jury in his own case <e> <s> it is suggested that when the director general of telecommunications makes a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission he shall without waiting for any response from the commission and without hearing any of the evidence the commission will have to consider at the same time modify without consent the conditions of the licence <e> <s> if that is not prejudging the decision of the commission i do not know what is <e>", "<cs> that is no analogy at all <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> this is a complex and dense amendment <e> <s> it has been moved in an unavoidably complex and dense way and also at breakneck speed which makes it somewhat difficult for us <e> <s> i think that it would be wise for us to concentrate on criticism of the right to strike section of <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene <e> <s> it was only because the noble lord lord cockfield referred to amendments which the government propose to put to this clause and subsection on report that i think it is necessary to say that although we agree entirely with his answers to the noble lord lord mottistone he has given only half the story <e> <s> it is not just a matter of the voice lines but the quality of transmission is particularly important for data transmission <e> <s> it will be necessary to see in any amendments that are made that the quality of data transmission on which many millions of pounds may depend will be fully protected <e>", "<cs> our response has to be the same as that on amendment no <e> <s> r <e> <s> although there seems to be considerable improvement in the drafting of clause the complex argument has only just been made available to us <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for allowing me to see his speech on amendment no <e> <s> r <e> <s> it is safest if we reserve our position so that we can raise any points when we come to consider amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the government will have to make up their minds whether they are making real concessions to the noble lord lord mottistone or whether they are cosmetic concessions which the minister is making <e> <s> part iii of the bill is perfectly clear in its intention <e> <s> it says that there is the right of appeal to the director against any abuse of the powers and responsibilities of operators <e> <s> that surely as i <e>", "<cs> i want just a point of clarification before the minister replies <e> <s> i wonder whether he has formed an impression of what the amendment means by per cent of its particular market <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone referred to one possible formulation of one of these companies to whom british telecom should be devolved as being hull <e> <s> there is no competition in hull <e> <s> hull is a monopoly telephone company within its particular geographical area <e> <s> are the government satisfied that the breaking up of a national monopoly into a series of regional monopolies is going to achieve the liberalisation which the noble lord lord mottistone desires <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i am alone in remarking upon the amazing contrast between the governments reaction to previous amendments concerning the successor company and their view on this amendment <e> <s> on countless occasions during this committee stage the government have acceded to requests to tighten the control on the successor company through additional conditions in the british telecom licence <e> <s> admittedly on a number of occasions this has been in response to suggestions from other parts of the committee that there should be controls in a statutory form <e> <s> but even so with what the draft licence already contains and with the many additions which the government have continually been undertaking to add to the draft licence to call this private sector company <e>", "<cs> before leave is given for the amendment to be withdrawn may i remedy an error of silence on our part <e> <s> from these benches we should have said that we support the amendment and think that the noble lord lord rochester has achieved something quite considerable in the response of the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> we join in thanking him for it <e> <s> we believe that this debate has been worth while <e>", "<cs> i fear that the minister has made the absolute minimum of concessions to the noble lord lord donaldson who has moved what to us appears an admirable amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is in effect asking for a blank cheque <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that reminder <e> <s> i do not think that my pen was moving fast enough at that stage <e> <s> i can curtail my remarks on amendment no <e> <s> and simply ask whether the second subsection that is proposed in the amendment would also be acceptable to the government <e> <s> it simply seeks to provide that no such report should infringe the interests either of individuals or of corporate bodies as provided in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> subject to any further thoughts that i may have when i read his answer and the answer on the previous amendments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too believe that this matter should be treated entirely seriously <e> <s> but to put it kindly the minister has not completed the case for the pre-emption argument <e> <s> it is the question of the price to which the noble lord refused to reply that concerns me at this time <e> <s> if the price is that at which the disabled person bought the property then the disabled person will not get any benefit from that purchase <e> <s> the disabled person will be discriminated against in just the way that the government are complaining about now <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble baroness lady stedman for introducing this important topic <e> <s> i am sure that after her historical survey <e>", "<cs> i should have said the noble baroness lady burton <e> <s> i beg the pardon of both noble baronesses <e> <s> the noble baroness lady burton will be the first to agree that the biggest danger in tackling this issue is the well-meaning platitude <e> <s> it is not enough for us any of us of whichever gender to express hopes about the future <e> <s> something positive has to be done about the under-utilisation as she so graphically described it of at least half the ability of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cockfield made great play with the admitted defects of the original amendment <e> <s> since he mentioned my name in connection with those apologies to the committee at that time about the defective wording i looked back at the nature of those defects as we saw them and the arguments put forward successfully to the committee at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very tempting for us to leave this matter to the spiritual side of the house <e> <s> i think what we have here is in effect a theological discussion rather of the sort of the mediaeval disputation of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin <e> <s> does it make any difference whether we use the words effective or whether we use the words free and fair when the whole tendency of the bill as the noble lord lord glenarthur has made it clear is not a liberalisation bill at all <e> <s> if the government had accepted the beesley report then we might he discussing free and fair competition but in order to do that the government would have had to obdure restrictions on resale <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether this is a family quarrel or whether anybody else can join in but i yield as do other noble lords i am sure to the technical knowledge of the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> i just wonder whether the wording he has here will achieve his objectives <e> <s> i say that for two reasons <e> <s> first it seems to me that he is throwing in his hand when he uses the word available because the government are simply going to accept the word available and use it in a different sense <e> <s> secondly if his complaint is about the radio regulatory division that is now in the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i was never in doubt about what was in the mind of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> what i suspect is that the government could accept the word and mean something very different by it <e> <s> that would be my only comment at this stage <e> <s> the other concern that i have about the wording is that it uses the word efficiently <e> <s> i heard a number of noble lords on the government benches attacking the use of the words efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords these are extremely complex matters <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation not only of this amendment but of the consequential amendments <e> <s> i confess that before his speech i had not fully appreciated the full complexity of the relationships among the different clauses and amendments and indeed the telecommunications code <e> <s> as your lordships know there are a considerable number of amendments to schedule in the names of myself and my noble friends which are concerned with the adequacy of the code to protect the physical environment <e> <s> i have a suspicion that the noble and learned lord is going three-quarters of the way round the house in order to come somewhere near the place that we want to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to make the same request but i wonder whether we have a constitutional precedent here <e> <s> do we have a minister reading something into the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it was the intention of the noble lord lord morris but he has really let the cat out of the bag has he not <e> <s> with this series of amendments <e> <s> he has confirmed very precisely why amendment no <e> <s> is inadequate and why no <e> <s> which is about to be moved is inadequate <e> <s> a number of your lordships clearly failed to realise unlike the noble lord lord morris that the substance of clause is in subsection and that the substance consists only in a requirement that the secretary of state or the director shall give notice that he proposes to grant certain kinds of licences and the reasons why those certain kinds of licences are to be granted and in providing for the possibility of objections to licences <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to avoid the noble and learned lord having to seek the leave of the house too frequently may i ask further questions which he might like to consider at the same time as those of the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> at committee stage he made a rather seductive speech <e> <s> it is true that in taking away the criminal liabilities from the employees of british telecom and the employees in the telecommunications industry there was a considerable and welcome concession to the justified fears of those employed in the industry <e> <s> it is true that at committee stage he made great play of the phrase which he has repeated a number of times about the purpose of the action whether wholly or partly being to secure a breach of the operators liabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will permit me has there ever been an occasion when employees have voluntarily forgone their wages and incomes for that sort of purpose as distinct from improving their own conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lords reply was so meaty that we can forgive its length <e> <s> indeed it was scarcely longer than my introduction and managed to say a great deal that is welcome and positive <e> <s> i am happy to accept his undertaking to consider at third reading our amendments nos <e> <s> c and aa and i shall read with great care what he has said particularly about amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords before the withdrawal is accepted i hope that the minister will repudiate the dreadful allegation that the noble lord lord orr-ewing made that british telecom do not keep proper accounts <e> <s> if that is not repudiated it will make a great deal of difference to the possibility of a successful flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting but it does not prescribe that its members shall be it prescribes that the secretary of state shall <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is quite rightly resisting any temptation to seek the leave of the house again <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords i have no wish to oppose this amendment but merely wish to pay tribute as one who lives in the lee of a large block of flats which have minicab radio operators aerials on their roofs to the work of the radio interference service <e> <s> i am delighted to see that its financing is being given statutory authority <e>", "<cs> my lords again i do not wish to oppose the amendment and i certainly do not want to involve myself any more deeply than i did in committee in the lengthy debate between the government and the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> however i should like to ask the noble lord <e> <s> lord glenarthur before he concludes his remarks on this amendment to add to the indications he has just given that there will be further amendments on third reading <e> <s> i should like him to confirm that my understanding is correct that the undertakings given to me yesterday by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate are related to these points <e> <s> i refer to the amendments on clause that he undertook to consider on third reading concerning the register of directions and the conditions to he provided for under the telecommunications code <e> <s> i do not think it is a controversial point <e> <s> i just want to be clear about my own understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is a kernel of good sense in this amendment in that it is undesirable to have unnecessary ducting or cabling beneath our streets or anywhere else <e> <s> it is desirable to secure that there is efficient use of the transmission facilities available <e> <s> however i should like to ask the government in their reply to the amendment to make clear whether the amendment actually achieves that more limited objective <e> <s> it seems to me from reading the wording of the amendment that there is the possibility of extending the permission for public telecommunications operators those who i understand from clause have wayleave rights to install new conduits and to go against the objective which i understand the noble lord lord glanusk is looking for <e> <s> if that is the case and there is the possibility of having more and more operators gaining access underneath our streets and in other areas where this access would cause damage i hope it will be discouraged and resisted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be a kindness to pause for a moment to allow the noble lord to find to which amendment he spoke yesterday to which this is consequential <e>", "<cs> with your lordships leave nothing would have pleased me more than to do the house the courtesy of referring to as many amendments as possible and curtailing the speeches <e> <s> the problem is that the amendments to which i would wish to refer include some of my own as the noble lord has indicated but also include many more of the governments amendments <e> <s> i think it would be quite unusual for me to seek to refer to amendments which have not yet been moved or not yet been spoken to by those under whose name they appear <e> <s> i hope that the house will accept that explanation of the difficulty i have in being precise about what future amendments could actually be referred to when i spoke on no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his explanation and in particular for the last part of it which i think epitomises very clearly the attitude of the present government to a large number of social issues <e> <s> the noble lord says quite rightly i do not disagree with him that the telecommunications code is concerned primarily with land law <e> <s> it is concerned with landowners and tenants and it is only the interests of landowners and tenants or occupiers which are considered important enough to be included in legislation in this way <e> <s> indeed much time has been spent in particular in committee and much time could be spent if all the amendments were debated this evening in protecting the interests of landowners and occupiers <e> <s> but when it comes to the general public those who have a concern for the physical environment those who seek to enjoy the countryside and those who are landless whom i dare to say we perhaps represent more adequately than noble lords on the government benches their interests are not to be protectd by legislation they are to be protected in a much less secure way by means of the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not attempt to follow the passion with which the landowners and their representatives treat this matteri may even be out of order because the noble lord read the amendments to which he was speaking so rapidly and sometimes not in the order in which they appear on the marshalled list to make it even more difficult that i am not certain that he is speaking to the two to which i wish to refer which are amendment no <e> <s> be which removes subparagraph and no <e> <s> bn <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i should declare an interest as a life member of the national trust for scotland <e> <s> in any case i express my gratitude to the noble lord lord glenarthur for the assurances that he has given <e> <s> i take it that if the national trust for england and wales is satisfied the other bodies to which we have referred in particular local authorities because those are by far the most numerous bodies referred to in my amendment will also be satisfied with the assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i shall have to rely on the last sentence of what the noble lord <e> <s> lord glenarthur said and his statement that the secretary of state may under suitable circumstances clearly only if there are major abuses taking place i quite understand that point intervene to ensure that licences and the practices of operators take account of this quite serious environmental point even though it may cause amusement to the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that that explanation meets the point with which i was concerned a larger or more offensive installation <e> <s> if it is true that completion of an installation covers that point i am happy to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply unimpressed and unconvinced by the detailed arguments of the noble lord although i have no doubt about his goodwill <e> <s> we have proposed both in committee and report a number of detailed amendments designed to strengthen the telecommunications code <e> <s> a number of these have been withdrawn or not moved on the basis of assurances that have been given <e> <s> we are grateful for those assurances and believe that the situation is not as bad as it was before <e> <s> but the noble lord has not answered except to say that it is too late to move this kind of amendment the major point that i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my response to that must be modified rapture <e> <s> there are a number of substantive points which i believe to be helpful <e> <s> i believe the exposure of these arguments in debate will encourage further improvement <e> <s> first may i recognise that the amendments which have been made so far at report stage have improved the publicity given to the detailed conditions of licence and have made it more possible for objectors or potential objectors to understand what it is they are having to deal with <e> <s> the whole concept of the local availability of the register is a valuable one and i am grateful to the government for that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that seems to be a reasonable alternative <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to the government that we welcome these amendments <e> <s> they will know that we had already considered putting down an amendment to achieve very much the same effect although with nothing like the complexity and skill of the government and indeed lacking the help of the resources available to the government in moving such amendments <e> <s> i have to confess that the amendment appears to us very much a second best <e> <s> it had been our wish throughout that there should be directory inquiry services of the type described by the noble lord available free of charge to all subscribers as they have been made available historically by british telecommunications and i assume by the hull telephone undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords in most of what he said the noble lord lord mottistone appears to be referring to systems of electronic mail <e> <s> i may have misunderstood him and if so i shall gladly <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i shall withdraw the guarded welcome that i was about to give to the amendment <e> <s> if it is to be concerned primarily with electronic mail i do not think anyone could have any objection <e> <s> after all electronic mail systems operate primarily through data networks <e> <s> it is not my understanding and here i would be glad of the governments confirmation that they would be considered to be part of telecommunications systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of wearying the house by repeating the arguments made on this at report stage particularly as the arguments have been made so effectively and freshly by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in his admirable and quite ingenious amendment <e> <s> it seems that this bill has various layers of protection moving down from the first part of clause to the second part of clause a long way down to clause and way beyond that to unprotected licence conditions <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble lord would give effect to the assurances given by the government when they rejected the amendment which we moved at committee stage <e> <s> it would seem logical and rational for them to accept the amendment which is now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble and learned lord not only for the amendments but for the very clear way in which he moved them <e> <s> i cannot avoid noting that on nd march the noble and learned lord wrote to the society of telecom executives using the words with which he now proposes to amend the bill and in that sense i suspect he was rather jumping the gun on the position as it stood at that time <e> <s> but these are improvements <e> <s> they overcome some of the difficulties that we foresaw with some of the government amendments when they were moved earlier and we indicated that we did not think the government were making these difficulties intentionally <e> <s> we are glad to have it confirmed that this is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord persuaded the house at report stage that it was desirable that there should be this possibility of civil action <e> <s> but i have to say that he did so on the basis of the wording of his amendment <e> <s> that provided for very strict restraints on the litigation that might otherwise be possible <e> <s> the first of those restraints was that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to facilitate the creation of parishes in urban areas <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has just said the last five speeches have been about the problems of the third world and the impact on the third world of interest rates <e> <s> i hope it will be taken as evidence of my own incapacity rather than any reflection on the importance of the subject of the third world or indeed on the quality of the speeches if i turn completely from that subject to what is literally a parochial subject namely the burden of interest rates on local authorities which is included in the admirable motion of my noble friend lord beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to the noble viscount lord eccles the minister referred to the need for what is in effect rate capping during the first three years of the new authority <e> <s> may i ask him in what sense this is a new authority <e> <s> is it the governments intention that the staff of the inner london education authority shall lose their jobs and have to reapply for them <e> <s> is that the position of those with responsibility in schools <e> <s> surely the governments intention cannot be to cause disruption among staff and in the schools and in that sense is it meaningful to talk about a new authority <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> can he point out the reference to an inquiry in the amendment <e>

blame for being here <e> <s> just over a year ago i had the temerity to make my maiden speech in your lordships house in a debate on the future of the ordnance survey and to talk specifically about digital mapping <e> <s> i was misled by the common courtesy of your lordships to think not only that i might have made a reasonable speech but also that i had some intellectual understanding of the issues involved <e> <s> i must assure your lordships that my technical knowledge of these matters is extremely limited and if i succeeded in concealing that fact a year ago i will have much more difficulty in concealing it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be able to help my noble friend <e> <s> section of the act says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is better to ask a question now than not to have it answered in a winding-up speech <e> <s> now that the noble lord has gone back to the question of district councils and as he

been made in urban areas in england in the period since when the reviews started <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for making his and the governments position so clear <e> <s> i think that is about all i can be grateful to him for because it seems to me that the arguments he has put forward do not really advance the case for local democracy and do not really provide an adequate response to something which is not and was never intended to be a party political issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that assurance and of course i accept it <e> <s> but really the strength of the argument is also inadequate against this bill <e> <s> yes it is recognised and there is <e>", "<cs> since i was challenged directly on whether it was a sufficient answer to what i am saying i must say that i do not believe that what i am saying is in any way altered or diminished by the statement of the noble lord lord elton that there should be a prohibition in regard to recordings under the guise of current affairs <e>", "<cs> i was under no illusion about that <e> <s> i understand very well the difference between prohibition and classification <e> <s> i am also familiar with the commercial incentives for certain kinds of producers to produce the kind of film which the noble lord lord elton has described <e> <s> unfortunately since i was unable to put down my name for the second reading debate i was not invited to the viewing and therefore i have not in person seen the examples but many years ago there was a film called mondo cane which was widely shown in cinemas in this country <e> <s> it was a collection of clips of unpleasant and sometimes much worse incidents which were put together for the purpose of titillation and with the object of collecting audiences who gloried in violence <e> <s> i was in no way attempting to defend that kind of commercialisation and in no way attempting to suggest that it was wrong to classify such exhibitions <e>", "<cs> if the noble lady will forgive me again i understand that perfectly well but clause refers to specific activities which may or may not be part of a genuine current affairs programme <e> <s> but it covers both the issue of classification and the issue of prohibition does it not <e> <s> if i am right that it covers prohibition as well then we have a provision which is not only an infringement of liberty but which also contains the possibility of denying to our people the understanding which will make them revolt against violence and therefore do the opposite of achieving the effect which the sponsors of the bill wish to achieve <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i must persist in this <e> <s> channel recently showed a programme about belsen which was in no sense recent news coverage which dealt with events which happened years ago <e> <s> a series of programmes was shown in the united states in this country and most usefully in germany called holocaust which contained scenes and acts

prepared to give guidance to that designated authority as to what is proper and what is not proper parliament is simply introducing censorship without giving adequate guidance as to what that censorship should be about <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships committee that the balance of the argument must always be that if one is giving people powers to interfere with liberties the intention is to interfere with undesirable liberties and i perfectly agree with that part of the aims of the bill then parliament itself must indicate the limitations on that interference with liberties <e> <s> it does not do so in the bill as it stands and the amendment helps it to do so <e> <s> that is why i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting that unless parliament puts in such guidelines it

doctrine of fiduciary duty <e> <s> at a stroke both of those elements of responsibility or safeguards which the government of that time thought were important for the proper running of london transport as a public service are being taken away from what will still be a public service <e> <s> the government made a political decision to take one of them away and they won an election <e> <s> right the opposition accept that <e> <s> but to take away the legal safeguards at the same time seems to be not only knocking down the ratepayers of london but kicking them in the teeth when they are down <e>", "<cs> this is a moderate version of the previous amendment <e> <s> it is designed to eliminate the kind of argument which the noble lord lord lucas used in resisting the previous amendment <e> <s> i shall be as moderate as i always am in my reaction to what he says <e> <s> but i have to say to him again that it was the conservative party which rejoiced in the decision of the law lords that there had to be a legally enforceable balance between the interests of the ratepayers and the taxpayers <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any inconsistency at all <e> <s> the debt that was written off thanks to the noble lord lord plummer was one which was written off as between taxpayers and ratepayers <e> <s> in other words the money was still in the public sector <e> <s> what subsection provides is that there may be a sale or transfer of assets to the private sector and it is the interest of both taxpayers and ratepayers in this case that i am seeking to protect <e> <s> i still ask the noble baroness for her support and for her confirmation that it was the policy of her party to encourage capital expenditure by taxpayers and ratepayers in london transport <e>", "<cs> the argument is politically totally unconvincing <e> <s> it would have some degree of plausibility if it were not for the fact that subsection refers to the transfer of assets as well as to the sale <e> <s> in other words that presumably means transfer without compensation and that the person or persons to whom the transfer is made is in the public sector <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble baroness lady gardner there is a great deal of difference between transfers from one part of the public sector to another and transfers to the private sector <e>", "<cs> briefly i do not wish to detain the committee but while we are discussing privatisation of parts of london transport it is necessary to make the point because it was not made on second reading from my reading of the debate

their transport systems which is what ratepayers in other parts of the country have <e> <s> i sometimes get the impression that governments of this party have not trusted the people of london since the gordon riots of the s and that they fear that any power which is given to the people of london to make decisions about their own services and this applies not only to this bill but also to

nothing which gives that assurance <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord lord plummer has not read the bill or was not listening to his noble friends answer <e> <s> the question is not whether the surplus should be returned to the ratepayers or go into the kitty of london regional transport but whether it should be swept into the purse of the treasury and therefore into the consolidated fund

be even higher <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he said <e> <s> it would be fair to say that in per cent <e> <s> of the cases which he and i think are likely the government would adopt the same policy as we would wish them to adopt <e> <s> unfortunately the legislation does not say that <e> <s> the bill as drafted gives the possibility for the government perhaps another

ex-ministers as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter about what happens to money which is taken from other pockets and put into the pockets of the treasury <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e>

the greatest hesitancy as a non-lawyer in the company of many lawyers <e> <s> however since the amendment of the noble lord lord swinfen that would have introduced a custodial sentence for this

personal capacity <e> <s> may i therefore assure him that there is general agreement among some of us on these benches with what he says <e> <s> it seems to me personally that to introduce into

understand it from the noble lord lord nugent there is the question of a summons in the police and criminal evidence bill which was the point that my noble friend lord houghton was making <e>", "<cs>

changed the title to the specified premises amenities bill and immediately got it through <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that one important reason for encouraging overseas

business <e> <s> but if the necessity for such an amendment is so obvious now and i can see that it must be it makes one wonder whether the government were as far-sighted as has been claimed earlier

including the common council <e> <s> it is proposed in this amendment that the common council should be represented on the new council <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down in justice he ought to pay tribute to the very serious speech of his noble friend the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes rather than appear to think that the opposition comes only from my noble friend and myself <e>", "<cs> i do not want to add significantly to what my noble friend has said but as a non-lawyer i have one or two questions to put to the government <e> <s> am i right in thinking that this is the first time in legislation that the word parties referring to political parties has appeared <e> <s> if so what definition is given for political parties <e> <s> my noble friend referred to the london borough of hillingdon <e> <s> he referred only to the balance between the conservative and the labour party but a significant part of the council of the london borough of hillingdon is the ratepayers association <e> <s> it does not call itself a political party <e> <s> is subsection supposed to permit representations to the hillingdon ratepayers who would deny the existence of a political party <e> <s> what happens to independents <e> <s> they may not be common in the glc or in metropolitan counties but i wonder whether we are not enshrining into legislation almost by the back door a concept which we all recognise of political parties <e> <s> many of us would not be here unless we did i say that carefully <e> <s> but is it right in this way without recognition of all the implications of the constitution of political parties to introduce this now into this legislation for a period of only months <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i wonder whether he would try to do it so that it could be considered before report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am fortunate in following a number of excellent speakers on the first of these two bills in that it relieves me of any responsibility of adding to the speeches even if i were capable of doing so <e> <s> i thought that my noble friends lady nicol and lord graham and the noble lord lord grimond in a very wise speech covered this ground very adequately indeed <e> <s> therefore this afternoon i want to concentrate on the second bill which has been added and it is my inclination to do so anyway because the sums of money involved have at least two and probably three noughts added on the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not saying that the bill should contain a definition of a small firm <e> <s> it may be entirely my own incompetence but i cannot find in the bill any reference to concessions to small firms of whatever size <e>", "<cs> the noble lord read his brief on amendment no <e> <s> at breakneck speed and i can see why <e> <s> he can only have hoped that we would not notice the fundamental illogicality of what he says <e> <s> i do not believe that this lame duck committee stage is the appropriate time to make a long speech <e> <s> but it is necessary to point out that under any regime in london and in the metropolitan counties there will have to be something other than district and local plans <e> <s> there will have to be some continuation of strategic land use planning and that i believe is recognised in the governments own intentions and in streamlining the cities <e> <s> i believe there is talk of a planning commission which would fulfil those functions <e>", "<cs> the noble lords protestations of ignorance and innocence are very affecting <e> <s> but he ought to have been briefed adequately with the firm knowledge that he is to be presented with substantial amendments to the greater london development plan to the structure plan and that the glc had to take the department of the environment to court within the past months in order to get it to fulfil its statutory duty to consider such amendments <e> <s> when it came to court mr justice hodgson made some very unflattering remarks about the department of the environment and said that the departments behaviour was less than might have been expected of a great department of state <e> <s> in saying that i do not claim to quote the actual words <e>", "<cs> i am glad that i shall not be in the shoes of the noble lord lord bellwin if this amendment is passed <e> <s> i do not believe he has any conception of the depth of the heffalump trap that he is digging for himself <e> <s> he will have two problems that he has not even started to appreciate <e> <s> first there is the problem of actually policing this new clause <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> i think my intervention may be helpful to the noble lord <e> <s> if he is so anxious to reassure these bodies and i accept what he says will he tell the committee when his officials are going to start to consider the applications which already are <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer back again to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> all of us in this house because the cross-benches are empty have made a political commitment and some of us receive opprobrium because of our commitment <e> <s> will the noble lord consider i know he is in no position to reply but perhaps he will consider in his mind whether the difficulties involved in contracting in may not be greater when the problem of opprobrium among workmates and among employers arises and whether the personal difficulties which he described so graphically might not be greater with a system of contracting in <e>", "<cs> may i my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls made two points which i would welcome the opportunity within the rules of order of a report stage to debate with him very briefly and i shall now attempt to do so <e> <s> the first point he made was that the timing for any legislation is in the power of government and parliament to determine and that there is no reason why legislation should not be brought forward quickly and brought into force quickly if the government so decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that the noble lord was being disdainful to the councillors <e> <s> of course they must put forward the policies upon which they wish to be elected <e> <s> i cannot imagine that any of the parties contesting an election on nd may would lose the opportunty to put forward those policies and seek to persuade the electorate of them <e> <s> if however the noble lord believes that what would happen would be that the electorate would express a view on the governments policies on abolition i think he is right and then i insist that it is disdainful of him to suggest that the electorate should not make up their own minds on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords lord boyd-carpenters hit list of organisations of which he does not approve is becoming a little tattered <e> <s> he has been using it over and over again at all stages of this bill and at all stages of the rates bill <e> <s> it is not a particularly effective list because the noble lord does not actually give the figures of the amounts of money concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments statement is couched as if it represented concessions to local authorities as if the fact that the requirement for the overspend to be put right for next year were actually a concession <e> <s> will the minister not agree that what we are now seeing is the inevitable result of the uncertainty which has been placed on local authorities by the combination of short-term capital objectives and the requirement that capital disposals be part of the allocation even though a substantial part of the receipts from capital disposals goes to central government rather than to local authorities <e> <s> will the minister cast his mind back to his own period in local government and the problems that i am sure he must have faced in leeds in forecasting capital expenditure <e> <s> will he not recognise that local authority treasurers finance committees and chairmen have been put under an intolerable burden of uncertainty which not only makes it difficult for them to forecast but causes them to make bad capital expenditure decisions <e> <s> will the minister acknowledge that the changes which are annnounced today do nothing to make any better that uncertainty and that bad management <e>", "<cs> my lords may i seek the leave of the house to ask a single question that i neglected to put when i rose previously <e> <s> may i ask the minister how he reconciles the continuing pressure for disposal of capital assets with amendment no <e> <s> carried to the local government interim provisions bill on monday which makes it necessary to have the secretary of states approval for even very small disposals of land <e> <s> it seems that the two types of pressure are totally in conflict one with another <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express our thanks to the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i wish i could say the same about the availability of the white paper itself <e> <s> my honourable friend in another place was supplied with a copy of the white paper by the ministers right honourable friend some time ago and yet when i went to the printed paper office at this afternoon i was told that the white paper was embargoed until <e> <s> i think the house will agree that this makes it extremely difficult for the opposition to make the kind of effective and constructive comments that we like to make on statements of this kind <e> <s> it is particularly galling that this should be the case because we have been waiting two years since july for this white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister in his first reply saw fit to contrast the enterprise of the film industry with my personal lack of enterprise <e> <s> i may assure him that i will resist any temptation to make personal comments about him <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne has fallen into a very elementary logical trap <e> <s> he thinks that because he is attacking my noble friend lord bruce of donington he is somehow thereby defending the government and defending the bill <e> <s> i have to tell him that nothing could be further from the truth <e> <s> the virtues which he has put up for the bill do not in fact exist and the government are not claiming that they exist <e> <s> neither the government nor the civil service is claiming that they exist <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that intervention because that is exactly the point that i was about to make next <e> <s> the government are under the illusion which clearly in this case is shared by the noble lord that the only matter with which we must be concerned is immediate job creation <e> <s> his examples of sullom voe and moss morran are certainly examples of capital investment where the number of people involved in the plant itself is very small <e> <s> but although the capital investment involved in the creation of an energy industry which in turn creates cheaper energy for the whole country may not be regional industrial policy it is certainly a rational form of industrial policy and is certainly a rational way of saying that the competitiveness of the british economy depends on a cheap and efficient energy supply and that the jobs indirectly created from that will be significant and could be taken into account in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends question refers to the community at large <e> <s> i hope she will forgive me if i refer in what i have to say to the community at small and to the needs of small communities and the relationship between those small communities and local authorities <e> <s> i know that it is only part of the problem with which this very valuable question is concerned but i believe it is an important part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will he agree that the proposal that he has just described is a good deal less effective and comprehensive than the exemption of expenditure on charitable bodies which was carried by this house and then overturned by the government at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i had come unprepared for this attack and have no references to hand <e> <s> however i and others of my colleagues on the opposition benches have stood up strongly against law breaking and against any spoils system in local government wherever it may be <e>", "<cs> and others my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when i consider the wording of my noble friends motion i cannot resist the cynical thought that it is oppositions who are always in favour of decentralisation and governments who are always in favour of central authority rather in the way that politicians who see that they have some prospect of an absolute majority in another place or in a council are against proportional representation and those who have no such prospect are in favour of proportional representation <e>", "<cs> my lords when the issue before the house is violation of the law i suppose there may be those unkind enough to ask somebody speaking from this dispatch box whether he is in favor of the enforcement of the law and obedience to the law <e> <s> let me assure the house that i can unhesitatingly give the assurance that i am in favour of the enforcement of the law and of obedience to the law but i cannot help the thought occasionally that there are degrees of moral opprobrium given against some perpetrators of disobedience to the law <e> <s> the moral atmosphere for striking trade unionists and local councillors seems to be a little bit different from that which applies sometimes to entrepreneurs and advertisers <e>", "<cs> my lords he is i am the only one <e> <s> but i do not suppose for a moment that <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords correction <e> <s> but i do not think there is a great deal of financial benefit to be gained from being a director of a local radio station <e> <s> i am convinced not only from that fact but also from the force of the arguments that it has not been a significant factor in this debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the practical complications of legislation to permit political enthusiasts to occupy occasional airwaves on a sunday afternoon would be too great <e> <s> therefore i am suggesting and here i think that i am following the noble lord lord aylestone that we ought not to be worried too much about that sort of breaking of the law <e> <s> i think it was the noble lords noble friend who led the way to that sort of tolerance which the french government found that they had to accept after a period during which they tried very seriously to crack down on these zealot radio stations <e> <s> so my answer to the noble lord lord kennet is the same as that of his noble friend let us not worry about them too much and certainly let us not worry about the fact that occasionally there are political messages involved whether it is radio scargill or any other political belief <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord beswick has drafted his motion admirably to enable us to consider the economic policies of this government not only in terms of their efficiency but in terms of their equity <e> <s> a number of noble lords have spoken much more eloquently than i could about the equity of government policies <e> <s> i want to concentrate on the efficiency of government policies and i want to look at government policies as they were expressed in yesterdays white paper on public expenditure in terms of how well they conform with modern business principles and modern business practices <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble lord for introducing what is of course a serious matter as seriously and responsibly as he did <e> <s> we on this side of the house support the regulations <e> <s> we believe that although it might be thought that this is an extension of the nanny state which none of us would wish for its own sake the dangers here which are to be avoided by the regulations outweigh the dangers of increased regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that his answer is quite inadequate from the point of view of the controller of finance of the greater london council who has to advise his members as to the likely outturn in financial terms of the financial year and that forms a major part of the consideration of the following years budget <e>", "<cs> faced with the serried ranks of solicitors barristers accountants and others with experience of big business i quail and i particularly quail after hearing the noble and learned lord and feeling myself held with his glittering eye <e> <s> however perhaps i may be permitted a very short story <e> <s> i am the kind of person who your lordships are all talking about <e> <s> i am the director of small private companies <e> <s> if i may be permitted to say something personal from this dispatch box perhaps it may bring some of this discussion to a personal level <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be no opposition from this side of the house to either of these proposed regulations <e> <s> the first is clearly necessary and has been observed by british industry for many years as the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for that very clear explanation of what is in fact quite a complex issue even though the wording of the draft order is relatively clear so far as such things go <e> <s> we welcome the extension of anti competitive practices regulations and of the powers of the director general of fair trading in i am sure successful collaboration with the caa <e> <s> i shall not tempt the noble lord to comment on what effect such a statutory instrument might have had on the dispute between laker airways and british airways since that dispute is presumably <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be forgiven for being tempted to ask specific questions about what is after all my home town <e> <s> i shall resist that temptation except to say that i know councillor salinger i know councillor meehan the leader of the council and i also know mr gale and i know them all to be honourable men <e> <s> it appears to me that there is a conflict of evidence between what they say and what the secretary of state says <e> <s> i shall read with great attention the wording of the particular denials which the noble earl has read out on behalf of his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> why not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord terrington for his introduction to this debate and by extending my congratulations to the noble viscount lord bridgeman on his extremely well-informed expert and well-delivered speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may interrupt on that very point <e> <s> a question was asked in the house of commons on th january this year about the number of shareholders in various privatised industries and the answer from the financial secretary to the treasury referred only to the number of shareholders on the flotation <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that the number of shareholders there are in privatised industries after flotation will become public in future <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case why did the financial secretary to the treasury fail to answer the question in another place as to the number of shareholders after flotation and after registration had been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of things in the early part of the noble lords speech with which i think all members of your lordships house will agree his tribute to the recent achievements of the british film industry in world markets and world esteem and his hopes for the success of british films in this years oscars <e> <s> we all share those hopes <e> <s> i fear however that our welcome for this bill goes no further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in a most interesting speech chose to make the majority of his comments about the constitutional issue as between this house and another place and on the issue of retrospection <e> <s> on the first issue i join with him whole-heartedly in feeling that this house should not in any way seek to increase its powers in relation to those of another place and in his spirited defence perhaps somewhat belated of the parliament act <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has referred to the judgment i wonder whether he will confirm or deny that mr justice mcneill said specifically in so many words that the departments officials seemed more concerned with creating a surplus in to be carried forward to enable much smaller revenue to be required in than with a careful appraisal of all the relevant facts <e> <s> does that not give the lie to the ministers claim that this is a matter of providing for liabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to make a comment on what has just been said <e> <s> other speakers at second reading of the films bill made exactly the same point to the government spokesman at that time that it was totally unsatisfactory for there to be a division of responsibility for the film industry between different government departments <e> <s> the ministers noble friend rejected that argument <e>", "<cs> i am happy to support the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord mersey and to which i and others have added our names <e> <s> he has set out far better than i could from his own specialised knowledge the nature of the film industrys needs for financial support <e> <s> it is worth reminding the committee that the need for financial support from government is not unique to this country <e> <s> indeed virtually every country in the civilised world and some countries in the less civilised world provide support of one kind or another for their indigenous film industries because they appreciate the necessity for a film industry as an essential strand in their national culture <e> <s> that i believe is behind what appears to be the financial plea made in this amendment by the noble viscount and others <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend will permit me to intervene <e> <s> the amendment does not actually refer to channel which he has been citing with such approval <e> <s> it refers to the contractors and the bbc and therefore it is not a question of clobbering those who as he says have been so effective in their support of the cinema <e>", "<cs> it must be for the noble viscount lord mersey to decide what he wants to do about the amendment which he has moved but i for my part would say that the government have been totally uncompromising in their reply and have failed to make out an effective case against the levy which is put forward in the amendment which the noble viscount so eloquently moved <e> <s> unfortunately i also have to address that remark to my noble friend lord willis who avoided some of the inconsistencies of the noble lord the minister in his reply <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas seemed to be making two separate conflicting remarks at the same time <e> <s> on the one hand he said that films were a declining part of television that the audiences for them are not sufficent and therefore any levy would put those audiences even further at risk <e>", "<cs> i am content with the noble lords repetition of his remarks but very shortly after that he was arguing that we were reaching the stage where there would be a sellers market for feature films that for example there were increasing markets in cable and satellite broadcasting and that the longer-term rewards for film producers would be increasing <e> <s> there seems to be some conflict between those two statements <e> <s> to put it at its lowest there seems to be no solid basis for the confidence which the noble lord has in the commercial field as well as for the artistic future of the british film <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord auckland returns to the issue i must say that if ever there was a justification for a short debate on a probing amendment i feel that this was it <e> <s> that is because every time the minister opened his mouth his case weakened <e> <s> he revealed more and more inconsistencies <e> <s> he made exactly the same mistakes in respect of the video industry as he made on the last amendment in respect of the television industry <e> <s> on the one hand he was saying that the video industry is enormously strong and that for that reason the british videogram association can afford to make this substantial contribution of for at least three years to film production <e> <s> in almost the same breath he is saying that the video industry is extremely competitive that it is vulnerable to new technical developments and that therefore a levy of the sort proposed would be extremely damaging to its health a dead hand was the phrase he used <e> <s> he really cannot have it both ways <e> <s> certainly he cannot claim that a year for three years with no guarantee of success or was it <e> <s> from the british videogram association <e> <s> am i quoting the figures wrongly <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i was incorrect to the extent of or <e> <s> nevertheless the total amount has been universally agreed by everybody associated with the film industry to be totally inadequate for the purpose <e> <s> if the noble lord did not learn that lesson from the unanimous opinion expressed in all speeches at second reading then if i may say so i do not think he was paying adequate attention to the debate <e>", "<cs> i wish to say only a few sentences because the noble viscount has covered the waterfront extremely adequately <e> <s> no doubt the government will argue that the heads of agreement which have been placed in the library and which we have an opportunity to see are the answers to the questions raised by the noble viscount <e> <s> i want to put it to them that if you have heads of agreement which themselves have no statutory force and you have a consortium which is itself the most unstable form of business enterprise you are combining two sorts of instability in one <e> <s> the government will have to defend very strongly those two elements of instability if they are going to argue that there is a continued effective and adequate means of funding the british film industry <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has i am afraid gone no further than the assurances given by his honourable friend in another place which were not entirely satisfactory to my friends there as he will know <e> <s> however i think it was necessary to bring these issues into the open again and we shall read his remarks very carefully before deciding on our course of action at a later stage <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd has asked me to apologise to the committee because he had to leave for an urgent appointment <e> <s> on the basis that this is an amendment which is very personal to him he would wish me not to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the observations of my noble friends <e> <s> as they did i have listened carefully to what the noble lord the minister has said and i have to agree with my noble friend lord willis that the situation as it has been put by the minister is in fact worse than it was when we started <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd has spoken with unrivalled authority about an institution to which he has devoted a great deal of his energy <e> <s> we must all be in debt to him for his speech tonight <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything effective i can add to what he said <e> <s> i believe that he has anticipated as a good law professor should all the possible arguments which might be put forward by government and opposition to his amendment <e> <s> i believe that he has shown effectively that there are <e>", "<cs> my lords this again is an amendment which has had some discussion at earlier stages of this bill <e> <s> i think it is necessary to draw attention to the differences between the amendment now proposed by the noble viscount lord mersey and the amendments on the levy issue which were proposed at committee stage <e> <s> the most significant by far is the fact that the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will permit me to say this <e> <s> the levy paid by the independent television contractors to channel is not determined by the contractors themselves it is determined by government <e> <s> quite apart from that the amount of the levy which they pay to channel affects in turn the amount of levy which they pay to government <e> <s> in other words it is not open to independent television contractors to exercise the kind of choice which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened most carefully to what the noble lord has said and i have listened even more carefully for what he has not said <e> <s> the house will observe that the noble lord did not deny that britain is the only country which observes the direction from the european commission and that other countries have not followed suit in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will wish to make its own judgment on that statement <e> <s> i adhere to my statement that britain is the only country in the community which is adhering to the direction from the european commission <e> <s> if it is true as the noble lord says that to put us in the wrong as well is the wrong way to do it then i invite him to bring forward concrete proposals for ensuring that within a finite period of time there is either agreement by the other members of the community or an agreed amendment to this bill an agreed withdrawal from our isolated position <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the regret of the noble viscount lord mersey that it is necessary to bring the same amendment at third reading as was moved and then withdrawn at the report stage <e> <s> but the fact that it is necessary is evidenced by the fact that the arguments for the amendment particularly those so ably put forward by the noble viscount a few minutes ago become stronger and the arguments put forward by the government against the amendment become weaker <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my noble friend is seeking to withdraw the amendment but another word or two is in order <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale is incapable by his nature of being abusive but he has delivered a most abusive speech and he has delivered a speech to an abusive brief <e> <s> it was quite irrelevant for him to speak about the views of the glc and the way in which the glc have presented their statistics in the face of an amendment moved by my noble friend which puts a demand which cannot be seen as anything other than perfectly reasonable <e> <s> the demand is that there should be some estimate made by the government of that proportion of the expenditure of the directly elected authorities in other words the glc and the metropolitan counties and the london borough councils and the metropolitan district councils respectively which would continue to be the responsibility of directly elected bodies and that proportion which would become the responsibility of quangos and of government departments <e>", "<cs> it was abusive <e>", "<cs> that speech was a <e>", "<cs> the minister really ought to insist that the briefs he reads are not the briefs before yesterday <e> <s> that speech could have been made had the committee not made the decision it took earlier this evening and had it not been agreed by the committee that there was to be a body responsible the london residuary body which would have the reponsibilities contained in the existing transport policies and programmes procedures <e> <s> as it is the brief he has read is almost entirely irrelevant to the amendment moved by my noble friend and the noble lord has really painted himself into a corner on this one <e>", "<cs> i want to pay tribute to the speech of the noble lord lord beloff not least because it came from someone who has been a devoted supporter of the government throughout the passage of this bill but also because it came from someone with outstanding professional expertise in this area <e> <s> i believe that it would be wise for the government to pay due attention to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> certainly i have no capacity or capability to add to the points that he made <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear of the difficulties that the noble baroness has had <e> <s> of course it was an all-party agreement on the greater london council which led to the saving of the archives from the threat of flooding as it was a few years ago and the establishment of a new record office away from county hall <e> <s> this has never been a party political matter <e> <s> access to the archives has always been available to members of the council and to the public as the noble lord lord mcgregor has made clear <e> <s> the noble baroness should avail herself of the opportunity while it is still there <e>", "<cs> my lords i say at the outset that we warmly support the bill in order that there should be no confusion about it <e> <s> we think it is a necessary measure and one which deserves a speedy passage through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my appreciation to the minister for that statement <e> <s> i was afraid he was going to rest on his first sentence about parliamentary time which is as long as a piece of string <e> <s> i am therefore grateful for his further precision <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i made no attempt to raise again the substantive issues about support for the film industry <e> <s> i can only conclude that the noble lord has not read the consideration of our cause in another <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me i have a subsequent letter from the noble viscount which i think makes things clear

difficult not only to those who have some experience of computing but even more for those like myself who have no particular knowledge of copyright law <e>", "<cs> i just want to express my appreciation to the noble viscount <e> <s> i think that the explanation he has given is not only clear but entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i want to say only one more thing <e> <s> the noble lord lord brabazon in his speech made reference to the possibility of doubt about the applicability of copyright now under existing legislation to the work of an author keyed into a database <e> <s> i hope that he will think very carefully about the words that he used <e> <s> it is not just the work of a novelist as the noble viscount said the whole copyrightability if i may coin that awful word of the material in commercial databases could be at risk between now and the passage of the bill if it were to be stated here that there is any genuine doubt about the copyright status of material provided by information providers into commercial databases <e> <s> i had always understood and i hope that i am not wrong about this that the arrangements that they make under copyright legislation ensure that hosts for the databases which provide access to their material are legally valid and that there is no doubt about their copyright status <e> <s> it would be useful to have that assurance repeated by the government <e>", "<cs> we can only be grateful to the noble viscount for cutting the gordian knot of the long title <e> <s> i would only say to the government that if they do as we have heard accept the amendment we on this side shall find occasion to use this precedent to seek to adapt long titles of bills in this way to avoid some of the difficulties which have in the past inhibited the kind of amendments that we should like to see to government legislation <e> <s> a long title as the noble viscount rightly said ought not to seek to contain all of the conditions of the bill <e> <s> governments have very often sought to use long titles in that way <e> <s> we shall use this precedent to seek to prevent them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether your lordships will permit me to speak in the gap even though i was not sharp enough to put my name down on the list <e> <s> i should like to join with my noble friend lord graham in welcoming this bill so ably introduced by the noble lord lord maude <e> <s> he himself described it as a relatively modest bill hut one of great importance to those directly concerned <e> <s> he also said something that i want to follow up <e> <s> he referred to the possibility that charter trustees might gain parish council status at some time presumably through the parish review procedure <e> <s> he described that as being a desirable change an improvement in the status and an improvement in the democratic basis for charter trustees <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that from the point of view of timing the most important thing is that ratification should take place in time for this countrys delegation to take part in the working groups at nairobi as access to the meeting itself is available to countries which have not ratified <e> <s> can she give us any further hope that such ratification will take place in time for this participation in the working groups <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has been described as a high risk bill by members on all sides of your lordships house <e> <s> i imagine that the government are used to that accusation and are not particularly worried about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be corrected by the noble earl <e> <s> then the bus goes on to some place called something like canonicorum <e> <s> this route is in three parts <e> <s> the first part to the housing estate is highly profitable at all times <e> <s> the second part to the suburb is profitable at peak hours only but not in the early mornings or evenings or week-ends <e> <s> the third part is never profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i am glad to add that to my list of criticisms <e> <s> my lords i have concentrated on the deregulation issue mainly because your lordships have done so over the past six hours and because it does seem to me to be the central and most controversial issue <e> <s> but i think i must say that there are a number of other aspects of the bill where we on this side of the house will be looking for significant change <e> <s> we are not satisfied with privatisation as a procedure <e> <s> i know that my position is somewhat weakened by the views of my noble friend lord shepherd who was perfectly content with privatisation for the national bus company but i think that even he would agree that there are examples of transport operations which ought not to be privatised and where at the very least we ought to be thinking of management buy-out or co-operatives as an alternative if we are looking for something less monolithic than central nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my plea to that of my noble friend lady birk for the secure continuation of a research and intelligence service for london and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> my noble friend has made the point effectively that the arrangements for a lead borough proposed in clause although an improvement on the original proposals do not provide that security which we believe to be necessary and which has been held to be necessary from an early stage in london government and in the government of the metropolitan counties <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene on what appeared essentially to be a debate on the government benches <e> <s> i accept that there are deficiencies in the amendments spoken to by the noble baroness lady vickers and i agree with some other speakers that the idea of a patchwork of regulation and deregulation throughout the country is not a plausible alternative either to the existing system or to the system proposed by the government in the bill <e>", "<cs> the evidence is in the reports of the transport and road research laboratory <e> <s> unfortunately and this is a point which i wish to take in favour of the amendment and against the bill none of the reports from the trrl is yet a final report <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne and i am sure the government will not deny the fact will find that in norfolk at any rate there has been a significant reduction in the number of bus services <e> <s> the noble lord the minister in an earlier speech made references to savings in local authority subsidies <e> <s> i asked him at that time whether he could find any evidence for it <e> <s> i should be interested to know whether he has yet been able to secure that evidence but certainly the trrl have not confirmed that the expectations of the experiment have been achieved <e> <s> i have to put it in that negative way at this stage <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot be more positive <e> <s> the facts will be no more positive to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if i were sitting on the front bench opposite i could say very happily that i would write to the noble lord and squads of civil servants would produce the evidence for me <e> <s> all i can say to him is that he ought to read the reports even the interim reports of the transport and road research laboratory on these experiments <e> <s> i was not saying that the services in hereford had reduced <e> <s> i was saying that they had reduced in norfolk and that not a single new bus service had been created in hereford <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps unfortunate that we have spent three-quarters of this debate dealing with what ought to be one-quarter of the subject-matter <e> <s> we have spent three-quarters of <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend will be as grateful as i am that the minister is prepared to think again about the issue <e> <s> before my noble friend responds let me say two things <e> <s> first i am as opposed as he is to bureaucracy and the need to notify ministers about services is the last thing in my mind and i am sure the last thing in the mind of my noble friend lord shepherd <e> <s> that is not the point at all <e> <s> the point is what security can be given to passengers <e>", "<cs> may we just come south of the border for a moment <e> <s> i realise that the government must have severe psychological objections to thinking about the brecon and radnor area and i am sure that the noble lord lord mackie would agree with that <e> <s> but there is also penrith and the border <e> <s> there are large constituencies and large rural areas in england and wales in which as the noble lord says miles is not a particularly magical figure <e> <s> is there any reason why the two sets of regulations should not butt up one against the other <e>", "<cs> we would all agree with the minister that this is a matter of judgment and that there are opposing considerations which the committee ought to take into account <e> <s> it must be said that it is a derogation of the governments duty for the minister however charmingly to say that he is going to ask the questions instead of answering the questions and to say it is up to us to show the balance of advantage between fewer bus stops and the benefits of the fuel rebate <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> it is the governments responsibility to inform the committee to the best of their ability what part the fuel rebate plays in the running costs of a bus service and to indicate the governments judgment the governments best informed view of the balance of advantage for an operator between that saving on fuel rebate and the likely additional benefit in terms of extra customers by having more stops or going by a more circuitous route <e>", "<cs> i beg my noble friends pardon <e>", "<cs> i do not wish in any way to seem ungracious <e> <s> i too am pleased to be roughly on the same side as the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil but there are differences between these amendments to which it is only right to refer <e> <s> the noble lords amendment refers to bankruptcies or disqualifications under sections of the companies act <e> <s> but there are many ways in which the financial standing of potential operators could be subjected to positive vetting rather than the kind of negative vetting to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i appreciate and share his concern <e> <s> in pointing out the differences in wording i was attempting only to extend that concern and to extend the range of options possibilities and dangers to which the government should reply in response to the amendments moved by the noble earl lord de la warr and by the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> it was in a desire to be helpful to the government in what i believe to be a completely non-party matter that i thought it was desirable to spell out some of the other difficulties that arise and not in any sense of contention with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if this had been a government amendment the government spokesman would have been briefed to explain subsection by subsection the new clause which has been put forward <e> <s> i think perhaps there has been some loss of clarity in this debate if i may put it that way because nobody has actually done that <e> <s> i wonder whether it is not necessary at this stage perhaps it should have been done earlier to say what the amendment actually means <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have ever heard a more revealing turn of phrase than that which the noble lord has used in the context of the relationship between central and local government <e> <s> he described the traffic commissioners as being impartial <e> <s> the traffic commissioners are of course appointed by whitehall whereas the highway authorities are democratically elected by the people of our towns and cities <e> <s> if to be central is to be impartial and to be democratically elected is to be partial then the noble lord and i are living in a different country <e> <s> i cannot believe that the government can be so openly centralist as to say that a traffic commissioner because of his appointment by central government is somehow more impartial than a democratically elected city or town council <e> <s> the concept is totally foreign to everything that i have been brought up to understand about the nature of the relationship between central and local government in this country <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i reply to the noble lord lord mottistone before giving way to the minister <e> <s> of course our amendments are designed to secure that clause should say and i read it having excised those words which we seek to excise <e>", "<cs> it is indeed a requirement that this should take place but that does not answer my question <e> <s> i still ask why a centrally appointed official should come between the people who have the possibility of that requirement and the bus operators who serve their area <e> <s> that is the question to which the government must reply <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady carnegy makes two extremely interesting points which deserve reply <e> <s> the first is about the possibility of partiality on the part of the local authority <e> <s> i perfectly accept that where there are municipal bus services in the classical sense it would be possible for a local authority which has financial responsibility for those municipal bus services to give preferential treatment to those bus services in comparison with private operators <e> <s> but the whole intention of the bill is that municipal bus services shall be at arms length from the local authority and therefore that presumption of partiality no longer applies <e>", "<cs> before the minister receives the probe or whatever it is that happens with a probe perhaps i may add my support to the amendment of the noble lord lord monk bretton <e> <s> it is not as far-reaching as i should have wished on the amendments that i previously moved but it tackles some of the problems which i confidently fearfully if you like foresee will arise in many of our town and city centres <e> <s> may i draw particular attention to the following words in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but before the noble lord replies i should like to say a word or two more about local authority procedures and the way in which they work <e> <s> if it is the responsibility of a local authority and it appears that something has to be done urgently there are procedures within local authorities county councils and so on for taking chairmans action and doing something immediately <e> <s> if it is a matter of going through a middle man of making representations to a traffic commissioner the government must recognise that local authorities are heavily constrained legally to go through proper committee and council procedures <e> <s> even apart from the summer recess a period of six or eight weeks may pass between the urgency of a problem being recognised and the possibility of a local authority formally making representations pushing the button as the noble lord lord belstead said and something being done <e> <s> that is why i moved the earlier amendments and sought to cut out the middle man <e> <s> i do not seriously think that the government have fully recognised the nature of local authority procedures the possibilities of delay and the dangers of the procedures proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> that is the most gracious and least qualified response to an amendment that i have had in the course of this bill <e> <s> i certainly shall not kick it back in the face of the government <e> <s> i express my gratitude to the noble lord lord belstead for his acceptance of the principle behind the first half by which i take it he means the first two-and-a-half lines of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may add my urging to that of the noble baroness lady macleod that there should be more wide publication of perhaps the relevant parts of the traffic regulation conditions so that people can actually get to see them <e> <s> indeed that is what i was intending to say when i talked about the concomitant responsibilities of the local authorities themselves <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies may i make another perhaps sour or cynical remark about local government <e> <s> it is well known that counties of one political persuasion are not particularly attracted to the propositions of district councils within their area which are of another political persuasion <e> <s> i am not making a point about one party or another <e> <s> those of us who have served in local government know that that is the case <e> <s> i am not <e>", "<cs> i have only one question for the minister before the noble lord lord teviot replies <e> <s> he has on more than one occasion referred to the prospect of comprehensive legislation <e> <s> i wonder whether he can tell us first how long this prospect has been in view and secondly how long it will be before we see some result from it <e>", "<cs> one should never be surprised at government responses to amendments but i confess that the logic of the noble lord lord belstead is more defective in this case than in any i have heard during the course of this bill <e> <s> i remind him of the obligations which this government have taken upon themselves and sought to bring into legislation <e> <s> first there was the ec directive of which said that transport operators the noble lord used the words himself should be of good repute should have appropriate financial standing and they should be professionally competent <e> <s> that directive was enshrined in legislation by the government in the transport act and the public passenger vehicle act which this amendment seeks to add to <e> <s> all that the noble earl lord de la warr was seeking to do was to see to it that those considerations can be effectively taken into account by traffic commissioners <e>", "<cs> if i am going to be accused of being totally deaf i have to be told why <e> <s> i listened most carefully to the noble lord lord nugent i referred to his speech and i quoted from it <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mottistone wishes to criticise me for something i said or failed to say perhaps he will be good enough to state what it is <e>", "<cs> i have a couple of questions about this amendment <e> <s> first i should like to welcome the desire of the noble lord the minister to harmonise hgv licence conditions with psv licence conditions in this respect and to recognise the feeling of the house so recently expressed <e> <s> the noble lord told the committee that there have not been any appeals of this sort or did he say that there had not been a significant number <e> <s> i did not fully catch it <e> <s> has the noble lord received any representations from the relevant trade organisations about the appeal provision which he now proposes to delete <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i appreciate his point <e> <s> will he say to the committee that if between now and report stage he finds that there are from the trade representations which appear to have some weight he will undertake to consider them and consider what effect they ought to have in the form of amendments at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am sorely tempted to continue the discussion about the victoria coach station and its surrounding area since my noble friend lord ponsonby introduced the bus lane in buckingham palace road in his capacity as chairman of the central area board of the glc and as his successor as chairman of the central area board i had to face the protests of the shenley place residents association as a result of his action <e> <s> but i think it is important that we broaden the issue and look at the implications for the rest of this bill as well as for the victoria area of the deregulation of express coach services in london <e>", "<cs> i should be interested as i am sure would the noble lord to know the actual figures <e> <s> if it is true that the amendments do not adequately cover foreign registered coaches the conclusion is not to abandon all regulation but to extend regulation to cover foreign registered coaches as well <e> <s> the implication of that is very precise <e> <s> the implication is that any regulations we have must cover routeing and stopping places and even pausing places as well as the provision of bus stations and termini <e> <s> the arguments of the noble lord are very clearly against the governments position rather than the reverse <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has a touching faith in the governments willingness to listen to reason which i fear will not be realised <e> <s> i accept that the noble lord moved the amendment as a probing amendment and i accept his understanding that the noble baroness lady gardner intended it as a probing amendment at this stage <e> <s> i shall not make the -minute speech which is perfectly well prepared on the subject <e> <s> all i want to say is that when we come back to this at report unless the government have yielded to the eloquent pleadings of my noble friend lord pitt this will by no means be a probing amendment <e> <s> our willingness to let the government sacrifice themselves on the ideological extension of a system which will not work for the rest of the country to london where it most certainly will not work will be extremely limited and we shall make the utmost effort to persuade them that it would be extremely unwise for them to take the powers which they purport to arrogate to themselves in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord lord grimond has moved this as a probing amendment and that he himself has expressed some doubts about the wording of it <e> <s> but even in those circumstances i should like to give a welcome from these benches to the thinking behind the amendment and to express our view that although of course we are in favour of public ownership of undertakings of this kind which in our view and as expressed in this bill do not readily lend themselves to the kind of privatisation proposed there should be some opportunity for the workers involved in the industry to participate in it <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i know that it is unusual for two speakers to rise to this dispatch box one after another but i am emboldened to intervene by having been in this position i do not know whether any other noble lords have <e> <s> i was a member of the transport committee of the greater london council at a time when london transport had the relationship which the noble earl lord de la warr described <e> <s> i am perfectly familiar with the powers of an elected authority in this case it would be a joint board over london transport and of the limitations of those powers <e> <s> perhaps i may give an example of the limitations of those powers <e> <s> in those days the greater london council had the power to issue directives to london transport and indeed it had the duty to do so every year when it came to consider london transports budget proposals it had to consider them in the light of its own transport policies and programmes and to consider what financing from the ratepayers was required in order to meet the objectives agreed with government for an integrated transport policy and therefore to agree a transport budget for public transport with london transport <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disagree with the noble lord but that is not the case <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting that the government are taking a business view of the matter whereas in point of fact they are failing completely to take a business view and are failing to meet their own objectives <e> <s> if they were wise they would listen to the words of the noble earl because it is the noble earl who has the experience and who as the noble lord lord tordoff properly says is making the right distinction between business and politics <e>", "<cs> i forgive the noble lord lord mottistone his insult to the survey and research trade in which i have earned a living for many years <e> <s> in fact his contribution was constructive <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> he makes a very valid point <e> <s> whether or not we approve of the detailed provisions of this bill all thinking is to persuade more people to use public transport as has been achieved in london by better marketing and better services without privatisation <e> <s> i say that as an aside <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that there had been consultation with local authorities as to whether they would welcome such a duty <e> <s> immediately before that he referred to the alternative strategy of having local authorities taking the strain so to speak of representing the passengers <e> <s> does the noble lord mean that the local authority associations said that they do not wish to represent the passengers or that they do not wish to see statutory consultative committees <e> <s> that was not clear from what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i should like to express general support for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord teviot and in so doing say that i believe he is exactly right in pointing out the other responsibilities of county councils in addition to the operation of commercial bus services which must be linked with them if a sensible transport policy is to be evolved and publicised <e>", "<cs> that is of course true but as i understood it and perhaps i have misunderstood the noble lord the point of this amendment and certainly the point of amendment no <e> <s> zca which is the new clause is that the county councils are required to have and to publish some form of transport policy <e> <s> i understood the noble lord lord teviot to say that this ought to cover all the transport services provided in and for their area <e> <s> i do not wish to add any more except to say that we seem to be in the middle of a bill which is being rewritten as the committee proceeds <e> <s> it is extraordinarily difficult for us to relate the arguments which we planned some time before to a stream of government amendments which come through at the very last minute and which require much more attention than it is possible for those of us who have to earn our living elsewhere to give them in the way of making effective judgments as to what they mean <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord tordoff says it is unfortunate that an amendment of this significance has to be debated at this time of night on the fourth day of the committee <e> <s> perhaps it is the fault of those of us who have been putting down amendments to the bill as it has proceeded <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will allow me to finish the sentence <e> <s> it has a rather different end to that which some noble lords on the government front bench might expect <e> <s> we have done the government the credit of assuming that they took their principles seriously and that they had thought out seriously the implications of the combined deregulation and privatisation that is the theme of the bill <e> <s> we have taken those intentions at face value <e> <s> in many amendments to many clauses and many subsections we have sought to provide safeguards for the travelling public or to find out how seriously the government had actually thought about the problems that they were getting into by this series of untested adventures into privatisation and deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to put two sentences into the gap <e> <s> i confess my ignorance in that i was not aware that <e>", "<cs> i am glad to yield to the greater knowledge of the noble lord particularly since for my sins i have never even been to the isle of wight <e> <s> let me give another example of where changes have certainly happened the example of the irish sea crossings and the privatisation of sealink away from british rail <e> <s> here there have been arrangements for sharing routes between sealink and b and i ferries on the routes to ireland and the isle of man <e> <s> the result of these arrangements has been that sealink is no longer operating the route from liverpool to the isle of man <e> <s> that may be a perfectly proper commercial position but the isle of man tourism depended very considerably on the liverpool trade and it must be a very wrong decision which as it takes effect will do a great deal of damage to the isle of man <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in the discussion on this amendment <e> <s> i say that even to the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> i must say that to call it moderate when the noble lord lord brabazon refers to endless forms and excessive and unreasonable information when as my noble friend points out the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> the answer to that was given by the noble earl lord de la wan <e> <s> the fact is that one must have the information at the time when it can be used <e> <s> it ought in the bill to be an obligation on the operators to provide that information and not be a matter for the local authority to demand it afterwards <e> <s> it is timing that is of the essence and that is the extent to which although the noble lord lord mottistone is undoubtedly right about clause and its extent this amendment is still necessary <e>", "<cs> if any part of the noble lords resistance to the concern of the noble lord lord mottistone concerning ferries to the isle of wight is that an amendment might be hybrid may i beg him on behalf of the noble baroness to consider ferries to the isle of ely and for myself ferries to the isle of dogs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of these complex amendments and i am grateful to him for notifying me on friday of the revised notes on clauses which referred to them so that i was able to see them when i arrived earlier today <e>", "<cs> i want to come back on the question of consultation and the agreement of the counties <e> <s> i do not have the papers in front of me but i distinctly recall a memorandum from the association of county councils saying that it wanted a delay of at least three months <e> <s> i know that the non-shire counties the metropolitan consortium of non-shire counties support a delay of approximately six months <e> <s> i know that this is true also of the association of metropolitan authorities and the ptes group <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord and we are talking to the same people <e> <s> i should be grateful to have further evidence of the opinions the noble lord has had expressed to the department of transport <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to detain the committee and i certainly do not want to go over procedural arguments again <e> <s> if the noble lord lord belstead will read my speech he will recognise i think that i referred to the governments flexibility and i referred to the governments good intentions in some of these amendments <e> <s> what i said was that the result was unsatisfactory and i still believe that to be the case <e>", "<cs> i must protest at this amendment being not moved it is sheer poetry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may say that she has made a number of points which have to be replied to later in the debate <e> <s> there is one matter on which i should like to be of one mind with her <e> <s> that is the example which she gave to which i listened with great interest of the two operators who were willing to supply a service for a number of students and did not want the final date put back because that would put back the date on which they could supply that service <e> <s> would the noble baroness not agree with me that if the operators have road service licences or are willing to apply for them they could go ahead and provide that service without waiting for the provisions of this bill to come into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by expressing my appreciation to the noble lord <e> <s> lord belstead for the concession that he made in the last few minutes of his speech <e> <s> even one-sixth of what has been asked for must be welcomed and i believe it is in the governments interests to make that change which will presumably be in the form of amendments to schedule at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords third reading rather than report stage i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however in making that concession i think he has shown a misunderstanding of both the purpose and the effect of these amendments which was shared by rather too many noble lords but ought not to have been shared by the government <e> <s> it is certainly true that our amendments do not make a major change in the period of the actual tendering period <e> <s> what they are designed to achieve is that the raw material which is being worked on by the operators by the joint boards by the passenger transport authorities and by the traffic commissioners is a good deal better considered better thought out than it would be if one used the governments timetable <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendments to extend the first period the period in which tenders can be entered rather than to try to extend the later period of the tenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> i think it strengthens the case i am making <e> <s> the point i am making is that th july is deregulation day it is the end of the procedure not the beginning of the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady carnegy put forward if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that amendment no <e> <s> is unexceptionable <e>", "<cs> my lords the only temperate thing about that response was the tone of voice <e> <s> everything else was so extreme that i could hardly believe that i was hearing it from the lips of the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> the suggestion that authorities would actually make bus services worse and increase the fares in order to provoke a public inquiry is so extreme that it is an insult to those who are responsible to the public in the areas they serve and are capable of being replaced by the public if they fail to provide an adequate service <e> <s> the same cannot be said of some operators or indeed of the traffic commissioners i am not attacking the traffic commissioners who are not themselves responsible to the areas they serve <e>", "<cs> my lords per cent <e> <s> of individuals and not per cent <e> <s> of households are without access to a car <e> <s> those who now have access to cars did in the past provide the most profitable market for bus services <e> <s> those who do not have access to cars but who need transport at off-peak times and in the evenings particularly housewives in one-car families where the wage-earner takes the car to work are indeed a market but they represent an incomplete market when compared with the complete market that existed before <e> <s> quite apart from the noble lords understandable mistake concerning the percentage of car ownership his question does not support his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that when the noble lord moved amendments on this subject in committee i had grave reservations about them <e> <s> he was proposing at that time that there should be a special licence for small public service vehicles <e> <s> i felt as i believe did a number of my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clearly my fault that i failed to communicate my thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not my understanding and if i have drafted the amendment wrongly i apologise to the house <e> <s> my understanding is that the passenger transport executive is responsible to the passenger transport authority <e> <s> it is a part of prudence on the elected members that they should seek to interpose between themselves and the day-to-day managment a body of bus professionals who are responsible to them <e> <s> i am saying that it is not good enough to have councillors sitting on the boards of the operating companies because the interests of the operating companies which are perfectly proper and respectable capitalist interests are not necessarily the interests of the passengers in the area as a whole who want a complete network including profitable and unprofitable services <e>", "<cs> my lords the executive is responsible to the authority <e> <s> clearly i am not myself this afternoon as i am not making myself understood <e> <s> the authority consists of elected representatives who have the responsibility of representing the diverse interests of ratepayers in their area <e> <s> they set out the policy <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the executive which has bus professionals reporting to it to implement that policy <e> <s> it implements that policy through a series of powers some of which are given in the bill such as control of the tendering procedure and some of which we propose to give them such as the implementation of the policy to secure an adequate network <e> <s> if i continue it will become more difficult <e> <s> policy is for the politicians with implementation and advice from the professionals that is what we are about <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to abuse the procedures of report stage but before the noble lord sits down may i continue to read new section a on page <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not difficult to oppose an amendment if you take the precaution which the noble lord lord beloff took of rewriting it first <e> <s> the amendment says nothing about elaborate machinery and there is no reason why there should be elaborate machinery <e> <s> i have a great deal of experience of both good and bad consultative bodies dealing with london transport <e> <s> the london transport passengers committee has existed for a very long time and for a large part of that time it was simply appointed by official i nearly said officious and that would probably have been a better word bodies <e> <s> it did not really represent anybody <e> <s> it did not deal with any of the major issues confronting london transport passengers <e> <s> it did not do a great deal of good and it deserved the criticisms which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will allow me to interrupt he is challenging the noble lord lord tordoff over the figures he gave in relation to a reduction in services by the original operators by those who have these vehicles <e> <s> it is surely the responsibility of the government to give their estimates <e> <s> can the noble earl not give the house his own figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add one simple point <e> <s> if anyone should think that the amendment would cause

side by side and being in two schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords that was in part a very interesting reply <e> <s> however in part it was not so interesting because the noble lord <e> <s> lord trefgarne

moment to be perfectly proper for me to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to that reply <e> <s> i appreciate that at this late stage in the bill it is difficult for the minister to give assurances which are going to cause significant disruption to the drafting of the bill but i have to say that i do not think the noble lord has in any way

which as a layman i have great sympathy that legislation should not impose duties without suggesting what the remedies will be <e> <s> it is simply not good enough for the courts to be told by the minister that the duty expressed a broad view or a broad principle <e> <s> that is not what is said on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a few words from personal experience of the

minister that he has two ex-chairmen of the central area board of the glc on the bench facing him <e> <s> i do not think either of us could suppress wry smiles about his undertakings <e> <s> if he thinks that more meetings and more surveys will solve the problem he has another think coming <e> <s> these problems have been with us for many years <e> <s> admittedly they have become worse with the liberalisation of long-distance coaches but the powers available at present to local authorities either the glc or the westminster city council are not adequate to the purpose <e> <s> i do not feel that his response to the noble lord lord tordoff will take us much closer to a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before we accept there has been some movement but we are far from satisfied that it is enough and on the basis that we may feel it necessary to come back to this matter on third reading i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to concentrate on the public policy and the political aspects of this motion not only because i am totally unqualified to comment on the technological and philosophical side of it but because i believe that is what the noble earl lord stockton to whom we are deeply grateful for giving us the opportunity to hear him and to debate this matter meant by putting down the motion in these terms <e> <s> after all <e>",

thing <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the ministers statement of a decrease in graduate unemployment may i ask him whether he would accept that there are two possible explanations of that one that there are genuinely more jobs for graduates and the other that there have been excessive cuts in the provision of university education <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to thank the minister for his three replies <e> <s> i am now able to thank him for his four replies <e> <s> does he not agree that his fourth reply to the noble viscount indicates as the noble viscount said the dangers of allowing schools to sink into unpopularity and the real problems which that would pose for the parents children and teachers at such schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will agree to make the very severe attack that he has just made on london regional transport and its operations at the garages of the men themselves rather than just at the dispatch box here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am doubly grateful to the noble baroness lady seear for moving this motion today <e> <s> i am grateful of course on behalf of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl the minister accept that there is an intermediate solution between permanent exclusion and leaving the boys responsible in the same school <e> <s> the normal procedure surely is that the pupils who are responsible in these cases are expelled or suspended from the particular school but are taken up by other schools in the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords in adding my thanks to my noble friend lord stewart of fulham i know that he will be less impressed by my thanks than he will be gratified by the response there has been to the debate he so ably introduced <e> <s> every speaker has referred to particular examples of

regulations must be seen in the light of the education amendment bill which is now going through another place <e> <s> the ministers statement raises a number of questions about the relationship between the regulations and the bill which i think should be made public <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble earl for the lucid way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> i cannot start to consider the merits or the demerits of the bill without remarking on the disparity between the number of speakers on education and the number of speakers on the salmon bill that follows <e> <s> those who have an exaggerated view of the importance of this house in the legislative process will no doubt take note of that disparity and note the priorities of noble lords as between the education of our children and the protection of our fishing <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will risk the wrath of his fishing friends by confirming that this is not the governments sense of priority as between education and salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords that intervention could be turned on its side if not on its head <e> <s> it reminds me of the old saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl will permit me to interrupt <e> <s> i realise that he is in no position to commit future governments but it was not just a question of the percentage of expenditure <e> <s> it is a question of how far we are getting away from the spirit of the education grants and awards act which was intended to deal with expenditure for experimental purposes particularly among selected local authorities and not general educational expenditure <e> <s> that is the issue on which i seek the noble earls assurance <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i want to make it clear and i know that the noble lord lord ritchie would agree with me that we are very conscious of the drafting defect of this and any other amendment to this bill <e> <s> the long title of the bill refers only to amendment of the education grants and awards act and the remuneration of teachers act <e> <s> any amendment which is proposed which has any substance as does the noble lords amendment to change in his case the definition of midday supervison or in the case of subsequent amendments to talk about training or minimum standards ought not to be dependent upon the remuneration of teachers

earl <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not think it is appropriate for him to contrast the long-term plans which i assume are the purpose of this legislation with what we hope is the short-term position of uncertainty created by the industrial dispute between the teachers and the government <e> <s> i was going to say local authorities but in fact the dispute is with the government <e> <s> i do not want to say any more on that <e> <s> we must all hope that the talks now taking place at acas and i hope that they are continuing tomorrow although i have not seen the late news on this will succeed and that the uncertainty which does indeed plague parents at this time comes to a speedy end <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> it is a sensible suggestion for the government to make that there should be monitoring and that continuation of the scheme should be dependent upon an evaluation which shows that it is working successfully <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl that so far as possible it ought to be local authorities who take the ultimate responsibility for the training <e> <s> what was being suggested in the amendment was that the government in their great wisdom might have something to contribute to that debate <e> <s> the noble earl seems to think not <e> <s> perhaps there is no hope of trying to persuade him on that matter <e> <s> perhaps the man in whitehall it used to be whitehall does not necessarily know best <e> <s> on the basis of the noble earls reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord irving has richly deserved the thanks that have been showered on him by all speakers for his foresight in introducing this motion today <e> <s> in addition to the thanks he must have the satisfaction of knowing that he has drawn into the debate a number of people with excellent personal understanding of the issues <e> <s> if ever there were a subject before this house on which the emphasis must be on people on what happens in the classroom rather than on institutions education in our schools is that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords that i am sure is acceptable to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but

important that we be quite precise in the terms that we use and quite precise in the statements that we make on this complex and important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to have that gloss on what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i did not notice her saying that in her speech nor in what she said to the <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong my lords i willingly apologise <e> <s> i must have misheard the noble baroness <e> <s> i still do not have it entirely clear where in exeter the curriculum is which is so wicked <e>", "<cs> my lords the words that i used were that she had no formal position in the polytechnic at that time <e> <s> i believe that at the time to which i am referring the re-submission the noble baroness was at chelsea college and not at the polytechnic of north london <e> <s> her experience was of a previous occasion <e> <s> in any case following consideration by the council for national academic awards and despite the dossier sent by the noble baroness to the secretary of state the council for national academic awards in fact approved the resubmission by the applied social studies department <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to pick out the things that one knows about <e> <s> we have to consider the matter occasionally in detail because the noble baroness made very properly a detailed speech <e> <s> it is proper that the accusations that she makes should be considered as objectively as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not think that i questioned the noble baronesss <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only because the noble lord mentioned my name <e>

would be valuable evidence to us <e> <s> neither the points that she made nor those the noble lord lord chalfont is making now are really adequate as evidence for the point that he is trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord and i am grateful to him for dissociating me and my noble friends from the views that he has been describing <e> <s> but of course it is not just my noble friends here but the labour party as a whole which is opposed to what he described correctly as revolutionary socialism and it is all the more poignant for us that we have this very small number of people who have come into our party and seek to distort our democratic socialist purposes to those ends <e>", "<cs> my lords when he ceased to be minister of health mr enoch powell wrote a very wise little book called <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble earl for his lucid and exhaustive explanation of the provisions of this bill <e> <s> he is right in drawing attention to the fact that there is a great continuity of legislation and thinking about the government of schools over a period of more than a century though i suspect that the noble earl may be a little optimistic if he thinks that the present bill will provide the culmination of that process <e> <s> the history of managers as they were called in our schools possibly started with the education act when of course they were largely confined to primary schools <e> <s> but the controversy about whether or not there should be independent bodies attached to each school playing a role in the government of the school has never ceased since that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would permit me to <e>", "<cs> i am my lords <e>", "<cs> that is not only a damp squib but i suspect the minister has actually taken the squib and thrust it into the red bucket which stands behind the door and next to the teachers desk <e> <s> i consider it to be a wholly unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> i am disappointed that the minister should have felt it necessary to read it out as he did <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble baroness said <e> <s> it is explicit in the amendment that pupils over the age of should take over from their parents the right to make application to the ombudsman <e> <s> in that sense the content of the amendment if not the wording ought to meet with her approval and it recognises the responsibility which young people of and years of age have for their own lives as distinct from that which their parents have for them <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble earl said <e> <s> he has not made any advance in his attitude toward the amendment but in view of what he has said and the remarks of the noble baroness i think it is probably best if i take back the amendment now and return with one which has less defective wording <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it may be helpful if i came in immediately to respond to the right reverend prelate and to the noble baroness <e> <s> although there may be drafting defects i do not believe that they are drafting defects of the sort suggested <e> <s> it is not the intention that this amendment should apply to aided schools or to special-agreement schools and it is certainly not the intention that this amendment should have any effect whatever on the relationship between the church and the state in our schools <e> <s> if we have worded the amendment wrongly by omitting the word special from the second line so be it <e> <s> it will have to be corrected later <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that i had made it clear that the only consequential action that i proposed to take if the amendment is carried is to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> the discussion that i would wish to take place on clause is a separate matter and is not related to this amendment in any way <e> <s> there are a whole series of clauses on which i shall oppose the motion that the clause shall stand part of the bill for different reasons <e> <s> they are not affected by the wording of this amendment <e> <s> the right reverend prelate made one other perfectly valid point <e> <s> i think that we have put the head teacher in the wrong place <e> <s> it is not the intention that there should be five equal quarters on a governing body <e>", "<cs> the committee must be grateful to the minister for the sensitivity with which she has responded to the points made in the debate and for her detailed examination of them <e> <s> i suppose it was inevitable that an amendment of this sort coming first in part ii of the bill would flush out all the difficulties that are likely to occur in any solution which may be found for the composition of governing bodies <e> <s> indeed we have had a debate which has anticipated almost all the discussions which might take place on subsequent amendments on part ii of the bill <e> <s> i do not object to that at all because the amendment introduces many points for the first time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the interventions of the right reverend prelate and of the <e>", "<cs> if there is to be any teacher representation then on the noble baronesss argument there would have to be negotiation with the unions <e> <s> that applies whether or not the amendment is carried <e> <s> it applies under clause without this amendment <e> <s> the only addition here is the possibility and the requirement that there should be at least one member of the non-teaching staff <e> <s> this makes no difference to the fundamental issue <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the first amendment adds support staff but i phrased it badly <e> <s> the proposal is not necessarily to increase the number of teachers <e> <s> that is not the way it works <e> <s> it is to achieve equality between teachers and parents and the local education authority <e> <s> that is the objective <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for correcting me on that <e>", "<cs> support staff are those employed in the school who are not teachers <e> <s> they are those responsible for the physical maintenance of the school those who help for example as laboratory assistants and those responsible for catering and matters of that kind <e> <s> this is an issue that was discussed in our consideration of the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i respond to the noble lord lord renton first <e> <s> i appreciate his deep concern and interest particularly with mentally handicapped children and i think it is only responsible of me to acknowledge the worthiness of his motives at the same time saying that i think his objections to the amendment are misconceived <e> <s> if the noble lord is worried that in order to bring up teacher representation because there is much more about teacher representation than support staff representation it only happens that in the first group it occurs by adding one support staff in all the other groups you are adding teachers as well we have to reduce the number of co-opted members which is indeed the case in order not to have excessively large governing bodies he ought to have supported amendment no <e> <s> which left the issue of the total size of the governing body open to local decision <e>", "<cs> this has inevitably been a somewhat truncated debate because of the wide coverage of the previous amendment <e> <s> but it is the only opportunity we have to secure within the framework of the bill the objective to which my noble friend lord taylor has referred <e> <s> it is not that there should be more teachers than any other group <e> <s> that would not result from any of these amendments <e> <s> the intention is to increase the number of teachers and support staff which together will equal the number of parents the number of nominees of the local education authority and the number of co-opted governors to represent other interests <e> <s> i do not understand in what way the minister can argue that we are putting more teachers in than any other of the three groups <e> <s> perhaps she will help me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that because the arithmetic is achieved by adding in the head teacher to the number of teachers <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that the role of the head teacher on a governing body is different from the role of a teacher governor even if the head teacher chooses to be a governor <e> <s> the bill as drafted provides for the possibility of the head teacher electing not to be a governor but the head teacher may decide to be a governor <e> <s> the role in my experience is that the head teacher reports the facts of the events in the school and the provision made by the school to the governing body rather than acting as a voting member of the governing body although one hopes that governing bodies do not take too many votes <e> <s> i suggest that it is not legitimate to add the head teacher to the teachers number for a wise head teacher stands apart from the governing body to that extent reporting to it and acting on its decisions rather than taking part in the debates in the normal way <e>", "<cs> i think that in her last sentence the noble baroness has given the game away about clause <e> <s> she has convinced me if i needed convincing that clause is in fact a straitjacket <e> <s> because it is drafted in that way because it is drafted in the rigid way that it is there is virtually no possibility of effective amendment however good the case may be <e> <s> i am bound to say that the case made out <e>", "<cs> since reference has been made to amendment no <e> <s> i say immediately that i entirely agree with the noble lord that paragraph <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beloff is certainly right that if it were proposed that this amendment should be inserted into the legislation rather than being a probing amendment we would need something much more complicated <e> <s> that again compounds my feeling that we are in an extremely difficult position because clause is so rigidly and tightly drawn that these objections can arise <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i appreciate the force of the alternatives that she has suggested that there may be ways by election or co-option whereby welsh speakers could be added to the governing body <e> <s> however i am bound to say that experience certainly in cardiff does not encourage that view <e> <s> there is experience of a smaller welsh unit in a larger english school being ignored or neglected from the point of view of addition to the governing bodies <e>", "<cs> i had given notice of my intention to oppose the question <e> <s> that intention was based on the hope that the committee would see the wisdom of agreeing to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the circumstances i do not wish to pursue this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his remarks and i confirm that i shall be withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> however despite the absence of any of the right reverend prelates tonight and despite the absence to my knowledge of any spokesman for the catholic hierarchy i should like to make the following appeal to the churches <e> <s> on the basis that there is to be no attempt in any way to undermine the dual system to which reference has been made would it not be a valuable and co-operative gesture on the part of the churches to make some attempt to see to it that foundation governors themselves adequately represent the parents and the teachers at the school <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> it confirms what i have just said and it confirms my intention to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word of support to the noble lord lord kilmarnock on this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that this is another example of the government having trapped themselves into complete rigidity in the composition of governing bodies and of now being forced to take an extreme position <e> <s> it is an extreme position to say that all the parent governors in boarding schools should be appointed by the local authority when as the noble lord has convincingly shown us it is possible to have elected parent governors of a boarding school <e> <s> they have a community of interest which is just as strong despite the fact that they do not all live in the same neighbourhood <e> <s> there are working examples of elections by parents and the successful functioning of parent-teacher associations in schools of that kind <e> <s> in those circumstances it is the noble lord lord kilmarnock who is being moderate and reasonable and in the formula laid down in clause the government are being exclusive unreasonable and unrecognising of successful practice in another way <e> <s> if the noble lord does not press the amendment he may consider at a later stage some intermediate amendment which will allow for the possibility of election but which will also allow for the possibility of appointment if election is not feasible <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> if the noble lord lord renton promised me that he was half-glad to give me full-hearted support that would give me even greater pleasure <e> <s> but i recognise the force of the points made <e> <s> i also recognise that the bill provides for joint appointments when that is appropriate <e> <s> i still feel that there could be an advantage in a panel of this kind which need not be as formal as the noble earl suggests <e> <s> but i will consider the form of the amendment in the way that the noble lord lord renton has suggested and see whether it is more appropriate to put it forward in that way at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the virtues of this amendment seem to me so apparent that i am sure the government will give way and it would be inappropriate for me to make any grumbling noises <e> <s> i rise only to say that i support wholeheartedly what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i recognise that his wording is preferable to that of my own amendment no <e> <s> and i am sure that the noble lord lord kilmarnock and my noble friend lord irving will agree with me on that <e> <s> i hope that the government will give as sympathetic consideration as they can to something which i am sure must have been intended and which i am also sure is what parents teachers and all governors would expect to be the conditions of appointment to a governing body <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i were to remain on my feet long enough for the noble baroness to obtain advice on this matter <e> <s> it would be preferable to have the matter clarified now rather than wait until a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that we might ask the noble baroness to go a little further than that <e> <s> in view of what she has said and whatever may be the position in respect of subsection it would not be unreasonable of us to ask her to confirm the governments view that it would be desirable if it can be achieved not to have lame duck governors either parents or teachers after the end of the school year in which they are either teachers or have pupils at the school <e> <s> if the noble baroness will confirm that and will simply say that a means must be found of achieving it then she will deserve and receive the gratitude of parents of schools and indeed of this committee <e>", "<cs> forgive me for intervening again but the matter is governed by primary legislation in subsection <e> <s> we are totally relaxed about whether it should be primary legislation or by regulation at the end of the day <e> <s> we are saying that the primary legislation on the face of the bill does not achieve the objective which i think all members of the committee want <e>", "<cs> i also intended to say that i should be delighted to follow the noble lord or to act with him as a teller if he felt inclined to give effect to statements with which i entirely agree but for another reason <e>", "<cs> i find myself wholly convinced by the arguments of the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i have given notice of our intention to oppose the questions on both of these clauses <e> <s> clauses and are closely related <e> <s> my noble friend lord taylor will no doubt wish to refer to the very lengthy considerations of the taylor committee about the grouping of governing bodies <e> <s> this was a matter which caused them considerable concern not least because of the very substantial abuses which took place under the preceding legislation <e> <s> reference was made at second reading to the fact that manchester local education authority for many years thought it appropriate to group all of their schools together under one governing body which was in effect the education committee <e> <s> reference was also made to sir james graham of leeds who managed to use the act to circumvent the provisions of the act <e> <s> this is a matter which goes back a number of years <e>", "<cs> i always find the noble baroness a very effective advocate <e> <s> i must say that on this occasion i find her brief wholly unconvincing <e> <s> nine-tenths of it was devoted to saying how little grouping there was going to be and the only statement of defence for the remaining grouping was to say in some circumstances grouping may be beneficial <e> <s> she <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i dispute that even at this time of night <e> <s> the noble earl is assuming that the secretary of state in his guidelines has to specify either exactly what form the elections should take or make the guidelines so vague as to be useless <e> <s> there is a third option <e> <s> it is possible for the secretary of state to describe a number of ways in which the elections could take place and leave it to the local authority to decide which of those ways is the most appropriate for its circumstances <e> <s> in that way the secretary of state would not be overbearing or forcing a particular solution on a local authority he would be providing the kind of practical help for what is after all a complex matter which i should have thought most local authorities would welcome and find helpful <e>", "<cs> i prefer my amendment amendment no <e> <s> and i do not think it is appropriate to have two debates on two different amendments <e> <s> the reason why i prefer my amendment is that i think an opportunity for a postal vote is more appropriate when there could well be a considerable part of the voting actually taking place at a meeting and when the need for a postal vote is complementary to that <e> <s> in my professional organisation we have an annual general meeting <e> <s> postal votes can be sent in by the time of the start of the meeting but those who come to the meeting can cast their votes in a secret ballot at the meeting itself rather than sending them by post <e> <s> that seems to me to be a more appropriate solution to the compulsory postal ballot which the noble lord lord kilmarnock is proposing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord kilmarnock replies i think that our colleagues who have responsibility for the employment brief would be amused to find the government supporting workplace ballots and the opposition supporting postal ballots if it came to trade union legislation <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord lord kilmarnock thinks but i thought that the governments reply was peculiarly unsatisfactory and requires further action <e>", "<cs> my lords tribute has rightly been paid by all speakers in the debate to my noble friend lord gregson and his colleagues for a most remarkable report <e> <s> speaking as one who comes to this subject totally afresh indeed one who would not come too close anyway because i am the kind of sailor who gets seasick even in his own bath i find the analysis of the report and the description of the issues which face government and our society exhaustive and the conclusions which the report reaches devastating <e> <s> i am bound to say that i have never before seen a set of recommendations which are more comprehensive in the way that they cover the field more closely linked to each other in argument and more challenging to those responsible for our science policy than the recommendations which are in the report before us today <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the question asked and the answer just given raise a much more general question of the future of the observatory at herstmonceux and the sercs intentions in relation to that observatory <e> <s> will the minister intercede through the usual channels to ensure that this house has an opportunity to discuss this much more serious and wide-ranging issue <e>", "<cs> there can be no doubt about the importance of this amendment <e> <s> in moving it the noble lord lord beloff said that it was an opportunity to turn what he described as a minor bill into a major bill <e> <s> he gave good notice of that intention at second reading and indeed has faithfully followed it out <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson referred to it as a modest proposal <e> <s> i suspect that it is a modest proposal more in the sense that jonathan swift meant a modest proposal than in the sense which the noble lord lord henderson originally intended <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i am puzzled by his last remark <e> <s> surely the secretary of state has the opportunity to give voice to his views about the curriculum now and under the proposed legislation <e> <s> what is proposed in the amendment is it not <e> <s> is that the curriculum policy of local education authorities shall be in accordance with priorities laid down by the secretary of state <e> <s> that is a very different thing <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness made a brave and loyal attempt to defend the parliamentary draftsman but it will not wash for a number of reasons <e> <s> i have looked back as well at <e>", "<cs> those are about the minimum concessions that the government could have offered dare i say <e> <s> to the universal concerns that have been expressed from all sides of the committee about the drafting of clause <e> <s> the noble baroness says that she cannot accept my amendment and that she will take it away to consider it with colleagues in the department of education and science <e>

disappointed by that answer <e> <s> i think it is highly unlikely that we will come back on report with an agreed solution to this complex problem <e> <s> although i shall beg leave to withdraw the

the roles of the various participants in the decision-making process we shall be forced to come back with an amendment very similar to the one moved today <e> <s> i say that now in order not to be accused of abusing the procedures of the chamber at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i hate to delay the committee at this hour but silence from this dispatch <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i understand that he is quoting from <e>", "<cs> there is a danger of repeating the debate which we had ostensibly about primary schools before the break but as we know it was a debate which trespassed on the conduct of secondary schools <e> <s> i intervene from this dispatch box again on the basis which i profoundly believe that we are opposed to political indoctrination in schools <e> <s> but that does not mean that we accept the need for the kind of amendments proposed now still less the kind of arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> if ever there was a case of a zinoviev letter being taken up by noble lords this was it <e>", "<cs> i am not claiming that the labour members of liverpool education committee are in perfect awareness of the facts <e> <s> what i am saying is that it is we on these benches who are fighting militant <e> <s> we in the labour party are fighting militant and we are winning and it is no thanks to those who distort the issue and the arguments by falling for this blatant hoax <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that there are people in militant tendency who would like to behave very much in the way that the noble lord has been reading out and that the noble lord lord harris has been reading out <e> <s> i want to make two points <e> <s> i say this out of great detestation for militant tendency and great confidence that militant tendency will not be an important matter and ought not as my noble friend lord parry says to be considered further in this committee <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord reflect upon the fact that the kind of political education that he has described at eton which involves having speakers from the labour party and from the conservative party as an adjunct to the teaching in his school is precisely that which would be forbidden in local authority schools by the amendment that he is now supporting <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is enough to disagree <e> <s> the amendment says that the local education authority will <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to learn that eric heffer and ken livingstone did not promote their partisan political views <e> <s> in my experience it will be the first time in history that that has been the case <e>", "<cs> i rest my case <e>", "<cs> i like the amendment and the committee must be grateful for the moderate and rational way in which it has been moved <e> <s> i was particularly interested to hear the noble lord lord ritchie say that it is the professional objective of teachers to ensure that in dealing with political matters a balance is achieved and that if one political view is stated the alternative view should also be stated <e> <s> my only doubt is about the wording and whether that objective is achieved by the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that he wig not press this amendment to a vote <e> <s> therefore this is a matter on which only from this dispatch box can i express my views on the amendment <e> <s> it is not necessary or appropriate to discuss whether the amendment may or may not be defective in its wording but i think it is necessary as the education spokesman for the labour party before this committee to say without equivocation that we do not condone the exclusion of the police from any schools and that we do not believe it is proper whatever political views teachers may hold that they should use those political views for any exclusion of this sort <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but the impression left of the legal position by the minister is so far from reality that it is necessary to correct it <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the european courts ruling was only that the <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that i was caning it a bit in asking for an immediate reply but i still think it will be necessary for the government to express their views on the way in which the law stands and how we are to comply with the requirements of the european court of justice which have until this afternoon been accepted by the government as being binding <e> <s> through the usual channels i shall seek to find further opportunities for your lordships house to interrogate the government and to make sure that the government make their position clear <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what has been said by the noble baroness <e> <s> i am grateful that she felt able to make a statement about the governments position on the issue of corporal punishment <e> <s> i felt sure that one had been drafted for the eventuality of the government being defeated but i thought that it might take a few minutes for it to reach the front bench <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to debate with both the minister and my own noble friends <e> <s> it is an experience which she has been undergoing on this bill more often than i have <e> <s> nonetheless the experience does not disagree with me <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> appears before amendment no <e> <s> a in the

punishment <e> <s> i did not speak to it in moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i confess to your lordships that i am not entirely clear whether amendment no <e> <s> is an essential part of the argument on corporal punishment but i shall have an opportunity to return to it at report stage if i find it is a necessary part of the series of amendments depending upon amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> briefly although in this committee that word seems an introduction to length we thoroughly support the amendment <e> <s> we believe that it is a valuable addition to the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble baronesss reply puzzles me <e> <s> i wonder whether she is speaking to the right amendment because the new clause proposed by the noble lord lord kilmarnock is a replacement of clause <e> <s> it confirms the position in the bill that in county controlled and maintained special schools there shall be a right of appeal against exclusion and it makes new provision for such an appeal to exist for the parents in aided and special agreement schools <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord on this point <e> <s> the whole thrust of the bill as we have been told on many occasions is to extend the democratic government of our schools system to a wider body of people <e> <s> the particular mechanism chosen by the government to do that is the governing body <e> <s> the governing body has increased powers and a wider membership to include elected parents and elected teachers and other co-opted members <e>", "<cs> i was very encouraged by the first part of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> she has certainly convinced me that per cent <e> <s> could be interpreted as being a proportion of the funds and i would have been very happy to leave it at that <e> <s> but she then went on to say that there was something dangerous about the approach and that all of the funds allocated to the school would somehow bring with it all sorts of difficulties about payroll and so on <e> <s> if that is the case then the objection applies to the bill without the amendment because if per cent <e> <s> is a proportion then per cent <e> <s> is all <e> <s> the objections apply whether or not the amendment is carried <e>", "<cs> if that were the case then there certainly cannot be any objection other than pure parsimony to publishing the address in an accessible form <e> <s> but if it is not the case and if they are not in the telephone book it is not just that people do not have telephones an increasing number of people are actually excluding their names from the telephone directory for reasons of self preservation then it is appropriate that they should be as accessible as those who are in the telephone directory <e>", "<cs> i am always susceptible to suggestions that an amendment might be unnecessary <e> <s> i bridle more when i am told that it is dangerous <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that the noble earl used that word in this instance <e> <s> in this case i am less than convinced i am bound to say by the noble earls arguments <e> <s> to have to approach a governor through the clerk to the governing body or through the school is an additional complication which will to that extent make governors less accessible to the electorate whereas the opportunity to write directly to governors is a facility that ought to be made available to the electorate <e>", "<cs> the effect is the same <e> <s> if a parent who wanted to contact a governor had to go to the clerk to the governors to obtain the address that would in effect be going through the clerk to the governors <e> <s> there is no direct contact <e> <s> there is at least the reforwarding to take place <e>", "<cs> i share my noble friends disappointment <e> <s> indeed i am puzzled by the attitude of the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> it is after all an established principle that the publications of a local authority and the proceedings of a local authority in wales where there are welsh language speakers must also be available in welsh <e> <s> i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> i cannot help thinking that the draftsman just forgot about the welsh language in this respect and that the resistance to this amendment is purely formal in order to protect the parliamentary draftsman rather than the result of deep thought <e> <s> it seems to me that in practical terms the government are inviting difficulty not so much in this committee although the strength of the welsh language on these benches is well known from my noble friend lord cledwyn downwards but particularly in another place <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble baroness said because i think it leads the way to a compromise that might be acceptable to all parties <e> <s> i agree that one could conceive of a situation where it would be undesirable to insist on a copy of the report in welsh simply because there is a part of the school that uses the welsh medium <e> <s> however the noble baroness suggested that it might be possible to say that if any parent or parents ask for the governors annual report to be in welsh then it should be required for it to be provided <e> <s> that seems to me to be a useful halfway house <e> <s> it is not in the bill as drafted but an amendment on those lines could well be prepared which would presumably meet with the approval of the government since it would be made at the suggestion of the noble baroness <e> <s> on the understanding that we shall come back on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl in the course of one speech is not only taking words out of my mouth he is putting words into my mouth <e> <s> i am certain that no governing body of which the noble earl is a member would be as he puts it bolshie it is not a word that i ever use but he recognises as i do that there might be governing bodies even elected governing bodies or even governing bodies without a local education authority majority that would find it more cosy not to report back on an annual basis with all the additional work and attendance that might be required <e>", "<cs> i would be slightly more sympathetic to that reply if the government had not been so implacable in their opposition to pupil governors because it is possible if the governing body not having any pupils on it does not wish to encourage senior pupils or the school council and i find both those suggestions helpful then it can do so and therefore can impoverish the annual meeting at which the governors report <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble baroness is right in saying that the important thing is that action should be taken as a result of the resolutions passed at annual meetings <e> <s> i welcome what she said about the power of parents annual meetings to pass resolutions of this kind and to have them taken seriously <e> <s> i was urging perhaps a more practical and less formal way of responding <e> <s> but i look hack and see the phrase brief comment on it is included in the bill and on a number of resolutions the comment might be no longer than agreed action on th april <e> <s> that would fulfil the obligations as i understand it of the subsection and would probably be a perfectly satisfactory solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not see how the amendment duplicates existing channels of communication <e> <s> it was helpful of the noble baroness to repeat what i knew but perhaps the committee did not know that legislative provisions exist for the agendas and minutes of governing bodies meetings to be available for inspection <e> <s> that goes one part of the way towards meeting our objectives <e> <s> to include the provision that the text of reports this is important which are formally required under clause either by the governing body or the local education authority should be provided is an addition to the requirements but it is not a duplication of the requirements <e>", "<cs> for the reasons that i have already given i do not propose to seek the decision of the committee on this amendment <e> <s> indeed in addition to the drafting defects that i pointed out i appreciate what was said by the noble baroness <e> <s> the amendment in effect requires the senior representative to exercise a casting vote whereas it ought to make it possible rather than require it <e> <s> that is a further defect in the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has spent a great deal of time putting forward very much <e>", "<cs> it was one of the reasons and it was one of the least convincing reasons among the many other unconvincing reasons that the noble earl put forward <e> <s> the burden of proof is clearly on the government <e> <s> it is the government who are trying to change a system which to the best of my knowledge and taking into account anything the noble earl has said on behalf of the government has not been criticised <e> <s> if there is to be a change of this sort it has to be shown that the alternative is better than what we have at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure to acknowledge and add my own thanks to those expressed by the noble lord lord lucas to my noble friend lord ennals <e> <s> it was my noble friend who in introduced into another place the dangerous household products child safety packaging bill <e> <s> that was far too long a title but it was a very necessary initiative on his part <e> <s> it was that bill which resulted in the child resistant-closure working party to which the minister has just referred <e> <s> i think it was remarkable that the working party which consisted of a number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that that was the risk of spillage <e> <s> i was suggesting that if the container in becoming child resistant had increased the risk of spillage the temptation would be for the adult to transfer the liquid to another container <e> <s> that is the worry that i had about spillage and i think it is relevant to the safety of children <e>", "<cs> as the minister says i am a reasonable man <e> <s> i am also noted for my devout adherence to the proprieties of the committee <e> <s> i spoke only about the amendment and not about the wider issues which have been raised in debate <e> <s> i am bound to say that the contributions of my noble friends and others have convinced me if i needed convincing that the issue is more serious than what is covered by this amendment and the reply from the noble earl gives me much greater concern about what is in the mind of the secretary of state and whether this is the right way to go about it <e>", "<cs> i agree with that <e> <s> that is certainly what is said in the sentence that i read out earlier <e> <s> but does that mean that every aspect of a teachers working life or even to some extent leisure life is going to be controlled compulsorily by appraisal <e> <s> the whole point about this clause is that this is provision for compulsory appraisal <e> <s> what may be agreed voluntarily by negotiation is a very different thing from what can reasonably be imposed by the secretary of state on the basis of statute <e>", "<cs> the governments replies to this debate are not only unsatisfactory they are positively alarming <e> <s> the noble lord lord alexander put the point very precisely <e> <s> if it is proposed that the minority shareholders in our education system those who do not employ the teachers those who do not run the school systems in other words central government shall have the control over the appraisal of individual teachers throughout their careers then we have a complete break with all the traditions not only of the education service but of appraisal in any sphere of employment <e> <s> it seems to me inconceivable that the government <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear the noble earl confirm something that did not need confirming <e> <s> i was not making that claim <e> <s> it is common ground between us that central government does not employ teachers <e> <s> it is common ground between us that central government does not actually run the schools <e> <s> what the noble earl has now confirmed is the <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> we have never said that the labour party was opposed to appraisal <e> <s> we have said that the labour party was opposed to appraisal imposed in the way that clause proposes to impose it <e> <s> however that is not being opposed to appraisal indeed we have said the opposite <e>", "<cs> i am in sympathy with that which the noble lord lord kilmarnock wants to do but i share his scepticism about the effectiveness of statutory instruments and regulations being laid before both houses of parliament largely for the reasons he gives that they are not capable of amendment and by convention they are not actually turned back particularly if they have been approved by another place <e>", "<cs> i have not given notice of my intention to oppose the motion that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is always difficult to anticipate whether there are going to be amendments from any quarter on a particular clause which will enable one to say the things that have to be said <e> <s> we appear to be approving without comment the provisions for in-service training of teachers <e>", "<cs> i am happy to answer the noble lord although i think that my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for intervening between myself and my noble friend <e> <s> i suggest that i am intervening between him and the bill he is supporting because the questions he is raising apply not only to the amendment but also to clause of the bill <e> <s> it is his government which are proposing that <e>", "<cs> i have found that a helpful and constructive reply and i shall certainly read carefully what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i noticed that the brief that she was reading from at one stage was written on the assumption that the central advisory unit was prescriptive rather than advisory <e> <s> she herself observed that this was the case and what we were proposing was advisory rather than setting central standards <e> <s> i think that that is an important distinction which we ought to have made more clear in moving the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness but what she says is not in accordance with my understanding of the way in which the inter-authority payments committee actually operates <e> <s> i understood that it was not a single national level but that it was an agreed and negotiated level of recoupment which includes a london weighting in the consideration <e> <s> therefore if there is a recoupment between the inner london education authority with its necessarily highest costs and another neighbouring authority the london weighting as applied to ileas costs would be taken into account under existing arrangements but there is no assurance that it would be taken into account in the arrangements as proposed by the bill <e> <s> however this is a technical matter and rather than detain the committee with this i would prefer to read what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i am sure she will wish to write to me if there is any difference of understanding or of evidence <e> <s> i think it is preferable if i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble baroness felt able to start to heed the wise words of the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill because what he said is true <e> <s> the distinction between vocational and non-vocational education is no longer a tenable distinction from the point of view of statute law when we have as we have now and shall have in the future a population many members of which do not have access to a full-time job and whose working life will change in ways they do not expect and do not want and who face retirement earlier than they would wish and without the preparation that they would wish to have for retirement <e>", "<cs> i read this clause with some incredulity and i looked back at the explanatory and financial memorandum to see what provision was being made for extra civil servants in the department of education and science to read all these reports to the secretary of state <e> <s> the governing body of every county voluntary and maintained special school and establishment maintained for further education shall make reports and returns tc the secretary of state <e> <s> i cannot believe that the secretary of state will read or have anybody read for him reports from every school and every further education establishment in the country <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble earl should think that i am so distrustful of the governments motives that i would believe that they would wish to bypass local education authorities in an unjustified way <e> <s> i have great faith in the noble earl on a number of matters <e>", "<cs> i have refrained from intervening because several of my noble friends have done so in terms with which i fully agree <e> <s> i too am disappointed by what the minister has said not because i dissent from the reasoning behind it in many ways but because there is a gap between the provision which she says is now available and the practice in many of our schools <e> <s> there is a difference as my noble friend lord dean said between those schools that have adequate insurance and those that do not <e> <s> i know that the amendment is not about insurance but there are differences between the schools <e>", "<cs> i am impressed by the clarity and brevity of the intervention of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i certainly yield to him in his interpretation of what is meant by may and shall although it seems different from the way in which i use these words in ordinary life <e> <s> i am bemused by the intervention of the minister <e> <s> unless i misunderstand her the noble baroness says that it is compulsory to make a scheme but that the scheme although it is compulsory may not result in the actual payment of travelling and subsistence allowances <e> <s> i shall read carefully what she had to say and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> the noble baroness may well be right about the definition of the word subsistence <e> <s> there are always different interpretations to be put on words of that sort <e> <s> before i withdraw the amendment i ask the noble baroness whether the government have formed a view on this point <e> <s> if a local authority did decide to grant child care allowances then would it be prohibited from doing so by the terms of the bill or would such payments be within the discretion of the local authority to make to governors if it so wished <e> <s> my understanding is that there are local authorities that do such a thing for their councillors at the moment <e> <s> if the noble baroness does not have that information available now perhaps she will let me know the answer later <e>", "<cs> in anticipation of that reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know that this is a matter to take to a vote but it seems that after the very distinguished history of the central advisory councils for education over a period of years perhaps not over the past few years but for many of the past years it is a very mean provision that the act should be amended in this way <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> while recognising the value of the work done by the <e>", "<cs> this is a crazy clause <e> <s> there is no other word for it <e> <s> the government are demanding reports from all and sundry about all <e>", "<cs> we must be grateful to the noble baroness for what she says about the sources booklet <e> <s> i am sure that it will be valuable to members of parliament <e> <s> however in almost every other respect that reply was deeply disappointing <e>", "<cs> i listened to what the minister said with mounting disbelief and those who feel strongly that justice is not being done in many conservative parts of the country will read what she said with mounting disbelief <e> <s> it is literally true that the powers of the secretary of state in dealing with cases that are brought to him are restricted to accepting or rejecting the proposals and he has no power to amend them <e>", "<cs> my lords the house owes a debt of gratitude to the noble baroness lady seear not only for her choice of subject for this afternoons debate but also for the eloquent way in which she moved the motion standing in her name <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the tribute she paid to the initiative years ago of my right honourable friend mr james callaghan in starting the great debate and for the cogent way in which she expounded the decline of that great debate and the way we have sunk to a much lower level of concern for education and for educational standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> i did not actually use the word skulduggery <e> <s> i merely suggested that it would have been helpful in the debate in the run-up to the local elections if extra efforts had been made to see that the report was published so that the public could take it into account <e> <s> if i may say a word in the issue of books i do not doubt that there may be management detects but does the noble earl deny that the real expenditure on books since has declined by one-eighth <e>", "<cs> my lords it is commonplace in politics that the old saying <e>", "<cs> my lords if the right reverend prelate will permit me there is no amendment to the number of foundation governors <e> <s> in each subsection the amendment proposed is to the number of co-opted governors in cases other than the cases of foundation governors in controlled schools <e> <s> perhaps i may refer the right reverend prelate specifically to the first one concerned which is amendment no <e> <s> which refers to reducing the three co-opted governors to two rather than to changing the number of foundation governors <e>", "<cs> my lords having made such an attempt to simplify the issues before the house in comparison with the wide-ranging debate we had in committee i find it somewhat galling to hear noble lords particularly the noble lord lord mottistone now expressing a preference for the flexibility which was our first choice at committee stage <e> <s> it was after all an amendment to allow flexibility and to permit local circumstances to have an influence on the size and composition of governing bodies that we took to a division at committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone voted against us in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is proper for me to permit an interruption to my speech even at report stage particularly when it is not a response which is worthy of the noble lord <e> <s> whether or not the noble lord takes part in the debate he has an opportunity to consider the issues and i hope that his views have not changed since that time <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place even though the statement is one of what can only be called studied imprecision <e> <s> we on this side of the house agree with the secretary of state that the process of re-revising the determination of the recurrent grant and the block grant by the university grants committee is a worthwhile process <e> <s> i am sure that it is necessary for the historic accidental basis of the calculation of recurrent grant and block grant to have been revised and overhauled <e>", "<cs> my lords following this wide-ranging discussion on the statement will the noble earl acknowledge that there will be widespread dismay in the universities and among those who attend them or who are responsible for them that not one single assurance that i sought has been given by the government in response to the questions raised <e> <s> no assurance has been given that there is not a real shortfall in of more than per cent <e> <s> no assurance given that the extra money to be available in will in fact restore level funding no assurance given that any money will not come from <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped in what i said at the outset that i was making it possible for the government to make some smaller concessions than the acceptance of the amendment <e> <s> it would have been possible for us to have moved amendments that would have made pupil governors part of the co-opted sector of the governing body that would have relieved the concerns of the right reverend prelate and the government about the per cent <e> <s> laid down by the act <e> <s> it would have been possible for us to have moved amendments that would have fallen short of full membership of the governing body <e> <s> it may be necessary for us to do that at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords is the word in fact subsection as printed on the marshalled list or should it read subject to section as it was in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose we must be grateful for that as far as it goes <e> <s> i would prefer to have said that the amendments provide the framework whereby the position might be clarified because the intention of the original amendments was to ensure that where parents cease to be parents and where teachers cease to be teachers they would no longer be eligible to be governors even though their four-year term had not expired <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down since we are at report stage may i say that i am grateful for that small mercy but it is incumbent upon the government to indicate their attitude towards the content of the amendments put at <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are trying desperately to claw their way out of the trap they have dug for themselves with overprecise legislation <e> <s> this is exactly the kind of difficulty that we anticipated when we saw that every single detail of the composition of governing bodies was going to be laid down by statute <e> <s> i am sure that there will be subsequent amendments along this line when the draftsmen discover other examples or other examples are referred to them of exceptions which cannot be dealt with within the framework of the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i wonder whether she is aware that it is not really a matter of the number of queries tailing off after the act but both the advisory centre for education and the national association of school governors and managers report that there is a continuing high level of queries about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for those last words <e> <s> i must apologise to her for my unseemly laughter during <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a fascinating reply <e> <s> indeed it was several fascinating replies <e> <s> in the first instance i felt that the noble baroness was speaking in support of my amendment <e> <s> we entirely agree with everything that she said about shared responsibility between the governing body the local education authority and the head teacher <e> <s> indeed the amendment specifically sets out in comprehensible terms and i apologise if they are also tidy the nature of the shared responsibility between the local education authority the governing body and the head teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters have been debated in your lordships house on a number of occasions in the last six months with a very considerable and clearly genuine passion <e>", "<cs> my lords i had expected it only to be necessary for me to stand up and support my noble friend with my small experience of living in perhaps one of the most multiracial boroughs in london having had the pleasure of all my children being at primary and comprehensive schools in that borough where there were significant numbers of pupils from other countries and having felt in my own family and in the friends of my children the pleasure of the immense cultural and intellectual vitality which was given by the mixture of their friends and associates and my own friends and associates <e> <s> i had thought that my personal testimony on that score would be the most that i could contribute to the support of my noble friends amendment which i clearly and openly support

henderson or the noble viscount <e> <s> if the <e>", "<cs> my lords if that little local difficulty has been got out of the way perhaps it would be appropriate for us to say that this may be one of the occasions when the government have got the balance right between matters on the face of the bill matters to be prescribed in regulation and matters not even to be prescribed in guidance <e> <s> clearly the whole complexity of regulations about the publication of information could be very great <e> <s> it could be as complicated as part ii of the bill and i do not think that noble lords would wish to get themselves involved in complex drafting of that sort particularly at this stage in the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly express entire agreement with the noble lords amendment which would bring a degree of reason to sessions terms and holidays which could well escape if the bill as drafted were to proceed without amendment <e> <s> it is in the interests of the local authorities and it does no injury at all to the autonomy in important matters of the aided and special agreement schools <e>", "<cs> my lords these are exceedingly complex matters and i am not satisfied that i yet understand all the details of the amendments that the noble earl has moved although i am very much predisposed to agree with them and to support them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only right that i should express our appreciation to the government and to the noble baroness lady hooper who took the trouble to write to me twice about the matter <e> <s> there was indeed confusion <e> <s> i do not think that it was confusion in the minds of the opposition but in the wording of the bill as orginally drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that <e> <s> i had thought that there was a connection between this and the preceding amendment <e> <s> i am happy to have it confirmed that the governments general move in the direction of better information about schools and the operation of governing bodies includes those matters <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed <e> <s> after reading the minister of states speech i am hardly surprised but it makes me think that we have not found the right solution and that the whole complicated procedure set out in clauses and will not work as the government think <e> <s> the only consideration that we can continue to give to this matter must be to see whether it should not be dealt with by regulation rather than on the face of the bill <e> <s> we shall give consideration to that alternative before the third reading <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply which indeed covers a very large part of the intention of the amendment <e> <s> it is useful to have confirmation that the powers already exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trebly grateful to my noble friend for moving this amendment in the way that she has firstly because in order to move the amendment she has sat patiently through so many hours of debate when i know that she is not in the best of health secondly because of the extremely eloquent and lucid way in which she has moved the amendment and thirdly because of her kindness in not referring to the mess frankly that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness responds perhaps i may reinforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i had assumed that it was a matter of courtesy to let the government respond to my noble friends motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care and sympathy to what the noble baroness has said because the government are certainly in a difficult position <e> <s> it is true that the government made the undertaking which the noble baroness read out <e> <s> it is certainly true that they were under an obligation after report stage to come back to this house at third reading <e> <s> however report stage was on tuesday th may <e> <s> by the following wednesday the bill as amended at report was not available and it was therefore not possible for anybody other than the government to put down amendments to it <e> <s> i did not see the amendment until this friday morning last th may <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness could hardly say fairer than that <e> <s> we have the undertaking that i was looking for we have the understanding that it is in the mind of the government as it was in the mind of the house at earlier stages of this bill that there should be no unjustifiable obstruction of postal ballots and no obstruction by anybody in any position of authority of the democratic rights of parents to select their own parent governors <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for her assurances and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sensible that the whole question of the interpretation of single words such as modified or interpreted is an extremely difficult one <e> <s> i am grateful as always to the noble and learned lord lord denning for his advice on the matter <e> <s> however even speaking as a non-lawyer i do not feel that we have got to the bottom of the issues that we are considering <e> <s> the matter goes far wider than the use of words <e> <s> there is behind it all the rather fundamental issue of the control and ultimately the democratic control of our education system <e>", "<cs> my lords i stayed cautiously clear of this debate at earlier stages <e> <s> i am not much of an expert on high minded words or what the noble and learned lord calls pious aspirations <e> <s> i am inclined to think however that the only piece of sex education that will have a real effect on pupils is if they can be convinced that a happy sex life is possible only in a loving and stable relationship <e> <s> if that could be secured by statute we should be achieving something <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to this motion i should like first to say with complete sincerity that it has been a pleasure to face the team from the government benches <e> <s> the noble baronesses and the noble earl have been unfailingly courteous and punctilious in responding where they have undertaken to do so to questions which could not be raised in debate <e> <s> they have indeed made a number of significant concessions as a result of our debates and my sincerity in saying this can be gauged by the fact that i could not have said it on a number of bills on which i have been engaged from this bench <e>", "<cs> my lords the house must be grateful to the minister for her lucid introduction of these amendments <e> <s> as she says they are largely procedural rather than substantive but of course they are a further step along a road of which we on these benches profoundly disapprove <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble baroness define best when she talks about those schools <e>", "<cs> my lords the house must be very grateful to the noble earl lord de la warr for raising the matter and for raising it with a persistence which encourages him to stay this late at night in order to do so <e> <s> it is important that he raised it and that the matter is considered by the house now because the science and engineering research council is due to make a decision on this matter at a meeting on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for introducing these regulations and for the explanations she has given <e> <s> the larger issues concerned with the use of education support grants and specific support for education by central government in addition to the block grant were of course considered by your lordships at some length during the passage of the education bill <e> <s> the point of view was put by a number of noble lords including the noble lord lord beloff and my noble friends lord houghton of sowerby and lord stewart that perhaps it would be as well to recognise the reality and have a great deal more control by central government of the curriculum and of expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has sought to distance herself from the grotesque error made by the ugc <e> <s> will she recall that when the announcement was made in this house of the allocation of resources to the ugc for the forthcoming year the government took great credit for the way in which the grant was to be allocated and the reforms that were to be made in the allocation <e> <s> is it consistent with the attempt to take credit for the method of allocation now to deny responsibility for one of the effects of the allocation <e> <s> is she aware that the simple error is that these are not part-time students in the same sense as students in other universities <e> <s> they are full-time students working at night <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is speculation what is the true figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> will he accept from the outset that we are not saying from these benches that everything about that statement is bad <e> <s> in particular the announcement of a review which although it is to be carried out within the government will nevertheless take representations from interested parties and will publish its results i hope with rather less delay than the results of the review of the social security advisory committee is welcome <e> <s> it has been the policy of my party for a number of years that a review of this sort should take place and we are pleased to see the government accepting the logic of our position <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to the original question the minister referred only to the responsibilities of local education authorities and schools <e> <s> is he not aware that the broome committee on school libraries made specific recommendations to the department of education and science that there should be a statutory requirement on schools to have adequate libraries that the department of education and science should undertake a specific training initiative for school librarians and the appointment of chartered librarians in schools and that there should be what the report called challenge funds which might be taken in with education support grants to encourage expansion of library and information service provision <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened with care to what the noble earl said about the consideration being given by the government to further funding <e> <s> can he give the house any indication as to when that consideration will result in a decision by the government and an announcement of that decision <e> <s> is it not also the case that apart from the issue of funding there is a grave need for breaking down the barriers between different grades of engineers <e> <s> is it not absurd that in there should still be a distinction between technician engineers and engineering technicians quite apart from the distinction between graduate engineers and those with other engineering responsibilities and duties <e>", "<cs> on these benches we should like to welcome the amendment which provides a useful paving stone for some of the require-ments on disclosure that we shall be discussing in a few minutes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for reminding me of the detailed terms of schedule <e> <s> he need be in no doubt that i was aware of the terms of schedule before framing my amendments which are intended to push the frontiers of principles applicable to regulations as far as they could possibly be pushed <e> <s> the explanation we have had has confirmed what a complex area it is how there have to be different rules for company representatives and independent representatives and the precautions which have to be taken to deal with the kind of abuse <e>", "<cs> i feared that the minister was going to respond to the form of my amendment which i admitted was defective rather than to my invitation to him to be a little more explicit <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for the indication he gave towards the end of his speech about the way in which the governments mind was moving <e> <s> i have to say at once that i do not believe and consumer organisations will not believe that a period of days for a cancellation period for applicable deals and i accept that not all investment deals are applicable is adequate <e> <s> that means that we shall have to put down if we can find a way of doing it some suitable amendment at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i think it is appropriate for me to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that response may not make sense to my noble friend but it certainly makes sense to me <e> <s> i am sure that he will read carefully what the minister said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there are two ways of responding to that <e> <s> wearing my mr hyde hat i might say that the government are continuing to make up the bill as they go along which is not a very satisfactory procedure in matters as complex and important as this <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> it is after midnight and i forgive the noble lord for over-reacting <e> <s> had he <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has indeed made the governments position clear and he has made the governments opposition to the sibs draft regulations of may clear and for that we must be grateful <e> <s> i expect therefore that we shall see from the sib before we come to report stage revised draft regulations which reflect the attitude of the government in this matter which is one which has the full support of her majestys opposition <e> <s> if we do not see revised draft regulations which reflect these views we shall of course take appropriate steps to see that the proper protection for investors is written into the bill <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have already indicated our intention to seek to secure an effective and adequate cooling off period or cancellation period for unsolicited calls <e> <s> it would not in any way strengthen our argument if the definition of unsolicited calls were to be too wide and if the situation as expressed by noble lords opposite of the customer in a bank managers office were to be included <e> <s> therefore subject to the answer the government give in general we are in support of this amendment <e>", "<cs> we have not put down an amendment to clause although unsolicited calls is a matter of very great concern to us because i may have failed to secure them we have not seen the <e>", "<cs> i am of course sympathetic to the idea that disqualification should not be a punishment but should be a protection for investors <e> <s> i was and am aware of the possibility of a revocation <e> <s> i am still somewhat at a loss to understand what it is that a disqualified person may do to show after what period of time he becomes fit again to be employed on investment business <e> <s> it seems to me that the revocation procedure could end up by being somewhat clumsy and in many cases this could be avoided by a definite period of disqualification rather <e>", "<cs> no one could have less knowledge of the law and less experience of gaming than i but i had always thought that the enforcement of gaming contracts was exacted by taking out a contract on the life of somebody <e>", "<cs> the minister chose to make his reply to my introduction of the amendment principally in terms of a criticism of the word representatives <e> <s> that was not his response to my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> i recognise that fact but if he wishes to maintain the position that this is not a quibble i believe it is really a quibble then he should have suggested some way in which the government could have given ground on the substantive point rather than by criticising the wording of the amendment on the matter of the representativeness <e> <s> i remind the minister that a representative is not a <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord taylor he has put a number of weighty additional arguments in favour of the general case that is being made in amendments nos <e> <s> and however since i had already indicated my willingness to withdraw the amendment and since <e>", "<cs> it must be said that that was a series of exceptionally unsatisfactory replies from the government in the first place it is true that the sib in its document indicates that it proposes to set up an ombudsman scheme but i note from paragraph that subscription to the scheme would be voluntary that the board does not intend to make this a requirement <e> <s> that must be unsatisfactory because therefore it need not be compehensive and will certainly not provide public and universal assurance that justice will be done to those using financial services <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord williams on a recent amendment found himself moving towards the government position as he listened to the argument and read the amendment <e> <s> i find myself in the opposite position <e> <s> when i read the amendment itself and the notes on the new clause i felt it was relatively harmless but i confess that i am concerned with the idea that the same degree of flexibility should be given to insurance companies with respect to long-term policies as is being given to unit trusts <e> <s> those who put money with insurance companies in long-term policies are not the same as those who invest in unit trusts <e> <s> those who invest in unit trusts are very conscious not only that they are investing but also that they are investing in a particular kind of unit trust which may have different objectives as between income and growth and almost certainly will have explicit policies about the kind of investments that will be made <e> <s> those who put money <e>", "<cs> i have to preface any remarks by saying as my noble friends have on previous new clauses that these are extremely complex matters it is difficult for us with our resources fully to comprehend them when they are first presented and despite the lucid explanation we have had from the noble lord for which i am grateful we have to reserve our position for a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has nothing to apologise for <e> <s> he set out very clearly the case for what is the central amendment in his group amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i say right at the outset that with the reservations i shall express we are in favour of this amendment and are opposed to the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord ezra which would fatally weaken the proposal for a central compensation fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i take this opportunity to welcome the noble lord to the dispatch box for the first time on this bill although he has i know been answering questions previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i described the amendment as a probing one <e> <s> i did not intend to accuse the government of being lazy or indifferent with their drafting <e> <s> they have been enormously conscientious and gone to great lengths with the drafting <e> <s> i had hoped to bring the government a little more out their shell and that they would express an opinion about the appropriateness of cooling-off periods under certain circumstances <e> <s> to that extent the minister has been helpful <e> <s> he has given some examples of cases where longer or shorter cooling-off periods might be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness care to remind the house that the education act provides for religious instruction and collective worship <e> <s> would she not agree that what has happened in the past years has been enormously to the benefit of religious education in that the range of religious faiths among the parents and children in our schools has increased very greatly <e> <s> is that not a benefit for religious education rather than a disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i can scarcely say that i am disappointed by the ministers reply since as he said he gave his reply in virtually the same terms of tuesday night <e> <s> but i have to say that i am disappointed by the replies he has made both on that occasion and on this occasion because his replies sit uneasily in the mouth of a government who claim to be protecting the interests of the small investors <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to confirm the support of her majestys loyal opposition for the strongest possible industry-wide compensation scheme that can be achieved and to indicate that if these amendments are taken to the vote i shall be asking my noble friends to accompany me into the government lobby on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to welcome this amendment <e> <s> it seems to tighten the nature of the trust on which clients money is held <e> <s> as the house will observe from the amendment which follows immediately afterwards and on which i hope that we might have the support of the noble lord lord hacking we are very concerned that there should be both adequate accounting and adequate recompense if in any way a client should lose out on either the capital or the interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i find that argument deeply unconvincing both in terms of the words which are in the bill and in terms of the arguments which the noble lord has put forward <e> <s> this is one of those cases where in order for the law to be effective and understood it is necessary for everybody to be in no doubt that it is the clients interests and the investors interests which are paramount <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the noble lords arguments <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government not agree that the question of the retention of good university staff goes beyond the question of salaries to the funding of universities as a whole <e> <s> universities cannot be funded with widely varying support from year to year <e> <s> they do not recruit staff year by year they do not maintain their premises year by year and they do not have their students year by year <e> <s> will the noble baroness not agree that unless the government can give security of funding into the future there will be no long-term solution to the recruitment of first-class university staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baronesses will not think i have been churlish in failing to respond to the amendments which as the government have said have been made in response to opposition pressure <e> <s> however we appreciate the way in which the government have taken account of the views expressed by the various opposition parties on this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to delay the house or to prolong the debate <e> <s> in any reply that the minister wishes to make to the noble baroness lady cox will she bear in mind that in surveys per cent <e> <s> of parents have expressed their satisfaction with the sex education in schools given to their children <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be the only opportunity available to those of us who voted by a small majority in favour of the abolition of corporal punishment to take note of this fact and also to recognise that by an even smaller majority another place came to the same conclusion <e> <s> the government have accepted the verdict of both houses in the amendment now proposed <e> <s> we must be grateful to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is certainly right in saying that there have been a number of very unfortunate and unhappy occasions recently on which there have been breaches of freedom of speech in our universities and colleges <e> <s> it must be common ground among all members of your lordships house that this is not an acceptable state of affairs and that every effort must be made to ensure that it does not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of constitutional conflict <e> <s> the noble viscount the leader of the house himself said that since there had been no opportunity to consider this matter earlier on third reading we would now have a full opportunity to consider and if necessary to amend the legislation proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we must express our gratitude to the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we welcome it to the limited extent that it is apparent that the secretary of state has won what purports to be a battle in cabinet with some of his cabinet colleagues and has achieved expenditure levels that his predecessor was not able to achieve <e> <s> that leads us inevitably to ask the government why the money was not made available two years ago <e> <s> why have we had to suffer this long period of disruption in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness be good enough to clarify two points arising out of previous questions <e> <s> first my noble friend lord houghton said that these conditions were negotiable <e> <s> i read the statement to mean that they were not negotiable in any way <e> <s> i wonder whether she can confirm that is the case <e> <s> secondly the noble viscount lord eccles referred to this as a deal <e> <s> as i read the statement there is no deal <e> <s> the deal has to be made between the unions and the local authority employers <e> <s> this is simply an ultimatum made by the government of the conditions on which the government are prepared to allocate a modest amount of taxpayers money and a very large amount of ratepayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords even if the noble baroness cannot answer it now i should like her to write to me about this <e> <s> the statement says that the secretary of state will <e>", "<cs> and here my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly is suggested that there is an anomaly between the treatment of tertiary colleges and sixth form colleges <e> <s> i have never heard a more feeble brief read better in this house in all the time i have been here <e> <s> the point that was made not only in another place but here was <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful to your lordships house to know that we are talking about mr david selbourne <e> <s> can the noble baroness confirm that the contract of employment for academic staff at ruskin college in contrast to many other academic institutions guarantees the freedom of expression of points of view by academic staff <e> <s> is it not the case that the college has imposed no disciplinary action of any kind on mr selbourne <e> <s> is it not also the case that any attempt at collective action by students to boycott mr selbournes lectures has been opposed forcefully by the college authorities <e> <s> in those circumstances does the noble baroness consider that there is any strength at all in the case made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the opposition welcome the answer she gave to the main question welcome the special inspection which she has announced and agree with what has been said about the abuse of power by the council of the london borough of brent <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that my deepest suspicions are aroused when a government minister says that something is a modest measure <e> <s> so often have we found in the past that modest measures carry within them unexpressed or unexplained disadvantages <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to go behind the very lucid explanation for which we are most grateful given by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there is no breach of this undertaking if the labour party says that there should be no particular fiscal advantages to those pupils who go to independent schools <e> <s> would the minister agree that her majestys government are also bound by the provisions of the united nations universal declaration of human rights which says that education shall be directed to the full development of human personality <e> <s> is it not difficult to conceive how that can be achieved if there is a system of apartheid in our education provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness not agree that these laudable objectives would be better secured if the government were to refrain from their hamfisted attempt to intervene in the teachers pay negotiations which are rapidly approaching a successful conclusion and to withdraw the teachers

governments particular view of the events of the past two years in our education service <e> <s> indeed if it were not presented as a crisis measure it is difficult to conceive how your lordships could ever be asked to agree to the elimination of negotiating rights on the part of the employers and the workers in per cent <e> <s> of the public sector in this country <e> <s> that is what the bill means no more and no less <e>", "<cs> my lords will the right reverend prelate permit me to intervene <e> <s> in accordance with common trade union negotiating procedures all unions maintain

teachers <e> <s> does the right reverend prelate agree that that which would be the result of common negotiation procedures is likely to be achieved only when there is real negotiation rather than

service what then is the pressure for this bill <e> <s> presumably what he is saying is that the pprs already keeps the pharmaceutical companies costs to the national health service down to reflect

amendments down earlier than last thursday morning <e> <s> i should have preferred to put them down earlier <e> <s> however during virtually the whole of the period since second reading and my lack of vocal chords is testimony to that i have been talking with the teachers and with the employers organisations in a successful effort to reach the highest common factor of agreement between them in a

purpose of the series of amendments is to build on the advances that have been made in agreement about negotiating procedure and to remove the obstacles to them which exist <e>", "<cs> the opposition

advisory committee which is contained in clause shall be subject to an order <e>", "<cs> but these orders could be many months apart <e> <s> the constitution and the setting up of the committee takes place at one time the committee then deliberates and the decision of the committee is communicated to the secretary of state <e> <s> if the secretary of state then agrees with the committees decisions he uses the negative resolution procedure and if he disagrees he uses the affirmative procedure <e> <s> these amendments concern what happens when the committee is constituted and not when it reports <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the minister will confirm that the noble lord lord elton is correct in his interpretation of the text of the bill and that my amendment no <e> <s> a does require that each time the secretary of state gives directions to the committee there should be the order procedure <e> <s> however if the secretary of state has any concern whatsoever for the stability and self-respect of the education system in this country surely he is not going to be constantly giving directions to his own advisory committee <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister should have been driven to over-react in that way <e> <s> the use of the word fatuous regarding amendments seriously moved and seriously debated for a number of hours in the committee is unusual to say the least <e> <s> i can only assume that the noble lord has been driven to it by the tunnel vision from which he suffers in relation to the negotiations that have taken place over the past year <e> <s> of course it is true that burnham as such the official machinery has not come up with a way to deal with pay and conditions of service at the same time <e> <s> that is excluded by the legal statutory constitution of burnham <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee <e> <s> we dealt with this amendment as a consequential amendment to an earlier amendment <e> <s> but it is proper to ask the government what they mean by persons <e> <s> does that mean two persons other than the minimum of five and the maximum of nine who have <e>", "<cs> the phrase knowledge of or experience in does not mean <e>", "<cs> the noble lords first question deserves a reply though i do not think that his second observation deserves a comment <e> <s> the answer is that unless the amendments were to say specifically oral representations that is not what is meant <e> <s> representations in writing would fulfil the requirements of the amendments <e> <s> the advisory committee would be well advised just as the committees of this place are well advised to read the written submissions made to it to consider whether there are any points on which it would wish to seek any oral evidence and which it would wish to discuss with those who have something to say to them and to consider also the status of those putting forward representations <e> <s> it may then wish to invite oral evidence <e> <s> that i believe in the traditions of this place would improve the quality of the committees debate <e> <s> we do not require that that should be provided for on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to hear a rather different tone in the reply of the noble lord from that which has prevailed in preceding amendments <e> <s> what he has said deserves close study <e> <s> i would have wished the noble lord to say that the secretary of state would in the terms of reference which he alone has the right to give to the advisory committee indicate that they ought to be listening to evidence and representations from teachers employers voluntary schools and parents <e> <s> before the next stage of the bill the noble lord might like to consider whether he would be willing to indicate that that is what the secretary of state would do <e> <s> it would be enormously helpful and might simplify the proceedings later on <e>", "<cs> having referred to the matter in dealing with the previous amendment we considered i can on this occasion invite the government to go a little further with regard to parents organisations <e> <s> i appreciate that the parents organisations have no formal concern with teachers pay and conditions as do the employers the teachers unions and indeed the voluntary schools <e> <s> however the whole thrust of the governments thinking over the past couple of years has surely been to involve parents more strongly in the governance of our schools <e> <s> in particular with the passage of the act parents have a position as of right in governing bodies and will be concerned with the way in which conditions of service pan out in practice <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that there is something special about the interests of the local education authorities and the teachers and governors of voluntary schools in the pay and conditions of teachers <e> <s> all i can say is that you could have fooled us because the whole import of this bill is to take away any real influence on the pay and conditions of teachers from the employers and the teachers themselves <e>", "<cs> that reply shows an astonishing lack of understanding not only of the amendment for which the noble lord can be forgiven but also of the governments own bill <e> <s> so far as concerns the amendment it is the intention to give a further opportunity for negotiations to replace the work of the advisory committee <e> <s> it must be common ground that the negotiations are better than an advisory committee <e> <s> we may make our own judgment about whether it is necessary now to establish an advisory committee on the grounds that the negotiations have broken down <e> <s> but when this interim bill comes to an end there will have to be negotiations again because they are better because negotiations are the only ones that recognise the interests involved and because negotiations are the only form of settlement which will be accepted and recognised by the employers and teachers <e>", "<cs> i am quite satisfied with the governments version <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted for the noble lord to answer i did not say at some length <e>", "<cs> i think it would be helpful if i replied to that straight away <e> <s> the amendment does not take away responsibility from the secretary of state <e> <s> it makes it his responsibility by altering may to shall to make provision by statutory instrument giving effect to the recommendations of the committee <e> <s> if there is no modification proposed by agreement between the teachers and the employers the secretary of state has the same responsibility to give effect to the recommendations of the committee <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee have never been in blank cheque country wherever that may be and we do not intend to be now <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord lord elton has raised a valid point about which the government are unsure as to whether the provision means what he thinks <e>", "<cs> consultation can have a number of different meanings which is why we prefer negotiation to consultation <e> <s> however even a wide variety of parent organisations does not seem to us to be all that unacceptable <e> <s> consultation does not have any great statutory significance <e> <s> it means that you acknowledge what people write to you and you say that you will take it into account <e> <s> i have known that happen from the government front bench on more than one occasion during the passage of legislation in this place <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his courtesy in expounding my amendments which i passed over in defence of my voice and in recognition of the hour of the evening <e> <s> however he explained them cogently and clearly <e> <s> i thought that he put a rather good case for them <e> <s> i am sorry that the conclusion to which he came was not in accordance with the arguments that he put forward <e>", "<cs> dare i tempt a thunderbolt from above in the absence of any bishop by saying that of course the governors of voluntary schools are the employers of teachers in voluntary schools <e> <s> they do not actually pay them it is the local authorities who pay them <e> <s> but we do not oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise not only to support the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson but also because i have a sneaking wish to see the burgundy book on teachers pay and conditions available in the printed paper office of this chamber <e> <s> i do not know whether anybody has seen it and knows how lengthy it is but it would be a valuable addition to noble lords reading matter <e>", "<cs> my amendment is no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is an error in the marshalled list <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was originally down in my name and i had intended to have it struck off on friday <e> <s> if the committee takes the amendment as not moved in my name perhaps it will facilitate matters <e>", "<cs> i am not disputing that this is the right way to proceed but i think it is now necessary to put down a marker <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> falls if amendment no <e> <s> is carried because the wording is imperfect <e> <s> i say in amendment no <e>", "<cs> i think all members of the committee share the governments wish for any award made this year to be agreed as soon as possible so that teachers may know what it is they can expect and if they are anything like me and have already spent any award they need not wait too long to repay the debts that they have incurred <e> <s> but i am surprised at the noble lords interpretation of the difference in time between the negative and affirmative resolution procedures because both procedures are surely subject to the scrutiny of the joint committee <e> <s> in that there is no difference <e>", "<cs> as this is a matter of fact and i should not like to be in conflict with the noble lord on this matter i did not say that they were represented on the njc but that they were not represented in burnham and the njc which is what the amendment requires <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i think i should take an opportunity to apologise for misinterpreting my brief <e> <s> i did not understand that these other unions were members of burnham as well as the informal national joint council <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has moved this group of amendments with characteristic wisdom moderation and indeed lucidity <e> <s> i worry only that he has made it too easy for the government to go for the simple and least commitment possible and to gain the acceptance of the committee at very little cost <e> <s> although i believe that the noble lords analysis of the situation was precise and exact i agree with every word that he said i should not wish the committee to feel that the opposition would be satisfied simply with a change from negative resolution to affirmative resolution <e> <s> that change would be desirable and we would not vote against it in any way <e> <s> however it would not achieve the fundamental desire behind this group of amendments which is to secure that the government enact what they say they are enacting a temporary bill <e>", "<cs> again before the noble lord formally withdraws amendment no <e> <s> one or two points should be made about the situation in which we find ourselves <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson has achieved an important victory <e> <s> he has secured the agreement of the government to a concession which goes some way and i shall qualify that in due course towards the recognition that the proposals under the bill for the determination of teachers pay and conditions cannot be a permanent solution for any serious length of time <e> <s> he has achieved recognition of the sovereignty of parliament in that the affirmative resolution procedure has been recognised by the government as appropriate for any continuation of a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> i think it would be a pity for the committee to decide on this amendment without dealing with two misapprehensions which have recently arisen in the debate <e> <s> the first is that of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who seems to think because we had a debate in which we considered three options in what i thought was a reasonably rational way and yet had to have votes going for or against single options that that is no reason for us to consider each of those options in turn after the general debate <e> <s> that is what we are now doing <e>", "<cs> on the contrary the committee is now being asked to improve on the decision which we took a few minutes ago <e>", "<cs> the second misapprehension is that raised by the noble lord lord beloff who seemed to think that negotiations would be prolonged if there was the prospect of being the edge of the cliff so to speak <e> <s> my experience <e>", "<cs> that intervention is helpful and soundly based <e> <s> the conclusion one must draw therefore is that the government would not resist the idea of the secretary of state seeking representations from these bodies or such of these bodies as he thinks fit before making a decision about the extension of the act <e> <s> is that what is in the mind of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if it was not in his mind the force of his argument is somewhat diminished but it raises the possibility of a more appropriate amendment being put forward at a later stage <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed to hear that reply <e> <s> i do not think that the publication of <e>", "<cs> it is better if i respond before the minister replies <e>", "<cs> clearly it is the individual local authorities who raise the rates but through their associations they take part in the settlement on the level and distribution of teachers pay <e> <s> it is that part in the national settlement of teachers pay which is being taken away in this bill and which leaves the government open to the charge of forcing local authorities to raise taxes for a purpose over which they have no responsibility <e> <s> i am not suggesting any solution at this stage but i am saying that that issue must be faced <e>", "<cs> the amendment was clearly defective as has been pointed out but it was necessary to put something down in order to secure the statement which the minister has made and for which we are all grateful <e> <s> it is important that everybody should know that if a settlement is imposed under the conditions of this bill the government will ensure that they not only pay their share of the settlement and we have an assurance on that but also that the ratepayers share of the settlement will be recognised as legitimate expenditure by local authorities and that it will not affect their grant-related expenditure assessment or contribute in any way to the rate-capping process <e>", "<cs> we also thank the minister for giving effect to the concession that was made yesterday <e> <s> i have only one question <e> <s> it is clear that the government are determined to retain the power to carry on these so-called interim procedures beyond <e> <s> they are determined to retain those powers because they do not have any confidence in their ability to achieve what is necessary by <e> <s> i assume that when they continue the procedures after they will take the word interim out of the title of the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> i think it is right that i should intervene because as has been pointed out if this amendment is carried my amendment no <e> <s> will fall <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord beloff said i did not think that the noble lord was being particularly radical or adventurous in his proposal <e> <s> i thought that it was not much to ask that a committee which already suffers the indignity of being appointed entirely by the secretary of state but much more important the indignity of reporting to the secretary of state who may ignore change or accept its conclusions at will should have some little gesture of independence and be able to appoint its own chairman <e>", "<cs> once again the noble baroness has given me an opportunity to express my admiration for the work of the department of education and science and my confidence in their integrity and objectivity <e> <s> however that is not to say that the department of education and science is necessarily the right department of state to provide a <e>", "<cs> as always when speaking from this dispatch box on a private members bill i wish to state that there are certain matters on which i speak in a personal capacity and certain matters which i believe are matters of the policy of my party and on which i shall not speak in a personal capacity <e>", "<cs> the issue of the starting date of the effect of the bill is very much an issue of the cost to the national health service <e> <s> we are talking about a finite period of time in any case and if that finite period is <e>", "<cs> i shall gladly give way <e> <s> if my noble friend wants to make comments from a sedentary position that is his privilege <e> <s> i shall give way to him if he wishes his comments to be put into the record <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that my intervention has encouraged my noble friend to say a little more about the evidence for and against the assertion that there will be no significant increase in cost to the national health service <e> <s> i listened with care to what he said about the report of the henley centre for forecasting <e> <s> i would be the first to admit not only that it has been commissioned by parties who have a pecuniary interest in the matter but also that it has been produced in a great deal of hurry <e> <s> the point that must be made is that it is the only analysis that has been published on this matter <e>", "<cs> it would be improper to continue a duellogue between my noble friend and myself <e> <s> i shall not do that <e> <s> i have a very thick skin <e> <s> however much i may resent some of his remarks and the motives which he imputes to me i think it would be improper for me to pursue them at this dispatch box <e> <s> in regard to the international comparison that he makes i say merely that for example the united states retains only a -year patent life and that in germany the patent life before was only years although it has now been increased to years <e>", "<cs> my noble friend makes remarks about my awareness of the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> two weeks ago i knew very little about the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> since then i have learnt a great deal and what i have learnt is not very much to the credit of many of the people concerned <e>", "<cs> how do the government regard the million to million which the association of the british pharmaceutical industry considers as being its worst case <e> <s> does the noble lord consider that to be realistic <e>", "<cs> then why is the bill being promoted <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments are extremely complex <e> <s> i have no doubt that your lordships house could spend many happy hours analysing and re-analysing the syntax the references to previous legislation and the suitability of the appearance of certain words on the face of the bill and all the other things with which we occupy ourselves in matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will forgive me i did not attribute to the noble lord the view that they should not be altered in committee <e> <s> what the noble lord implied was that no new substantial amendments should be brought forward at report stage <e>", "<cs> was the noble lord present at the proceedings on the financial services bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been four strands in this interesting debate <e> <s> i refer to strands from the other side of the house <e> <s> my noble friends will forgive me if i merely thank them for their contributions as i do the noble baroness lady seear rather than go into detail on what they said <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point made by the noble lord and i value his contribution <e> <s> i simply say in reassurance that the amendments which would be required at third reading would be extremely simple since they would take out two clauses <e> <s> no major amendment would be required in any other respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two answers to that point <e> <s> first i should have thought that the secretary of state would only want to use that reserve power as a last resort and that is the way it is expressed in the bill <e> <s> secondly it is interesting that the noble lord has no faith in the legislation of his own government over the past eight years on the control of local authority expenditure <e> <s> after all there are the provisions not only for setting targets and grant-related expenditure allowances but also for rate capping which could come into play if there were any proposals to use local authority expenditure in favour of teachers at the expense of central government expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said i propose that as a last resort there ought to be a control on all government expenditure and it is that which is provided for in the amendment <e> <s> it is the noble lord who lacks faith in his own governments legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the kind of chaos that i envisage and i do not look forward to it with any pleasure is that of posts for which there is provision not being filled and teachers not able to do the work that they are there to do because of the imposition in a great hurry as it would have to be of a completely new structure <e> <s> that is the danger that i foresee <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a distinction between negotiation anybody can negotiate and negotiating rights which obviously has not become clear to the noble lord <e> <s> the distinction and the right that the teachers want to preserve is the right to have negotiations and therefore inevitably the right for their negotiations to have effect <e> <s> that is being taken away by this bill and it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord monkswell <e> <s> i share his hope that the government will be able to give the reassurance that he seeks and that it is not intended to have a kitty of merit payments solely in the hands of the head teacher <e> <s> apart from any other consideration i am convinced that such a proposal if carried out it is difficult to see from the secretary of states previous statements whether that is the intention would be bitterly resisted by the head teachers themselves <e> <s> nobody would be more reluctant to take sole responsibility for giving our merit payments than a head teacher <e> <s> if the government intend that there shall be a more formalised way of rewarding merit other than by promotion we shall have to listen to that with our usual care <e> <s> however the fear that my noble friend has raised is one which deserves to be dispelled and i hope that the government will be able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that in the strictest sense one could argue that this is a technical amendment because the words are recognisable because we have seen these words elsewhere and because we know as the noble lord says that they have been accepted by teachers and employers alike as being proper matters for discussion proper matters for negotiation proper matters on which decisions have ultimately to be reached when considering teachers pay and conditions <e> <s> on that basis we are not disposed to oppose the amendments but i am bound to say that the kind of agreement which is reached by teachers and their employers in the context of free collective bargaining is by no means the same kind of agreement as that which might be reached in the context of an imposed order which is what the government are proposing in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter found my unaccustomed silence had a sinister ring <e> <s> let me assure him that i only delayed intervening in the debate despite the fact that my name was on the amendment because i believed and i still believe that it is in the governments best interests to accept these amendments and until the last minute i still had hoped that they were going to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the power to continue the bill by affirmative resolution is taken away then all of the thrust must be for government not to run up against the final deadline <e> <s> all of the thrust must be for the government the employers and the teachers to reach an early conclusion and to take this matter away from the political arena <e> <s> that is the fundamental truth behind the arguments of the noble lord lord henderson and it is shared by those of us who are opposed to the bill while we recognise his support for the general precepts of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that response although i note that it does not go as far in confidence that we are not in breach of the conventions than earlier government statements in that she recognised that there could be a possibility of appeal to the international labour office in geneva <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble lord lord beloff for the comic relief <e> <s> i think he was ascribing the comedy to me but i am sure he is much more skilled than i am in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should love to make a long speech but i do not know how <e> <s> the only point i can make is that it is about time too <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that his words of praise for the department of transportation namely that it is in the forefront of these matters will be received with great pleasure at the university of birmingham <e> <s> however if that is the case why is it under threat <e>", "<cs> my lords the opposition support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the reasons for it that he has given <e> <s> we should be prepared to support him if he proposed to take the matter further failing a satisfactory reply from the government <e> <s> but it must be said that this amendment raises a very important anomaly to which inadequate attention has been given in the lengthy consideration of this bill <e> <s> that is that the system of determination of pay and conditions of service proposed by the government between now and and possibly further on than that is a classic example of taxation without representation <e> <s> the local education authorities which if this amendment is accepted or if adequate assurances are given will be responsibile for the actual employment of the teachers will have no say in the way in which their pay and conditions of service are determined <e> <s> of course the ratepayers who are responsible for per cent <e> <s> of the cost of teachers pay will have no say either <e> <s> it is central government which is responsible only for per cent <e> <s> of the pay which has a complete power of determination both of pay and of conditions of service <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards amendment no <e> <s> i am not at all convinced by the ministers arguments <e> <s> it is certainly true that the affirmative resolution procedure provides that a draft resolution shall be laid before parliament and that a government minister shall have to stand up and defend it <e> <s> i was making the point that that was not necessarily the best way for the general public who have shown a great deal of interest let alone the education service itself to be fully informed about the issues to be given the governments arguments and reasoning in writing before the debate takes place and therefore to take an informed view on the matters before both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite have made some play with what they describe as the distinction between the intentions of the amendment and the effects of the amendment <e> <s> i have listened carefully to all they have said and i accept that there ought not be a lack of congruity between intentions and effects <e> <s> but i wonder whether they have not misread the amendment <e> <s> these are proposals made by the secretary of state and all that is required is that they should involve <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be glad to give way to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway if i may first deal with the noble lord lord boyd-carptenter <e> <s> it is not our intention in this amendment to spell out every detail of the negotiating machinery <e> <s> we would not be thanked by the house if we tried to do that again <e> <s> we have been through that hoop and i suggest to your lordships that it would be inappropriate to do it now <e> <s> it is possible to combine the negotiations required by this amendment with a proper role for the secretary of state and if that is the case there is no reason on those grounds to oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no difficulty in facing up to it <e> <s> the word was chosen deliberately <e> <s> it is our intention to secure by this amendment that there shall be no long-term solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was kind enough to refer to me <e> <s> he has taught me a lesson <e> <s> he has taught me not to be so generous in my interpretation of the motives of government as i am naturally inclined to be <e> <s> i used the words interim temporary and breathing space because those are the words the government use <e> <s> the government persist in claiming that this is to be done only for a limited and fixed period of time during which the government will somehow come to an inspired longer-term solution for settling the pay and conditions of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have something to say about the intransigence and authoritarianism of the government in bringing forward and promoting this bill but it would be wrong for me not to preface my remarks with a tribute to the unfailing courtesy of the noble lord lord belstead and the noble baroness lady hooper in their presentation of the case however defective that case may have been <e> <s> it would also be wrong to deal with the issues in the bill without making reference to the ballots taking place in the major teacher unions <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has expressed the hope that the government might take these ballots and possible strikes into account when considering what to do about the current pay round <e> <s> i hope that they will not <e> <s> in my view and here i echo the views of my noble friend lord murray the actions of the teachers in this matter which i do not support are the actions of those who are desperate to make their voices heard <e>", "<cs> my lords the house and the country owe the noble lord lord sherfield and his colleagues a great deal for the signal service that they have performed <e> <s> they must feel as i do that it cannot simply be an accident that the business managers have chosen that the debate should take place so late and that so much of it should take place without the benefit of television cameras <e> <s> i make no apology for saying that it is a debate that ought to be at the forefront of political discussion politics in the widest sense <e> <s> i do not believe that this is a technical matter <e> <s> i believe that it is a matter on which the survival of our society depends <e> <s> that is what i take politics in the best sense to be about <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness lady hooper for repeating the statement made by her right honourable friend <e> <s> it is necessary to say at once that we recognise the reasonable tone of the secretary of states proposals and indeed the extent to which the noble baroness has moved away from the statement of th october towards the position agreed in the acas talks and subsequently agreed at the burnham committee on the th january <e> <s> but is it not the case that had the secretary of state been as reasonable and adaptable on th october last year we might have been very much closer to an agreement without the need for the imposition of the teachers pay and conditions act <e> <s> indeed is it not the case that had the secretary of state or his predecessor been prepared to make the same sort of money available two years ago when the round of negotiations started we could have been spared the extreme unpleasantness and pain in our schools over the period up to may <e> <s> is it not the case that it is the successive secretaries of state who have been responsible for the problems in our schools rather than those actually working in the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to be able to take part in this debate and even more a privilege to listen to the speeches which we have heard this evening <e> <s> this has been the best kind of debate in your lordships house <e> <s> it was introduced by the noble lord lord ritchie in a spirit of inquiry rather than in a spirit of controversy <e> <s> he has been asking for information from the government about the implementation of the provisions of the act <e> <s> he has not been doing it in any other sense than of concern for those who suffer from dyslexia <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has answered the letter of my noble friends question but she has not answered the spirit of it <e> <s> have not the government taken great exception to local authorities in particular labour-controlled authorities using public money to express controversial political views <e> <s> is it not now the case that the possession of nuclear weapons in this country despite what the noble lord lord nugent says is a matter of genuine disagreement among people <e> <s> is it therefore not wrong for the ministry of defence to spend money putting forward one particular point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a danger that we are playing with words here <e> <s> will the noble baroness not accept that in the past months birkbeck has been under exceptional financial strain and exceptional financial threat <e> <s> under those circumstances to quibble over whether the word exempt is the right one is not appropriate <e> <s> surely part-time students should be entitled to mandatory grants for their tuition in the same way as full-time students <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness recognise that concerns have been expressed this afternoon from a number of quarters in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness be good enough to answer the question of my noble friend lord graham and confirm that to the best of her knowledge no action has been taken in haringey to promote positive images of gay and lesbian people and certainly not without the agreement of all concerned <e> <s> does she also agree that there is a very long path between election manifestos and implementation of those manifestos whichever party they come from <e> <s> will she accept that the consultation which has to take place in haringey between the local education authority and the teachers and the governors is likely to lead to very considerable further delays before any conclusion is reached <e>", "<cs> my lords may i

been expressed about the damaging effects of distruption on our schoolchildrens education and that we wish to see every effort made to bring the action to an end <e> <s> will the noble baroness also acknowledge that local education authorities are doing their best to minimise any disruption caused by this action <e> <s> for example the inner london education authority has told all teachers that

salaries <e> <s> i am sure that that is most welcome <e> <s> however does she not agree that the full amount of the increase in the science budget which was announced on st april of this year with the exception of the special amount for aids will be taken up by the increase in salaries leaving no room at all for additional projects <e> <s> if i am wrong about that will the noble baroness tell us how much money will actually be available for new research projects over and above the additional costs of salaries <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will recognise that she gave no answer to my previous question <e> <s> perhaps i may put it more precisely <e> <s> what increase is expected in the proportion of research projects which are alpha-rated by the research councils as a result of increases in the science budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i know that it is not the tradition to interrupt in this house <e> <s> i was listening to him with some attention <e> <s> would he say that the continuing demand for courses at the open university for example which was not only high at the beginning but has continued throughout its life would have been anticipated <e> <s> would he say that a knowledge of what is available is a significant factor in assessing future demand and that the expectation that the thrust will always come from the bottom is not always true <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is true that in terms of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken part in too many late night debates not to be well aware that nobody is more unpopular than the mover of a motion of this sort who actually speaks at length at the end of the debate <e> <s> all that i am required to do which i do with a great deal of pleasure is to thank all speakers who have taken part in the debate and to express my regret that so few of the excellent speeches have been on subjects other than higher education and in particular on the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness on the new status in which she addresses questions of education and science from that dispatch box <e> <s> in so far as aids research is carried out in institutions of higher education would she care to confirm as has been discussed on a number of occasions in this house that most of the so-called increase in finance to institutions of higher education for research purposes is in fact being taken up by increased salaries rather than allowing for increased real expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble baroness was not in her place at the time yesterday afternoon but i should like to ask if she has had an opportunity to read the devastating speech made by her noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> the speech attacked the department of education and science proposals for the contract funding of our universities <e> <s> will she agree that nothing can be more calculated to spread alarm and despondency among our academic research community than the proposals to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for making that statement to the house i must first of all declare a relatively minor interest in that both mirror group newspapers and bpcc who were also bidders for the <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a supplementary question the noble lord implied that there were members of this house who would have felt differently about the matter if another bidder had been successful in the hid for this newspaper <e> <s> let me make it absolutely clear that the oppositions view would have been exactly the same had the successful bidder been mr robert maxwell and that we are opposed to the concentration of power in the newspaper industry regardless of who the bidder is <e> <s> i hope that he will recognise that that is the view of all members of the opposition and that we show no fear or favour in this matter as between one newspaper proprietor and another <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should not apologise <e> <s> the deadline of four oclock was imposed by the purchasers not by the vendors <e> <s> both those deadlines have been forced on the government and the government have given way to both <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak on the question and to thank the noble lord lord bonham-carter for introducing it i must repeat the declaration of interest that i made last wednesday in that mirror group newspapers one of the under-bidders for news uk as i undertand it has been and is a client of mine <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me i complained about the fact that the secretary of state was not here and that his right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster was opening the debate in another place <e> <s> the noble lord is virtually reading from the same brief that the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster used in another place <e> <s> there are differences of words and differences in the language that mr clarke used but we are getting virtually the same story at second-hand both here and in another place <e> <s> that is surely unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way again <e> <s> he is quoting directly from col of yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down in view of his failure to give any explanation whatsoever for the absence of the secretary of state he and the house ought to know that through the usual channels we shall be seeking an opportunity to raise this matter again <e> <s> it cannot be acceptable to parliament that a matter of such importance is dealt with at second hand both in another place and in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a good and on a number of occasions a somewhat surprising debate and none the worse for that <e> <s> as the noble lord lord quinton said education is an issue where it is possible and certainly desirable for some of our thinking not to be along party lines <e> <s> we have been grateful for the contributions made on both sides which have not been strictly along party lines <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord peston for introducing the debate as he did in a speech of notable humanity <e> <s> it was indeed no less than i expected from a fellow member of the haringey association for the advancement of state education and a fellow parent at the same inner city comprehensive school <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness is able to give me the specific assurance i sought that those comprehensive schools which opt for grant maintained status will remain comprehensive and will not be allowed to charge school fees <e> <s> if that is the case then the comprehensive system around them is no longer comprehensive and so loses its meaning and much of its virtue <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers answer to the noble lord lord renton would he care to comment on the reports that the secretary of state for education and science has requested no fewer than extra civil servants to assist in the preparation and drafting of the forthcoming education bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to face the noble earl across the table on this first occasion <e> <s> i am sure that both he and i would rather be with the noble baroness lady hooper in nairobi than here <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i am sure that he will recognise that there is a great deal of agreement on this side of the house with the governments proposals on the issue of corporate status for polytechnics <e> <s> indeed there has been a great deal of agreement from local education authorities from the educational trade unions and from others involved in education <e> <s> quite apart from the white paper issued in april of this year that was a policy which was urged by the national advisory boards management review commissioned by the previous secretary of state for education <e> <s> on that matter there is no disagreement with the proposals or indeed with the means which are now sought to be used to achieve the desired ends <e>", "<cs> which ones <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a criticism of the timing of the statement <e> <s> in normal <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state in answering questions on this statement in the other place this afternoon was challenged on exactly this point <e> <s> he gave one name nottinghamshire <e> <s> was that name not available to the noble earl <e> <s> has he not had the same briefing material as the secretary of state in order to answer questions relating to the statement <e> <s> may i remind him that the statement itself says a small number of local authorities and it therefore invites that question <e> <s> is it not the responsibility of government as a whole to have the same briefing material the same possibility of an answer and the same possibility of satisfying the legitimate requirements of this house in this house as in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the leader of the house for that statement and for his usual courtesy and precision in making it <e> <s> i should like to assure him that i accept what he has said unreservedly and without any qualification or hesitation <e> <s> there are two further points which need to be made <e> <s> first in no sense were our comments yesterday intended as any personal criticism of the noble earl lord arran <e> <s> so far as we are concerned he played a perfectly straight bat and we have no complaint about his response to the question <e> <s> the issue as the noble viscount knows and he has said is wider than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter chose to rejoice in the result of a single by-election <e> <s> will the minister acknowledge that at the last election across the whole of the london borough of kingston-upon thames a majority of votes were cast for those parties the labour party and the alliance party which supported and still support the abolition of selective education <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will be good enough to confirm that she is speaking on this matter in a personal capacity from the dispatch box because it is the tradition on our side that we do not take an official view on private members bills <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this question refers in particular to london <e> <s> there are two kinds of problem in london one concerns the mainly labour boroughs which are seriously over-burdened and under-resourced to deal with homelessness and the other concerns conservative boroughs such as westminster which have no intention whatever of taking seriously their responsibilities with regard to the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be more seemly for the noble lord to start at the other end of the pelican <e> <s> is it not the case that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that there will be deep disappointment and also resentment not only in this country but also in the nordic countries and west <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation of the bill and i hasten to say from the outset that having agreed that it should pass through all its stages today we shall not oppose the introduction of the bill <e> <s> in particular we recognise that the revised definition of capital which is now to be in terms of the outstanding principle in other words the nett amount is a much more sensible definition than the one used in the past <e> <s> as regards the overall limits we recognise that the government having willed the end in terms of the establishment of urban development corporations must revise the means available to the udcs <e> <s> however the issue of urban development corporations is much more controversial than those concerning the scottish development agency which the house has just been considering <e> <s> the scottish development agency was set up with the enthusiastic support of local authorities in scotland and has achieved universal support not least today on all sides of the house for the work it has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to follow the noble lord with mixed feelings <e> <s> i must start by congratulating him sincerely on his new position and i hope that he will follow the example of his predecessor in introducing an element of moderation into cabinet <e> <s> i feel sure that he will do us proud in this house and represent our collective interests with great effect <e> <s> he is followed in the environment portfolio by the noble earl lord caithness who showed great skill in his conduct of the criminal justice bill earlier this session <e> <s> i am sure that he will show equal skill in environmental matters though i hope that he will show that skill to less effect <e> <s> but i shall look forward to facing him across the dispatch box on no doubt numerous occasions over the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite clearly repeating himself in order to tempt me to my feet <e> <s> the issue before the house is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be defensible if it were indeed the case <e> <s> but the noble lord has improved on previous statements about haringey by admitting that haringey borough council planned to introduce such positive images <e> <s> those plans were subject to negotiations with parents and governors <e> <s> as the noble lord might expect they have been widely disliked and resented <e> <s> the result has been that those plans have never been implemented and there is no immediate prospect of their being implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear that i am not in favour of the promotion of homosexuality <e> <s> that applies at haringey and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to say that the answer must be yes of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lords argument would be affected if i told him that not only the federal government but a large majority of state city and local governments in the united states are also equal opportunity employers <e> <s> they employ the same contract compliance conditions <e>", "<cs> one can well anticipate that the governments response will be that this amendment was spoken to last week and that it refers to a new clause which was voted down <e> <s> i am sure therefore that it would not be proper for us to proceed with a discussion of the amendment today <e> <s> however before that procedural point is made from the government front bench perhaps i may say this <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble baronesss pardon <e> <s> however the matter was disposed of in committee earlier <e> <s> before the government give that procedural answer <e> <s> i merely wish to take the opportunity to say how strongly i support the views of the noble baroness <e> <s> we shall take every opportunity to give expression to that support at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am satisfied that it is proper that he should look at it between now and a later stage <e> <s> on the basis of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find that reply disappointing and illogical because there is clearly a great difference between the time which is required by a contractor to request reasons for a decision and that required by a local authority <e> <s> after all there is not a great deal of research required by the contractor it is almost certainly the only obligation he has to himself <e> <s> he is not trying to deal at the same time with a whole number of appeals as the local authority will be and he does not have to do a great deal of work to prepare his submission <e> <s> i do not think that the argument that there is a natural equality <e>", "<cs> i indicated at second reading our dissatisfaction with the inclusion of part iii as a whole in the scope of the bill <e> <s> there is a comprehensive housing bill going through another place in which this part would much more readily have found a suitable position <e> <s> however we have it here with us and the question is whether we should go through it with a fine toothcomb and consider in detail the amendments which might be necessary <e> <s> we have taken the view that although we have a large number of amendments prepared it would not be appropriate to introduce them at this stage <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything that my noble friend has said <e> <s> i fear that in his response to my remarks the minister has given himself a great deal more work at report stage <e> <s> i am not satisfied with his analysis of part iii of the bill <e> <s> his claims regarding local authorities exploiting loopholes in existing legislation were made without any evidence <e> <s> they were not even assertions they were mere asseverations <e> <s> they do not deserve the respect of this committee without further evidence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and i shall certainly look into the case that he has raised <e> <s> in the meantime i do not think that it is appropriate to pursue opposition to the motion that this clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> first should like to confirm that it is our intention that all the amendments with the number and various combinations of letters of the alphabet should be dealt with together <e> <s> it is a happy tradition of this place that whether we design it that way or not debates on such matters are collapsed into single debates and we cover a wide range of amendments at the same time <e> <s> there are significant differences in the amendments but it is as well to deal with them at the same time especially as the debate was so well introduced by the noble lord lord hayter <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord somers that it has to be a two-way <e>", "<cs> the minister says that the government are only putting forward a single test the intention of the material <e> <s> but subsection of the act which is repeated on the face of the bill refers to the likely effect on those to whom it is directed <e> <s> it refers also unexceptionally to the content and style of the material <e> <s> the reference to the intention of the material is indeed highlighted by the words in particular but surely the minister would not deny that there is reference to the other tests in the clause he is supporting <e>", "<cs> i intervene at this stage from the dispatch box not in any way to inhibit my noble friends from further intervention nor anyone else who wishes to speak <e> <s> i do so because i think we are in danger now of having a debate on clause stand part rather than the amendment which is before us <e> <s> it is important that we should try our best to get back to that <e> <s> these are different issues <e> <s> it is not like the publicity issue which we were debating a couple of hours ago <e> <s> there are different issues involved and further amendments which deserve debate before we come to the clause stand part debate <e> <s> i should like to concentrate our attention on going back to the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord falkland and the noble lord lord henderson <e>", "<cs> i hope to expand on that matter in relation to this amendment and that what i say will be acceptable to my noble friend <e> <s> the benefit of this amendment on which we ought to concentrate as i see it is that it deals quite comprehensively and effectively with what the noble lord lord beloff charmingly called the infelicities of the wording of the amendment <e> <s> there are many things worse than infelicities <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i did not go so far as to accuse my noble friend of that <e> <s> however i know that there are people who take that view <e> <s> but what i would hope to persuade my noble friends and what my recommendation would be with all the strength that i can give to it is that this is a rational a reasonable a helpful and forward-looking amendment to the clause and that it deserves all the help it can get <e>", "<cs> i should be the last to question the credentials of the noble lord lord monson on this matter <e> <s> i certainly do not question his motives in bringing forward the amendment <e> <s> indeed i come back from australia as a recent convert to compulsory voting but i very much doubt whether it is really appropriate to introduce at this time and on this subject the entirely new principle of a majority of those qualified to vote rather than a majority of those actually voting <e> <s> there are very few local elections in which a majority of those entitled to vote vote on any side let alone for the winning side and to expect a majority of those entitled to vote to vote is a little unrealistic <e> <s> although the amendment is as the noble lord lord henderson says undoubtedly well meant and is a step in the right direction it is a minuscule step and i do not think it will help us very much <e>", "<cs> this is a very interesting intervention by the noble lord <e> <s> we have heard of him drafting bills for the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> is he now drafting government amendments <e>", "<cs> the government have dug themselves into a pit and every time the minister wriggles he sinks deeper into the mire <e> <s> for the first time he has attempted first of all to define promote <e> <s> he says that promote means to say that homosexuality is something over and above heterosexuality <e> <s> the minister has never said that before and it is an interesting thing for him to say <e> <s> it goes flatly counter to common english usage and it certainly demands more justification than it has had from the minister tonight <e> <s> he is now attempting to justify the use of the word homosexuality by defining the different objectives which local authorities may have in as he describes it promoting positive images <e> <s> there again the minister has got himself into very deep trouble because homosexuality as an abstract concept is not an adequate way to look at these various aspects of homosexual behaviour and homosexual acts including the representation of homosexual behaviour <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord campbell will allow me to speak first <e> <s> he has had two or three goes already on this amendment <e> <s> it seems that the longer the minister seeks to answer questions the more difficulties he encounters <e> <s> he has now raised a completely new concept namely the idea that a library has a range of books on different subjects and that if the library consists entirely of books about homosexuality it would be subject to challenge but not if homosexual books are only a part of its general range <e> <s> of course none of that appears anywhere in the clause but that is the interpretation which the minister offers us <e>", "<cs> we must be grateful to the noble lord for coming clean <e> <s> he rather reminds me of the mother whose child comes home and uses bad language <e> <s> in defence the child says why mustnt i use those words <e> <s> shakespeare uses them <e> <s> the mother says well you mustnt play with shakespeare any more <e>", "<cs> we have consistently questioned whether the phrase to promote homosexuality has any definable meaning and we persist in doubting that <e> <s> there cannot be an answer not that we are unwilling to give an answer to the noble lords question because the terms of that question are inappropriate <e> <s> if his question properly interpreted is whether a play of high literary merit is to be banned although it portrays homosexuality as an acceptable or as a pretended family relationship our answer would be that high artistic merit would defend it from the charge of promoting homosexuality and it ought not to be banned <e> <s> if that is not the governments position the government have really committed themselves should they accept the arguments of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to a position of censorship of the worst kind that i have heard in this chamber in the time that i have been here <e> <s> it raises <e>", "<cs> i am directly challenged <e> <s> i am content to let <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may refer to what my noble friend thought might be a hypothetical situation <e> <s> one of my closest friends is a lesbian and is living with the mother of a five year old child who has just started school <e> <s> the case which my noble friend has put is precisely that which is happening now in a school in north london <e> <s> is that young child a boy aged five to be told that what he sees as his family relationship is unacceptable <e> <s> is it to be prohibited that the truth should be told about the relationship which is that of a happy family <e> <s> it is clear from the way in which the bill is drafted that a description of that relationship is outlawed by this clause <e>", "<cs> it is promoting in a maintained school the acceptability of homosexuality as the pretended family relationship <e> <s> that is what it is doing <e>", "<cs> it may be the lateness of the hour but i thought that those were uncharacteristically weak rejoinders from both the noble lord lord renton and the minister <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton did nothing but assert his disagreement with my noble friend <e> <s> he gave no reasons for that disagreement and even misinterpreted the status of the articles of the european convention on human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not clear evidence that westminster city council is either unwilling or unable to exercise its responsibilities as a planning authority for such a sensitive site <e> <s> i do not wish to reopen in full the subject of the existence of the glc but i recall for the government that when a similar question arose under the glc about years ago concerning the dilapidation and possibly horrific replacement of westminster pier my noble friend lady denington bought the pier for the glc in order to avoid such a situation <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that the applicant in this matter should be sir christopher lever <e> <s> he is chairman of london <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> at no stage did i say that i was worried that it would affect their sensibilities <e> <s> what i was worried about was the child <e> <s> noble lords may have their own view about the propriety of a homosexual couple living together and about the propriety of a homosexual couple having a child <e> <s> what there can be no doubt about is that the interests of the child must be paramount <e> <s> this clause makes it impossible for teachers to tell the truth to a child about the acceptability of its own family <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow the argument of the noble lord <e> <s> i trust that the committee will not wish me to follow the tone in which the argument was put <e>", "<cs> i believe that that was what i said the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> the danger will be apparent to the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> the microphones are not working and we are having difficulty in hearing him <e>", "<cs> the degree of astonishment that i felt when these amendments were tabled has now been compounded by the brevity and undoubted clarity with which the minister puts them forward <e> <s> there is now proposed and after the second marshalled list the amendment was starred on the third marshalled list a new schedule which is well over two pages long on a totally new subject <e>", "<cs> before the matter is put to the vote let me thank the minister for those last remarks <e> <s> i assure him that it is always my policy to attack governments this government in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his remarks on amendments nos <e> <s> c d and e <e> <s> i realise that they go towards meeting what i am asking for in different degrees <e> <s> however on the basis of his assurances in respect of amendments nos <e> <s> c and d i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> c <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the noble lord lord ross to our deliberations at report stage <e> <s> he will already have learned two lessons <e> <s> first of all he will have learned that those who speak from the government back benches to conservative central office briefs do not always find that the briefs are particularly relevant to the amendments which are before the house <e> <s> his second lesson will have been that some noble lords on the conservative back benches do not like debate and want to find ways of curtailing it even at the expense of not allowing the minister to reply to specific points which have been raised in the course of debate and which deserve specific answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not to question the minister further and i wish to adhere to the new procedures which we are looking at for report stage but because there are matters which have been inadequately dealt with in the ministers reply <e> <s> we have been led astray to some extent by the well-informed historical analysis of the nature of legislation as it relates to disabled people <e> <s> it does not matter very much whether the act is the right way to set about tackling this problem as opposed to codes of practice brought forward by the manpower services commission <e> <s> the important fact is that which was stated by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth that the unemployment rates among disabled people are twice that among able-bodied people <e> <s> that is the fundamental fact we have to face <e>", "<cs> my lords three types of objections to these amendments have been put forward and i want to suggest to the house that they are all in their own ways either misconceived in matters of fact or misconceived in the interpretation of the amendments <e> <s> i hope that when he replies the minister will not feel it necessary to rely on some of the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made no attempt to answer the points i made about the strength of the governments commitment to inner city regeneration and their recognition of the necessity for employment for local people which is local labour is it not <e> <s> in order to achieve that <e> <s> he made an attempt to answer the <e>", "<cs> my lords it sounds as if the ministers answer to my noble friend lord hatch is yes that it is the governments intention and is claimed to be the governments right to override the wishes of local people <e> <s> i cannot see any other interpretation to put on his failure to answer my noble friends question or his silence now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl will recognise that he has already had the comments which he is looking for from the noble baroness <e> <s> lady seear and myself <e> <s> the matter is not closed the consultation is not finished <e> <s> there is evidence that the government are entering these consultations in a spirit of indeed i am afraid so otherwise they would not have put in such grossly inadequate questions <e> <s> however because the matter is not closed it is appropriate that i should beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment to which i have added my name <e> <s> we had a long and not always totally calm debate on this clause in committee <e> <s> we on these benches expressed a great deal of concern about the wording of the clause and about the fact that the government were reintroducing into the criteria as regards what local authority publicity was going to be acceptable not just the question which widdicombe wanted to have considered which is the content of the publicity but also the question of the intention and the effect of the publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for following the minister <e> <s> i confess that i was taken aback because i did not realise that he was going to rise to his feet so early <e> <s> i shall not abuse my position by asking him further questions or commenting on what he said <e> <s> however i believe it is incumbent on me to say something from the front bench even in a personal capacity because as is well known we have no whip on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that supporters of the amendment should be accused of repeating previous arguments particularly when they were accused in a speech of such length which exactly repeated the arguments made at second reading and in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is a supporter of the clause i ask her whether she thinks that they can be defined as promoting homosexuality <e> <s> it has never been suggested that they are covered by the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be improper for me to pursue this but i do not think that any of the phrases which the noble baroness uses can be found in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply wanted to learn whether or not the noble lord was willing to recognise the rather important distinction between activities in schools and in discos <e> <s> school children are obliged to go to school <e> <s> therefore they might be thought to be the victims if you like or the unwilling recipients of any propoganda <e> <s> discos are entirely voluntary <e> <s> no one can force anyone least of all me to go to a disco <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course not arguing that it is all right to corrupt children at a disco <e> <s> i am saying that there are many voluntary activities which take place all over the country which are designed for adults and there are many at which most of us would not wish to he present <e> <s> it is not possible for a local authority to corrupt someone who goes to a disco unless it can force that person to go to that disco or any other comparable activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to associate myself with all my heart as well as my mind with the moving words of my noble friend lord rea <e> <s> i think that if we were to suffer the misfortune of going back to some of the moralising and lay preaching which we heard earlier on this evening the house would be doing itself a disservice <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome these amendments and reiterate the gratitude of these benches and of my noble friend lord gifford for the ministers prompt reaction to the fears earlier expressed <e> <s> i should not like it to be thought however that in supporting these amendments we feel that what is left is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not detained the house very much this evening and i do not intend to do so now but i want to defend the right of my noble friend and other noble lords to deal with this difficult nay impossible wording not only line by line and word by word but syllable by syllable if they want to <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important occasion not only because this is the th report of the nature conservancy council but also because it is the first report to be debated in this way in your lordships house <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble earl lord cranbrook for drawing the matter to our attention <e> <s> we also look forward to the contributions of many well-informed members of your lordships house and we look forward to the maiden speech of the noble earl lord granville <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i specifically did not say that schedule b was to be abolished but rather the schedule d release and the opportunity to switch between schedules <e> <s> if schedule b is put to replanting that is quite a different matter <e>", "<cs> what a cheek my lords <e> <s> we have closed one subject i have made all the right noises <e> <s> the amendments which i put down with the help of the draftsmen of the department followed on amendments which were debated at committee stage <e> <s> this is a totally different matter from the first consideration which is all we have of a long schedule and introductory clause <e> <s> certainly we were not able to debate those with any due consideration at committee stage <e> <s> as i said even the report stage is not a substitute for detailed consideration in committee in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers response but not at all satisfied with it <e> <s> i am a great admirer of the audit commission <e> <s> in addition to its function fo scarifying local authorities on occasions it has a good reputation for scarifying the government who set it up <e> <s> i do not say a word against mr davies because he has been in office for only a short time but its independence under mr john banham was quite outstanding <e> <s> the argument about the report is a minor matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has gone some way to setting my mind at ease about this matter <e> <s> i look forward to seeing the guidelines which will be produced <e> <s> it is true as the noble earl says that we shall have an opportunity to raise any concerns that we have about the guidelines when they come before us <e> <s> however by convention our ability to make changes or to oppose such matters is extremely restricted <e> <s> in view of that reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which indeed i anticipated to a considerable extent <e> <s> i should prefer the matter to be on the face of the schedule <e> <s> it would relieve the minds not only of the auditors but also the local authorities would know as a matter of statute the extent to which auditors are likely to impose prohibition orders on them <e> <s> there may well be cases for some prohibition orders <e> <s> but as the minister said the fewer cases there are the greater the likelihood that an amicable settlement can be reached without the imposition of a prohibition order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the minister <e> <s> it is certainly appropriate that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge that he was given by the questioner a pretty free hand in choosing the period of comparison and that he decided to refer to an upturn in construction over a period of only months <e> <s> would he care to give the house any more meaningful figures covering a longer period such as five or years <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose we must be grateful for the fact that we have achieved two things in this little debate <e> <s> the first is that at last after consistent refusal to do so both in this house and in another place the minister has given an example of abuse of local authority publicity powers since the passage of the act <e> <s> he has given the example of ealing councils house magazine which i shall certainly look into <e> <s> perhaps he will be kind enough to send me a copy of it not in the middle of my speech <e> <s> it is a fact that ever since this bill came before parliament the minister of state in another place and minister here have always refused to give any examples <e> <s> a minister of state in another place refused on principle because he said it was not relevant to the argument for the clause and ministers in this house perhaps gave less objectionable reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether a non-lawyer may intervene in this debate but it seems to me that the noble lords who have just spoken have a good case <e> <s> although to some extent i took a back seat on this amendment after our attempt to have the whole clause thrown out was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that after a distinguished career as a spokesman on environment matters the noble earl has in dealing with this amendment given one of his weakest replies <e> <s> at an earlier stage we said that we did not like the amendment because we thought that there were no good examples of the abuse which the government claimed as justification for the new clause <e> <s> our sceptiscism about the abuses still exists <e> <s> it is even more strong because the minister has failed to take another opportunity which has been given to him to set out the abuses justifying not only introducing a new clause at a late stage in the bill but justifying the retrospective elements of the clause <e> <s> we are saying exactly the same as was said by my noble friend lord dean at an earlier stage <e> <s> we are saying that as we have failed to persuade the government to take out the clause they should at least remove one particular objection to it namely that it is retrospective legislation without adequate justification being given <e> <s> the minister has given no further justification for the clause whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to the motion that the bill do now pass first i must express despite my comments on the last amendment which i moved my deep appreciation to the minister and his colleagues for the way in which they have progressed this bill through your lordships house <e> <s> it must have been a shock to the minister to have been brought so suddenly into the department of environment from the home office where he had distinguished himself <e> <s> however he certainly earned the respect of those of us who have been working in local government matters for a number of years for his understanding of the issues involved his unfailing courtesy in dealing with the arguments put foward and on occasions for his understanding of the validity of the arguments put forward although inevitably those occasions were less frequent <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not agree at all <e> <s> the clause is about teaching at schools and there is nothing anybody who wants to promote homosexuality in haringey can do to affect teaching in schools <e> <s> many of the activities of the gay and lesbian committee i very much applaud and indeed many of those activities will not come under the provisions of this clause <e> <s> neither do i agree positively with the noble baroness in the example that she gave and nor do i agree that it would be undesirable to have the alternatives she suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords and the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords answer mean that the government have abandoned any attempt to force the right-to-buy provisions on sheltered housing for the elderly <e> <s> as i recall that has been a matter of great controversy in this house and in another place <e> <s> the government seem determined to reduce the stock of sheltered housing for the elderly held by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that that happened because the government were voted down in this house <e> <s> i asked whether the government recognise the justice of the decision of the house <e> <s> are they going to abandon any further attempts to reduce the housing stock for the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords when responding to the question of the noble lord lord mellish the minister appeared to agree that the london docklands development corporation was an example for all inner cities <e> <s> is it not the case that per cent <e> <s> only of new jobs in the isle of dogs for example have gone to people who live in the isle of dogs and a further per cent <e> <s> to those who live in tower hamlets <e> <s> that is not an especially good example <e> <s> with regard to the new urban development corporations is it not the case that million in block grant has been taken away from those areas since <e>", "<cs> my lords on a previous occasion the minister was kind enough to invite me to visit the flow country of caithness and sutherland <e> <s> i should now like to invite him to visit oxford circus which is where i work and where we are frequently ankle deep in litter <e> <s> will the minister consider the degree of support which the government could give to westminister city council in its proposals for a fixed-penalty ticket for dropping litter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends on the opposition benches will know that i am fanatical in my regard for the supremacy of the elected chamber <e> <s> in more than five years in this house i have until today only once been persuaded that having considered a bill and the bill having gone through both houses of parliament it would be right for noble lords to object to the considered view of another place on our amendments <e> <s> that one occasion was on the films bill in when i felt that the deputy speaker had not allowed our amendments to be properly considered because of the grouping which had been imposed on those amendments <e> <s> today is the second and i hope the last time because i certainly do not wish to see a non-elected chamber taking and insisting on views after <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to all noble lords who have spoken in this most interesting debate for which we are grateful to my noble friend lord stoddart in detailed knowledge of the transport housing and other conditions in the royal county of berkshire <e> <s> even my noble friend lord graham seems to have acquired a litany of berkshire placenames as part of his preparation for this evenings debate although his litany of london placenames is slightly less accurate than one would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been able to give the house the cost to the organisations concerned of the british democratic right of assembly <e> <s> will he now tell the house how much it cost to put down litter for his right honourable friend the prime minister to pick up yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will accept that the discrimination in favour of unleaded petrol in the budget is one of the few parts of that document with which we on these benches wholeheartedly agree <e> <s> however can he be a little more precise about what the government can do to assist in the development of catalytic converters which are after all the means by which much of the <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the minister will have in front of him the judgment of mr justice simon brown of th march in which he found for the ilea and london local government against the secretary of state <e> <s> will the minister confirm to the house that mr justice simon brown noted the fact that the secretary of state accepted the inspectors conclusion that there was neither need nor desirability for the main building of county hall to be used in future as offices <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that many of us regret that he has repudiated the statement which he was alleged to have made by the <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble earl for the way in which he has introduced these regulations <e> <s> it is the duty of the opposition to oppose <e> <s> one duty of the opposition as legislation is being passed is to demand that regulations which are proposed by the government to require negative resolutions should become affirmative resolutions <e> <s> this seems a classic case where we have an affirmative resolution which ought to be a negative resolution <e> <s> if i learn either on the passage of the town and country planning act or the town and country planning minerals act that affirmative resolutions were inserted on the insistence of the labour opposition i shall be deeply embarrassed <e> <s> however we can find no reason to object either to the principle or the detail of these regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i join heartily in the thanks which have been expressed by other noble lords to my noble friend lord dean and indeed thank all my noble friends including the noble lord lord ezra whom i should like to call my noble friend who have taken part in the debate this afternoon <e> <s> i too regret that it has not seemed possible for any noble lord on the government back-benches to put his name down to speak <e> <s> surely the department or conservative central office could have issued a brief to encourage them <e> <s> even if there are not so many noble lords on the government benches who are expert in local government there are others who could mug up a brief <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl recommending that every local authority should have a red map <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether he has any indication from the government that if that final phrase is added to the amendment it would then be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for referring to my amendment no <e> <s> and also for calling it a worthy attempt at drafting <e> <s> there is nobody from whom i would rather have high praise than the noble lord <e> <s> i agree with him that both amendments attempt to achieve the same objective <e> <s> i am content that both amendments should be considered together <e> <s> indeed the noble lords amendment refers in the fourth line to <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall glady take that point on board <e> <s> i believe that as a result of this debate we shall need an amendment at third reading <e> <s> that amendment will have to be a conflation of the best of what the noble lord is proposing and what we are proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be corrected <e> <s> it was a slip of the tongue and i meant water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house is not satisfied with the name would it not be possible to change the name by changing the provisions of this bill when the main bill goes through <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seldom heard such a stumbling argument put forward with such confidence <e> <s> the noble earl seems to think that parliament is the poodle of the government and that the electorate having expressed a wish by electing a government who include in their manifesto the commitment to privatisation of water and electricity somehow that ensures that that will be achieved <e> <s> the minister has not even convinced expert opinion on his own back benches that he or his government can draft clause of a paving bill to provide for water and electricity privatisation <e> <s> if they cannot do that what confidence can we have that the government will be able to draft the main legislation for the privatisation of water and electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not convinced by the early part of the ministers argument <e> <s> but in view of the commitment that he made in his last sentence to consider the amendment in conjunction with his reconsideration of amendment no <e> <s> i think it is appropriate that i should beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two basic points to make in response to that <e> <s> the first is that any difficulty about the definition of proposals is not of our making but has been caused by the government in putting forward this legislation <e> <s> the fact is as became clear at earlier stages of the bill that there is no adequate definition of what the government mean when they use the word proposing in the first line of the bill and therefore there is no adequate definition of the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the undertaking was heavily qualified with comments concerning the stage at which the papers would be placed in the library <e> <s> i said that i would read what the minister had said and what the noble lord lord renton had said and see whether or not i am as reassured as he is <e> <s> if i am nothing will happen if i am not we shall introduce suitable amendments at third reading <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that <e> <s> it is true that the details of deals will be properly considered in the main bill and will probably be properly concluded when the main bill achieves parliamentary approval if it does <e> <s> however the legislation provides specifically for the division of the functions of both water and electricity authorities <e> <s> in the case of water authorities there is the division of functions between the successor bodies corporate and the national rivers authority <e> <s> in the case of the electricity authorities there is the division <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not wildly impressed by appeals to the basic structure of clause which has already come under very serious attack from all parts of the house <e> <s> however i appreciate the point that has been made by the noble lord lord renton that there is a possibility of ambiguity in my amendment and under the circumstances i think it better to ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that they were put down on tuesday night <e> <s> they could have been available to the noble earl first thing yesterday morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it was worth putting the amendment down in order to achieve that statement for which i thank the noble earl <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that answer which i find very helpful <e> <s> in the last year and indeed during the last weeks i have had experience of meters both freezing up and exploding due to intense cold and also jamming in the way the noble earl described <e> <s> this is a serious matter <e> <s> where meters are extensively used the experience of trading standards officers from local authorities this time i do mean local authorities is that there is still a substantial level of complaint about water meters <e> <s> i do not think the situation is as satisfactory as i am sure the minister would like it to be let alone the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> it was the kind of response i hoped he would make <e> <s> we shall await with interest and without commitment the details of the consumer protection proposals which will come forward in the main legislation <e> <s> it is helpful that he has been able to do this now and it is appropriate that i should beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will permit me i only wanted to draw the attention of the house to a phenomenon in a way that can be recorded in <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble earl lord onslow for asking this question of the government <e> <s> there could be two opinions about whether now is the right time to ask it when there is a joint select committee still sitting to consider the matter <e> <s> nevertheless he has been able to give the house the benefit of his extensive experience of the private bill procedures <e> <s> that has been valuable <e> <s> no doubt he will be disappointed that more noble lords with similar experience have not felt able to take part in the debate but the matter has been relieved by the intervention of two distinguished lawyers the noble lords lord renton and lord hooson <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> as i said i have never served on one of those committees <e> <s> i accept his assurance that that is the way the committee proceeds <e> <s> i do not think that that affects the fact that when parliamentary agents are appointed to make representations on behalf of objectors to the bill they are told that it has been approved in principle <e> <s> no doubt the minister will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> the point i am making is that it weakens the powers of objectors if they have to come before a committee in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to greater expertise on both sides of the house <e> <s> i am certainly prepared to listen to the noble lord lord renton telling me that there are improvements required in the publicity given to planning proposals dealt with by local authorities and increases required in the rights of objectors <e> <s> i have always felt that very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer which londoners will be pleased to hear <e> <s> can he confirm that the government have no intention of attempting to overturn the judgment made in the courts on th march when london government was established as being the only valid use a judgment which in many respects humiliated the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred in his answer to the wishes and needs of people living in depressed urban and rural areas <e> <s> without in any way underestimating the achievements of the proposals and policies he has referred to will he recognise that the needs and wishes of the people living in depressed areas are well expressed by their elected local authorities and that the government would do well to pay more attention to the opinions and to seek the help of those local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember very clearly the noble lord lord mellish when he was minister of housing coming to the borough of haringey and dragooning not to say bullying us into accepting more subsidies for building more highrise flats <e> <s> does the minister accept that i am glad to see the conversion of the noble lord to the case we then put of the dangers of some of these high rise flats <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for the lucid and conscientious though hardly enthusiastic introduction which he has given to the bill <e> <s> i believe that we can start from one common point <e> <s> it is common ground on all sides of the house that the effect of the bill will be to make the poor poorer and the rich richer <e> <s> the government do not deny that <e> <s> they seek to justify it but it is not denied by them <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that is not the intention of the government although cynically of course it could be to their advantage <e> <s> that is what will happen and that is the real risk we run with his legislation <e> <s> i am interested that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls says that that will be their decision and i gladly give way to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe anyone was talking about breaking the law in the sense that some people in scotland have been <e>", "<cs> my lords it is conspicuously more regressive more unfair and is perceived to be more regressive and more unfair than what went before <e> <s> this was recognised by mr heseltine mr heath and by large numbers of conservative back benchers in another place who have no particular reputation for being rebels <e> <s> they were concerned about it because they were concerned about the future of their party <e> <s> if i were being cynical i would say that the best thing for us from these benches is to let the government have their bill and let them get on with it because it is going to bring with it the obloquy of a kind which i do not believe we have even yet begun to guess at <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> does he believe that there is a single member of this house who will pay more <e>", "<cs> my lords nodding ones head is not an adequate response to the noble lord <e> <s> certainly we on these benches would not seek to extend in the medium term or in any term the powers of this chamber against the powers of the legislative chamber <e> <s> but i do not think that he can go on from that to say that we feel that this particular manifesto commitment and all the different ways in which it has been put before the electorate at different times and with the qualifications about the ability to pay made on various occasions by the conservative party deserves a great deal of respect from us <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will welcome what the minister has said in his reply to the question <e> <s> however will he state what has changed since the end of january <e> <s> uk then said <e>", "<cs> in the light of those repeated assurances because i understood the words long-term and guarantee in the speech of the noble lord lord belstead i believe that it is proper that i should ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i hesitate to say anything particularly this afternoon which might antagonise those noble lords on the government benches whose natural habitat is more the grouse moor than this chamber is it not the case t hat there is more pressure for deregistration of common land from those owners of grouse moors than there is from development <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will permit me as the proposer of amendments nos <e> <s> and which have by agreement been grouped with these two amendments i accept some responsibility <e> <s> in speaking to these amendments my position is made very much easier by the speech that we have just heard from the noble viscount lord whitelaw <e> <s> he seems to believe that the difference between my noble friends and the noble lord lord chelwood is that although the noble lord lord chelwood is proposing an amendment which he concedes in effect is not a wrecking amendment we wish to wreck the whole bill and have it returned to the electorate <e> <s> i wish that the noble viscount could persuade my noble friends of that because that is by no means the situation i find in discussions with my noble friends <e> <s> the very common view of my noble friends and of the labour party at large in the country is very much that expressed by the noble lord lord ellenborough that this community charge proposal is not only unpopular now but is bound to do enormous damage to the conservative party in years to come <e>", "<cs> yes i do not need much confirmation do i for that <e> <s> i have to say that i take a different view <e> <s> i take the view that the interests of the people of this country who will be voting for and paying for local government in the short medium and long term are important <e> <s> my noble friends ought to be supporting my amendment <e> <s> as it comes first and is not too different in its terms i shall talk about the substance of the matter before us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord spoke of an arithmetical fallacy <e> <s> is he not committing an arithmetical fallacy when he talks about re-rating <e> <s> if the total rateable value in a given authority rises and the amount of money to be raised stays the same then the rate poundage will surely fall <e>", "<cs> there is in the science of rocketry a useful and succinct word <e> <s> it is the word failsafe <e> <s> it means that if something goes seriously wrong with the firing mechanism or the control system the system shuts down and can be repaired rather than exploding <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that my amendments and those of the noble lord lord chelwood and his noble friends achieve that <e> <s> something has gone seriously wrong as is evidenced by the contributions which have been made unanimously from this side of the committee and by a majority of speakers from the conservative benches <e>", "<cs> i say by a majority of speakers from the conservative benches <e> <s> i believe strongly that this reflects the view not only in the committee but in the country as a whole <e> <s> if that is correct the failsafe action for the committee to take is to give the government an opportunity to think again to reject the amendment if it thinks proper and that may well be the right action to take and allow them to put something fairer in its place <e> <s> the committee has an opportunity to do so by voting for the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i have been enjoying the speeches so much that i hesitate to intervene <e> <s> i am looking forward to the interventions of the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter lord jenkin of roding and lord renton and of any other noble lord who feels like joining in <e> <s> having been challenged by the noble lord lord thorneycroft i think i have to make it clear that it is not the policy of the labour party to replace the community charge with capital value rating <e> <s> i am sorry to have to say that to my noble friend lord mulley but we are allowed at least the same degree of dissent about the means to be adopted as that which exists within the conservative party <e> <s> i happen to think that the method proposed by the noble lord lord chelwood and myself in our amendments was the right method <e> <s> i think that we were right to attempt to put the responsibility on the government of the day with all the resources at their disposal to find the correct solution to this problem <e> <s> i recognise that this is the alchemists stone anyway but attempts to do it from the back-benches of either side of the committee are not likely to achieve success <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any secret about this <e> <s> a lot of play was made of it as the bill went through another place and my honourable friends and right honourable friends stuck by the position that we were still consulting with the relevant authorities and with people generally <e> <s> i think that that is an honourable position to stick to <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i hope that he will be prepared to reply to the quite extraordinary assertion made by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding that there will no longer be any resource reallocation problems between local authorities if the community charge comes into effect <e>", "<cs> i was specifically complimented so i hope that the committee will forgive me for intervening again <e> <s> i now understand why i disagreed so violently with the noble lords rate support grant settlements when he was secretary of state <e> <s> if he did not understand then and does not understand now that needs and resources are a seamless robe and he does not understand that the distinction he is making between them is a totally false distinction then he does not understand what will happen to rate support grant under the new system and we shall have some very interesting debates later on in committee <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether the secretary of state can expect a reply at all <e> <s> i made it quite clear when i spoke a few minutes ago that the final policy of the labour party to be put forward at the next election had not been finalised nor has the final policy of the conservative party on a large number of issues presently facing this country <e> <s> the press is full of discussions of options available to the conservative party for policies on major matters of state <e> <s> in that the labour party is no different from the conservative party or any other party <e> <s> we should be quite foolish to give precise details of the legislation we shall introduce after the next election in the period before a general election <e>", "<cs> i echo the hope of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that the minister will intervene quickly <e> <s> therefore i shall intervene only briefly because i believe it is my duty on behalf of my noble friends to say how strongly we support these two amendments <e> <s> we have had an afternoon of high drama but perhaps as the right reverend prelate said the drama was somewhat divorced from reality <e> <s> we now have a whole series of cases of common or garden tragedy affecting real people of the kind of whom i suspect a large number of the noble lords who voted against the amendment this afternoon can have no experience whatever <e>", "<cs> the committee has taken more than one hour on each amendment <e> <s> i do not think the committee would therefore welcome a long speech from me on this subject despite the kind invitations from the benches alongside that i expound further on labour party policy <e> <s> i think i said all i wish to say about the matter in response to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mulley <e>", "<cs> i intervene only briefly on one technical point <e> <s> i do not want to intervene in the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend lord underhill but the noble lord lord renton referred to the word estimated as if it were a defect in the drafting <e> <s> that is far from being the case <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain what the word estimated means in this case <e> <s> if the word estimated were not there the investigation would have to be of every single payer of the community charge <e> <s> the cost as the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the members of the committee who have taken part in the debate notably for the general agreement that students have a very bad time financially if they are living on the grant available and their conditions have been getting worse <e>", "<cs> virtually every speaker who has taken part in the debate has better experience than i of the problems of disablement <e> <s> there are those who are involved with voluntary organisations for the disabled and the mentally handicapped those who are concerned themselves and within their families and those who have professional responsibility in this area <e> <s> i venture to make only three points about public policy which i hope will be taken into account by the minister when he replies to the debate <e>", "<cs> the amendment was tabled in the name of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and his friends therefore it must be his decision as to whether it should be pursued <e> <s> i am sure that he will welcome the extension which the government have made to the definition of severely mentally handicapped as i do <e> <s> it is clearly right that handicaps acquired in adulthood should be treated in the same way as those which existed from birth or which have been suffered during childhood <e> <s> however i do not think that the answer he gave to the noble lord lord donaldson was adequate in dealing with alzheimers disease and other related disabilities <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear the ministers intentions but the amendment does not say renouncing all worldly goods <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> there is no justification for the minister trying to draw my noble <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord does not mind us teasing him if we catch him out on the rare occasions when it is possible to do so <e> <s> but as i say we would prefer caravan parks to be treated for non-domestic rating purposes and to be treated as commercial operations <e>", "<cs> i cannot give any commitment about amendments which have yet to be tabled and i am sure that the noble lord will not expect me to do so <e> <s> however it is clear from what he said that we are getting closer together on the intention behind this series of amendments than was evident at the beginning of the proceedings <e> <s> indeed it may not matter so much which side approaches the problem in order to arrive at the same result <e> <s> i notice <e>", "<cs> it would be impertinent for me to seek to defend my noble friend lord morton of shuna <e> <s> he hardly needs that <e> <s> i intervene to defend the minister who has got himself into an impossible position <e> <s> he does not seem to appreciate our argument <e> <s> we are saying that clause as it stands and as paved by this amendment gives the secretary of state a power but the minister can give no indication how it will be used <e> <s> there are clear indications of potential injustice as instanced by my noble friend lord morton of shuna <e> <s> surely the wise thing now is for the minister to say that he will take this away consult his right honourable and honourable friends and bring to their attention the arguments which have been advanced in the chamber <e> <s> that is the only way in which he can get off the hook on which he has placed himself <e>", "<cs> that is not what the bill says <e>", "<cs> but <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak on the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i do so not for the reasons which my noble friend lord mulley would have put forward because he has withdrawn all the amendments which referred to it <e> <s> i do so because i believe that there are enormous misconceptions about what is meant by a second home <e> <s> they appear to be held more firmly by this committee perhaps for obvious social reasons than by anybody else <e> <s> i shall have a few words to say about the most revealing comments made by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e>", "<cs> i heard one or two phrases from the noble earl which led me to think that he would make significant concessions on this <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the patient and courteous responses made by the minister to cross-questioning from all parts of the committee <e> <s> i listened with great care because i wanted to believe that his answers would be good enough <e> <s> however there are two basic matters which leave me profoundly dissatisfied <e>", "<cs> we have had not perhaps a semantic argument but an argument about definition of terms <e> <s> i shall certainly not pursue the matter in conflict with the ministers legal advisers but it seems to me that public administration provides far too many examples of things which are maintained but are not kept up to date <e> <s> for example our road surfaces could be criticised in that way <e> <s> there is a budget for maintenance but it does not stop the roads having potholes <e>", "<cs> while the minister is considering that contribution perhaps i may invite him to reconsider the words that he spoke a few moments ago <e> <s> he said that he would talk to his right honourable friend and that he planned to come back to this chamber before a further stage of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham with his usual generosity assumed that the minister meant the next stage <e> <s> can he make it clear that he means report stage and not third reading <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i were to respond to that before the minister replies <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has vastly more experience of legislation than i have and he must know perfectly well that one puts down an amendment in this form and at this stage of the consideration of a bill to find out from the government what their plans are about the making of regulations <e>", "<cs> i am duty bound to press the minister a little further than that particularly in relation to schedule where the whole process of the compilation of the register is very much affected by a wide range of regulation-making powers which is given to the secretary of state by these provisions <e> <s> i agree that on many other matters the making of regulations is probably marginal to the compilation of the register and it is possible that the compilation of the register could proceed effectively without the regulations being completed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those comments and i must read most carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> however because he has referred to a period well before the end of this year it must be said that he is moving as fast as he can i am sure in the direction of giving local authorities not only the right to consultation but to the efficient implementation of the register <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if one examines what the minister has said what appears to be a very conciliatory reply in fact contains no real concessions at all <e> <s> the only new thing that the minister has said is that the report from the consultants when it is received will be published <e> <s> however those who have acted as i have on many occasions as a consultant to government departments know perfectly well that the time between when the draft report is produced to the department for discussion and the time when a final report is produced complete in every detail with every figure checked and every graph probably in glorious technicolour can be as long as the department wants it to be <e> <s> one must suspect that unless price waterhouse was lying when it said to the press that the first part was delivered to the department on th may and the second instalment on th may and if that is not the case i should be grateful if the minister would deny it this committee is being denied information which it should have in order to consider the whole issue of the compilation of the register <e>", "<cs> i hate to appear ungenerous to the minister <e> <s> i should hate him to feel that i was not taking his assurances seriously <e> <s> i am sure that they are the best assurances he can give <e> <s> however i do not think that they are satisfactory for the purposes of the business of this committee and the committees duty to consider the bill and in particular the whole basis for and cost of collection because if we do not do that we shall not be fulfilling our duty as part of parliament <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord flowers responds to that i must say that this is the most extraordinary example of the government making a rod for their own back that i have ever heard <e> <s> after all this is the country in which a woman police constable was shot dead in st jamess square this is the country in which a bulgarian exile was murdered with a poison-tipped umbrella this is the country in which an israeli ambassador was gravely injured this is the country in which it is well known as the noble lord lord flowers said that those who seek exile this is the price we pay for being available for exiles and all credit to us for it are very often pursued by their governments <e> <s> for example it may be the government <e>", "<cs> the minister has a case <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government are overreacting somewhat wildly to this matter <e> <s> no one likes complaints

authorities do not like the complaints we receive from such people who still think that they are our constituents <e> <s> it must be said that complaints take up time and are a nuisance <e> <s> some of them are unjustified some of them are written in green ink and some of them are written in capitals with three underlinings <e> <s> okay that is the price we have to pay i do not consider it to be a high price <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> c stands by itself <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i said <e> <s> i said that it did not appear in the formula but that it appears in the sense of

with the minister <e>", "<cs> i am content to leave the government to take this matter away and consider the points made by the noble lord lord tordoff and myself <e> <s> it appears that there is in algebraic terms b in clause b which is only defined in respect of clause and not clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the government fully appreciate the degree of concern which students could well

the person he is quoting <e> <s> he is still quoting from the official record from somebody who is not a minister <e>", "<cs> in those past few seconds we have made very considerable progress <e> <s> i am going to open up a gulf between myself and my noble friend lord dean of beswick <e> <s> i think that my colleagues in another place were exactly right to attack the greedy private landlords who would make money out of administering the community charge and i think i was exactly right to point to the difficulties which arise for voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> the noble earl must speak for himself <e> <s> he made that point and it was not discussed by other members of the committee <e> <s> as he correctly said what we all agreed upon was that the community charge system is going to be enormously more expensive to operate than the rating system <e>", "<cs> i believe that the minister is dragging the committee away from the impact and the purport of these amendments <e> <s> he is getting himself into difficulty by forcing other people to defend alternative ways of collecting finance for local government <e> <s> he is trying to put words into my mouth which i do not find acceptable <e> <s> he is getting himself into an unnecessary dispute with the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i suggest it would be better if we return to the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a general rule we take the view that if we have had a debate on what we have chosen to be the most significant item in a clause and the committee has decided not to accept our opinions it would be inappropriate for us to vote against the motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> as inevitably one has had to be selective in putting down amendments to the clause it is appropriate to repeat the view that has already been expressed by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs and by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> i am referring to the fact that we find the whole concept of joint and several liability as expressed in the clause to be profoundly unsatisfactory to be reactionary in social terms and to be in conflict with some of the small measures of progress which have been made in social security and other legislation by this government <e> <s> we very much regret that the complexity of the community charge system which the government have wished upon themselves and are now proposing to foist upon the nation involves us in this reactionary piece of social legislation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the intention of the amendment is to be helpful and we are not opposed to it in principle <e> <s> however i am bound to say that it contains many detailed provisions about what regulations may contain in order to achieve the kind of flexibility in the situation <e>", "<cs> i have not had an answer to my second question <e> <s> is there a difference between <e>", "<cs> i do not find the words confusing <e> <s> i find the drafting to be defective <e> <s> if it is made

himself off that hook <e>", "<cs> we have no objection to these amendments <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do and it must be entirely in his hands i hope that he will sup with a very long spoon from the assurances given by the noble lord lord hesketh <e> <s> the very reasonable case put by the noble lord lord flowers that the universities cannot be expected to do anything other

lord to say that the information at the beginning of the academic year shall be supplied for what it is worth <e>", "<cs> i apologise for rising to my feet again but the significance of what the noble lord lord hesketh said about the beginning of the academic year has only just occurred to me <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble baroness lady seear is quite right not only about the understanding by the drafters of this schedule of the way in which students live but also i cannot believe that they read the newspapers <e> <s> at the beginning of every adademic year for many years now there has been a severe shortage of student accommodation <e> <s> horrific stories have appeared in the press about students sleeping on floors in classrooms and corridors <e> <s> these reports may or may not be exaggerated <e> <s> the fact remains that particularly at the beginning of the academic year there is a great deal of movement among students as regards where they live which cannot be controlled or even monitored by the educational establishment authorities <e> <s> it is a particularly difficult time of year to expect them to embark on this exercise <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear says the only way in which contact is maintained and it is a perfectly adequate and satisfactory way is when they turn up for classes and when they appear to collect their money if money is due to them <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the difficulty in which the minister finds himself <e> <s> i was prepared not to move the amendment <e> <s> however the noble lord lord monson has a perfect right to raise the matter <e> <s> i believe that honour would be satisfied if the minister were to read and draw to the attention of his honourable and his right honourable friends the points which the noble lord has made <e> <s> perhaps i may say that i entirely agree with those points not least because my name is on the amendment <e> <s> perhaps the minister will write to us regarding the matter before the bill reaches the next stage <e>", "<cs> needless to say i do not <e>", "<cs> i am far from convinced that the analogy is exact <e> <s> an act such as the debtors scotland act which applies to all debts and not simply to this particular form of default is not necessarily applicable to the non-payment of the community charge <e> <s> it may well be that the criteria which apply are not appropriate <e> <s> i am conscious of two points in this respect <e> <s> the first is the difficulty for the individual concerned whose earnings are being attached <e> <s> to that extent i appreciate the flexibility of the provisions which the noble lord has set out and which come from the debtors scotland act <e> <s> however i am also conscious of the problems for employers <e> <s> as somebody who meets a payroll himself i am conscious that any deductions are not necessarily conducive to good industrial relations and to good management of human resources <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene because my noble friend lady jeger has put my partys position strongly and effectively <e> <s> i am reminded by what the noble baroness lady faithfull has just said of an experience that the borough of haringey had some years ago when my wife was chairman of the childrens committee <e> <s> the council then took the view that no children should <e>", "<cs> that answer does not explain why the home office should have changed its mind since <e> <s> at that time as i have reminded the committee and as the minister has confirmed it was considered necessary not only to say that the warrant may be directed to any other person as the magistrates court issuing the warrant may think fit similar words apply in regard to the execution of the warrant but to specify that it may be issued to constables <e> <s> the issue here is whether there may be a quite unnecessary and undesirable conflict between the police force and the local authority of the area <e> <s> it seems illogical and inconsequential of the home office to be giving the advice now that what was proper at that time and does not appear to have caused any difficulties should be unnecessary now <e>", "<cs> i do not recall that the amendment has been spoken to <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the committee <e> <s> however it would be helpful since the amendment is not inconsequential to have an explanation <e>", "<cs> that is not the grouping which i have and which i agreed to <e> <s> however i do not wish to delay the committee and i suggest that the matter can be easily remedied at report stage <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is very tactful for the minister to remind us in his reply of two matters on which some of us felt very strongly when we debated them yesterday <e> <s> the first matter concerns the sources of information which the <e>", "<cs> should we not take amendment no <e> <s> b first <e>", "<cs> i am less happy about this amendment for the same reason that i was worried about an earlier amendment <e> <s> it gives the government powers to determine what the other means will be without ever setting out their idea of the other means and the circumstances in which they will determine how they will be provided for <e> <s> i can readily understand that in a district which is parished for example there will be a different precept for a different parish and that that will cause a variation in the community charge <e> <s> however that has already been accepted under clause and as i understand the matter it is not part of the other means provision <e>", "<cs> what the minister says makes good sense but why does the amendment not say that <e> <s> why are we being asked to give the secretary of state the authority to make regulations about something whose meaning the minister except under questioning rather than voluntarily when the amendment was moved was not able to explain <e> <s> this is a most unsatisfactory way to draft a bill and to treat the committee <e> <s> however as i agree that the provision is under cross-examination shown to be acceptable i do not think we shall oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the government will respond to those questions but before the noble lord lord ross of newport concludes i must stress that the reason we have been uncharacteristically silent on the issue is that we do not think the amendments affect second homes as some members of the committee seem to think they do <e> <s> we think that the category of properties subject to the standard community charge is much wider than second homes in the sense of country cottages of the rich <e> <s> the case of the constituent of my right honourable friend the leader of the opposition in his constitutency of islywn is a good example <e> <s> here was someone who was suffering because she was in hospital and not able to sell her only home yet of course it would be subject to the standard community charge <e>", "<cs> i too have been in correspondence with the trade union side at the foreign and commonwealth office <e> <s> i fully support the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the trade union side of the department of the environment has been putting suitable pressure on ministers to support their colleagues <e>", "<cs> since it is our amendment and we should reply i understand that in such a case it will he subject to the personal community charge anyway because somebody is living there <e>", "<cs> george orwell must be turning in his grave <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not move my amendment no <e> <s> b because of the time of night <e> <s> the purport of that amendment was to make it possible to have revaluations more frequently than every five years <e> <s> in other words i was pursuing the goal of greater flexibility in this matter of non-domestic rating <e> <s> i am by no means qualified to understand the detailed arguments of the noble earl lord lytton or the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> in so far as they appear to be tending to the same objective i think that i should give them general support <e>", "<cs> we are prepared to accept that these are drafting amendments <e> <s> my only complaint and the only reason i am speaking at all is that the noble lord read out at high speed a large number of amendments which according to the groupings are not as agreed <e> <s> this is a point which my noble friend lord underhill has just picked up <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will not read them out again at dictation speed but arrange that we are informed what amendments are being spoken to now <e>", "<cs> we reached part iii of the bill which deals with non-domestic rating well after midnight on tuesday night or in other words in the early hours of wednesday morning <e> <s> then was not the appropriate time for us to open a general debate about the merits or de-merits of centralised business rating <e> <s> i do not think that the committee wish me to make a second reading speech on this matter particularly since it was referred to at some length on second reading <e> <s> in summary i think the position that we take about non-business centralised non-domestic rating is that the very fact that it takes away another quarter of local government spending from the decision-making powers of local authorities and local authorities are now left in control of only a quarter of their expenditure must be a bad thing <e> <s> it must be a centralising tendency which we can only deplore <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will forgive me i should like to remind her that we are debating charities rather than small businesses <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will speak for herself <e> <s> however if the rate poundage is set nationally as it is for the business rate then that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we could be clear as to what amendments we are talking to <e> <s> the noble lord lord moran in moving amendment no <e> <s> said that he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> he did not indicate that he was speaking to any other amendment <e> <s> since amendment no <e> <s> had been taken separately it would be as well if these three which are not like any of the others could be disposed of before going on to the governments amendments <e>", "<cs> as i was in considerable sympathy with the amendment although i did not feel that i had anything very much to add at the beginning i listened very carefully to what the minister said in reply <e> <s> it was when he used the phrase <e>", "<cs> that does not even attempt to answer the point i made namely that it is a combination of the burden of two personal community charges with the business rate on the shop which will be the difficulty <e>", "<cs> i think we shall have to do something about the grouping arrangements on this bill <e> <s> the noble earl has moved two amendments which i am the first to agree are mainly drafting amendments <e> <s> however partly because of reasons of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which will fall if amendment no <e> <s> b were agreed to is on a very major matter <e> <s> we are discussing the whole issue of the rating of empty properties <e> <s> as proposed by the government decisions about the rating of empty properties will be taken by the secretary of state in the form of regulations <e> <s> i put it to the committee that rating of empty properties has historically been a very sensitive issue in local government <e> <s> it has been one on which there have been disagreements between different residents in particular areas and strong differences of view between one local authority and another <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of the noble lord in general terms <e> <s> i was amused to find harry hyams described as a poor man <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are in general sympathy with the amendment but we are rather worried by the phrase having regard to the interests of persons subject to the community charges if that phrase means that the revenue that will be forgone by these provisions comes from the general community charge pool <e>", "<cs> i do not think that either of those answers is entirely satisfactory <e> <s> having willed the end the government must have thought about the means and should be able to reply to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> as regards my question will the minister give an assurance that we shall receive an answer on this point before we reach report stage <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord wish me to speak for a few minutes longer <e> <s> if so i <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> my amendments perform an elegant dance around the amendments of the noble baroness lady stedman in the marshalled list <e> <s> we come together very happily at amendment no <e> <s> which is in both our names <e> <s> unfortunately there is an intrusion of some vulgar amendments with the letters a and b appearing after them which come in the middle standing in the name of the noble earl lord caithness <e>", "<cs> the minister makes the same tired old cracks about the irresponsible and profligate expenditure of local authorities <e> <s> he ought to look at the balance between those parts of his script that come from conservative central office and those that come from the department <e> <s> it seems to me that the former is taking over in quite a large part of the speeches he is given to read <e>", "<cs> i think it is rather unwise of the noble baroness to refer from those benches to the burnham committee when it was her partys government that only last year abolished that body and took the entire control of teachers salaries into the hands of the secretary of state for education and science <e>", "<cs> i accept that this is a drafting amendment but i cannot help observing that if attention had been paid earlier to the wise words of the noble baroness lady stedman and my own wise words we should not have needed it <e> <s> the rpi is an unsatisfactory means of measuring local authority expenditure <e> <s> it is particularly unsatisfactory because the index is recalibrated so often <e>", "<cs> we welcome the amendment but i cannot help thinking that if the deputy chairman had been in his place on the benches he would have been suspicious of the phrase little more than a drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and to the amendments already spoken to by the noble baroness <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady blatch i have been having second thoughts <e> <s> there is a real difficulty in that the government are proposing a system whereby for wales the grants go separately to the district councils and to the county councils and for england they go to the district councils which set up a collection fund which is then allocated to the county councils <e> <s> clearly whichever view one adopts as being correct what one cannot do is to have one system for wales and another system for england <e> <s> i know that the government will have a complex and no doubt jesuitical series of reasons to explain that wales is totally different from england in this respect <e> <s> i do not think that we need spend too much time on them <e> <s> either the argument for accountability works better with a collection fund or it works better with the grant being separately allocated to each of the two tiers of local authority <e>", "<cs> all of us who work in the city of westminster whether paid or unpaid must have an instinctive sympathy for the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes and her amendment <e> <s> we must be grateful to her not only for introducing this important subject but for her own contribution <e> <s> we must be particularly grateful for the very remarkable speech which we have just heard from the noble lord lord carr of hadley <e> <s> if i may say so and i do not mean this in any sense as a criticism it is a speech which would have graced the second reading as much as it has graced the committee this afternoon <e> <s> it was notably thoughtful and raised very clearly some of the major issues which are still slipping through at a level of abstraction which does not do the chamber or the committee any credit <e> <s> there is still a level of imprecision in the governments thinking and often also of had thinking which needs to be exposed more clearly <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he would not agree that since what is being proposed is in effect a zero sum gain in other words no additional money or less money is to be extracted from the national business tax everybody in the country will he concerned westminster newcastle and birmingham on the one side and the authorities which will lose on the other side <e>", "<cs> there is a slight difference between a non-domestic rate set by local authorities and a national business tax the level of which is set entirely by central government <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene in what are to some extent as the minister said marginal matters but i was appalled by something the noble lord said about bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> do the government intend that those who offer one or two rooms as bed and breakfast accommodation in the summer should not only be subject to the personal community charge for the house in which they live but should he solemnly assessed for non-domestic rating on the basis of one room which may be occupied for a total of a month or two through the summer and then revert to being family accommodation for the rest of the year <e> <s> i cannot believe that the government can seriously mean that <e> <s> it would be a total nonsense <e> <s> it would be administratively wildly extravagant <e> <s> it would act as a deterrent to people offering bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> i cannot believe that if that is the governments intention they have consulted the tourist boards or the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> that is not the case <e> <s> property is being rated anyway because we have a domestic rating system <e> <s> the domestic rating system is being abolished and replaced by the community charge which does not involve any rating assessment <e> <s> in order to catch the people who provide a service to this country the tourist industry and probably the balance of payments these places will have to be solemnly visited rated and assessed in a way they would not otherwise be <e> <s> i cannot think that that is what the minister intends <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would write to me about the matter before we reach another stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> will he accede to my other request which is that the letter should come before report stage <e> <s> secondly will he consult the tourist hoards <e> <s> even if he consults only the major tourist boards it would be a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> we must be grateful to the minister for his clear exposition of the governments thinking in this part of the bill <e> <s> it certainly is helpful to have it set out in this way and it is a good deal clearer when he says it than when we try to read it in the notes on clauses <e> <s> certainly it is a good deal clearer than when we read it in the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i still find myself in considerable difficulty about many of the points he is making <e>", "<cs> i suppose we have made some small progress in that the minister indicated that he will support my amendment no <e> <s> which provides for the consultation with <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what the minister said would happen <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why he should not give effect to it in law if he is volunteering his agreement with our intention in that amendment <e> <s> however we are not debating that amendment now and the minister can find out ways in which to backtrack on the commitment he has just given <e>", "<cs> i find that answer almost entirely misconceived <e> <s> in these amendments it is not proposed that the secretary of state should base the revenue support grant on the expenditure of local authorities but merely that information on the expenditure of local authorities should and must be available to him in making his calculations <e>", "<cs> as the minister rightly says the amendment is in two parts <e> <s> the first refers to national business tax and the second refers to the receipts from community charges <e> <s> i must say straight away that i am most grateful for the undertaking given by the minister about the national business tax and i look forward to hearing his conclusions once he has taken it away and thought about it <e> <s> further i shall certainly be pleased to talk to him about the matter at any time before the next stage of the bills proceedings <e>", "<cs> as evidenced by the ministers reply there are two basic misconceptions about the amendments <e> <s> first he stated that we are looking for safeguards for local authorities <e> <s> we are looking for safeguards for voters and community charge payers <e> <s> they are the ones who will ultimately suffer if there are errors or injustices in the way in which the revenue support grant is calculated and <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness in moving amendment no <e> <s> referred also to amendments nos <e> <s> and all of which are in my name and are on a closely related point <e> <s> i am fairly open minded about the best way to achieve the purpose <e> <s> certainly the amendment of the noble baroness has the advantage of simplicity <e> <s> the point as she has so clearly said is that the cost of interest payments should be charged to the collection fund <e> <s> at the moment the charging authority has to pay interest to a precepting authority if the charging authority fails to pay the precept in accordance with the prearranged timetable <e> <s> this could happen if there were considerable difficulty in charge payers withholding or being slow in making payments <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendments although my name is not on them <e> <s> i do so as a former chairman of the association for neighbourhood councils and as the present joint president of that association which has always been very closely associated with the national association of local councils and has always been concerned to extend the principle of parish councils into the urban areas of england which are at present denied the right to have them <e> <s> that does not mean that we are not also concerned with wales and with the suburban and rural areas of england which are able to have parish councils <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord bellwin will accept my assurance that my amendments on the timing matter simply bring the situation back to what it was and is now under the rates act which he himself piloted with such distinction through this chamber <e> <s> if that is a tribute to the noble lords skill in advocacy and drafting then so be it <e> <s> but we feel that what was good and what was recommended to the chamber by the noble lord lord bellwin in has some validity <e> <s> however it is interesting that both the noble lord lord bellwin and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter have made nothing of the point that it is the governments claim that the community charge in itself will achieve accountability and should therefore make capping unnecessary <e> <s> he has given no credit whatever to any difference between the community charge and the rating system in that respect <e>", "<cs> i should apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> he is quite right of course in what he said <e> <s> i still do not think that it follows from that that the reserve power is necessary but that is a disagreement between us on a matter of policy and not a conflict on the record <e>", "<cs> when i first spoke on this amendment i predicted that the minister would set out the provisions of this part of the bill with much greater clarity than i could <e> <s> he did so with great lucidity and the committee will be grateful to him <e> <s> however his speech was strong on exposition and very low on advocacy <e> <s> he did not really answer the case that was made either about the justice of the capping of the community charge and still less about the timing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords indication of possible future support if we have to table another amendment on report <e> <s> however that is not what our amendments say <e> <s> the amendments that we are proposing do not add to the existing law under section of the local government act <e> <s> the amendments do not propose any decrease in the powers of the secretary of state powers which are already the law and which i have not heard as being the subject of political controversy in the intervening years <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the minister in the hope that he would say enough to enable me to withdraw the amendments <e> <s> even up to the last minute his last few words i had hoped that that would be the case <e> <s> i have not found those words <e> <s> as i understand it the position is that the government are going to ensure the continuity of section powers and for that we must be grateful <e> <s> indeed we recognised from the outset that this was the intention of the government <e> <s> however they have not recognised the force of the arguments about the way in which section powers have been diminished over the years since by inflation and the way in which they have been diminished by the abolition of two-tier authorities in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> to that extent there has not been any serious recognition of the problems which face local authorities who wish to make use of what has been universally agreed and agreed by the minister in his speech just now to be a valuable function of local government <e>", "<cs> i think i can detect in this amendment and in the speech of the noble lord a nugget of good will <e> <s> it is a long way down and it has suffered a lot of accretion since it started off but i take it that the original intention of all this was to take away from the chief financial officer of the local authority responsibilities which by the nature of his training abilities and responsibilities he is unable to assume <e> <s> if that is the intention so be it <e> <s> we are in agreement about what we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also say that i fail to see the cogency of the noble lords reply as regards professional responsibilities <e> <s> if we were talking about the chief legal officer whose job is to advise the council about the legality or otherwise of the actions that it proposes i could understand the position that is being put forward <e> <s> the chief legal officer has responsibilities relating not only to his own activities but to the activities of all other functions and chief officers of the council including the chief finance officer <e>", "<cs> but he is the wrong person to whom it should so appear <e> <s> he is the chief finance officer not the chief legal officer <e> <s> that is the reason we object to it <e>", "<cs> if the government had issued this prospectus in their election manifesto i wonder whether it would have been greeted with the wild enthusiasm which the community charge originally received according to government sources <e> <s> this is <e>", "<cs> as i said at the beginning my amendments were probing amendments to see whether i could draw the government out a little more as to the amounts of money concerned <e> <s> the noble earl has not been drawn out he still has not confirmed or denied the figures i gave nor has he said whether the government are considering compensation for those local authorities which are particularly badly affected <e> <s> before begging leave to withdraw the amendment i wonder if i might try once more to see whether we can make any further progress <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> can he help the committee about the compensation aspect and what help is to be given bearing in mind that it is a limited number of local authorities which suffer heavily and that the comparison which the noble earl made with the overall general increase in rate revenue is really not appropriate for those authorities <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i acknowledge as i ought to have done right from the beginning that the department has been in continuous consulation with the local authority associations <e> <s> that must be the right way to do it and that was recognised from the outset by my honourable friends in another place <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the minister for condensing his speech on retrospection since it became clear that i was not going to pursue the issue of retrospection back to <e> <s> i am sure the committee will be as grateful as i am for that <e> <s> in view of the statements made by the minister i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> aa <e>", "<cs> we are not opposed to this amendment and the local authority associations are not opposed to it <e> <s> so far as i know no local authorities are opposed to the amendment <e> <s> i regret however that it was necessary for the noble lord in introducing the amendment to make the customary boring attacks on a minority of local authorities <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady carnegy has turned to the only answer that the government could possibly give to the arguments that have been put forward by noble lords who have already spoken <e> <s> it has been made clear as if it needed to be made clear that the complexity and the administrative extravagance of the system which is proposed cannot be defended in its own right <e> <s> the noble baroness did not attempt to defend it on those grounds <e> <s> the differences between one local authority and another have been made clear <e> <s> one may hate local authorities but it does not mean that one has to hate the poor who live in the areas with local authorities which have high spending <e>", "<cs> i paid specific tribute to the noble baronesss integrity <e> <s> i think that she is wrong <e>", "<cs> i think that the examiners judgment on that response would be since the noble lord himself used the word improvement that it was a courteous speech but there is still room for improvement in the conclusions that he reached <e> <s> the amendment in one part is a probing amendment and in one part a determined amendment <e> <s> the probing part is the attempt to put the provision on to the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be recognised that our silence on this matter does not indicate dissent but an anxiety to see the business of the committee efficiently conducted <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i well understand that the gap between us on administration costs will not readily be bridged <e> <s> i should like to pursue for a moment the question of the percentage of the gross costs of the revenue loss from the rebate system <e> <s> it seems to us that the principles which apply for housing benefit are so close to the principles which should apply for the rebate system that a very high percentage as the noble lord has said is not quite precise enough <e> <s> however if he would indicate without giving an actual figure that the principles upon which the government will be calculating the benefit to the local authorities are comparable to those for the housing benefit scheme it would go a very long way to removing our disquiet <e>", "<cs> indeed it is most helpful <e> <s> it will be well received by those local authorities which are most concerned about the matter <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is so lucid that even i can understand him <e> <s> indeed i am most grateful that we do not have too many of our professional surveyors in the chamber this afternoon <e> <s> the issues are so clear and the need for the changes in the valuation tribunals so clear that one cannot resist asking why the government did not think about this when first drafting the bill or certainly at a much earlier stage than now <e>", "<cs> one and a half cheers for democracy <e>", "<cs> i should like to offer our support for this amendment but i bet that the noble baroness could not read it all without drawing breath <e> <s> it is one sentence ten lines long which cannot be the most desirable precedent for legislation <e>", "<cs> as a non-lawyer i should like to take exception to the words legalistic which the minister applied to my noble friend <e> <s> we are dealing with the law <e>", "<cs> before the minister responds there was one phrase that he used which i do not have exactly right and which puzzled me very much <e> <s> he said that there was no question of offering financial inducements to those who were very well able to pay on time <e> <s> i must have misunderstood the minister <e> <s> i do not understand how one can discriminate between those who are making an effort to pay on time and need the inducements and those who are very well able to pay on time <e>", "<cs> i always knew that this bill was a foolish and reckless venture and this clause proves it <e> <s> i am only given pause for thought by the fact that the next labour government will have to repeal it and replace it by a more just system of local government finance <e> <s> i imagine that we will suffer the same difficulties in implementation that the government are finding now <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state our sympathy but our heavily qualified sympathy for the political difficulty he has got himself into by his <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister turn his attention for a moment to the problems of local authorities <e> <s> does he agree that those problems are of two kinds <e> <s> first there is the cost of clearing up on local authority land and how that will be met particularly by authorities which have been rate-capped and secondly there is the question of how to minimise the damage from any future disaster <e> <s> does the minister agree that the privatisation programme makes it more difficult for local authorities to co-ordinate their emergency services on such occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that it is less than two years ago when she stood at that dispatch box repeatedly and with a straight face assuring me that what was proposed was not in breach of the ilo convention <e> <s> will she now be generous go further and say that not only is it in breach of the ilo convention but it is in breach of decent industrial relations and proper respect for teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to follow my noble friends lord sefton and lord northfield who have special expertise in this area and who have spoken on the orders with passion and understanding <e> <s> i repeat what both of them have said and what my right honourable and honourable friends have said in another place <e> <s> we are not opposed to the orders and we shall not seek to have them negatived <e> <s> however we have great doubts about the policy context in which the government are putting them forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the assurances he has given about medical records <e> <s> i am sure that those involved in the caring professions will be grateful that the record has been set absolutely straight <e> <s> if the amendments were separated out i would certainly withdraw any amendment referring to medical records <e> <s> however the increased security of medical and health records curiously enough makes it all the more essential that there should be protection for social services records greater than is provided in the bill <e> <s> the arguments which the minister rejected seem even stronger as a result of the clarification which he has just given <e>", "<cs> my lords before we proceed perhaps i may raise a question of procedure <e> <s> we have here an amendment moved by the noble baroness with which has been grouped some very significant government amendments <e> <s> i wonder whether the house would agree that although <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing his amendments the minister said that they constituted substantial concessions <e> <s> i agree and i thank him sincerely for the concessions that he has made <e> <s> they are clearly made with the right spirit and in response to a very strong feeling which was made clear at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are discussing this matter perhaps the minister can help the house a little more <e> <s> if i have followed his arguments correctly in many of these hostels some of these residents or guests will have a home and therefore will not be subject to the collective community charge <e> <s> but others will be <e> <s> the people running the hostel will not only be responsible for collecting the money and taking away per cent <e> <s> of p a very grand sum but they will also be responsible for deciding from whom they should be collecting <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house as the noble earl has not resumed his seat will he point out to his right honourable friend that many of these hostels make a deliberate point of levying a small charge for accommodation <e> <s> this is not true of housing and of crisis at christmas <e> <s> but it is true of others because they want to instil a sense of responsibility in the people who are staying in their hostels <e> <s> the very limited concession which the minister has indicated that he might be willing to discuss with his right honourable friend does not cover that matter <e> <s> therefore i suggest that it does not go nearly far enough to meet the points made in the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second occasion this afternoon i promise that i shall keep a tally on which i rise to thank the minister for the concessions he has made which are in line with the undertaking he gave at an earlier stage and also in line with the discussions which we had at committee stage <e> <s> amendments of this complexity we would find very difficult to draft and we are grateful that they have been so comprehensive and that they cover so fully the points made <e> <s> the only <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that the noble earl has resumed his seat definitively and he is not responding to that <e> <s> i find some parts of the ministers argument somewhat difficult to follow <e> <s> if the argument of an income trap is valid surely it is valid for a very much larger group of people than those who choose to enter religious communities <e> <s> if the noble earl had responded more positively to the amendments we put forward in committee on the taper perhaps he would not find himself in the difficulty of an income trap which he now appears to detect <e> <s> however i do not think that this is a matter on which it would be appropriate to divide the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in shorthand this is thank you number three of today <e> <s> i say that on behalf of my noble friend lady ewart-biggs who has retired to bed after hours for a well-deserved rest <e> <s> i know that she is grateful for the governments amendment which as the noble earl stated in a letter to me is intended to give better effect to her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i do not believe that i can do much more than convey the remarks of the noble earl to my noble friend <e> <s> however i fear that she will be disappointed as am i with his response <e> <s> it is not just a matter of what these people want <e> <s> the whole argument which is being put is on the basis that they will or may become eligible for income support and for relief on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation may be different but i suggest that in the cold light of day the minister may feel that the case is even stronger for battered wives hostels and i <e>", "<cs> my lords this is thank you no <e> <s> <e> <s> the minister is right in calling it a major concession <e> <s> indeed i am tempted to call it a victory because of the strength of the argument which was put in favour of the case for not taxing the homeless <e> <s> the media have already picked it up as being a major victory and i believe they are right <e>", "<cs> my lords as a layman in such matters but having read the debate which took place in committee i wish to express my support for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord flowers <e> <s> he has been merciful to the house in that he has been most sparing in his quotations from the long list of evidence of attempts to get at students from different countries which has been supplied to him by various universities <e> <s> in fact the list goes on for three pages and if he had read it out in full i think that noble lords would have felt even more strongly than they ought to feel now that he had made a valid case for this modest element of further confidentiality and privacy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord renton because like him i recall the debates in your lordships house concerning the data protection act <e> <s> he is right in saying that at that time we did not envisage that there would ever be legislation of this kind before the house <e> <s> it must have been for that reason that we allowed the provision in clause of the data protection act principle of the data protection principles that none of the principles apply to any data the disclosure of which is authorised or required by any enactment <e> <s> the data protection act says that if data were authorised by or required by an enactment it is assumed that they have been obtained fairly if they have been obtained by a person who is authorised or required by law to provide them <e> <s> i believe that it is clear from the debates which we have had on this bill that that is not the case here <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble earl has yet resumed his seat <e> <s> i wonder whether when he replies to the interventions that have been made in his speech he will consider the position of his own government and the officials in his box <e> <s> i quite understand that he and his colleagues in the government need to consult officials in the box but i observe that his noble friend lady blatch has been consulting officials in the box <e> <s> does that mean that that freedom is available to those of us who are on the opposition benches as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is not a question of order <e> <s> the noble baroness has the same freedom as we have to question ministers not officials <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is an opportunity to add to the tally of thank yous which now numbers five <e> <s> this is an important principle which the government have conceded and i believe that the noble lord lord meston and others who argued the case in committee have a right to congratulate themselves on a very major change <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house before we reach amendment no <e> <s> will the minister consider whether it would not be appropriate to agree also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not suggesting that he should answer now but i think he would agree that the subsection would be stronger with amendment no <e> <s> and that it would not be out of keeping with what he has already said <e> <s> in that hope and in the light of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am far from convinced by the noble earls first argument about the hotels <e> <s> all that he has shown is that the elaborate system which is being constructed by the bill with the three types of community charge and the national business tax does not stand up to detailed examination <e> <s> if we were dealing only with a business rate and a single community charge there might be a better case <e> <s> the analogy between hotels and hostels subject to collective community charge might be better than it really is and it might be as the noble earl has claimed <e> <s> however his other two arguments appear to have some force <e> <s> certainly the argument that there would be great administrative difficulties in hostels if they had to determine whether someone was subject to a personal community charge elsewhere has been sufficient to convince me that the right course would be to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology to the house and specifically to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for having drawn attention to the financial effects of the policy to which the government wish the house to agree <e> <s> having decided at the beginning of your lordships committee stage that it wished to see a flat-rate community charge i believe that it is the proper responsibility of this house to look at the proposition carefully and critically to consider the costs and possible drawbacks of the system and to seek to improve them so far as possible <e> <s> that is what our amendment does <e> <s> it is not a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it cannot be claimed in any way that it criticises the principle of the community charge <e> <s> it draws the attention of the house and the public to the enormously greater costs which will be involved in the administration of our local government finance system <e> <s> it suggests that it should be the governments responsibility to pay a larger proportion than is now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess i am surprised that the minister should call in aid clause <e> <s> indeed it is true that clause provides that the secretary of state has the power which is called a safety net to introduce grants for a transitional period to cushion the blow to local authorities of the change in the financing system <e> <s> however the grants are made to the local authorities and therefore in so far as they affect the community charge they affect the community charge for all rich and poor whereas we are proposing a direct recognition of the problems of individuals who are in hardship <e> <s> that is a very different proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i have worries in addition to those expressed by my noble friend lord jay <e> <s> in the first part of his speech the minister was entirely plausible in giving reasons why the secretary of state for social services should be able to pass on information when an applicant for income support is also making an application for a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> with the leave of the house perhaps i may put it to him again in the light of his assurances that there can be no conceivable objection to his agreeing to the amendment which completes the statement that he has just made <e> <s> the effect will be to say shall not be sold rather than may not be sold <e> <s> i fear that i have not done a concordance of the documents before me but the minister is well aware of the point <e> <s> would it not be stronger and more effective to agree amendment no <e> <s> as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say <e> <s> i said a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not take a strong position as regards the later amendments which have now been spoken to by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> i feel very strongly that equality of treatment which is the defence of the government for the attachment of social security benefits is a sham <e> <s> it can only be a sham at this level of income where income support is designed only to provide a minimum subsistence level <e> <s> any deduction from that level of income will cause not just poverty but real deprivation <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with care to what the noble lord says about the drafting of bills and i accept that a technical difference may be introduced by amendment no <e> <s> which means that we have not found exactly the right form of words <e> <s> however the purpose of the amendment is very clear <e> <s> whether it is in the scope of existing provision for deductions from social security earnings or whether it introduces a parallel provision the purpose is to ensure that those already on the minimum subsistence level through no fault of their own are not because of where they live and because of the level of community charge in the area where they live reduced to a state below the level of poverty of real deprivation <e> <s> if the wording is wrong that can always be put right at third reading given the good will of the house <e> <s> but the principle is so important that i do not believe it would be right for me to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i therefore seek the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press the minister further on my second request that he suggests i put it no higher than this to his right honourable and honourable friends that if there is any danger of any lack of co-operation with the police a circular might be issued or a message got through to the police forces that there is no substantive difference in the wording of this bill and the wording of the general rate act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no objections to the amendments but they give me the opportunity since i was not in the chamber when the noble earl made his earlier announcement to say that this is not thank you no <e> <s> because clauses are being withdrawn it is thank you nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not discussing amendment no <e> <s> we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady stedman which i understand is supported by the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> i t seems to me that the amendment is as reasonable as one could possibly imagine <e> <s> it provides for a consultation procedure which in almost every case ought to result in agreement without dispute between the district council and the parish council <e> <s> however it then provides in the case of last resort for an arbitrator who if necessary could be appointed by the secretary of state so that the matter will not drag on and may he resolved within a reasonable period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is i think jumping the gun <e> <s> third reading of the education reform bill will not take place until next week <e> <s> the minister does not know any more than i <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is saying that he will then move to restore clause b i shall have to ask him how much it costs to put down an amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble earls statement which i can confirm meets my point in amendment no <e> <s> and confirms my wisdom in not moving it <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply the noble earl said that the association was no longer in the public interest <e> <s> will he indicate to the house whether this change so that it is no longer in the public interest has resulted in any loss to the public purse <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl talks about reducing the liability does he mean that there is some extra liability to the public purse as a result of this affair even though it may be reduced by the actions taken <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us in this house must approach the amendments with the utmost respect for their movers for their knowledge experience and compassion and for the work of the charities which they have described to us <e> <s> those charities are enormously valuable to our society <e> <s> i cannot hope to compete with noble lords who have already spoken in describing the work they do <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble earl for his confirmation of the cost <e> <s> perhaps he would be good enough to help the house further by telling us what percentage that is of the total national non-domestic rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened most carefully to what the noble earl lord caithness said in response to an earlier amendment about the governments regulating powers under schedule <e> <s> i also listened most carefully to what the noble lord lord hesketh said about those regulating powers and the present consultations with local authorities <e> <s> it is a pity that what he said was written before our previous debate <e> <s> it has not taken into account the discussion that we had and the strength of feeling shown on all sides of the house about the inadequacy of the proposals to use the regulating powers under schedule for such purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords when this matter was debated in committee i held my peace <e> <s> i took the view that this was a matter upon which there should not be a party whip <e> <s> i still take that view and i would not have the temerity to advise my noble friend lord mason of barnsley and still less attempt to instruct him as to what he should do <e> <s> we could take a relaxed point of view about it at the committee stage and see what was the force of the arguments <e> <s> i have never heard a longer succession of speeches of blatant special pleading as i did at the committee stage in favour of the amendments put forward by my noble friend and others <e> <s> as a party we are not exactly lovers of agricultural derating and we are certainly not going to attempt to extend or reinstate it for what is clearly a money-making business <e> <s> it does not differ in any social way from any other kind of industry which pays rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for coming in after the minister but the debate has taken a slightly unusual form because the grouping did not quite work <e> <s> i cannot let this matter go without expressing a deep sense of nausea at the idea that we should have to fight every inch of the way for the rights of the homeless those in deep poverty and those who go to crisis at christmas and to the sue ryder workshops and over and over again have to plead a humanitarian case for those in real need while the noble lord can stand up with a straight face and ask for the derating of sporting rights <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is not a member of any church i do not feel disposed to oppose the amendment <e> <s> since the amendments seem to be wide-ranging concessions it would be helpful if the minister could tell us what the cost of the exemptions is likely to be <e> <s> that was considered to be an important matter when we were dealing with charities and it would be helpful to have those figures on this amendment as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for his response to my amendments <e> <s> i accept that on this occasion the need for additional consultation makes it more appropriate to use order-making powers rather than have this on the face of the bill <e> <s> i think that that is entirely proper <e> <s> i shall withdraw my amendments on that basis with renewed thanks <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies perhaps i may add my general support to the point made by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> the position which we have tried to adopt in respect of this bill as regards those issues which concern care in the community that is the issue of the community charge or rates status of those who might be in hospital being cared for at home or in a nursing home is that so far as possible the bill should be neutral <e> <s> the provisions of the bill should <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be thought that our support for these proposals which has been known for a long time implies agreement with what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has just said <e> <s> the reason why rates have been coming down in certain london boroughs is rate capping <e> <s> i suppose that the noble lord is not fully aware of the effects of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the charitable way to describe the ministers answer is that it is the argument of last resort <e> <s> when one has no real case to put forward one relies on the fact that under law any minister or secretary of state must act reasonably and fairly <e> <s> one cannot show that the law is obliging him to act in a proper way <e> <s> one therefore relies on the last remnants of common law responsibilities <e> <s> it really is not good enough <e> <s> my noble kinsman lord carr rightly said in a very penetrating speech which was not really answered that there must be calculations there <e> <s> they must be in the minds of those who are doing the sums in marsham street <e> <s> a first principle of management i should have thought would be that one should share these thoughts with the people who are so heavily affected by them <e>", "<cs> my lords as dr johnson would have said that is not even assertion that is mere asseveration <e> <s> there is no justification anywhere on the face of the bill we have only the words of the noble earl that it is the governments intention to carry out what he says <e> <s> there is nothing which talks about a needs assessment there is nothing which says how the needs assessment is to be explained or calculated <e> <s> none of these things appears on the face of the bill <e> <s> there has been no firm indication of how the regulations are to be framed <e> <s> i am not doubting the good faith of the noble earl far from it but i am saying that the government have a duty which is wider than ministerial statements at report stage in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords local authority finance officers are very able and dedicated people and almost any system can be made to work somewhere <e> <s> it does not mean that it makes sense managerially to do this <e> <s> it does not mean that it is right to have a capping system which applies after the charge has already been levied and involves the possibility of a charge changing <e> <s> i am totally unconvinced by those arguments but i thought that they would be put forward <e> <s> if i needed convincing the minister has convinced me that in-year capping is a deeply flawed system and that if they had to have any capping at all with which i do not agree the government approached the issue better in the rates act the previous-year capping system <e> <s> that is an issue to which we must return having elucidated the possibility of a rational and effective in-year capping system <e> <s> i beg leave to withdrawn the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is there an opportunity for the government to extend the powers of local authorities as the noble viscount suggested when we come to the standardisation of electrical equipment within the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale not only for the way in which he moved his amendment but for the clear thought which went into its drafting and the way in which it ingeniously if i may say so seeks to provide for the objectives which the government claim to have in mind with the other objective of accountability which they have always maintained that they are seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down she seems to be confusing the needs assessment with the national average <e> <s> she would be entitled to claim although i think that she would be wrong that no local authority needs to have a community charge higher than the needs assessment <e> <s> however i do not believe that even the government claim that <e> <s> the differences about which we are talking concern the way in which the rebate will be calculated based on the national average <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble baroness would claim that the national average will be per cent <e> <s> and that there will not be some higher and some lower community charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the first two noble lords who spoke from the government benches have failed to understand the nature of management in local government and that the last the noble baroness lady blatch has totally failed to understand the nature either of the government proposals or of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is a bit rich for the minister to be quoting widdicombe against me when the government are determinedly refusing to take up a position about the recommendations of the widdicombe report <e> <s> it is rather like an atheist quoting the bible to support his case <e> <s> i do not believe the government have any status from

effect to them where they need legislation or administrative action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house listened carefully to the minister <e> <s> i retain and i shall always retain one

are not contributing to the english national opera or the london festival ballet <e> <s> this was a specific grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> i rise partly to tempt the minister to his feet <e> <s> surely there will have to be a new equalisation scheme anyway because of the abolition of ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to find that the noble baroness is converted to the principle of ability to pay for the community charge <e> <s> she is a welcome conversion <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble earl for repeating not just one statement but four statements on four different topics which have been made in another place <e> <s> the four topics are capital expenditure the past revenue support grant which will require legislation the statement of the rate support grant for and finally a statement on capping <e> <s> these are major matters to be dealt with in a short statement considered at such short notice in light of the fact that the central consultative committee on local government finance is meeting only next monday and that so far only a draft agenda has been issued to the local authorities taking part <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to come back <e> <s> there were two points where the noble earl in his answer to the noble lord lord rippon positively went against what the statement says <e> <s> he says that the statement gives greater flexibility to local authorities but at two points the statement says the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the key role played in research matters by the natural environment research council perhaps the minister will tell the house by how much government funding of the nerc has dropped in real terms over the past five years or whatever period is suitable for the answer <e> <s> will the minister confirm that only last week job losses were reported by the natural environment research council which included serious job losses at the institute of oceanographic sciences which is very important in the study of the greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since i became interested in public affairs there have been people in positions of authority who have thought that the housing crisis the housing problem was capable of resolution in their lifetime and by simple means <e> <s> when i was young it used to be by bricks and mortar <e> <s> harold macmillan did a magnificent job in increasing the amount of house building <e> <s> during the labour government of i remember being bullied mercilessly by the man who is now the noble lord lord mellish who spoke in his capacity as minister for housing and local government not of bricks and mortar but rather of concrete and steel <e> <s> however the emphasis was on the idea that you had to build more in order to solve the housing crisis <e> <s> the noble lord lord goodman reminded us that even though that is not enough it is certainly an essential element in any effective housing policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i formally thank the noble lord for introducing these regulations in this house <e> <s> i say formally because we are far from satisfied either with some of the regulations themselves or with the brief which has been given to the noble lord in introducing them <e> <s> in at least two respects it is positively misleading <e> <s> i believe that the fundamental difference between us and the government as regards these regulations is that they seem to think of the regulations as being a burden on developers and on the authorities concerned whereas we see them as i believe the european community also sees them as possibly being benefits not only to the environment but to all of us living in it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the question is put perhaps i may say that i have been considering very carefully what the noble lord has said in response to our criticisms <e> <s> i think that on mature consideration the noble lord may feel that he would do better to have an opportunity to consider them in more detail <e> <s> after all my noble friend lord northfield only started with the first section of projects under annex ii <e> <s> i am sure that he could have continued <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be right for the house to allow these regulations to proceed without further consideration <e> <s> accordingly i beg to move that further consideration of these regulations be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would be able to help the house before he moves on from that point <e> <s> on the status of the practice note i asked him specifically whether the community charge registration officer would be able to use that as a defence if he was challenged by the district auditor or by judicial review or by the secretary of state suggesting that he had not compiled the register with sufficient vigour <e> <s> it is important in understanding the status of the practice notes to know whether that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to what the minister said <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his clear explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is thank you number but i should like to make it thank you number star or even number two stars <e> <s> when we come to them i shall withdraw my amendments nos <e> <s> and not only with alacrity but with enthusiasm because as the minister pointed out the amendments which the government have now put down go further than we were seeking to go at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a precedent for this if noble lords will permit me to explain <e> <s> on several occasions at report stage when we had a group of amendments which included government amendments and where it was important for the proper consideration of that group to know what the governments thinking was we agreed that the minister could speak at the outset of the debate without prejudice to the right of other noble lords to join in afterwards <e> <s> i hope that the house will agree that that is appropriate on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be appropriate if i gave the view of the opposition on this matter as early as possible <e> <s> we have listened carefully to what the noble earl has said <e> <s> we have no hesitation in saying that the concession that he has made is not only generous but also the more appropriate of the two options open to the house at this stage of the bill <e> <s> we never fully agreed with the noble lord lord sandford that the exercise of local authority discretion was in itself bad <e> <s> i believe that he is somewhat wrong in saying that all local authority associations agree with him on that matter <e> <s> the association of district councils may well agree but some other local authority associations do not hold that view <e>", "<cs> my lords the other way round in the sense that the association of district councils wishes to exercise discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that further intelligence <e> <s> we on these benches believe that there is scope for local authority discretion to be exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that my speech might have come out of lewis carrolls <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to express our support for this amendment which we supported when the noble lord brought it forward at committee stage <e> <s> the more one thinks about it the more it seems that not to have the qualification that the doctor should have experience of mental health would not only weaken the definition that is to be found in the bill but would also be out of line with many other mental health provisions in our legislation <e> <s> i hope that the government will sec their way to supporting or agreeing to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can ask for much more than that <e> <s> it is certainly true that the amendments that we originally proposed which the government ultimately accepted were moved on behalf of a particular body community service volunteers <e> <s> but as the minister has acknowledged in his reply there are other bodies some of which have as volunteers older people who presumably would be very much on the same footing as the young volunteers to whom my noble friend lady ewart-biggs referred <e> <s> i am content to leave it to his good sense to take the points which have been made in our debate fully into account when the regulations are prepared <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was brought up in part on the banks of the jed i hope that the waters in which bathed as a child which then flowed into the teviot and subsequently into the tweed will not become an anomaly as they reach the sea <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord morton of shuna and myself i should like to express my sincere thanks to the noble lord lord sanderson for the amendments <e> <s> they rationalise and put into order the amendment proposed by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with a feeling of some relief that we reach this stage of the bill <e> <s> it has been a long tedious sometimes less than tedious process since second reading on th may <e> <s> it will not be any surprise to your lordships to know that we on these benches still feel as strongly about the principle of a flat rate tax a poll tax in place of the present rating system with all its faults as we did at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord was in his place when i referred to the division on the chelwood amendment <e> <s> it was not part of my case that it was only conservative peers who supported the government on that occasion <e> <s> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will permit me to correct an unpardonable omission from my own speech <e> <s> i omitted to thank my noble friends on this opposition front bench for the work which they did on the bill <e> <s> it was truly a team effort and i am extremely grateful to them as i am grateful for the co-operation of those on the benches to my right and a number of cross-benchers who worked with us on the amendments <e> <s> i couple that appreciation with thanks to those advisers who assisted us in preparing amendments to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that those of us on these benches have any objection to the purpose of the order <e> <s> however it is necessary to draw attention to the report of the joint committee on statutory instruments which points out that it purports to have retrospective effect where the parent statute confers no express authority to do so <e> <s> i would not even draw the attention of the house to that if it were not for the fact that the report of the joint committee says that the department replied to its questions with a memorandum which may be found in appendix <e> <s> when one looks at appendix the memorandum refers to <e>", "<cs> i am indeed happy to speak to any amendments tabled in my name <e> <s> however it was my intention to speak principally to the amendments relating to clause to which amendment no <e> <s> is really a paving amendment <e> <s> i do not claim that it adds anything to the scope of the amendments to clause <e>", "<cs> it has been agreed through the usual channels with the agreement of the government and the department that the amendments should be taken together <e> <s> it is a longstanding tradition of this place that we should seek to save time by grouping amendments into meaningful groups <e> <s> i hope that the committee will agree that this is a useful tradition which should be continued <e>", "<cs> i am happy to take any amendment individually if the committee thinks that that will further the committee business <e> <s> as it is we have an agreed grouping which we hope is helpful <e> <s> morever i hope that we will not abandon the useful convention that we can have an opportunity to consider amendments together and to consider matters at a time which is usually thought to be for the convenience of this place <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit that this is one of those cases where to a considerable extent i have drafted the amendment myself <e> <s> not being a lawyer i am capable of being seriously wrong but as i read it the sentence will now read if the landlord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest that the point made by the noble lord lord broxbourne would be dealt with if he accepted my amendment which removes the words calculated to <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to return to the question of grouping which was raised originally by the noble lord lord coleraine <e> <s> however i must point out that the grouping of amendments was accepted by the government <e> <s> in addition i was asked by the government whips office just before lunch today to add amendments nos <e> <s> and to the list <e> <s> clearly there is some agreement between the front benches as to the relevance and interconnection of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i think that it may be helpful if after further reflection i respond to the points made by the noble lords lord coleraine and lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i defended our grouping of amendments on the grounds that we were free to group as we wished <e> <s> however i accept the points that both noble lords have made <e> <s> it might he for the convenience of the committee if i said now without in any way denying the government the opportunity to reply to this or any other amendments which have been discussed that i propose to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> and return to the matter on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i do not want to inhibit debate <e> <s> i have indicated that i shall withdraw the amendment but i think that it is proper that noble lords should have freedom to intervene <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the recognition by the minister that this is a matter of very great importance <e> <s> to return to the procedural matters that we have just been discussing it was for that reason that we thought that it should be the first item on the committees agenda <e> <s> we put it into clause because that clause which deals with the creation of assured tenancies is something that the outside world will see as being the potential cause of an increase in harassment <e> <s> that was the thinking behind it <e> <s> we thought that tenants who saw clause going through unchallenged or unamended would <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first respond to the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> when i was saying that we accepted that private rented accommodation could be a valuable part of the housing market it certainly was not because we were concerned for the interests of landlords <e> <s> our concern is that there should be decent accommodation on a wide variety of bases for a wide variety of people at affordable rents <e> <s> if some of that can be achieved by giving landlords a reasonable return on investment there can be no ideological objection to that <e>", "<cs> having known the noble baroness for a long time i can say that i have total respect for her probity and sympathise with the difficulty that she experienced with the rent tribunal <e> <s> i am afraid that she is not typical of landlords who will he using the shorthold tenancy procedure <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we shall oppose the amendment <e> <s> however i should be grateful if the minister would clear up one or two possible effects of the amendment and perhaps correct any misunderstandings that i may have on the matter <e> <s> it is obvious that if people are contemplating shared ownership they will need to be made aware as clearly as possible about the new regime that will apply to shared ownership <e> <s> does it mean that the rental part of shared ownership could be on the basis for example of assured shorthold tenancies or is it only on the basis of assured tenancies <e> <s> it would be helpful if the minister will indicate in what way the government propose to let people on shared ownership leases know what their new legal status is <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene <e> <s> however the noble lord lord trafford is seeking to persuade us as a matter of policy that we are not in favour of private rented property <e> <s> in fact he seems to be trying to put us off private rented property with his examples <e> <s> he is saying that a landlord should be guaranteed against any change in family circumstances which might work to his disadvantage later on and that a tenancy which was arranged with a single person would not continue on the same terms if that person married if his marriage broke up or if there were obligations to other members of his family <e> <s> unless he is saying that it is difficult to understand the meaning of his intervention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has certainly succeeded in diminishing my enthusiasm for the private rented sector <e> <s> if tenants in the private rented sector cannot change their family circumstances after the original lease was signed without losing their security of tenure the value of the private rented sector as a viable part of our housing market is clearly drastically limited <e>", "<cs> surely in such a case the landlord is borrowing money on the market and uses the house as security <e> <s> however there is no reason that the tenant should suffer in any way under those circumstances <e>", "<cs> before i make up my mind what to do about amendment no <e> <s> can i press the minister for a moment more regarding amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> i accept what he says and i appreciate that it is a defect of the amendments that they cover property which changed hands through inheritance rather than by purchase <e> <s> i accept that the effect of the amendments would be as he said to bite on the good as well as on the bad <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> we could together make some improvements of real value <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i believe that both noble lords have misunderstood the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> i am not attacking the three-month period or the power of the landlord to go to the courts which the noble earl lord lytton seems to think i am <e> <s> in the amendment i am saying that when the landlord goes to the court after three months there are different periods for different types of tenant which again i am not attacking the court should have an opportunity to order something such as repayment a suspended payment or whatever it may be rather than be forced to order possession without any discretion <e> <s> that is the basis of my argument <e>", "<cs> i have not misunderstood the noble lord lord trafford at all <e> <s> i must insist that i am not suggesting any change in the period as proposed by the government <e> <s> i am saying that there may be the circumstances which i gave where the landlord had failed to collect the rent or had not given proper receipts as well as circumstances where the arrears were totally out of the tenants control and would be put right as soon as the housing benefit or the maintenance payments were made <e> <s> it would be put right as soon as the court was satisfied that there was no doubt that the housing benefit or the maintenance payments would be paid <e> <s> under those circumstances i am suggesting that a courts discretion is better than a mandatory possession order <e> <s> that is regardless of the period of arrears <e>", "<cs> this is the second time today that the minister has sought to use the argument that because there are arguments on either side of his position he must be right <e> <s> i do not know the correct syllogistic formulation for that fallacy <e> <s> however i assure him that it is a fallacy <e> <s> we put forward reasonable arguments the government give unreasonable answers other noble lords put forward extremely unreasonable answers and on that basis the government claim that they are right <e> <s> that will not wash <e> <s> the minister ought to stop using that argument <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me i am curious about the phrase repairing the tenants roof <e> <s> presumably he is repairing his own roof if he is the landlord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> it is indeed the facts in support of the argument that we are asking for rather than the argument <e> <s> i apologise for my mis-statement of the law <e> <s> however it will be readily seen that when i talk about the ground and the particulars thereof i am talking about the facts and not about any argument <e> <s> it will be consistent with other aspects of the civil law <e> <s> it will be patently just that the landlord should give particulars of his complaint of basis on which possession is being sought before the court is required to give any decision on the matter <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i could not ask for more than that <e> <s> i am grateful to the government and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for his introduction to the orders and for his candid admission for the shocking error in draftsmanship or map-making to which he confessed <e> <s> he pointed out the fact that the orders were unopposed in another place <e> <s> certainly we do not wish to oppose them in this house this evening <e> <s> our understanding is that they give effect to the decision which parliament took in may in setting up the urban development corporations <e> <s> i understand that the vesting orders were made in conjunction and in full co-operation with the local authorities and public bodies concerned <e> <s> on that basis it would be entirely inappropriate for us to dissent from the means having assented to the end <e>", "<cs> i confess that there is a fine balance to be struck between the abhorrent principle of retrospection and the effectiveness of the legislation <e> <s> when the committee debated the matters in preliminary form last thursday the government recognised the necessity for protection against harassment and eviction <e> <s> one of the ways in which they sought to give effect to that undertaking was to introduce the measures as of the date of first publication of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i am grateful also to those on the government benches and to the noble lord lord monson for their support for individual parts of my amendments although i do not claim that any of them have supported the whole series <e> <s> i must point out that the amendments are framed within the context and in the spirit of the governments own clauses and within the spirit of chapter iv of part i we have not attempted in any way to change the definition of what harassment is about <e> <s> the phrase <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord trafford about the pronunciation of harassment with the accent on the second syllable <e> <s> it has a much more pejorative rasp and is clearly much more effective <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not know about anti-scots prejudice <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord meston that i recognise that there are tenants who behave badly <e> <s> that is human nature <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord jenkin that we must preserve the thrust of chapter iv <e> <s> we must do nothing to weaken it unnecessarily or damagingly <e> <s> i fear that to change shall to may runs the risk of the courts on the whole going over to the other side <e> <s> however it is only a matter of days since i was defending strongly the concept of the courts discretion <e> <s> if we reached the stage where a court would not convict a landlord because the law was too rigid we should not achieve our objective <e> <s> to that limited extent although i do not support the amendment there is a point at which the government would do well to reconsider <e>", "<cs> i thought that my measure of agreement was very limited indeed <e> <s> perhaps i may say in response to what the noble earl has just said that i agree entirely with him <e> <s> i think he has provided a very satisfactory answer to all the criticisms which have been made of this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> in general i support the amendment but i must protest as a resident on the borders of crouch end and as one who represented tottenham for years on the greater london council at the slur in the noble lords speech about those delightful neighbourhoods <e> <s> he ironically suggested that they could not be resorts <e> <s> let me assure him that there are few more delightful places in which to live and work than tottenham and crouch end <e>", "<cs> i must take note of the ministers last remarks and of his assurance that the national federation of housing associations has been consulted on the matter <e> <s> i shall certainly look to brief myself better than i feel i have been briefed at the moment about the consultations which have taken place <e> <s> i welcome what the minister said about the open mind with which he approaches the matter <e> <s> if i think it is necessary to come back at a later stage with an amended proposal then i am sure that i shall have an opportunity to persuade the minister that there is a kernel of truth behind what we are saying even if we have not covered all the possibilities <e> <s> for example i was particularly impressed by what he said about the danger in our proposals for short-stay hostels <e> <s> i agree that it would not have been our intention to include short-stay hostels in our proposals <e> <s> in those circumstances it is best that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment to which my name is added <e> <s> i am bound to say that when i first saw the text i was concerned about the inclusion of the common council of the city of london and the council of the isles of scilly <e> <s> i thought that in the rarified atmosphere of the city of london this sort of thing was hardly likely to happen <e> <s> certainly in the salubrious surroundings of the isles of scilly it would never happen <e> <s> i have to say that i am wrong <e>", "<cs> i must express my gratitude to the minister for explaining my amendments far more lucidly than i did <e> <s> certainly in his expose of the situation he leads me to think that the loopholes that i suspect exist in the government drafting are in fact quite serious ones <e> <s> even if i have the drafting wrong now and i think it is highly likely this is a matter to which i must return at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i could not ask for more than that <e> <s> i am certainly willing to withdraw it and to make myself available for discussion if he would find that helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee it was indeed my intention to speak also to those amendments <e> <s> with these amendments we return to the question of houses in multiple <e>", "<cs> the ministers reference to the former minister for housing and planning confirms what had only been rumour up till now that he himself has changed his responsibilities to include i think at least housing or some additional responsibilities within the department <e> <s> he seems unable to confirm that i thought it was now confirmed <e> <s> i was about to congratulate him on his increased responsibilities if that is true i congratulate him sincerely <e>", "<cs> the minister is as disarming as ever <e> <s> i am not entirely satisfied with his analysis of the situation <e> <s> he has already agreed that there are obligations on the old landlord for example in respect of breaches of tenancy agreements <e> <s> the obligation which we propose that the old landlord should have the responsibility of notifying the tenants of the last known address of the new landlord is not particularly onerous <e> <s> it ought not to cause the kind of difficulty which the government appear to see <e> <s> however in view of the ministers undertaking to take the matter away and look at it again which i assume implies recognition that the matter is one which could and should be dealt with in the bill if a suitable way can be found for doing it i think it is proper for me to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall he happy to respond to the noble and learned lord when we come to later amendments where that matter becomes an issue <e> <s> but the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington has not raised it in her amendment and i do not believe it is relevant to our discussion on this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> and me my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but i did not say that the government had always wanted to deny the student nurses the per cent <e> <s> what i said was that the further concessions which have been made were about the per cent <e> <s> that is our concern <e>", "<cs> my lords on the previous group of amendments i refrained from commenting on the constitutional aspects of the matter not least because of my manifest incapacity to do so <e> <s> on this group of amendments i have raised two amendments which might be thought to have constitutional significance <e> <s> i think that it is right that i should introduce them properly <e> <s> first i wish to point out what a short way they go <e> <s> amendments numbered b and b do not in any way question the judgment of mr speaker or the right of another place to oppose any amendment on privileged grounds <e> <s> nor do they in any way delay the progress of this bill <e> <s> they accept the amendments which have already been spoken to by the noble earl that the house do not insist on their amendments to which the commons have disagreed <e> <s> so if these two amendments are passed the bill can go through without a single seconds delay <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not wish to intervene perhaps i may point out that in introducing the amendments the minister said that he was speaking to the whole list of amendments including my own <e> <s> in courtesy to the house therefore i thought it right that i should speak to my own amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the respect expressed by the noble lord lord henderson for the financial privilege of the house of commons <e> <s> it will not be unknown to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i agree with the labour party manifesto of <e> <s> i am in favour of the abolition of the house of lords <e> <s> however while it is here we have to make it work have we not <e> <s> i confess that my amendments in this respect are my second choice <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i welcome the noble lord to the dispatch box on this bill but i can hardly be expected to welcome what he has said <e> <s> i think he has taken a very narrow view of the purport of these amendments and of the impact of the legislation on the housing association movement <e>", "<cs> the government say it and the tenants guarantee says it <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to the response of the minister <e> <s> on the growth of the housing corporation he has made an assertion and has not given any evidence to indicate that it will do anything less than grow in proportion to the number of properties with which it deals <e> <s> he has not given me any indication that it will not grow more because of additional responsibilities placed upon it <e>", "<cs> i did not expect any more than that <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness will no doubt read what has been said <e> <s> i believe that he is the minster responsible for housing and he may be in a position to be more positive <e> <s> although the detail may be questionable i believe that the thrust of the amendment is still valid <e>", "<cs> we are faced with a body which will grow very substantially despite the ministers denial <e> <s> we are faced with a body which quite unlike the training commission which is an analogy that we must make does not have any representation from outside interests except by the goodwill of the secretary of state <e> <s> after all the training commission and the manpower services commission before it is the prime example in this country of the tripartite composition of public bodies which is such a strong feature of the european community in which we are becoming increasingly involved as approaches very quickly <e>", "<cs> i fear that the minister has done little more than repeat the assurances given by his colleagues in may <e> <s> we never doubted that it was the governments intent as of may or july to continue to have local authorities playing an important role in the funding of new housing association projects <e> <s> that is not the issue in question <e> <s> we are saying that while intent can change more effort is required to change statutes <e> <s> we think that the intent should be enshrined in statute rather than left to the whim of governments who may be less favourably inclined to local authorities than the present government if that were possible <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds i am bound to say that that was an extraordinarily sanguine response to the amendment <e> <s> it reminds me of the bursar of the oxford college who wanted to criticise the colleges investment policy on the grounds that the previous years had been totally exceptional in economic policy <e> <s> when the minister says that there has been plenty of money for investment in housing except in the past few decades he seems to be whistling in the dark <e> <s> during the past few decades in particular the whole climate of investment in housing has been changed because we have subsidised private ownership on a large scale through tax relief on mortgages <e> <s> the minister did not even refer to that major consideration in housing investment in his response to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> for once i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment does not require <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for bringing the code before your lordships house <e> <s> let me say at the outset that in accordance with convention we shall not oppose a code which has been approved by the other place <e> <s> i notice that the minister in his speech glossed over the fact that the amendment to the act which was made by the act was an amendment to the decision reached by this house that such a code should not be obligatory on local authorities <e> <s> the words have regard to the code as a condition in the act were imposed by the government against the judgment of this house when it considered the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fascinated by what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i understood that the only inquiry that had been allowed by the city of westminster was an internal inquiry <e> <s> i did not know that there was to be an independent inquiry <e>", "<cs> which things my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious that the noble earls responsibilities in the department of the environment now include housing of which we are very glad but they do not include water <e> <s> will not the noble earl have the responsibility of piloting the bill attempting to privatise the water authorities through this house <e> <s> can the noble earl assure the house that any bill for which he takes responsibility will have adequate safeguards to ensure that the new water authorities do not in any way damage the environment of our beaches but help to make it better <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from residents of sheffield in the following terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from the residents of greenwich in the following terms <e>", "<cs> i fear that that is the answer i expected <e> <s> it is clear that the government are not prepared to take the step which seems to us to be entirely appropriate and give to the local authority which is elected by the people in the housing action trust area the opportunity to make a judgment on whether or not the designation is appropriate <e> <s> we are forced to consider the second alternative which is the consultation of tenants <e> <s> as the noble earl has said that is a separate issue <e> <s> in order to debate that matter without further delay i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will permit me it is i have many faults but being wrong is not one of them <e>", "<cs> the ministers response has a certain bland plausibility <e> <s> unfortunately it bears very little relationship to the situation as seen by the tenants in these estates <e> <s> this arises not so much from the distorted publicity which the minister alleges has come from other groups but from the publicity from which he himself proudly quotes <e> <s> the noble earl cannot deny that the governments case has been put to the tenants because he has himself quoted it <e>", "<cs> they too have had an estate action programme but it has been frozen because of the proposal for the housing action trust <e>", "<cs> it did indeed and it included tenants from estates which are affected by the housing action trusts <e> <s> these are people who do not make the distinction between part iv and part iii of the bill and i believe they can be excused for that <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that the government are determined to go ahead with these housing action trusts regardless of the past history of the estates and of any action which is being taken by local authorities often in conjunction with central government to improve these estates <e> <s> they are doing so for a political reason and in order to diminish and humiliate local government <e> <s> that is the purpose behind these measures <e> <s> the amount of money proposed for the housing action trusts is derisory compared with the amount of money provided for housing improvement programmes and which has been taken away from local authorities all over the country and not simply from the six local authorities mentioned <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lords speech was written before the committee took the decision to ensure that there <e>", "<cs> the minister has fairly and clearly described what happens when there is a positive value placed on the property <e> <s> he has said that it will be treated as a capital receipt subject to any restrictions on the use of such receipts <e>", "<cs> i can see that the minister and i have the same aim but i am not convinced that the bill achieves it <e> <s> will he confirm or otherwise that the conditions laid down in clause are stricter than those laid down in clause <e> <s> they are certainly different <e> <s> there is no doubt about that because the flexibility given to the corporation and the secretary of state in clause is much greater <e> <s> in other words the assurances which are given in clause are more satisfactory to us <e> <s> will he confirm that the more secure regime in clause is the dominant one <e> <s> if he does then we can think about it between now and the next stage of the bills proceedings <e>", "<cs> on the basis that it is not the governments intention to introduce a new and less rigid approval procedure for the disposal of securely tenanted hat households that is what i am really seeking to ensure i think it is proper that i should withdraw the amendment <e> <s> perhaps the minister and i can have a word about it before the next stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are talking here about the possibility in the end of landlords being struck off the register are we not <e> <s> will the list of landlords who have been struck off in that way be available <e> <s> further will the reasons for such action be available so that existing tenants unable to get away from those landlords can at least be informed of what has gone wrong and the extent to which the landlords <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that is not satisfactory <e> <s> it is clear from the wording of the amendment that that is what will happen <e> <s> we shall let the amendment go through but i cannot say that i am satisfied with the degree of briefing which has been given to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee and to the deputy chairman <e> <s> i did not realise that i should have said not moved to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> my speech related to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i hope that in the relatively clublike atmosphere in which the committee is being conducted at this hour of the night it will be possible for me to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take that last point first <e> <s> the minister certainly convinced me that the drafting of my amendment is defective in that it says that the full cost to the authority of buying a property should be added to the expenditure prescribed under part viii of the local government planning and land act <e> <s> he quite rightly pointed out that the local authority will already have had a capital receipt from the disposal of the property to the housing action trust <e> <s> therefore i feel that i should withdraw the amendment in order to find a way to reflect the net cost to a local authority rather than the gross cost <e>", "<cs> the former parliamentary under-secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those final words which give me some reassurance because i am bound to say that the noble earls first words struck me as totally irrational <e> <s> to say that one embarks on a new procedure of interrogating junior officers simply because the information is important does not seem to me to be a rational way to proceed <e> <s> i am glad that in his final remarks the minister recognised that point <e> <s> on the basis of what he has said i am disposed to withdraw the amendment although i shall not do it just yet <e>", "<cs> it would be churlish and against my instincts and judgment if i did not respond by thanking the noble earl for his remarks <e> <s> i know that because of the pressure of business we are in the middle of the committee stage of this bill but it gives us all time to pause and read further so that <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister accept that what he has just said about hotel use for county hall is in conflict not only with the views of the london borough of lambeth but also with that of his own inspector <e> <s> after the last public inquiry his right honourable friend the secretary of state accepted the views of the inspector that a hotel was not suitable and not least the judgment of mr justice stephen brown in the high court <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to present a petition from the tenants residents and workers of the london borough of hammersmith in the following terms <e> <s> they believe that the proposals contained in the housing bill will first undermine the rights of council tenants private tenants and housing association tenants and threaten their security of tenure secondly lead to exorbitant rent levels which will push rented housing out of the reach of those in greatest need thirdly do nothing to solve the crisis of homelessness or increase the supply of decent rented housing and fourthly threaten the jobs of local authority housing workers <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> f to which the noble lord appears to be speaking was not moved <e> <s> i am speaking to amendment nos <e> <s> g h and b <e>", "<cs> i shall not respond in detail to the noble lords attempt to put words into my mouth but i shall have a later opportunity to do so <e> <s> i think it would be convenient for the committee if we did not go backwards and forwards on each item as it is raised <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate on this matter during which four major strands have emerged with which i shall deal in order of increasing importance <e> <s> first there is the question of the propriety of the grouping of the amendments <e> <s> second is the issue of the independent tellers in any ballot <e> <s> third is the issue as to whether individual tenants can in fact opt out of any decision which has been taken <e> <s> fourth which i still feel is the most important is the question of the way in which the ballot is decided <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted if the noble earl who is clearly better briefed than i am would care to do so <e> <s> he might also like to remind us about the conditions in the act which i think are also relevant <e>", "<cs> that is a statement it is not a defence is it <e> <s> since i do not have the papers in front of me i am bound to accept that there may be some precedent for it <e> <s> it does not make it right <e> <s> clearly the views that have been expressed from many sides of the committee show that this is an unsatisfactory procedure one which is a denial of democracy and one which has caused justified fear among many millions of people and here i agree strongly with my noble friend lady denington who know that a rent is an important part of their income and that security of tenure is an important part of the quality of their life <e> <s> i think it would be irresponsible of me if i did not seek the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the normal courtesy of his reply <e> <s> he goes a very small distance along the way i was urging him to move <e> <s> i think it is right that before we come to consider part iv of the bill on report the committee should be in no doubt whatsoever as regards what the electoral reform society has agreed to what its role should be and how it should be exercised as well as who pays the society <e> <s> i do not want to bring the minister to his feet again unless he wishes to add anything further <e>", "<cs> in view of all of that i think it is appropriate that i should give the minister notice that i shall seek some way of providing on the order paper an opportunity for the chamber to debate this matter perhaps in the form of an unstarred question before the bill comes back on report <e> <s> at that stage the minister will be able to consider his response perhaps more than he has been able to now <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark was surely right to warn us of sterile ideological debate <e> <s> it is simply not good enough for any of us to say either private sector housing bad public sector housing good or public sector housing bad private sector housing good <e> <s> it is not like that <e> <s> there clearly have to be both sectors in any decent range of housing provision if we are to meet the housing needs of this country <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the force of that argument and i would modify what i have said to the extent of saying that in addition to an adequate housing benefit scheme we shall be considering tomorrow whether the housing benefit scheme to come out of this bill will be adequate there must be if not subsidising of bricks and mortar in a crude way some responsibilities on those providing housing to see that the nominations go to the people in need <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that intervention because the noble lord has much more experience in these matters than i have <e> <s> he has made the point more clearly than i could have done <e> <s> it has been our experience over the years that if there is to be anything approaching adequate treatment of the homeless and those in greatest housing need heaven knows the treatment given to them now is not adequate there has to be a duty on somebody to house them <e> <s> somebody has to have a duty to be concerned for them <e> <s> a draft or even a finalised guidance which states that the new landlords have to take account of those needs is not good enough <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will agree with me that on the basis of the ministers reply it would be quite wrong for us to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i commend it to the committee <e>", "<cs> while we are on the subject and before the noble lord lord swinfen speaks again the ministers noble friends were seeking his assurance that the obligations were continuing <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble earl wanted them to continue because he described them as a burden <e> <s> however on this side of the committee we want them to continue <e> <s> our amendment no <e> <s> b refers to this exact point <e> <s> it proposes that the onward disposal of the property by an approved landlord should be only to an approved landlord perhaps this is an appropriate time for the minister to indicate that he supports that amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> that is indeed the case <e> <s> the argument that we are making in all these amendments is that the local authority the existing landlord has an important part in the pre-selection procedure <e> <s> we want to ensure that the local authority is not inhibited by the local government act which saw its passage through this chamber only a few months ago <e> <s> it is all very well to talk as if the disagreement if there is to be disagreement and there very often will be between the two parties who are seeking the control of these properties and their secured <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am particularly interested in the suggestion of a new hurdle of the per cent <e> <s> of secure tenants giving their agreement before we can <e>", "<cs> i suppose that i should have known better <e> <s> that will teach me to be even-handed and objective <e> <s> i propose three amendments which attempt to give a reasonable timescale for a local authority to do the very complex <e>", "<cs> the minister will not be surprised to hear that i am not very satisfied with that reply <e> <s> he thinks that there are unmixed motives on the part of both the applicant and the local authority when it comes to questions of delaying or speeding up the process <e> <s> it is certainly true that applicants once they have made an application in one sense will wish to see it carried through swiftly <e> <s> in another sense once they are protected by having the valuation made on the date upon which they made the application if they delay the procedures they are also delaying the time in which they pay the money without any risk of paying more money because property prices will have gone up in the intervening period <e>", "<cs> our virtual silence on this matter should not be taken to imply any agreement with the framework in which these amendments are moved <e> <s> we are strongly opposed to the voting procedures as we made clear earlier this afternoon and as we shall have to make clear again <e> <s> however when it comes to righting injustices for long leaseholders this is not a matter that we would wish to oppose <e>", "<cs> i am not unhappy that i moved this amendment because it has evoked such a considered thoughtful and courteous reply from the minister <e> <s> i have to conclude that it is good in part rather than good as a whole but there is certainly ample food for thought about the different elements which he discussed <e> <s> i shall wish to consider them before a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to echo the words of the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> despite the very heavy vote which took place this afternoon i feel that we shall find ourselves allowing through a nonsense <e> <s> we shall find ourselves in a position where objective outside bodies such as the national consumer council can accuse the government although it is itself a government-funded organisation and is therefore somewhat restricted in its scope for direct criticism of the government of inertia selling <e> <s> that is a very serious accusation <e> <s> the ncc has proposed amendments <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b and to refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am bound to say that i found the ministers explanation an exercise in advanced paranoia <e> <s> the government seem to have drafted the whole of clause on the basis that local authorities are unscrupulous bunches of people whose only concern is to avoid at all costs the transfer of properties and that they are quite capable of filling up these vast numbers of empty properties which the government keep on speaking about with tenants who will oppose the transfer of properties simply to frustrate the wishes of the applicants <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> will he tell the committee what he means by any size <e> <s> he mentioned that applications involving a number of properties of any size i assume he meant any considerable size would involve not less than weeks consultation <e> <s> what is the figure for any size <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that will do but we have gone so far towards common sense and the recognition of common sense that it would be churlish for me to do other than beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with that point first <e> <s> the noble lord lord swinfen is arguing against his own front bench <e> <s> we have just been told by the minister that that information will have to be gathered anyway in order to be supplied to the housing corporation <e> <s> so the only additional cost likely to be incurred is not in gathering the information but in sending it to the tenants and that cannot be the major part of the cost to which he refers <e>", "<cs> i intervene not because i disagree with the amendment but because in the presence of the leader and deputy leader of the house i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the noble earl on surviving a long committee day entirely by himself <e> <s> it is a tribute to his stamina and intellectual agility that he has succeeded in doing so <e> <s> it is also a tribute to the paucity of talent on the government front bench that he has been forced to do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his response <e> <s> obviously i am disappointed that the point we have attempted to raise in amendment no <e> <s> a i accept the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that response but it gives rise to two difficulties <e> <s> the first is the nature of the review body with which he has spoken <e> <s> the proposal is obviously made with good will <e> <s> the proposal that there should be a review body and a form of generalised recourse to a panel of senior rent officers is not worthless i do not wish to dismiss it out of hand <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy for giving me an opportunity to correct a misapprehension which i seem to have placed in her mind <e> <s> she appears to think that our amendments are designed to protect the local authority <e> <s> i have already explained as the minister confirmed that the interests of the local <e>", "<cs> it is the noble baroness herself who says that the question was outwith the scope of the amendment and not me <e> <s> i am not responsible for the noble baroness keeping within the rules of order but i am glad that she asked the question and was able to do so <e> <s> if she is not satisfied with the answer she received about information i hope that she will pursue the matter <e> <s> i agree with the thrust of her question <e>", "<cs> we had a substantial debate yesterday on the issue of the words may and shall <e> <s> at one stage the government were arguing that shall is really no different from may <e> <s> although i maintain the view that may is different from shall on reflection i take the view that my amendments should have said may so that they could be amended rather than shall <e> <s> i believe that the ministers criticism of me in that respect is correct <e> <s> i wish to seek leave to withdraw the amendments but i do not wish to do so without saying that i welcome what the minister said concerning the discussion that is to take place on these matters <e> <s> we shall be happy to take any part that seems appropriate in the discussions <e> <s> i know that the local authorities and the very many professional bodies concerned with housing will also be keen to do so <e> <s> i am sure that they will be as glad as i am to have heard what the minister said <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall not be deceived into thinking that the rest of this <e>", "<cs> i should hasten to get in before the minister comes back on this point so as to give him an opportunity to improve on his earlier <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that once again we find the governments determination to stamp out what we consider to be imaginary or insignificant abuses is firmer than their determination to maintain protection against hardship for those most in need in our society <e> <s> no doubt somewhere in the country there are people living in property which is too large for their needs <e> <s> i am sure that that is the case but property that is too good for their needs property that deserves a higher reasonable rent <e> <s> there may be elderly people who have lived in the same property all their lives and whose economic circumstances have become worse as they have grown older <e> <s> who are we to say what is too good for their needs <e>", "<cs> this has been a most valuable exchange and i am glad that i sat down and enabled it to take place <e> <s> first i am grateful to my noble friend lady fisher for pointing out the contradictions in the governments subsidy policy for housing <e> <s> the intervention of the noble lord lord swinfen does not help his case very much <e> <s> the point about tax relief for mortgage payments is that it is given to those who are earning at least a year that is required in order to obtain a mortgage of -and therefore to those who are by definition better off than the people of whom we are talking who are in need of housing benefit <e>", "<cs> the minister has presented a complex series of amendments in a very clear and beguiling way <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by stating what we agree with because i am afraid that we cannot go along with him on some aspects of this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> i forgot to ask the minister one question to which i should like to give him the opportunity to reply <e> <s> it is a question that has been raised by the national federation of housing associations in particular with reference to amendment no <e> <s> but probably also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> do those provisions apply to housing associations as well as to local authorities <e>", "<cs> we are in danger of causing some confusion not only in the mind of the noble lord lord hayter but in the minds of many more of us <e> <s> the amendments may not be alternatives in the mind of the noble lord lord swinfen but it is possible to argue as the noble lord lord monson and my noble friend lord carter have argued that amendment no <e> <s> a is preferable to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to try to resolve this fraternal disagreement in which we find ourselves <e> <s> the most important thing i should like to say to my noble friend is that there is an alternative which does not involve discrimination and that is the one contained in amendment no <e> <s> a which was moved by his and my noble friend lord carter <e> <s> if there is any degree of discrimination against disabled people under the present law i accept what he says that as the situation stands there is a degree of discrimination it can be resolved by the transferable discount which gives disabled people the right to buy a council property or a property with the kind of discount that they would have received on their own property <e> <s> that proposal removes the discrimination and removes per cent <e> <s> of the <e>", "<cs> nothing would please me more than if the government were to make money available to local authorities to build not only a replacement dwelling for disabled people but indeed many more <e> <s> as my noble friend lord carter said with progress being made at a level of less than per cent <e> <s> a year we are a long way off achieving adequate accommodation for disabled people <e> <s> however that situation must arise in any event and must be in addition to everything else we do <e> <s> what is proposed by way of amendment no <e> <s> does not produce a single extra unit of property suitable for disabled people <e> <s> indeed in the medium and long term it actually diminishes the pool <e> <s> surely we should be building more properties for disabled people on top of the maximum number rather than on top of a diminished number <e> <s> that is why i am worried about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would read that sentence again <e> <s> i thought i heard him say it would be wise for us to do that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord considers what to do since i was specifically referred to perhaps i may say that i think he has given the committee good advice <e> <s> it is right that there should be consultation <e> <s> we shall consider the point that he makes about the difference between paragraph and paragraph before the matter comes back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> we welcome the amendments <e> <s> any amendment that helps to maintain our national parks areas of outstanding natural beauty and similar areas as economic communities in accordance with the definition in the housing act places where people live and earn their living rather than a glorified disneyland accessible only to people wanting holiday accommodation or second homes is to be welcomed <e> <s> in so far as the amendments help to achieve that i think that they do we welcome them <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl continues with his argument i was staggered to hear him say that the expenditure involved would be demand-led expenditure <e> <s> the whole of the right-to-buy programme is demand-led expenditure is it not <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely puzzled by the ministers answer in respect of one aspect only of this matter <e> <s> he will have recognised that the wording of amendment no <e> <s> h is taken directly from clause of the bill <e> <s> yesterday after considerable debate the government amended clause of the bill to strengthen the right of tenants to opt out of a mass transfer of ownership of their properties <e> <s> yet here just because it is the council <e>", "<cs> i must immediately express our appreciation not only of the new clause amendment no <e> <s> but for the changes which the government introduced in another place to strengthen the powers of section of the race relations act and apply them to the housing corporation and the housing action trusts <e> <s> indeed it is appropriate that that should be the case because after all this bill seeks a very major shift of responsibility for public housing from local authorities to the housing corporation and through the housing corporation to individual housing associations and co-operatives as well as to housing action trusts and indeed to any person who is an approved landlord under part iv of this bill <e>", "<cs> i think that the ministers most encouraging words were a recognition that the government are receiving bids from voluntary organisations and that those bids will be considered sympathetically <e> <s> i merely ask him <e>", "<cs> this amendment invited the government to put up or shut up <e> <s> they have refused to put up <e> <s> i suggest that the minister invite his less scrupulous friends to shut up <e> <s> if he can come back from having attended the conservative party conference in brighton and assure me that nobody at that conference has repeated the slanders about empty properties under local authorities i shall eat a copy made on rice paper of my amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps if i say a few words that may give the minister an opportunity to respond now rather than writing to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i hope that the government will take seriously the amendments which have been moved <e> <s> less responsible spokesmen of the government have said that fear and despondency is being stirred up among tenants in housing action trust areas and in areas where there are likely to be proposals for the transfer of estates from the local authority to other landlords <e> <s> one way although by no means sufficient for the government to answer those misrepresentations which it is claimed are being made <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reciprocate the thanks of the noble earl <e> <s> this has been a long and tough committee stage <e> <s> the report stage will not be very much easier but we have been grateful for the courtesy and consideration of the government at all times even when they have not recognised the full strength indeed the overwhelming strength of our arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim to have read the bill but i have carefully read the statement made on behalf of the promoters in its support <e> <s> i was concerned when i read the objections which had been raised <e> <s> i am happy to hear from the noble viscount that all the objections except that of the british railways board have now been resolved <e> <s> i understand from the statement that the board is now moving towards a settlement with the promoters of the bill <e> <s> on that basis we have no objection to an unopposed second reading and the bill being referred to a committee as is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down do we understand that he is volunteering his services to the select committee <e> <s> that would seem to be the most appropriate step <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister make a better attempt to answer the supplementary question put by my noble friend lord stoddart <e> <s> he asked whether in the circumstances where an applicant a private landlord has an interest in a high number of extensions there is not a contradiction in having the applicant pay the costs of the independent monitoring body <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to the amendments i shall not follow the minister in his general observations about part i of the bill except to say that i am sure he is right that there will be considerable disagreement between us on a number of the matters before the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he confirm that under the amendments the duties of private landlords will be as strict as they would be if the alternative landlord were for example a housing association <e>", "<cs> my lords to mention the point of procedure first if the noble earl wishes to deal with amendment no <e> <s> separately he is fully entitled to do so <e> <s> i shall move it in such a way that he can make the many points which he wishes to make <e> <s> i hope that they will be helpful points <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the matter were as simple clear and uncontroversial as the noble earl suggests <e> <s> i should like to remind the government that in committee on st july we moved an amendment to deal with this problem of the protection of tenants from incoming resident landlords <e> <s> the problem is that with an incoming resident landlord the tenants are liable to lose their security if they co-operate with the incoming landlord by moving to another part of the premises <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may reiterate that he oversimplifies the matter <e> <s> the problem is that when the beneficiary under a will comes in and trustees have to give a new tenancy it is perfectly proper and reasonable for there to be some adjustment of the premises occupied by a tenant and by the beneficiary under the will in order to meet the new family circumstances <e> <s> it is in those circumstances that we are concerned that the tenant who is trying to be cooperative and to make way if necessary for a beneficiary under a will who has different or greater housing need should then be penalised for that cooperation because he is to be given a tenancy which is not protected in the same way as his existing one <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is an invitation that is likely to achieve a response from the government i am pleased <e> <s> however i shall not move the amendment afterwards unless something extraordinary happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> i have clearly misread the bill <e> <s> i do not think that i can move amendment no <e> <s> without having moved amendments nos <e> <s> or <e> <s> if i have wasted the time of the house i apologise <e> <s> it is appropriate that i should talk with the minister before we come back to third reading <e> <s> perhaps we can have a very brief introduction to these amendments if as appears my fears are groundless <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first of all deal with the point raised by my noble friend lady phillips she asked me to define cohabitee <e> <s> i would not be so presumptuous as to attempt any legal definition <e> <s> the phrase used in the amendment is not cohabitee that is a word that i used for convenience <e> <s> i was referring to the people who had the right of occupation under the family law reform act which has not yet come into force <e> <s> the significant point about that is that it does not attempt to cover all kinds of cohabitees it concerns only those with children <e> <s> it concerns them if they have the right to apply to the court to have a property transferred to the child or to themselves if the court considers that it is in the interests of the child <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sad <e> <s> i thought that we would be in agreement and that this was an issue on which we all wanted the same thing <e> <s> we want to keep families together <e> <s> and we want to achieve that by agreement on all sides of the house <e> <s> if our amendment is defective in the sense that it applies to only one kind of tenancy let us pass it now and put it right at third reading <e> <s> it cannot be so difficult to give a group of people already defined in law access to rent assessment committees <e> <s> i am searching for a way to withdraw the amendment but i am not being given an opportunity to do so <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards amendment no <e> <s> the minister takes pride in the fact that there is to be payment of removal expenses when the tenant is being dispossessed on the ground that alternative accommodation is available <e> <s> i give him one and a half cheers for that <e> <s> that provision is clearly a step forward and i do not wish to underestimate it <e> <s> however being dispossessed when alternative accommodation is available and being dispossessed without alternative accommodation at a time of redevelopment makes all the difference in the world to the tenant <e> <s> in the first case the tenant having accepted alternative accommodation has somewhere else to live <e> <s> the tenant who is being dispossessed as a result of the redevelopment clause is left on the street at the mercy of the local authority and whatever resources it may have <e> <s> that tenant may have the worst shock that could happen to anyone in his life apart from bereavement to find himself without a home <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that <e> <s> i am sure that we can have a sensible discussion to see whether we can come back on third reading <e> <s> the minister knows that i am not satisfied with his answer on amendment no <e> <s> but so as to make progress on the other matters i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the ministers heart is in the right place he takes this matter with the seriousness that it deserves and is determined to pursue it <e> <s> i have sufficient confidence in him to withdraw the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the wrong wording but the intention is clearly the same <e> <s> i am sure that the minister has heard what has been said and has noted the difficulty with adjoining occupier <e> <s> it is possible for a nuisance to be caused by somebody who is not physically adjoining <e> <s> if the minister looks at this matter again i hope he will feel able to come back to us at third reading or be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will take that point on board as well <e> <s> this is not a matter which is black and white at all i apologise i said that entirely without consideration this is not a matter where all the right is on one side <e> <s> i am reminded by the noble lord lord hylton that it is possible for injustice to be done to the family of somebody who is actually causing racial harassment <e> <s> if the remedy is in terms of obtaining possession of the harassers property instead of taking other forms of legal action the injustice could be on both sides <e> <s> clearly we do not wish that to arise either <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are once again in one of those positions in which the government have one stereotype of the wicked tenant not paying the rent and are accusing us of having another stereotype of the wicked landlord harassing the tenant and trying to drive him out <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister anticipated in his reply that we would be dissatisfied with his arguments and his answers <e> <s> that is certainly the case <e> <s> he started with a completely false analogy in order to reach a completely false conclusion <e> <s> the false analogy was based on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the consideration which the noble earl has given to the amendments which as he said i have discussed with him since the committee stage <e> <s> as he expected i am disappointed with the result <e> <s> i believe that he has again chosen examples of tenants and their families which may well apply in a number of cases and i do not deny that <e> <s> but the government ignore the kinds of case which fall within the scope of this part of the bill and which are bound to cause real hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing the amendments the noble lord lord coleraine was pleased to attack the opposition for referring to specific cases of harassment <e> <s> i shall not defend the reference to mr rachman <e> <s> i did not refer <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i did not make my position clear to the noble lord <e> <s> i said that we supported the change from calculated to likely not as the noble earl suggested because we thought that calculated meant likely <e> <s> we do not think it means likely but it ought to <e> <s> to that extent we support these amendments <e> <s> we are opposed to the extension of the mitigation from acts of omission to actual positive acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that is right and it will be the effect of the amendments but i am by no means convinced of it <e> <s> i am certainly in favour of the possibility of a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i accept that correction as regards the nature of the liability he is avoiding <e> <s> however it still seems to me that the possibility of dragging matters out is to the disadvantage of the tenant rather than the other way round <e> <s> tenants who are exposed to a long-term programme of harassment will be more at risk because the landlord will not do it unless he thinks that tenants will become fed up give up and go away <e> <s> that is the intention of most harassment <e> <s> that is the way it normally happens <e> <s> far more harassment cases do not come to court not because landlords give up harassment but because tenants lose hope and despair and get out of property <e> <s> harassment wins <e> <s> the problem is not that harassment fails but rather that harassment wins without the case coming to court <e> <s> i am afraid that these amendments will encourage harassment to win without the matter getting to court <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i appear to be cast in the role of grumpy bear <e> <s> i am the one who does not like all these things that are being done <e> <s> all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is right to say that these amendments clarify the position <e> <s> what they do not do is to meet a government commitment made in committee <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble earl did not see fit to mention that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not accept that the minister has rebutted my amendments <e> <s> he expressed considerable sympathy with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i suppose i must be grateful for that <e> <s> but the lengthy explanation is only necessary because the minister has the responsibility of explaining to the house why the unequivocal promises given by successive ministers throughout the whole consideration of this bill and since the time the concept of the bill was first introduced that existing tenants rights would not be eroded are broken in the bill <e> <s> that is the fact of the matter <e> <s> existing tenants rights are eroded by these provisions <e> <s> the amendments are designed to deal with that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that answer is not satisfactory because it means that if we do not have an opportunity to introduce an amendment to close the gap so to speak the law could be as was not intended and i think that is common ground uncertain for a considerable time to come <e>", "<cs> my lords this is my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved the amendment <e> <s> i am entitled to respond to the debate <e> <s> i am not responsible for the actions of others <e> <s> the minister must have smiled to himself when he read in his brief the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely congratulate the minister on the way in which he continues to present his case in the face of universal opposition from your lordships house with the exception of those noble lords who troop into the division lobbies without having heard the debates <e> <s> i want to draw attention to the fact that of the eight speakers in support of the amendment two sit on the government benches <e> <s> i shall refer to those two speeches before reverting to the wider issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the way in which he has moved his own amendment and referred to mine <e> <s> i recognise immediately that there is a common thread between the two amendments and to some extent they overlap as they have a common intention <e> <s> we have no objection whatever to the government amendment <e> <s> we believe it is right that the housing corporation should have the power that is proposed to appoint a local authority as its agent <e> <s> we believe it is complementary to our amendment rather than supersedes it <e> <s> i shall explain why in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords what does that mean <e> <s> does it mean that if the local authority is discharging its agency function effectively the housing corporation will not subject the project to additional second scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords that is double scrutiny <e> <s> the scrutiny will be by the local authority discharging its functions properly and by the housing association because the money is coming from the housing association scrutinising it again <e> <s> it is no use the minister saying that in principle he is against double scrutiny if he then goes on to describe precisely what it is he is trying to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords it is simply a recipe for conflict if the minister seriously thinks that the secretary of state can exercise his discretion in such a way as to marginalise the tenants and the people with knowledge of the area on the housing action trusts however temporary they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not quite the point <e> <s> we do not mind if the minister is doing that but why does he keep on chastising us for doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am delighted to have that confirmation and also the confirmation that it has not been done so far <e> <s> i am sure that my honourable and right honourable friends who are concerned with treasury matters in another place will be very interested to have that reply <e> <s> it confirms what i was saying more recently namely that the hats themselves do not have any financial interest whatever <e> <s> it is only the government the expropriator and the local authority which is to receive the money <e> <s> it seems totally inequitable that the expropriator can determine the financial terms that are provided for in clause <e> <s> what we are trying to put right in this amendment is that quite unequal relationship between the government and the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister clearly thinks that the soft answer he gave at the beginning of his speech will turn away wrath <e> <s> he gave us what was not much more than a second reading defence of the hat proposal <e> <s> i do not intend to follow along that road <e> <s> if i talk in the context of trying to improve the hat proposal before us i do so not because i accept the principle of hats but because the job of the house is to make such amendments as are appropriate to make the legislation more effective <e> <s> that is what we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not attacking the ministers sincerity <e> <s> i am not suggesting that he does not fully intend to do that <e> <s> but secretaries of state and governments change <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate that the groupings have no statutory force and that they are only advisory <e> <s> however the grouping on our insistence in the course of this morning was changed so that amendments nos <e> <s> and were taken together and amendments nos <e> <s> and were taken together <e> <s> we agreed with the departments wish to take amendments nos <e> <s> and separately <e>", "<cs> my lords there has clearly been a misprint here <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and i think quite clearly refer to the collective right to withdraw and amendments nos <e> <s> and refer to the individual right to withdraw <e> <s> if we have agreed to a wrong grouping i apologise but i think that the noble earl will agree that that is the commonsense grouping <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i know that this is report stage but i specifically refused to do either of those things <e> <s> what i said was <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not at all know what was agreed earlier <e> <s> but if the minister is now confirming the terms of the release which state that <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to pour over that submission word by word <e> <s> but my reading of it is that it is not the same as what was stated in the press release <e> <s> i remind the house that we are not talking about a collective veto <e> <s> we are not talking about per cent <e> <s> of tenants <e> <s> we are talking about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> we are talking about an individual veto <e> <s> to me the news release promised an individual veto the minister is saying something different <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made no statement in principle tonight about hats and it is not my intention to do so <e> <s> what i said about hats at second reading is on record and i shall not go back on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim the detailed knowledge of the status of credit approvals which i ought to have in order to make a final judgment <e> <s> i am grateful for the ministers confirmation that the letter which had been promised in the press release has been sent out <e> <s> i shall certainly want to consult with the leaders of the councils which have received that letter and with their local authority associations <e> <s> if as i hope the ministers assurances cover all the points which i have raised in moving this amendment i shall very happily acknowledge that and not return to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very significant and disturbing retraction of what was said as recently as this month by the parliamentary under-secretary of state in a letter to all tenants <e> <s> i repeat that the parliamentary under-secretary said <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not say that ones suggestion will be listened to <e> <s> it says you will be able to make suggestions <e> <s> in commonsense english it means that the tenants are given a choice <e> <s> if they do not like one choice they can reject it and can make their own suggestion <e> <s> that is not the same as consultation <e> <s> that means that they can reject <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter is about who will be managing their homes <e> <s> one of the ways in which the homes will be managed is by agency agreement <e> <s> if agency agreements are to be imposed on the management of homes after consultation despite the results of the consultation and that is possible from what the minister has said then we are going back on the undertakings given by the parliamentary under-secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the minister has said although that does not mean that i agree with it <e> <s> the secretary of state takes responsibility for the actions of the officials in his department <e> <s> in legislation we do not say that any official in the department of the environment shall provide to any outside body information required by statute <e> <s> we say that the secretary of state shall provide it and through his officials it is his responsibility to secure that that information is provided in accordance with statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the elucidation <e> <s> i was not sure what the noble lords final position was and i am glad to have given him an opportunity to express it <e> <s> i think he would be satisfied with the provision in the bill which was agreed at committee stage that the secretary of state shall make orders so as to secure what he wants <e> <s> that has satisfied the noble lord lord campbell of alloway but i must say that it does not satisfy us <e> <s> it was a valuable concession in itself but i thought that i should refer to this issue because of the objections that we still have to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble earl should feel it necessary to accuse me of discourtesy <e> <s> i was referring to policies not to individuals who put them forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house suggested that the minister might feel it necessary to reply to the debate which took place after his first intervention <e> <s> let me assure him that if he wishes to do so he is at perfect liberty to interrupt me <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply the minister has sought to reassure the house on the basis that the voting procedure will be exhaustive and over a period of time and that all efforts will be made to secure a high turnout <e> <s> i shall believe that when i see the governments response to the amendments we have put down which are for debate later this afternoon <e> <s> those amendments seeks to secure for example that information about the transfer should be made available in the ethnic minority languages <e> <s> there are many other examples where we are seeking what the government claim they wish namely a high and well-informed ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is correct in saying that we have many of the same objectives <e> <s> we have supported the approval regime that is imposed on the housing corporation <e> <s> we agree with him that revocation of approval before the transfer is the correct procedure <e> <s> as he says what happens afterwards is more complex <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what he said and i shall certainly have to think about it before deciding what to do <e> <s> he referred to clause which as i understand it is mainly concerned with proposed acquisitions but i do not doubt that he is serious in saying as i think he said that help could be available from housing corporation powers <e> <s> that may well be a better advantage than the solution which we have proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> we are searching along different roads for the same objective <e> <s> therefore it would be proper for me to take the amendment away and read what he has said <e> <s> i hope that we can reach agreement <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the minister wants what we want <e> <s> i am far from convinced that the examples he has given are adequate to justify his rejection of our amendments <e> <s> if he can tell me of any area of the country where there is an excess of rented property then i shall be delighted to recommend people to move there <e> <s> i do not think an excess exists anywhere in the country unless it is simply the case that rents are beyond the reach of ordinary people in that area but even that i doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point i wish to ask him what he means by in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl means principal not principle <e> <s> i am delighted to have that confirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for at least part of that reply <e> <s> i accept that the intention in respect of subparagraph i of the amendment is clear and that if the pre-selection procedure is a condition of approval by the housing corporation that that meets that point <e> <s> i suspect although i shall have to read more carefully what the noble earl has said that that applies to subparagraph iii as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given a very interesting and complex <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i find this aspect very worrying <e> <s> i fear that it could be a step backwards <e> <s> i appreciate that it is necessary for an applicant to know the total extent of rent arrears because that is a matter that affects the purchase price and the applicants judgment as to the possibility of effective management of the properties <e> <s> i see that it could be desirable for example to provide statistical information which said that there are so many tenants of whom so many are in arrears of under three months under six months over a year and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trafford is helping to make my case <e> <s> indeed it is necessary to know why arrears occur <e> <s> however this could be provided in statistical or anonymous form whereas the amendment provides for the details tenant by tenant to be provided <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot see why that is either necessary or helpful <e> <s> it could be misleading <e> <s> the applicant needs to know the numbers of tenants in arrears the extent of the arrears and the reasons for the arrears the noble lord lord trafford is quite right about that but not in a manner that identifies individual tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i confess that i had not read it in that light as being a concession to my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> i was puzzled about why the subsection is more widely drafted than originally but i shall read carefully what he has said and hope that enlightenment will come to me in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> in doing so i should like to remind the house of the many and varied reasons which could prevent tenants from voting <e> <s> reference has already been made to the principle of informed consent <e> <s> i think it is important that we should apply this all the way through the process which is being introduced by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am not satisfied with that answer <e> <s> it does not deal with the fact that there will continue to be voids <e> <s> the suggestion that there might be agreement between the applicant and the landlord goes entirely against the paranoia of the government in thinking continually that the landlords- in other words the local authorities are going to be obstructive all the time <e> <s> if the local authorities are being obstructive what confidence does the minister have that there will be the kind of agreement that he talks about <e> <s> what we shall have is more empty properties and if not we are going to have quite unsatisfactory temporary licences <e> <s> that is not a suitable way in which to treat housing management <e> <s> it means that there is a very undesirable interregnum between the local authority regime and that introduced by the applicant <e> <s> the complication and the length of it is a matter for the government to secure by regulation <e> <s> i am quite sure that they will wish to see that it is as short a period as possible <e> <s> nothing that the minister has said has convinced me that there will not be a period in which housing management is in effect in abeyance and during which an effective allocations policy is no longer possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply the noble earl has demonstrated that the government have put together a package which will do what they want it to do <e> <s> it can be adapted to meet any political or administrative objective <e> <s> the noble earl is saying that the basic electorate if i may continue to use the analogy is established by statute but that the government can do what they like by regulation to add or subtract from it <e> <s> if the representation of the people act were being considered in another place and these proposals were put forward for parliamentary or local government elections any government who proposed them would find their proposals tossed out on their ears <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend will read the ministers words with great attention <e> <s> if he feels it necessary to come back at a later stage he will exercise his rights within the rules of debate and within the rules of order of the house <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to the noble earl the minister said that the government were not going to exercise their default powers <e> <s> i hold no particular brief for the council of the london borough of brent but if the minister will not intervene should he not refrain from criticising individual councils in this way and accusing them of mismanagement <e> <s> in other words should he not put up or shut up <e>", "<cs> my lords that was an interesting speech by the minister which we shall have to study carefully <e> <s> i was especially interested to hear him say that benefit would be set at the level determined by the free market and that the only restriction would be that it would not be paid on rents above the market level <e> <s> is the noble earl proposing to table amendments at third reading to put that on the face of the bill because that is not what the bill says at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a profound conflict between those words which if i thought they were going to be law rather than a ministerial statement i would welcome very much and what the bill actually says <e> <s> i concede that these discretionary powers have existed for some time <e> <s> we already have powers for local authorities to restrict the amount of rent that counts for housing benefit purposes when it is unreasonable <e> <s> local authorities have those powers and it has not been suggested that their extension in april has worked in any way inadequately <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect what the minister says <e> <s> it does not go very well with what he said a moment ago about not proposing to put down amendments at third reading but he said first something new about market rents which has never been said before so far as i know during the passage of the bill either here or in another place <e> <s> he also said that he will listen to our demand that nobody in need should suffer as a result of the bill <e> <s> if he can come back at third reading with a provision to enshrine that noble lords on this side of the house those who are responsible for administering housing benefit and above all those who are in need of housing benefit will be profoundly grateful <e> <s> on the basis of what the minister said the proper course is for me to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reasons i have given i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> in so far as he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is going back to the debate and the sidetracking of the central issues which i am sorry to say took place in committee <e> <s> none of us is saying that penthouses in mayfair should be fully paid for by housing benefit that is not the issue <e> <s> but there are already adequate safeguards for local authorities to exercise their discretion in such cases <e> <s> some of them existed before april and some of them were strengthened in april <e> <s> with respect i do not think that that is the essence of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords on amendment no <e> <s> a i invited the minister to give the house an assurance that no one in need would be poorer <e> <s> he did not say that he could not give that assurance for this or that reason he said that he would think about it <e> <s> on that basis i withdrew the amendment <e> <s> he has given no such comfort in relation to this amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c is absolutely vital if we are to avoid a greater degree of poverty resulting from the bills provisions that local authorities should not be able to pay less than the rent set by the rent officer <e> <s> we have not received the assurances we need and therefore it is necessary to take the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a suggestion on procedure <e> <s> i think this is one of those occasions where it would be very helpful if the minister who has his own amendments were not only to speak earlier in the debate but were to have the leave of the house to reply before the noble lord lord swinfen <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stoddart is quite right about one thing it will be obvious from speeches made from the opposition benches that there are differing views about this matter and that noble lords who take the labour whip are entirely free to speak and vote as they wish upon it <e> <s> i want to put my view <e> <s> i seek to persuade my noble friends and indeed any other of your lordships that the governments approach is the right one and that the amendment of the noble lord lord swinfen should not be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there ought to be more money spent by local <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add our support to the amendment <e> <s> it would be presumptious of me to attempt to better the way in which the arguments have been put <e> <s> i have one point to add which ends with a specific question to the minister <e> <s> on the issue of judicial review as opposed to an appeal to the county court the minister will recall that on nd october the noble lord lord skelmersdale who at that time was a minister at the department of the environment said during the report stage of the housing and planning bill that the government would consider the need for a homelessness appeal as part of the civil justice review <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the ministers objections to amendment no <e> <s> a with interest and sympathy <e> <s> i listened to his objections to amendment no <e> <s> b with utter disbelief <e> <s> i could not believe that he still was unable to understand the position in which tenants will find themselves <e> <s> it does not make any difference to the tenants whether the council is disposing of the properties voluntarily <e> <s> they are the same tenants they are in the same houses they have the same need for protection <e> <s> since many of the councils which are going for voluntary disposals have probably been elected largely by owner occupiers they have not even taken an active or successful part in the democratic process which leads to the voluntary disposal <e> <s> if we look at it from their point of view and not from a centralist point of view which is what the government are doing none of the ministers arguments holds water <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that i responded to this amendment in talking to the last amendment we debated <e> <s> perhaps it might have made more sense to have grouped the two together <e> <s> i am still worried by the phrases which the minister used in moving this amendment and in his response to my amendment we expect this and we do not expect that <e> <s> expectations are not very positive unless they can be secured either by legislation or regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those who organise the schemes and even more so those who take advantage of them will be glad to know of the ministers words of support for the schemes and the extent to which the bill encourages them to be extended to housing action trusts as they apply to housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply is totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> the noble earl has neither answered the questions put by the noble baroness lady seear nor has he answered the point i made that there are a significant number of large housing associations with the scope and responsibilities comparable to local housing authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i comprehend what the noble earl said but i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to be associated with the thanks just expressed by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak to this amendment i should like first of all to offer my congratulations to the noble earl on achieving today the mature age of <e> <s> it has not yet turned him grey despite the fact that this th year must have been one of the most strenuous in his life starting with matters of criminal justice and ending with the varied activities of the department of the environment <e> <s> i promise him that we shall try to make his st year as stressful as his th year <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister finds himself in the curious position of agreeing with much of the argument yet rejecting the conclusion <e> <s> i find it unsatisfactory that at third reading of a bill which has been around for most of the year the minister should be confessing on behalf of the government an inadequacy in the drafting capacity of his department and of parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> if he recognises the issue it is his responsibility to deal with it and not mine <e> <s> i appreciate his tributes to my ability but i do not have his resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that noble lords will consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i shall have to read carefully what the noble earl said <e> <s> it was worth reviving this matter in this way because that was not said so clearly on report <e> <s> that may have been my fault for not drawing it out adequately because it is always a matter of mutual responsibility between the two front benches <e> <s> however on the face of it the assurances given by the noble earl are adequate for my purpose and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister permit me to intervene <e> <s> i am following with great attention and interest what he is saying and i like what he has said about the per cent <e> <s> can he tell me why there is a reference in clause to taking account of other resources before giving per cent <e> <s> approval <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house can the local authority be forced to do that if the department decides that it is able to do so or can the local authority decide whether it is able and willing to do so <e> <s> i can quite understand the latter case but it is the former that worries me <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing i can say about that reply is that it is good in parts <e> <s> i return briefly to the issue which obliged me to intervene during the ministers statement <e> <s> he replied to me again by saying that if the local authority can afford it and the department also knows it can afford it then there may be a contribution from the capital resources of the local authority rather than a contribution of per cent <e> <s> from the department <e>", "<cs> my lords we generally welcome amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it leaves the discretion of the secretary of state all powerful in any dispute between a tenant and an undesirable landlord <e> <s> we have not yet provided a veto under section a of the housing act but this goes some way towards meeting what we are looking for <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is a concession to an amendment which we moved at report stage <e> <s> as the noble earl reminded the house he gave an undertaking to my noble friend lord graham to see whether he could clarify the matter on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that that was a disgraceful answer <e> <s> i am not imputing anything personally against the minister but that reply is a denial of what in plain english was said to tenants by the parliamentary under-secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister has not said and i challenge him again so that he has an opportunity to say it is that the sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords and that choice will be carried into effect and there will be no cases of tenants being allocated to landlords whom they have not positively chosen <e> <s> is that what the minister is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what the letter says <e> <s> the letter says that not only will you be given the choice <e> <s> i forgot to read further down where it says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not appropriate for this house to pursue the matter in this way but it will be pursued <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two important aspects to the amendment and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has both wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not claim that it was restricted to those who were unable to vote <e> <s> it was the noble lord himself who claimed that it was restricted to those who refrained from voting <e> <s> of course the amendment covers both those who refrain from voting and those who are unable to vote <e> <s> the noble lords strictures on the amendment apply perhaps with some minor force to those who refrain from voting they certainly do not apply to those who are unable to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to rise on the same point before the minister sat down <e> <s> will he confirm that there is a difference between this bill and the education reform act other than that to which he referred in responding to the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> the difference is that in the education reform act the ballot does not rely upon those who abstained or who are unable to vote as being counted as in favour of the transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister without reserve for what he has just said <e> <s> i accept that it may be necessary to improve the drafting in another place <e> <s> i am sure that we shall not object to any of the fine tuning to which the noble earl referred <e> <s> i am grateful for the recognition of the validity of the argument we have put and for the kind words the minister has used in agreeing to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i made clear that this amendment was tabled in order to give the minister an opportunity to share his thoughts with the house <e> <s> i pay tribute to him he has done so <e> <s> he has attempted to make clear the situation in which tenants will find themselves and by implication he means i take it that local authorities will have the resources to do what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords although i fully appreciate the sincerity behind the last two speeches and the feelings which give rise to them i fear that they do not represent the situation <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected my lords <e> <s> when the noble lord refers to the need for amendment of building regulations one can readily agree with him <e> <s> when the noble baroness lady masham refers to the need for more suitable housing for disabled people one can only agree with her <e> <s> but surely we should be seeking to find more suitable housing for disabled people from whatever source and we should be adding the best possible number of houses suitable for disabled people to the existing houses available for the disabled <e> <s> additions to the stock of housing suitable for the disabled are by definition only at the margin <e> <s> if we produce even per cent <e> <s> of the stock in any one year it will take years to make up the stock <e> <s> it is more likely that we shall be producing per cent <e> <s> of what is required rather than per cent <e> <s> although i do not know the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for introducing this amendment and for the terms in which he introduced it <e> <s> when we put forward this point our intention was that all assured tenants who are sitting tenants at the time the developer buys the property should be covered <e> <s> i think and hope that that is what this amendment means but before i shout content i should he grateful if the minister would confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to yield to the greater knowledge of the ministers parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> i am sorry that we have failed in our objectives <e> <s> however since the minister appeared to rely on our drafting failure in his opposition to the amendment perhaps we can persuade him to draft a better amendment for consideration in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the minister cannot intervene in the procedures of another place <e> <s> however he is the minister for housing and he may have a political influence even if he does not have a direct legislative influence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply suspicious of anything that is called a very minor amendment indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bad bill <e> <s> it bids fair to be five bad bills <e> <s> there are five parts of it all of which are deeply objectionable and are all based on a false analysis of the housing crisis in our society <e> <s> the assumption is made that our problem is lack of private rented accommodation brought about because private sector landlords do not have a sufficient financial incentive to expand private rented accommodation <e> <s> from that assumption flow many effects in the bill all of which are deeply damaging despite the changes that have been made as the bill has passed through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary from this dispatch box to thank the noble lord who asked the question and made possible the debate <e> <s> in one respect i do so wholeheartedly <e> <s> it is always good to have an opportunity to hear the thoughtful and lucid speeches of the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> in another respect i am more doubtful <e> <s> this is a subject which will become very much clearer for debate when the bill is published in a relatively short time <e> <s> i was always brought up not to shoot until one saw the whites of their eyes <e> <s> i certainly do not propose to take this opportunity to expose all the arguments that we have prepared ready loaded and cocked against the final publication of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has anticipated my next objection which is that the testing of which he speaks can only be testing to destruction <e> <s> this is not a matter like the contracting out of a school meals service or the contracting out even of refuse services in the london borough of wandsworth where it is well known that it very often does not work and the services have to be taken back again <e> <s> one cannot risk the water supply not working <e> <s> one would have to rescue any contractor who took on the responsibility and failed to maintain the service <e> <s> the service is so ancillary to the core of the business which is the provision of water that it is difficult to see how it could have the kind of impact that the noble lord anticipates <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister permit me to intervene <e> <s> i sympathise with a great deal of what he has said about the need for investment <e> <s> will he remind the house that at the moment over per cent <e> <s> of the investment in the water industry comes from revenue sources rather than from borrowing <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way wish to go against constitutional proprieties which restrict the powers of this house in relation to bills which have been certified in another place as money bills but that does not mean we have to like this bill <e> <s> certainly it does not mean that we have to let such a bill go through without at least discussing the issues raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> however when he said that authorities have overspent what he means is that their budget and their provisional estimates involve overspending he does not mean <e>", "<cs> my lords how can it be said to be hypothetical when it has taken place every year in which the system has been enforced <e> <s> it is not hypothetical it is real money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord yet again but he seems to be going on to another part of his speech without actually dealing with the real issue concerning creative accountancy <e> <s> the point i was making which he has not answered and which ministers in another place did not answer is this <e> <s> what is wrong with the amendments put down by the opposition in another place which did not involve treating one local authority differently from another which did not involve creative accounting but which provided for recompense for those authorities which <e>", "<cs> my lords before the motion is formally decided a very serious charge which has been supported on both sides of the house has been made by my noble friend lord callaghan backed up by the noble lord lord rippon <e> <s> we appreciate the constitutional position of a money bill but i ask the minister in all seriousness whether he would not be well advised not to press the second reading today but to put it off until monday <e> <s> then he could go back to his right honourable friend the secretary of state and put to him the matters which have been raised this afternoon not so much from the opposition front bench but from privy council benches <e> <s> the noble lord would not risk losing the bill we shall not break the constitutional rules <e> <s> would he not be well advised to give the bill three more days <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government want the good news or the bad news first <e> <s> let me give them the bad news <e> <s> first we are deeply dissatisfied with the way in which this bill has gone through its remaining stages in another place <e> <s> i am sure that it is not for us to criticise the conduct of another place <e> <s> nevertheless at the very last minute that is to say last friday the government had to impose a timetable motion on consideration of our amendments to this bill and that cannot be other than derogatory to the dignity of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak to this amendment in order to say what i neglected to mention when we discussed the previous amendments <e> <s> when i criticised the timetable motion that the government put before another place i neglected to pay tribute to my honourable and right honourable friends for their persistence assiduity and skill when they attacked those of your lordships amendments with which they disagreed <e> <s> i do not believe that it justified a timetable motion but it should be recorded that right up to the very last this bill had the most expert attention from another place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recognise that his answers so far have given no comfort whatever to those of us who fear not only an ecological and natural disaster but also a financial disaster <e> <s> that is in exactly the sense of the kind of sell-off we had of the royal ordnance factories and the undervaluation of the land that was bought on privatisation <e> <s> will the noble earl give the house an assurance that there will be a full complete up-to-date and realistic valuation of all the land assets of the water authorities before privatisation is enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord russell for introducing this debate <e> <s> i confess that when he put down his unstarred question a week or so ago i was not particularly grateful <e> <s> i read the press as well <e> <s> i read the kind of anguished protest which was the substance of the speech of the noble earl lord russell and i read the kind of tabloid vituperation which was the substance of the speech of the noble lord lord bethell <e> <s> i must confess that i was tempted to think that there was something in this <e> <s> i made it my business to find out the true facts about the financial position of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unaware of mr kuba assegai <e> <s> i shall not be drawn into that type of accusation <e> <s> i am not issuing a blanket defence of brent councils current policies and i never claimed to do so <e> <s> i am sorry that any noble lord should believe it necessary to engage in blanket attacks on any councils policies <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful for that intelligence and i am sure that the house will also be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the chronology which his right honourable friend mr gummer gave in another place <e> <s> i was aware of that <e> <s> but does not the minister recognise that the rate support grant act not only covered the current expenditure but also past expenditure <e> <s> the furious indignation that occurred in many local authorities throughout the country at the retrospective legislation which was put through this house earlier on this month came not only from labour authorities but also from conservative authorities and those without any political control <e> <s> so to restrict the accusation to brent and haringey and to restrict it only to one year is not telling the whole story <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down in view of the respect that i have for him personally i hope he will accept from me that i do not hold him personally responsible for the appalling complacency of the answer that he has felt it necessary to give <e>", "<cs> my lords may i tell the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords there must be some form of words <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to convey to the minister that we on these benches strongly support any efforts by the government to strengthen the control of the chemicals which cause damage to the ozone layer <e> <s> we welcome the conference to which the minister has referred <e> <s> will he draw to the attention of his colleagues the recent report by the worldwatch foundation in washington which claims that there is a serious risk that depletion of the ozone layer of up to per cent <e> <s> could occur in densely populated areas within years <e> <s> does that not increase the urgency of the efforts that are required <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one who has worked at oxford circus for the past years and whose fingers are still pink and whose ears still work has the noble lord considered that the worst aspect of pneumatic drills is not that they exist i believe that all of us are reasonably stoical about that but that different public services dig up the same street on successive days in pursuit of comparable objectives <e> <s> can some improvement in the noise nuisance not be achieved by better coordination between public services <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord blake for introducing the motion this afternoon <e> <s> it has been an education for me to hear so much about a part of our heritage with which i am less familiar our english country houses <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government have the ability to reduce taxation it is proper to argue about on whom the benefit of the taxation relief as well as the pain of taxation would fall <e> <s> i would argue that even in a time of reducing taxation and i do not accept that there are not very many higher priorities for increased public expenditure than the noble lord would agree to if there is to be a relief of taxation one has to consider who will be best able to bear the remaining burden if i may put it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords there are already very substantial concessions made for principal residences <e> <s> they are not subject to capital gains tax already and to propose an extension of that on death seems to me not only continuing but increasing the differences in wealth in our society and increasing the prospect of inherited wealth being a strong feature of our society <e> <s> the noble lord and i will have to disagree about that <e> <s> it may be a political point but it is one i feel quite strongly about <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are inclined to accede to the noble earls suggestion of a gift of perhaps million i do not think that he would find us voting against it <e> <s> all i am suggesting is that it is not perhaps the best way to ensure the continuing preservation of our historic buildings and treasures <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government are promoting the water bill as a universal blessing to mankind will they put down amendments in the bill to abolish drought <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend lady nicol receives at home in cambridge tomorrow the hansard of todays debate i believe that she will read it with a considerable degree of satisfaction <e> <s> knowing her it will be quiet rather than exuberant satisfaction but i believe that as she reads through nearly speeches each of which has shown some degree of expertise in analysing the problems of the environment and some imagination about possible solutions to those problems she will feel that her initiative is worthwhile <e> <s> of course my noble friend will be sorry not to have been able to be here with us but she will read the masterly overview of my noble friend lord cledwyn with the admiration that has been so widely expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating the noble lord on his appointment to the department of the environment may i ask him to reconsider his answer to my noble friend lord strabolgi <e> <s> surely price is part of the service and if the price becomes excessive the consumer is getting a poorer service <e> <s> secondly will the minister confirm that the controls to be exercised by the director-general of water supplies apply only to water supply and sewerage and not to the other activities of the new water companies <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not fast approaching the happy state where the cost of compensation to those who will suffer the impact of such a rail line may match or even exceed the cost certainly in built-up areas of putting it underground <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to tell the house a relevant story about why i am not a communist <e> <s> as a schoolboy during the latter part of the war i was evacuated to bradford <e> <s> i stayed in a household where the husband used to walk five miles to the centre of bradford with his knapsack on his back in proper style <e> <s> you entered the house past terraced gardens where the lawns were cut with nail scissors <e> <s> you took your shoes off at the door <e> <s> you could hardly breathe on the furniture <e> <s> when you sat up at table you had to sit up tight and keep your elbows in <e> <s> the householders were members of the communist party and you did all those things because you were a good communist <e> <s> you sat up straight at table like a good communist <e> <s> you kept the furniture clean like a good communist <e> <s> you did not run or walk fast in the street like a good communist <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will tell us which noble lord said that we should intervene in the affairs of bradford <e> <s> i did not suggest that and i did not hear any of my noble friends do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not some conflict between what the minister has just said and what the secretary of state said on a panorama interview on th november when he described legislation as top priority <e> <s> even if the minister does not agree with what the secretary of state says does he agree that there are some particularly urgent environmental matters notably the extension of planning controls to cover agriculture and forestry which should not be left without legislation any longer <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made in another place earlier this afternoon <e> <s> it is however peculiarly unhelpful <e> <s> for all the assurance it gives to occupiers of business premises as to what their future business rates are likely to be it could as well have been issued not only before christmas but at the time when the local government finance bill was enacted <e> <s> we have no indication whatever of the likely effect on any individual businesses group of businesses or type of businesses <e> <s> the most broad indications are given in the statement about regional differences but nothing else to help businessmen assess their likely rate obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i was not referring to increases in rateable value <e> <s> we all know that there have to be increases in rateable value <e> <s> what the transitional arrangements are about is not increases in rateable value but increases in the amount of rates paid <e>", "<cs> touche <e>", "<cs> my lords does the response that the minister gave to my noble friend indicate that the government are in full agreement with the european commissioner for the environment signor carlo ripa de meana as regards the ability or otherwise of this government to derogate from european drinking water standards <e> <s> is the minister confident that the governments existing policy is in accordance with ec directives <e>", "<cs> my lords as the water companies claim that the increase in prices is occasioned by the impending privatisation proposals and as at the same time the government are apparently saying that they have no power over the water companies to do anything other than to urge them to phase their increases will not the public draw the justified conclusion that those increases are the direct responsibility of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords how will the minister resolve the potential conflict of interest which will happen under privatisation <e> <s> as i understand it under the existing system it is to the benefit of the water authorities to encourage people to conserve water whereas under privatisation especially with meters they will be paid according to how much they sell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of croy both on his good furtune and on his characteristic skill <e> <s> his good fortune of course is in winning a place in the ballot <e> <s> his skill lies both in the precision of the wording of his motion and particularly in the timing of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may not be aware that the select committee on the environment of another place says that some cases have involved exports from the united kingdom <e> <s> therefore it is not only my noble friend lord hatch of lusby who has to give information but the select committee on the environment of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the gratitude of those on this side of the house who appreciate his setting out in advance the three weakest possible arguments for water privatisation that we have yet heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the very welcome increase in funding arose from a disagreement between the briefing of the prime minister and that of the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> if the briefing had informed the prime minister that the figure was million would the result have been a million increase <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has undoubtedly responded to the letter of my noble friends question but he has not appreciated the spirit of it <e> <s> if as i understand it we are talking about the green giant site which has been the subject of application for planning for government offices for many years does not the noble lord agree that the proposed use of that site for government offices is totally overtaken by the expressed desire of the government to disperse government offices to other parts of the country outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave a disappointing reply to the noble lord lord hayter who asked for guidance about what the man in the street should do when disposing of a refrigerator <e> <s> can he give any guidance to those of us who have recently acquired halon fire extinguishers which i am told are many times worse than refrigerators in their potential to damage the atmosphere as to how we are to dispose of them as we bought them without knowing how dangerous they can be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will permit me to intervene <e> <s> he has already answered the point i was going to make <e> <s> if the local authority is sensible and these labour local authorities are it would recognise that the government will only give money to their own appointees <e> <s> they will not give it to elected local authorities <e> <s> that is the realism that the local authorities have shown <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way again <e> <s> i have a very quick point to make <e> <s> the research in to which i referred showed that by there were more old etonians than trade unionists on these bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords my formal task is to thank all noble lords including even the noble baroness lady blatch who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i do that with complete sincerity <e> <s> the debate has given me a great deal of pleasure <e> <s> i gained especial pleasure from the contributions from three former secretaries of state <e> <s> my noble friend lord ennals made the point about the health service which was not only unanswerable but unanswered that all locally elected participation in it has been withdrawn <e> <s> despite prompting from his noble friend lord rippon the minister made no attempt to answer that point <e> <s> it remains on the record as an accusation which cannot be denied and which the government made no attempt to deny <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having arrived after this debate started <e> <s> i can only say in mitigation that my faith in the health service is undiminished though it has been slightly dented temporarily by spending three-and-a-half hours this morning in a casualty waiting room <e> <s> i only intervene in the knowledge that my noble friends lord graham and lord pitt and the noble lord lord tordoff besides the noble baroness lady gardner have made the most substantive points that need to be made against these orders <e> <s> i wish to add the point of view of one who took part in the passage of the housing bill which is now the housing act <e>", "<cs> my lords surely taxpayers subsidise owner occupiers who have tax-subsidised mortgages however large the house is in relation to the size of the family <e> <s> the government are being inconsistent in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport and general workers union withdrew its opposition when it was offered <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord renwick for the lucid and candid way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> i wish to start by saying that i agree entirely with what the noble lord lord elton has just said namely that it is a proper bill to come before noble lords <e> <s> it is a proper use of the private bill procedure because the market was established by statute and can be changed only by statute <e> <s> i also want to say at the outset that i recognise that in promoting the bill the city corporation has done so entirely properly in the sense that planning permission for the proposed developments has been sought and obtained both at spitalfields itself and at temple mills <e> <s> there is therefore no attempt here to bypass planning procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has used the word bribe which i did not say <e> <s> it is interesting to hear confirmed that there are substantial commercial risks involved which in the noble lords view justify that sort of payment <e> <s> one is talking about millions of pounds and what may be hundreds of thousands of pounds for each individual trader <e> <s> so there are such risks and if at the moment the market is relatively successful and the local community wants it to remain there then i shall need a lot of persuading that the payments are truly justified <e>", "<cs> my lords the select committee will have the opportunity to look at the payments and at the elements of those payments which relate to actual costs and to risks and at that element which could only by residue be called bribes <e> <s> i think that it may well be found that there are some elements of all three <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for his intervention <e> <s> i shall ensure that he has a copy of the letter to which i referred <e> <s> i propose to send a copy to the lord chairman of committees and to the clerk of the parliaments <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to do so <e> <s> in accordance with the conventions of this house it will be accepted that i have no intention of dividing the house against a second reading of a private bill <e> <s> however i do feel that there has been sufficient concern expressed about the bill about the effect on the community from which the market comes and indeed about the effect on the viability of the market to ensure that the select committee of your lordships house must consider it to be a matter of very grave concern and take very serious account of the arguments both for and against the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is right and proper <e> <s> in making my remarks i said that the noble lord had been impeccable in declaring his interest <e> <s> i apologise to him for not being able to give him advance notice of what i was going to say but i did not have advance notice myself because i did not know that he was going to speak for the spitalfields market tenants association <e> <s> if i had known in advance i should certainly have given him an indication of my concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not suggest that the corporation was in any way party to such a letter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge that in his second attempt to answer the question of the noble lord lord ezra he gave a totally unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> he did not explain why the consumers of water should be required to pay for the historical neglect of our beaches which we acknowledge to have been going on for a very long time <e> <s> will he now explain why the public as a whole rather than the consumers should be required to pay for the cleaning up of our beaches <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing that gives me pleasure in rising to the dispatch box to speak on the bill is the prospect of crossing swords once again with the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> we have had this experience on a number of occasions in the past <e> <s> although our disputes have never been less fierce they have always been courteous <e> <s> i can see that that will happen again at least on his side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> is it not the case that the water act gave the water authorities the power to raise money in the private market <e> <s> was it not his government which refused to give the water authorities the authority to exercise that power which was given by legislation <e> <s> therefore is not the difficulty of the noble lords own making <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has a curious view of th century history and of the history of the water industry long before the th century <e> <s> it was those in the public sector notably the big cities who were in the forefront of improving water quality throughout the th century <e> <s> they had to take over from the private sector in order to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister seriously claiming that what is proposed is to transfer the water industry from the crown to the people <e> <s> surely in practice it is transferring the water industry from all of the people to a very few people <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that such a reasoned opinion will have to be disclosed in the prospectuses for water privatisation <e> <s> if the government do not give better answers than those of the minister this morning will not privatisation be seriously in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has signally failed to answer any of the questions about the statistics put by my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> even if we were to accept his figures that of million for the cost of rates is in fact not the official figure the cipfa figure being million are they not an admission that the cost of collection of the poll tax will be twice as much as the cost of collection of rates <e>", "<cs> the noble earl made a suggestion along these lines in a debate in this chamber last year when he was arguing for a more widely based environmental protection agency <e> <s> as i recall i was somewhat cool to the idea because i felt that changing names does not change very much <e> <s> what is important is to change functions <e> <s> although i have come round to the view that an environmental protection agency more broadly based is a wise policy i am nervous about this amendment because of the point in which the noble earl himself rejoices that it changes only the name without in any way changing the functions <e>", "<cs> i assure the minister that the opposition will concentrate on the substance not on the name <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord seriously suggesting that i am putting unworthy thoughts into the minds of the pure souled and high-minded people who are proposing to take over our water authorities and that it would not have occurred to them otherwise to dispose of their land assets for a profit <e>", "<cs> the minister is quite right <e> <s> the amendment refers to the freehold of all land <e> <s> that land which is required at any lime for the operational requirements of the water supply plcs will be leased to the water supply plcs <e> <s> therefore they will be at no risk of lack of access to the land they need for their operations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the discussion on these amendments <e> <s> may i first deal with one or two points about the wording of the amendments before going to the more fundamental issues with which the committee is faced <e> <s> i start with the noble lord lord renton who referred to the amendments as partial nationalisation of the land by the back door <e> <s> this is not nationalisation of any land <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the issue of whether it is national or involves different water companies is fundamental <e> <s> the fundamental issue is what is the remit of the national rivers authority what are the remits of the water authorities now how do they compare with the purpose and the objectives of the plcs to be established under the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness knows more from personal experience of the management and conservation of wilderness land than i do <e> <s> i readily concede that <e> <s> of course i do not say that there should not be sensible and effective management and active conservation of wilderness land and other land in water authority ownership <e> <s> it is entirely consistent with the other objectives of the national rivers authority that it should have that responsibility <e> <s> indeed that is what is proposed in the amendments <e>", "<cs> i may not know very much about the conservation and management of wilderness land but i do know something about our planning laws <e> <s> i know the inadequacy of our <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble earl about what the public want <e> <s> my amendment specifically provides for his concerns <e> <s> it says specifically that all land required for operational purposes shall be leased to the water companies that any land which they subsequently do not want shall come back to the national rivers authority and any land which they subsequently do want shall be <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not discard any offer of discussion or further consideration <e> <s> i said that i looked forward eagerly to seeing the amendments <e> <s> i shall of course be glad to have discussions about them with the minister before they are formulated <e> <s> that does not in any way conflict with the rest of what i say <e> <s> the noble earl made it clear that his amendments will be to clause <e> <s> the fundamental point which must not be ignored is that clause is subordinate to clause and that the objective of the new water companies must be to make a profit <e> <s> otherwise why are we spending our time here at all <e> <s> this is not an environmental bill it is a bill to privatise water based on the argument that the industry will be operated more efficiently in the private sector <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble baroness asks me a question or seeks to make a point at a rather late stage in the debate <e> <s> perhaps i may take her point as it appears to be intended and answer her question <e> <s> i believe that not only all the organisations concerned with the environment but a large number of people in this country who do not have any specialist knowledge think that the environment will be gravely at risk if land that has been in public ownership through the water authorities which have constraints laid on them by statute is transferred to public limited companies whose primary objective is to make a profit <e> <s> the more i hear of the danger to the privatisation process from any attempt to take non-operational land away from them the more i believe that privatisation is not about running water more efficiently but about selling off our land assets <e> <s> if it comes down to that it is on those grounds that i ask the committee to take a decision on this matter <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene either but i was tempted by the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> in the sense that the noble earl lord shannon said it is true that the polluter does not pay <e> <s> on the other hand if the polluter has to add the cost of remedying the pollution to his prices there is some incentive on him which otherwise does not exist to reduce the pollution <e> <s> i strongly support the point made by the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> if we did not hold to the principle of making the polluter pay at least in the first instance we should be back to lord shaftesbury and the employment of children in our factories <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord renton will remember that the explanatory and financial memorandum to the bill says

make an apology <e> <s> there is an error which may have caused confusion <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> refers to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister has gone scarcely any further than his honourable friend colin moynihan in another place almost two months ago <e> <s> at that stage he indicated that there would be further safeguards <e> <s> i believe he <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord nugent knows there are certainly practical problems here <e> <s> they are it seems to me of two kinds <e> <s> the first is an ongoing problem which relates to the need as the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said for impartial witnesses in any case <e> <s> a great deal of money can be involved in the enforcement of provisions to protect water quality <e> <s> we must therefore be absolutely certain that the effect of part iii of the control of pollution act and the implementation and enforcement of these provisions are not in any way damaged by the risk of partiality on the part of those taking the tests <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> it would have to be a company or organisation in order to carry out the work it could not be carried out by a private individual <e> <s> a person in this sense means a company or organisation which is an undertaking <e> <s> in my view that is a common occurrence in legislation <e> <s> therefore i do not think that the long-term objections to our amendments have a great deal of strength <e>", "<cs> that is a most disappointing answer <e> <s> i offered the minister an opportunity to give further assurances <e> <s> i said that i would deal with the practical points of computing and laboratory services in the early stages of the bills proceedings by withdrawing the amendment and bringing forward another at a later stage <e> <s> the bill as it stands does not provide for a separation of functions between the regulator and the operator <e> <s> the ministers refusal to go any further by way of assurances means that we shall land up when the transitional period is over with the operator exercising those contracted-out functions on the part of the regulator <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that the minister has allowed ideological objections to catch up with him on this occasion <e> <s> he does not always do that and it is sad to see when it happens <e> <s> his advisers have formed a view that the word plan is ideologically unsound although he used the words clear planning framework with every appearance of approval <e> <s> the distinction between a plan and a clear planning framework is not entirely clear <e> <s> if the world plan is ideologically unsound for him he is in a great deal of difficulty <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will be kind enough to accept it i should like to offer my support for the amendment and the subsequent amendments that he proposes to move <e> <s> his last point was especially telling <e> <s> it relates to the case that i was trying to make for a coherent statement of the function of the nra because there is a necessity for public confidence in the nra <e> <s> if the nra is to perform effectively as the guardian of conservation and environmental standards not only must it have as i failed to convince the committee a business plan but the public must be convinced that it is obtaining the best possible advice <e>", "<cs> am i alone in detecting a certain degree of political schizophrenia in the governments response to this amendment as there was in the response to the earlier amendment moved by my noble friend lord graham of edmonton about the membership of the nra <e> <s> in one breath the minister refers to a strong and independent body in the next breath he repeats the tired old stuff about the secretary of states accountability to parliament which appears to mean that the members of the nra cannot possibly represent anyone else or be in any way independent of the secretary of state <e> <s> they must all be appointed at his whim and must apparently be paid according to what he says <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord ezra in this matter <e> <s> of the two positions held by the government i prefer the strong and independent nra to the subservient nra which is enshrined in the bill <e>", "<cs> the minister seems to believe that it is good enough to suggest that the nra could fund its capital expenditure requirement i notice that he did not deny that there would be a capital expenditure requirements or requirements larger than revenue expenditure requirements by a combination of charges and grant-in-aid <e> <s> the problem with that is first that the charges which are charges fundamentally on local authorities will have to be met out of local authority revenue income <e> <s> that will make the budgeting of the local authority community charge difficult and erratic because it cannot be predicted as to when those expenditures will occur <e> <s> they may be high at certain times and may then fall off <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble earl has given me an opportunity to say once again that i did not spurn his earlier offer of discussion or consideration of amendments <e> <s> i said that since the amendments related to clause they could not meet the fundamental difficulty and could not be other than secondary and inadequate to meet the more basic point which we were making <e> <s> that was the basis on which we were forced to proceed to a vote <e> <s> i shall of course be very pleased to have an opportunity to discuss the amendments with him and agree with them as far as i possibly can <e>", "<cs> i have had an opportunity to have a quick skim through the document issued by the national rivers authority <e> <s> i notice that there is no reference whatever to the degree of consideration which the nra will give the recommendations of its regional advisory committees <e> <s> therefore it is not inappropriate for me to move this amendment <e> <s> i believe that the ministers response is interesting but i do not believe that it resolves the issue <e>", "<cs> my amendment no <e> <s> is being taken with this amendment and since i now have my own copy of the national rivers authority document i have the advantage of the noble lord lord norrie in this matter <e>", "<cs> again my amendment no <e> <s> is linked with this amendment and it will fall if this amendment is agreed to <e> <s> in any event the noble earls amendment is better than mine <e> <s> the word wholly becomes redundant <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl because i believe that there should be an arms length relationship between the regional advisory committee and the authority <e> <s> i know that it is not the governments intention that there should be a major overlap of membership <e> <s> there should be no overlap at all

the fact that the opposition are not wildly enthusiastic about the amendment <e> <s> that will be obvious from what i and my noble friends said on second reading <e> <s> we share the view of per cent

beloff <e> <s> i have not finished my remarks <e>", "<cs> i agree that the two are not identical <e> <s> our final choice will depend upon the final form that the bill takes <e> <s> neither i the noble lord lord beloff nor the minister know exactly what form privatisation will take and therefore we cannot give the precise prescription for correcting it afterwards but correct it we shall <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may quote the west kent water authority which had the largest increase of p in the pound of which p <e>", "<cs> as is clear the chairman of the eastbourne water company was referring to the privatisation of the rest of the water industry <e> <s> i shall gladly let the minister see his statement if he wishes to <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> what he strictly said was that under the bill the shareholder comes before the consumer and that his amendments were intended to correct that position <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will have an opportunity to make another speech if she still wishes to do so <e> <s> however the crux of the matter in her argument is the phrase having the licence taken away <e> <s> we all know that the licence cannot be taken away <e> <s> the new water authority plcs <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i should like to intervene because he made a direct challenge to me and to my noble friend lord cledwyn <e> <s> i would not intervene again except for that reason <e> <s> i said from this dispatch box that we would have to reverse the bill of the noble lord lord nugent as much as mr ridleys bill <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that from our point of view this could not be thought to be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it is something that we should have to deal with in any event <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add my support to the amendment so poetically moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> she has made it much clearer than could be said in ordinary prose that a customer service committee or a consumer council as it is in other privatised industries is an absolutely essential part of the regulatory process <e> <s> that has been so in every single privatisation measure introduced so far by this government <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do i say to the noble earl that he would only have the nerve to make that reply in the absence of his noble friend lord renton <e> <s> in common parlance the words may and shall means something different <e> <s> if the government are seriously saying that shall would imply an obligation to specify the number of customer service committees that could easily have been solved by a much more conciliatory approach in saying that the number of customer service committees can be decided later <e> <s> it was not necessary to respond in this way to the noble baronesss amendment which anybody in common parlance would understand as meaning the possibility that customer service committees would not be set up <e>", "<cs> yes i am speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> a which is on the same point but referring to schedule as opposed to clause <e> <s> the point of both amendments if i may make this clear to members who do not have the bill in front of them is that clause deals with the principles of the establishment of customer service committees and schedule deals with the details <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the minister has been briefed on the specific amendments <e> <s> it is entirely my responsibility to have widened the basis of the debate and not his <e> <s> if he and the government front bench think about the <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord rose to his feet he knew that we would not be satisfied with that answer <e> <s> he knew that because we have already made it clear and have taken the opinion of the committee on the matter that we do not agree that it is appropriate for the role of consumer advocacy which is what the customers service committees are doing to be subordinate to the role of regulation <e> <s> therefore we do not agree that it is satisfactory for the co-ordination and taking further of the activities of the customer service committees to be left entirely in the hands of the director general as is proposed <e>", "<cs> my only response to that piece of gobbledegook is that i am tempted to divide the committee simply because of the nature of the answer given to me <e> <s> we are asking people voluntarily to serve on customer service committees <e> <s> many noble lords here tonight serve voluntarily on all sorts of organisations in the public interest <e> <s> they do not do so because of any hope of aggrandisement or profit but because they believe it to be a worthwhile job where they can make some improvement in the conditions of the people or the orgnisations with which the voluntary bodies are concerned <e>", "<cs> i should like now to give the minister an opportunity to reconsider his position <e> <s> we now have the <e>", "<cs> it is one thing to maintain financial controls and we are not disputing that in making these amendments <e> <s> our amendments say very specifically that there are financial controls resting with the secretary of state and the treasury and therefore accountability to parliament is not at risk <e> <s> but making a financial plan is not the same thing for a customer service committee as having the staff that it needs within these restrictions and appointed by itself to do its own work <e> <s> it is an insult to the potential members of the customer service committee to suggest that they are incapable of doing that themselves <e>", "<cs> i too hope that the government will find it possible to support at least the principle of this amendment <e> <s> i say that even though i am not in any way confident about its wording <e> <s> indeed i heard the noble earl lord onslow say that he would not make us walk around in support of it <e> <s> that is perhaps a pity since he has received support from all sides of the committee <e> <s> however whether or not the wording is right the principle must surely be sound that the consultation rights which have been held by the water authorities which are public bodies should not be passed without amendment to private companies otherwise we shall find that under the companies act the private companies will be in a privileged position in relation to other private companies <e> <s> that seems to me to be a real difficulty which sets them apart from other private companies and which dilutes the effectiveness of the privatisation procedure <e> <s> i am not saying that i am in favour of the privatisation procedure but it is a distortion of privatisation to allow this change to go through without the protection proposed in the amendment moved by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i could hardly speak to amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord in whose name the amendment is tabled is not present tonight <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the minister has said <e> <s> i listened also to the noble lord lord renton and the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> if i am accused of being a thatcherite by the one and of having an atavistic hatred of the entrepreneur by the other i must be <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i should have provoked the minister to repeat that tired set of arguments <e> <s> we will find an opportunity at another stage therefore to put on the record that the water authorities established under the act have been consistently reducing their operating costs over the years and have been increasing their efficiency <e> <s> that is well established and it will have to be shown when the prospectus is issued for the new companies because the opportunities for further cost savings are severely restricted by the increases in efficiency that have taken place over the past years <e> <s> that was not the issue that i thought we were debating but it is useful to have an opportunity to repudiate the statement which the minister has just felt it necessary to make <e>", "<cs> although it was grouped with mine i was not able to refer to the noble lords amendment because he was not in the chamber at the time <e> <s> perhaps he would prefer to <e>", "<cs> they overlap but the arguments that i wish to put on them are somewhat different <e> <s> i am still trying to draw out of the government some consistency between their public statements and the text of the bill <e> <s> each time i have a go at it i get a little further <e> <s> if it is at the expense of the committee this evening i sincerely apologise <e> <s> however in my view i did not make progress last time <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that that was not a successful amendment <e> <s> it gained me no insight into the governments thinking <e> <s> i am sorry about that because i think that the relationship between clause a and clause b is a vital relationship for the bill <e> <s> in response to the previous amendments i thought that what the noble earl was saying sounded interesting and could even have been hopeful <e> <s> however what he has now said is simply a repetition of what has been said earlier <e> <s> i shall not detain the committee any longer on this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i sought to give the minister an opportunity to answer the question what is meant by a reasonable return on capital <e> <s> in order to help him i suggested three alternatives namely a continuation of the existing rate of return a utility rate or an equity rate of return <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkin of roding seemed to suggest that the reasonable rate of return would be a new market and somewhere between the utility and the equity rate of return <e> <s> that seems a perfectly rational answer to give but the minister gave no answer at all <e> <s> i wonder whether he is able to help the committee <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it would be kind or cruel to give the minister time to answer the question of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but i shall certainly not delay the committee with that in mind <e> <s> however i shall delay the committee for a moment longer because the persistent refusal of the noble earl to give an answer to what seems to me to be a reasonable question is all too clear <e> <s> if the bill contains the words <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely <e> <s> the gearing will be absolutely critical <e> <s> we shall put down amendments to that effect later on <e> <s> however that confirms what i am saying <e> <s> parliament is being asked to buy a pig in a poke <e> <s> parliament is being asked to approve of a privatisation measure without having any idea of the real financial terms on which this privatisation measure is being put forward <e>", "<cs> it is hardly my job to do anything other than seek to draw out the governments argument <e> <s> i am not seeking to draw the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> he is not responsible for the bill <e> <s> i am asking the government to give us straight answers about the cost to the consumer of this legislation <e> <s> we are entitled to know what the cost to the consumer will be <e>", "<cs> this bill has been before parliament since before christmas <e> <s> these are absolutely critical figures which have been <e>", "<cs> i suppose this amendment has had an interesting result in that although i fondly imagined that the phoney arguments that there would be meaningful competition for the privatised water industry were dead and buried they have been exhumed by the noble earl in his reply <e> <s> the problem with this answer an answer which closely reflected that given by the minister in another place that in practice there will be significant competition is that the requirement for the competition to be effective is that the director must have some kind of performance review procedure <e> <s> that is the meaning of this subsection if it has any meaning in it whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i have studied the relevant parts of that monopolies and mergers commission report <e> <s> i do not claim that i have read the whole thing but the report was concerned with a single application of a single water authority and the statutory water companies within that authority <e> <s> that is not the same as saying that it is possible to carry out comparisons across the whole country which is what the capital market is supposed to do if there is to be meaningful comparative competition <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that we have detained the noble lord lord hesketh from the celebrations <e> <s> i hope that she took it from a democrat and not from a labour councillor <e>", "<cs> i thought that that might be the case and it lessens the pain somewhat <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord hesketh will convey our totally non-partisan familial congratulations to the dowager lady hesketh <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene but i am tempted by the noble earls reference to east bay having worked nights in a canning factory in emeryville at the foot of the oakland bay bridge one summer in <e> <s> as i remember it my canning factory was sending out very nasty effluents into the bay <e> <s> i am delighted to hear from the noble earl that that is no longer possible <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount sits down it is not intended in this amendment that conservation should have priority over recreation <e> <s> it is simply that the words have to be in one order or another <e> <s> there is no intention whatever that full attention should not be paid to recreation <e> <s> there is of course sometimes a conflict as the noble viscount will recognise between access and recreation <e> <s> that is a professional or technical matter it is not an issue which we intend to pre-judge in our wording of the new clause <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has raised an interesting and most helpful point <e> <s> the intention is that those who receive land under the act that is the water undertakings shall have a continuing responsibility whether or not they continue to own the land <e> <s> such undertakings as they dispose of the land must secure adequate covenants to give effect to the provisions under this clause and under clause <e> <s> that is a well-established procedure which exists in many circumstances in the private sector <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for that helpful point <e> <s> it seems to me that what we are gathering from this discussion is that all members of the committee who have spoken thus far are in favour of the principle of continuity <e> <s> indeed that includes the noble lord lord renton and the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> if so and if it is the case as the noble earl lord radnor suggested that the covenant procedure is not adequate then we must find a way of ensuring that the act makes that protection available <e>", "<cs> i am always pleased when the noble earl feels it necessary to depart from the departmental brief and go to the conservative central office brief or is it the prime ministers speech writer who wrote the piece about former marxist traditions in the labour party <e> <s> i do not think that comes from marsham street <e> <s> i shall save myself the pleasure of responding to the noble earls speech until i have dealt with the remarks of other noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e>", "<cs> i am the first to congratulate the noble earl in achieving success with his amendment on thursday night <e> <s> i think that was well worth doing <e> <s> but i have to remind the noble earl that what he contemptuously described as walking around in circles or what outside this chamber could be described as walking around in a circle down to the polling station and back again is rather an important part of our democracy <e> <s> it is important for our democracy that we express our opinions <e> <s> people outside this chamber as well as members on these benches expect us to express our opinions as clearly as we can <e> <s> we do not always do so in the expectation of immediate success but in the expectation that people will understand that what we are saying is right <e> <s> i think this amendment is right <e> <s> i hope i shall not have to make a second peroration on this amendment and that the committee will be prepared to proceed to a division <e>", "<cs> i was impressed by the simplicity and effectiveness of the amendments when i saw them on the marshalled list <e> <s> i am even more impressed having listened to the closely and powerfully argued case put forward by the noble lord lord norrie <e> <s> it cannot be the public conception of water privatisation or if it is it cannot be to the advantage of this government that the effect will be that non-operational land of the water authorities will be in effect free from all the environmental constraints that are sought in clauses and <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord makes up his mind whether to press this amendment may i draw his attention to two points about the ministers reply which was in some ways helpful <e> <s> the first is that he is relying substantially on the code of practice in clause <e> <s> as we shall be showing later today this code of practice is deeply defective <e> <s> it lacks statutory authority and it contains a number of provisos that make it much less effective than we should like it to be <e>", "<cs> i have not yet spoken to amendment no <e> <s> which will be dealt with later <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble earl must not confuse listening with agreement <e> <s> i listened carefully to what he said but i disagree <e> <s> on that issue so does his noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> it is not that i do not listen to him but that i do not agree <e>", "<cs> i very much enjoyed the ministers final remark that the amendments he intends to table on report may deal with the problem but there again they may not <e> <s> that is the problem we face <e> <s> we do not know what amendments the noble earl intends to table nor does he <e> <s> we have to go on stating our case regardless of imprecise commitments <e> <s> they cannot be called commitments <e>", "<cs> should the noble lord lord hesketh ever by challenged about the obtrusive nature of his house he needs only to show the picture of his house with his charming family in front of it published in <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister saw fit to accuse the ramblers association and those who took part in yesterdays demonstration of being misguided <e> <s> my noble friend had made it very clear that many people there were seriously concerned about a restriction in their rights and were seriously dissatisfied with the governments proposals <e> <s> however they acknowledged and were grateful for the progress made on report in another place <e>", "<cs> the minister will not be surprised to learn that i am not satisfied with phrases in a code of conduct which is in itself unsatisfactory and which has inadequate powers <e> <s> however i agree with him that striking a reasonable balance is the right way to approach the matter <e> <s> it does not of course solve the problem in any particular case but it at least reminds those concerned of the differences of interest which may arise <e> <s> i thought that amendment no <e> <s> a went some way towards striking a reasonable balance but the minister seems <e>", "<cs> i echo what the noble lord lord greenway has said <e> <s> in the light of the ministers offer which i should be delighted to take up with him if he wishes me to do so i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> it will be obvious to the committee that amendment no <e> <s> a has exactly the same effect as that moved by the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> i rise only to support heartily everything that he said <e> <s> it appears that the definition of inland waters is at variance with common sense in that it does not mean what the ordinary man in the street would think it to mean <e> <s> but when we come to the legal definition the noble earl has far more experience of those matters than i do it means different things in different parts of the legislation <e>", "<cs> i listened willingly to what the noble earl has said despite my reservations about the status of the code of practice which are well known <e> <s> i think that he is being somewhat unfair to the amendment <e> <s> it states that apart from the named bodies the <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for that restatement of the governments intention <e> <s> however i must say that when he says that the subsection does not alter the bill and is only there for clarification and in virtually the same breath complains that it has been widely misunderstood i wonder whether it is achieving its objective <e> <s> i do not believe that the misunderstanding is out of ill will or particular stupidity on the part of those suspicious of it <e> <s> it must surely be failing in its objective to secure clarification <e>", "<cs> i am not familiar with the legislative process of brooding <e> <s> it is a new thought to me <e> <s> however if that is the way that the minister wants to proceed i suppose i have no alternative but to let him brood and i hope that he will lay a rather large and healthy egg <e>", "<cs> i could scarcely believe my ears when i heard the noble lord say that these are technical amendments <e> <s> they are three large amendments one is significant in quantity and they raise issues of considerable importance <e> <s> i am sorry that they are raised at ten to eleven at night but even so i do not think we can allow the government to get away with passing over them just like that <e>", "<cs> will the minister explain what he means by the word translucent <e> <s> i believe that it means seeing light through but nothing in particular not giving a clear image <e> <s> is that what the minister means <e>", "<cs> the word transparent means clear <e>", "<cs> before the matter is put i shall not detain the committee now but in view of the fact that we have had this debate back to front with the minister only explaining what the amendments mean after the debate has taken place it is only fair to say that we may wish to come back to this at a later stage <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall certainly not speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>

have disappeared altogether overnight <e>", "<cs> at this hour of the night i think it is necessary that we strip these amendments down to the bare essentials <e> <s> i agree with noble lords who said that amendment no <e> <s> a is unnecessary <e> <s> i think it would be wrong to impose on the secretary of state the duty to approve a code drawn up by somebody else <e> <s> i agree with the minister

difference between us about other owners occupiers and lessees <e> <s> although we do not agree it is not a matter that i propose to pursue tonight <e>", "<cs> we are talking about clause not

rivers authority and to the water undertakings <e>", "<cs> we are making progress only an inch at a time <e> <s> i do not think that is good enough <e> <s> the minister has now been criticised on this specific point by his noble friends lord renton and lord caldecote <e> <s> both the noble viscount and the noble lord asked him to do more than say he would read what has been said <e> <s> will he

make compliance with the code of practice a condition of appointment of the water and sewerage undertakers is a quite different matter <e> <s> it does not involve any of the issues of principle about primary and secondary legislation which the noble lord lord renton raises but provides the minimum enforceability which there ought to be for a code of practice <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i was being bare <e> <s> i said that i was reducing the arguments to a bare minimum <e> <s> that is rather different <e>", "<cs> from what i have heard the intention of amendment no <e> <s> b is not

is a matter of interest and concern to the city and in turn determines who the likely investors will be <e> <s> surely before the prospectus is issued and while the bill is still before parliament the government should make their position clear on this most important aspect of the flotation <e>", "<cs> i have seldom been the victim of such a piece of selective quotation as that which the noble earl has just put forward <e> <s> he read out a selected part of my amendment namely <e>", "<cs> we are not talking about an overwhelming burden on parliament <e> <s> we are talking about water authorities in the first instance and statutory water companies <e> <s> orders of this kind are commonly brought even <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right in saying that there can be subsequent debates on the performance of the water undertakings <e> <s> i venture to suggest that there will be subsequent debates on the performance of the water industry under privatisation <e> <s> that is an inevitable political fact <e> <s> but in one sense those debates will concern the whereabouts of the horse when the stable door has been shut behind it <e> <s> the true responsibility of parliament ought to be not only to consider what is going wrong after privatisation has taken place but to consider the process of privatisation including not only the passage of the bill but also the nature of the appointment agreement <e> <s> this will not be a standard appointment agreement produced on a word processor for all the water undertakings <e> <s> it is already clear we shall see this in discussion on the next amendment that the price charging formula the rpi plus k formula will not be the same for all the water undertakings <e> <s> the nature of the appointment and the rpi plus k formula for each undertaking is a matter of public concern particularly for the members of parliament representing the areas concerned by the appointment <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble earl could show me where on the record i said that the regulation is too harsh <e> <s> the only occasion on which i recall using those words was during second reading when i observed that the <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord seriously suggesting that that will be the case in the next years <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult situation <e> <s> we tried in putting forward this amendment to bring on to the face of the bill the opportunity to discuss one of the most important issues brought up by water privatisation <e> <s> i refer to the cost to the consumer <e> <s> we have done so in a form which does no more than bring out into the open the need for realistic calculations of water costs after privatisation <e> <s> we have not suggested a completely new way of assessing what water charges should be after privatisation <e> <s> we have done nothing radical <e> <s> we have not in any way suggested in the amendment delaying the process of privatisation or putting it under a different form of public control <e> <s> all we are saying is that people care about the price of water and that the government ought to be more open and honest about the calculations they are making and ought to share their thinking with the public <e>", "<cs> i sincerely thank the minister for what he said <e> <s> the changes that he is proposing in the status of the disconnection code and the leakage code are real changes <e> <s> the additional power that the director will have to seek to secure compliance with the code and the enforcement that will be applied are certainly an advance on anything that the government have said before <e> <s> i wish to pursue this matter with the minister in a moment <e>", "<cs> that is a generous and realistic response <e> <s> i believe that parts of the general code could be treated in the same way as the government now propose to treat the leakage and disconnection codes and i think we shall make even more progress than the real progress which we made just now <e> <s> in the light of that i am very pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot resist that can i <e> <s> i am content for the government to take the amendment away and think about it <e> <s> i am grateful for the interventions of other members of the committee which i am sure helped to convince the government that this was the right thing to do <e> <s> i shall only add that it seems to be assumed that all the existing authorities trumpet their environmental achievements <e> <s> i do not think that is quite the case <e> <s> i think the necessity for a provision along these lines lies in the fact that although one would think all the authorities trumpet their environmental achievements that is not the case <e>", "<cs> in relation to the specific points concerning clause the minister is quite right to remind the committee that the secretary of state under clause la has the obligation to notify local authorities of an application in the area <e> <s> however he has not specifically responded to my point about i am sorry i need to have so many pieces of paper at the same time local authorities which may not be in the same area but which may act as sewerage agent for the undertaking <e> <s> i think that there is nothing illogical in saying that a local authority which acts as a sewerage agent but is responsible for a different area should have the same rights of notification as the local authority in whose area the application falls <e>", "<cs> i think that is fair <e> <s> the original interpretation of my amendments was incorrect and i think that it would be right for me to give the government an opportunity to think about the amendments in the way that has been suggested <e> <s> i hope that the government will seek to return to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> if not we shall <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have heard those arguments on many occasions before and they are no more convincing now than they were before <e> <s> the government seek to assure us that when there is a range of potential obligations or opportunities it is standard practice to use the term may instead of the word shall on the grounds that it is more flexible to include may in order that the government the director the secretary of state or whoever can pick and choose <e> <s> i believe that that is the implication of what the noble lord said in respect of the different obligations <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble earl two specific questions <e> <s> first does he think that the public who are very concerned with environmental and recreational matters and who have been widely alerted to the protections which are supposed to exist in part i of the bill will be satisfied with permissive rather than mandatory conditions of appointment in clause <e> <s> does he not think that public confidence in the governments good intentions in drafting part i will be strengthened if the government found a way round their drafting difficulties and put shall rather than may <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made no attempt to answer my questions <e> <s> he has simply read out the additional section of his brief which says if pressed <e> <s> i am not impressed i shall press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords some months ago when questions were raised in this house before the final route of the channel tunnel rail link was anounced by british rail i suggested that it would be cheaper for british rail to put the line underground than to face the delays and cost of compensation <e> <s> a number of people thought i was making a joke <e> <s> however i was not and british rail did not take my comments as a joke <e> <s> it became clear that british rail had realised that we had been approaching that happy state and that environmental protection by tunnelling was not only an environmentally desirable alternative to damage and compensation but was also an economically viable alternative in a number of cases <e> <s> in that sense perhaps the confusion of the compensation legislation is a benefit rather than a disadvantage <e> <s> clearly it must be better to prevent damage than to cause damage and pay for it afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to learn that the victoria tower is the next phase but can the minister tell the house why there is this substantial gap between the completion of the last phase and the phase now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a great and deplorable contrast between the relaxation of the rules for the central government public sector and the increasing tightening of the rules for local government which will be intensified in the local government and housing bill now before another place <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any idea how much more private finance of the water industry will cost the taxpayer and water consumer as opposed to public finance <e>", "<cs> the minister appears to put the protection of the secretary of states all-seeing powers and all-powerful statutory duties before almost any other consideration indeed before every other consideraton <e> <s> it seems to be suggested that the intervention of local authorities into the responsibilities under the act for ensuring drinking water quality is a new proposal <e> <s> that is not the case <e>", "<cs> it was the minister who raised the question of the later clauses not i i shall respond to the challenge <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him of the clause to which he referred <e> <s> he accused me of referring selectively to that clause <e> <s> as he rightly said clause states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the minister for repeating that answer given in another place <e> <s> from what he has said the answer sounds encouraging <e> <s> i was particularly encouraged to hear of the financial help from english heritage and the government to protect the rose theatre <e>", "<cs> this is clearly a statement of the utmost importance <e> <s> i shall break precedent straight away by asking the minister to let me have a copy of the speech he has just made as quickly as possible in writing because we are due to debate later on this afternoon a number of the issues which he has touched on in his wide-ranging review <e>", "<cs> clearly the noble lord is blessed with a photographic memory and has taken in every single word which the minister said <e>", "<cs> i am not capable of doing that <e> <s> we have a series of amendments which we could debate more effectively if we all had a photographic memory and were able to take account of what the minister has said <e> <s> clearly it was a prepared statement and it may have been issued as a press release i should not be at all surprised <e> <s> certainly it is expected that a statement of such importance will be made available to the press in order that it can be accurately reported on television and in the press <e>", "<cs> the noble earls reply confirms my worst fears <e> <s> all that he is able to say in response to a direct challenge is that it is extremely unlikely that a contravention which is trivial would be a danger to health <e> <s> in other words he is saying that there is a possibility of the secretary of state being unable to secure or to make or confirm a provisional order that is necessary to stop a nuisance which is a danger to health <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls appears to forget that clause is negative in effect <e> <s> the secretary of state or the director cannot make a final order or make or confirm a provisional order if the contravention is deemed to be trivial <e> <s> in other words the fail-safe position is the wrong way round <e> <s> however it is clear that we are not going to make any progress with the wording of the amendment so while reserving our rights to come back to it i feel it better that i should beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows perfectly well from observation that i do not speak from notes <e> <s> if he has seen <e>", "<cs> i must confess i find that reply totally illogical and irrational <e> <s> the bill already makes provision for local authorities to be notified of applications and variations to appointments <e> <s> how different is it now to ask for local authorities to be notified about information which is essential to the performance of their duties under clause and clause and probably under clause although i have not got that far in my exegesis <e> <s> if they need to know about applications and variations of appointments surely they also need to know about any subsequent failure of the undertakers to meet the appointment conditions <e> <s> would that not be a logical consequence of the distribution of information to local authorities which is already a part of the bill <e> <s> i do not understand why that situation is so different <e>", "<cs> there is no more rationale in the governments answer now than there was before <e> <s> it is not a matter on which i seek to divide the committee although i am completely unconvinced by the answers given by the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i ought to have a copy <e>", "<cs> i am very anxious not to widen the debate into a full procedural debate on this matter i wish only to answer the direct question put by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls and to say one thing with reference to the rules of debate in this house <e>", "<cs> it is sauce for the goose but not apparently for the gander <e> <s> i shall not ask the noble lord for a transcript of his speech <e> <s> what he said has given me sufficient indication despite the lack of the word shall which would be reassurance on the face of the bill that the secretary of state intends to bring in appropriate regulations so that the information we require will be made available to customers free of charge <e>", "<cs> that reply is in part reassuring but our amendment specifically says that <e>", "<cs> that seems to make sense <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the noble lord has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall read very carefully what the noble earl said <e> <s> however it appears to me at the moment that he managed to misunderstand both of my amendments <e> <s> he talked about an unlimited obligation on the director to collect information <e> <s> however the collection of information is referred to under subsection not subsection <e> <s> i have not proposed any amendments to subsection <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord trafford has the same problem i have owing to the fact that references to the director general are to be found scattered throughout the bill in many different places <e> <s> it would be enormously helpful if there were at some stage a <e>", "<cs> clearly the government consider they are necessary otherwise they would not have included a separate clause dealing with the review <e> <s> if clause was adequte for the purpose then the extensive provisions in clauses and would not be necessary <e>", "<cs> that sounds a rather better answer than that which we received earlier and i am content to leave it at that <e> <s> i cannot imagine how any of the items in paragraphs a to e could possibly give rise to the need for the proviso contained in the phrase which amendment no <e> <s> a removes <e> <s> i shall be very interested to see what examples the department comes up with <e> <s> of course who is convinced is another matter <e> <s> what may convince the minister may not convince us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton has made my point much more succinctly and better than i was able to do <e> <s> we look forward to hearing what the department has to say with great anticipation but without any necessary assurance that we shall agree as to what is a convincing example <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am interested to hear what the minister says but he has not answered the question with which i introduced the discussion on this amendment <e> <s> what is it that the secretary of state could not do with regard to publication or advice which would not be available to him without the existence of this clause <e> <s> what powers would he be denied if this clause were not to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the phrase a general provision in order to clarify has a sinister ring <e> <s> it reminds me of an answer which the noble earl lord caithness was obliged to give in a debate on an amendment last week <e> <s> he said that the provision had no extra effect on the bill and was only required for the purposes of clarification <e> <s> since clearly it did not clarify the bill it left the government open to the charge that the provision that he was then talking about was a bit of waffle and not required at all <e>", "<cs> when the minister says that our amendment does not match up well with the procedure under the rpi plus k formula i take that as a compliment because that formula is so patently flawed as we have seen in discussions in committee that anything that matched up well with it would itself be flawed <e> <s> what astonishes me is that the minister sees fit to describe this as a technical matter <e> <s> it is far from that <e> <s> we have a price-setting regime under privatisation which in effect allows the water company undertakers to appeal to the director general and the secretary of state for increases in water prices almost without let or hindrance and at any time they see fit <e> <s> there is to be no appeal against increases in water prices on behalf of the consumers <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to express my support not only for the content of the amendment but for the way in which the noble baroness moved it <e> <s> she was both concise and poetic as is her wont <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> i then had the opportunity to read the statement for which i am grateful to somebody which enabled me to be more critical about it than i was at the beginning <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the minister has totally failed to convince me that the fears which i expressed at the beginning are not real fears <e> <s> he talked about the history of efforts to improve the situation and to secure compliance <e> <s> i did not say that there had been no efforts i said that compliance had not been achieved <e> <s> it is not a matter of making efforts <e> <s> even if efforts had been made which i beg leave to doubt it is already four years since the date by which compliance should have been achieved <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord trafford that the legislation should go wider than nitrates and lead <e> <s> we have nowhere near reached the stage where the government are even willing to set a time on compliance <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that we have returned so quickly to the repetition of what i still consider to be quite inadequate reasons for retaining the powers of the secretary of state to do what he likes in regulation rather than placing matters as they should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> i feel strongly that when we consider legislation of this kind we should have a clearer idea than we do from the bill as drafted of what the effect of the legislation will be <e> <s> however i understand the last point that the minister made about the discretion of the secretary of state <e> <s> it is a matter that i want to look at more fully <e> <s> without prejudice to any undertaking not to bring it back at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister tempts me <e> <s> i was well arare that the draft regulations were published in april <e> <s> that was why i wanted the minister to say as i believe he has done that the secretary of state will introduce regulations to that effect <e> <s> is there then any conceivable reason why faced with the possibility of defeat he might not agree to shall instead of may <e> <s> is there anything whatsoever to be lost by agreeing to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it is called a stand-up <e> <s> it is clear that the government will do the right thing <e> <s> i do not think that the committee would appreciate our pursuing the matter to a division at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there are two separate issues here <e> <s> the first is the question of the payment for keeping the fire hydrants in good working order and replacing them when necessary and the second is the question of development <e> <s> the first is perhaps the simplest one with which i can deal more quickly <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> i was fascinated by the noble baronesss reference to other privatisation legislation <e> <s> she will no doubt recall that the water bill is proceeding through this chamber at the present time <e> <s> there all of this discussion about the formulae for price regulation has been put into a cupboard in the back corridor under the name of rpi plus x in other words none of the formulae to which the noble baroness and my noble friend lord peston referred has been allowed out into the open <e> <s> has she discussed this matter with her noble honourable and right honourable friends in the department of the environment <e> <s> can she explain why such a different approach is being taken here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the opportunity given by my noble friend lord dormand and other speakers to hear this very interesting and obviously well-informed debate on what is clearly an exciting project <e> <s> my noble friend set out the benefits that the teesside development corporation sees resulting from the proposed barrage <e> <s> i shall not weary the house by repeating them <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendments of the noble lord lord wise in general terms and also to speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> b and za <e> <s> those amendments approach the same problem from a slightly different standpoint but one which i hope will gain the approval of the government and/or the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word in explanation to the noble earl lord balfour <e> <s> the substantial amendments refer to clause which deals with domestic water supply <e> <s> the first two amendments amendments nos <e> <s> a and b exclude non-domestic suppliers under clause from the prohibition on disconnection <e> <s> if the noble earl will look again at that i think he will find that although there may be technical defects this is not one of them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wise will speak last because his amendment comes first <e> <s> but i thought that it might be helpful if i said a few words because i had threatened i believe that is the right word that i would continue to move amendment no <e> <s> b even if the noble lord lord wise withdrew amendment noa <e>", "<cs> these appear to be reasonable and helpful amendments <e> <s> i am pretty sure that we welcome them <e> <s> the only question is whether the minister is proposing a closer definition of what is meant by a reasonable distance <e> <s> this matter has caused considerable concern in all the privatisation measures <e> <s> if he were able to define it more closely or to indicate where it is defined i should find that helpful <e>", "<cs> i do not respond in any way to the noble baronesss challenge to debate amendments which have already been withdrawn or not moved <e> <s> however i believe that her amendment is sensible <e> <s> she is speaking of the burden on water undertakers to issue notices to local authorities <e> <s> i am thinking about the burden on local authorities which must receive them <e> <s> on the face of it any restriction from unnecessary pieces of paper passing to and fro is desirable <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will not because i was convinced by his argument <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ezra responds to that i must say how very interested i was in the ministers reply especially when he talked about compliance with directives <e> <s> did he perhaps include european commission directives in that <e> <s> if so would he like to tell the committee what progress is being made in negotiations with the european commission under clause as amended <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds we listened with great attention to the noble lord reading the letter from the european environment commissioner <e> <s> no doubt the letter will be or has been placed in the library <e> <s> i think it will have to be because a letter of this kind which is read out in committee and is a communication from the european commission ought to be made available to noble lords who are concerned with the progress of this bill <e> <s> i assume that it ought to be placed in the house of commons library as well <e>", "<cs> the minister went backwards by referring to clause and to go back only as far as clause is surely a much lesser offence in procedural terms <e> <s> it is true that the reasoned opinion issued in april gave as a deadline for compliance two months from the date of issue of the reasoned opinion <e> <s> the government made it clear at that time and ought to repeat it that there was no possibility whatsoever of meeting the compliance requirements of the reasoned opinion within two months of the issue of the reasoned opinion <e>", "<cs> this sounds like the last-ditch stand of the may brigade the power as opposed to duty brigade <e> <s> the distinction between enforcement orders and regulations is a distinction without a difference <e> <s> there is no better reason for having may when as the minister says it is hardly conceivable that the secretary of state will not make the regulations <e> <s> it is clear that the european commission directive requires him to make the regulations <e> <s> on this occasion the minister might go back and say to his advisers and to the department <e>", "<cs> it is clear that there are points of agreement and points of difference on the matter <e> <s> the points of agreement are where we are all concerned that there should be a water quality control monitoring service <e> <s> the minister describes it as being the drinking water quality inspectorate within the department of the environment <e> <s> we describe it as being a monitoring service operated by the director general of water services <e>", "<cs> if that is the case can the minister suggest why it is that gas bills that is the nearest analogy one can think of if the minister rejects the analogy of food and clothing set out the quality of the product in that they specify the calorific value of the gas supplied <e> <s> is there any reason why what is done successfully for gas so far as we know should not also be done for water <e>", "<cs> i do not understand why there should be items on a water bill <e>", "<cs> the information could be provided by exception <e> <s> it is only necessary for the water undertaker to indicate those elements which are no doubt very few in which the water is short of the standards <e> <s> i do not find that argument convincing <e> <s> i do not think it is good enough to require consumers to be active consumers <e> <s> it is almost like saying that the government will not put a health warning on cigarettes but will make available in marsham street and in local offices of the department of the environment or in elizabeth house and the local offices of the department of education or in alexander fleming house and local offices of the department of health information on the relationship between smoking and lung cancer <e> <s> the time to do this is at the point of sale <e>", "<cs> even though we are not seeking to replay an earlier discussion i could have wished that the minister had responded to my suggestion that he might explain how these assessors this inspectorate would actually operate on the ground <e> <s> will they be based in marsham street and sally forth each morning to northumberland or cornwall <e> <s> will they be located in the regions where the inspectorial work has to be carried out <e> <s> is the minister able to give us any guidance as to how this extraordinary piece of democratic centralism is to work on the ground <e>", "<cs> it is clear that i shall not get a straight answer from the government on the matter <e> <s> i must reserve my right to come back to this important and erroneous provision in the bill at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hesketh chided me when we referred to this matter earlier on this afternoon <e> <s> he chided me for not having added my name to this amendment as i had complained about the effect of the subsection as it stood <e> <s> i accept the rebuke <e> <s> i must confess that i misread the amendment <e> <s> as the rubric of the clause refers to contaminated water i thought the amendment referred to contaminated water and not to the misuse of water <e> <s> i think this is a good and realistic amendment and in effect it relieves the abuse to which i referred earlier on <e> <s> as the noble earl said such abuse would be intolerable <e> <s> i am grateful to the government for bringing forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> on the face of it these seem very reasonable amendments and i am sure we shall want to support them <e> <s> however i wish to ask the noble earl whether with new regulations starting to apply to water mains inside or outside houses there is any risk of any cost or inconvenience falling upon consumers <e> <s> this is an extension and it would be helpful to have an idea of what risks may exist <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled by the ministers last remark <e> <s> he suggests that by replacing a power with a duty our amendments would prevent the secretary of state from making regulations which would create new conditions and new powers <e> <s> i cannot see how the amendments do that <e> <s> i shall take the three in turn <e> <s> first <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers confirmation that my amendments do not involve any limitation on the secretary of state <e> <s> i believe that my two fundamental points are still valid indeed the more so from the ministers retraction of his earlier remarks <e> <s> the first point is that there must be a continuing duty on all secretaries of state <e> <s> that would not be achieved by the may formula which is in the bill at present <e> <s> the second is that it seems to me that it is political suicide for the government to neglect the widespread and justified concern that exists over the state of our sewers <e> <s> they should not neglect an opportunity to put things right which exists and would exist and be strengthened by the acceptance of our amendments <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister seems to be falling into the same trap as he fell into before <e> <s> he asserts now as he asserted in connection with the last group of amendments that the amendments inhibit the secretary of state from making further regulations or detailed plans later <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> he should not have repeated the same claim as he made before and had to withdraw <e>", "<cs> this amendment even though it has been put forward as a probing amendment relates very clearly to the amendments that i have already moved <e> <s> the question of whether one can have adequate asset management plans that set adequate targets is crucial to the argument that the noble lord lord renton is putting forward <e>", "<cs> perhaps it could be achieved by pouring macerated sewage over troubled waters <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee <e> <s> i said that i would speak to two other amendments and i did not <e> <s> i wished to speak only to amendments nos <e> <s> za zb and zd <e>", "<cs> the minister and the noble lord lord nugent have spoken more against amendment no <e> <s> za which would give the local authorities a prescriptive right to carry on the agency agreements than amendment no <e> <s> zb <e> <s> in abandoning my argument for amendment no <e> <s> za perhaps i may remind the committee what amendment no <e> <s> zb states <e> <s> i shall then put it in the context of what is stated in schedule to the bill <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zb states <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton made an effective intervention against only one part of my principal amendment <e> <s> if my amendment said only that local authorities had to be notified of any tendering arrangement i should agree with him that it is their responsibility to read the newspapers and to find out whether there is a tendering arrangement in their area and to tender if that is felt necessary <e> <s> if they fail to do that it is rather their own fault <e> <s> however that is not only what the amendment says <e> <s> it states further that in any event the sewerage undertaking shall ensure <e>", "<cs> it is necessary that the relevant authorities should be notified of the decision in order to achieve the full and proper tendering process which we require particularly for design work and forward planning and that is something which i should have thought would be attractive to members of the committee on the government benches <e> <s> the result of that seems to me coherent and not at all a curates egg <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is under some misapprehension <e> <s> i am moving only amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> za <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> is the minister saying that the restrictions of section of the local authorities goods and services act do not apply not just in clause but elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> in other words is he saying that no danger arises from conflict between this bill and the act <e>", "<cs> is the minister able to give a comparable assurance for other parts of the bill <e> <s> i noted carefully that he referred only to clause which is why i am raising this question now and giving him time to obtain an answer <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord therefore be good enough to write to me and tell me whether there is any potential for conflict between the act and this bill <e> <s> will he do so in time to allow me if necessary to move another amendment at a later stage <e> <s> on that understanding which i wish to record in <e>", "<cs> that was an extremely disingenuous reply and i suspect deliberately so <e> <s> the noble lord seems to set up a contrast between regulation proposed by the government and central control proposed by the opposition <e> <s> he seems to suggest that what we are proposing is in conflict with the present regime whereby the secretary of state he says sets the prices for the water industry <e>", "<cs> i should not rise at all because clearly i am exposing my ignorance <e> <s> i read the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> a as being a restriction on the power to make connection charges <e> <s> it is described as such in the side heading <e> <s> as a result of the ministers speech i was not clear that the opposite was the case <e>", "<cs> while the minister is considering that i am still concerned by his response to the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> i quite understand that it is not possible to put a figure on this matter but the question then arises as to whether there is any limit <e> <s> that is a rather different question <e> <s> is there not a risk in this new clause that the water and sewerage undertakings might be in a position to hold to ransom those who wish to have supplies to individual properties or to estates <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord addington decides what to do about the amendment perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the minister has picked on what i take to be a defect in the wording of the amendment which states <e>", "<cs> i have no responsibility for this amendment <e> <s> i shall have to <e>", "<cs> do the government believe that it is a good thing for consumers to be told the basis on which their water and sewerage charges are fixed <e>", "<cs> i do not have the draft code of practice in front of me and i bow to the noble baroness who has that document in front of her <e> <s> i certainly agree with her that it contains the information to which she referred but i did not understand that all these matters must be provided to customers with their bills <e> <s> if that is the case we shall not raise the matter again <e>", "<cs> there are a number of elements in this group of amendments with which we have some sympathy <e> <s> we certainly have great sympathy with the sentiments behind the amendments as expressed by the noble lord lord nugent and the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> these amendments recognise that in a sense what is being done in the bill is a form of institutionalised theft against the local authorities who spent so much money not their money it is never the local authorities money but the ratepayers money over the years in building up the assets of the water authorities which were taken away from them by the water act <e> <s> the amendments recognise that there is a difference between those assets which come from the local authorities in other words those built up before and those which were <e>", "<cs> it is neither my responsibility nor that of the noble earl that there is a proposal to privatise the water industry <e> <s> in many ways the noble earl is as unhappy as i am about that <e> <s> i certainly agree that capital must be produced for the water and sewerage industry but that is the responsibility of the government who are trying to privatise the industry <e> <s> we shall shortly in fact let us come to it now be dealing with the accumulated debts of the industry in relation to its assets <e> <s> that affects the viability of the flotation <e>", "<cs> clearly the minister has made a number of very significant statements and it would be virtually impossible for me to respond in an authoritative way to the complex arguments which he has put forward <e> <s> therefore i wish to thank him for what he said <e> <s> i take the opportunity of rising now to speak before the noble lord lord nugent who must close the debate on this amendment <e>", "<cs> we are in committee and it would be as well if the noble baroness were to make her own speeches rather than intervening in mine <e> <s> however she has got the figures totally wrong <e> <s> we have looked very closely at the balance between the debts and the assets of the regional water authorities <e> <s> the debts of the regional water authorities amount to approaching per cent <e> <s> of their assets <e> <s> i will come on to this when we discuss later amendments <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said and i should like to confirm that we are not unaware of this point <e> <s> as he may know my honourable friend mrs ann taylor who is our spokesman on water has made her estimate which seems to be fairly well accepted that the cost of putting matters right in the water and sewerage industry could be of the order of billion which would have to fall on the taxpayer <e> <s> we are not making these statements in ignorance <e> <s> however we feel that these are public responsibilities and that once the public has paid to do what is right to put matters in order again as concerns both water quality and sewerage the assets which remain which will be net assets should stay in the hands of the public sector <e> <s> that is the fundamental difference between us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trafford is a loyal supporter of the government but he has been left somewhat beached by the changed attitude which they have expressed <e> <s> that has meant that he has totally failed to understand the thrust of what i was trying to say <e> <s> that is undoubtedly my fault <e> <s> the point i am trying to make which is one that members opposite do not appear to be able to grasp is that there is such a thing as public investment and public service for a public service <e> <s> if we are talking about public investment as we undoubtedly are whether or not it is in the form of giving public money to the successor undertakings as that is what writing off a debt means the investment has to be made however it is done <e> <s> that was the point that the noble lord lord nugent of guildford correctly made <e>", "<cs> on the basis of those arguments the noble lord ought to have followed us into the lobby last monday when we secured that there would be a reasonable and rational timetable for investment to improve drinking water quality <e> <s> i am sorry to see that he did not <e>", "<cs> the noble earl seeks to attack these amendments by suggesting that we have not appreciated the difference between one water authority and another <e> <s> the problem which the government have is that this is not simply a write-off of debt <e> <s> if that were the case we could disagree with them but we could also understand how they could reach that position <e> <s> what is proposed here is a complete freedom for the secretary of state not just to write off debts but to write in debts <e> <s> that would be the situation of the consumers of thames water <e> <s> the people who live in the thames water authority area have paid for their assets once <e> <s> they are now being asked to pay for them again so that the city can be given a big enough price for the other water authorities which are not in that happy position to go ahead <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my second intervention gave the minister an opportunity to repeat some of the words that he used in response to the amendment of the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> i was in no doubt as to what he meant <e> <s> i had no doubt that he meant as he has now confirmed that the debt structure of the water authorities is to be reorganised so that some of them will benefit and some will lose <e> <s> clearly one that will lose is thames water authority <e> <s> it is useful to have the ministers confirmation of that <e>", "<cs> that is gobbledegook <e> <s> it is simply avoiding the issue which these amendments pose <e> <s> the amendments suggest that parliament has a right to know <e> <s> what the minister is saying in all sincerity is that there is no possibility of sharing with parliament what the government must know because the government are proceeding apace with all the negotiations certainly on the pricing structure and no doubt on all the other aspects of the prospectus which has to be put into place before privatisation can proceed <e> <s> we must find some way for parliament to take part in the process of privatisation <e> <s> if we accept the governments object in proceeding to privatisation by november of this year it cannot be done <e> <s> i do not know how i can express this <e> <s> it cannot constitutionally be done with all the important issues left out of the bill and <e>", "<cs> i do not blame the noble lord for trying it on but he is wide of what my noble friend said <e> <s> there was no suggestion whatever that the shares should be bought without compensation <e> <s> that was not said at all <e> <s> it is clear however that the next labour government and we are only two years or so away from the next labour government will be taking urgent steps in the simplest possible way perhaps in a bill encapsulating this amendment to secure that we have a majority shareholding in the water industry <e> <s> investors must take that into account and also take into account that when we have taken urgent action to secure public control of the water industry as the people of this country wish us to do we will then at more leisure take steps to ensure that we have the final structure of a public water industry that we want <e> <s> there was never any suggestion in my noble friends words and no one could read into his words that no compensation would be paid <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is trying it on again <e> <s> nobody can buy shares in any private company with full guarantees that they will not lose money <e> <s> that is the nature of the gambling den which is called the city of london <e> <s> that is what it is all about <e> <s> we are certainly not giving any guarantee of that sort <e> <s> we are saying that we will take public control of the water industry but will not do so without compensation <e>", "<cs> all this is immensely flattering <e> <s> we know that the government have now accepted the fact that they will go out of office at the next general election and be replaced by a labour government <e> <s> that is fine <e> <s> otherwise this intense interest in every word that falls from our lips would not make any sense at all particularly at this time of the night <e> <s> it is enormously flattering <e> <s> however the minister and noble lords opposite live in the real world <e> <s> they know that we do not prepare a detailed legislative programme in advance of an election and that we do not even prepare a manifesto in advance of an election <e> <s> the details of what goes into that manifesto are not decided by opposition spokesman in the shadow chamber of parliament <e> <s> let us not play this game any longer we are all agreed that the water industry will be a public water industry again within less than three years <e> <s> that is all we need to know <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has not explained what is meant by <e>", "<cs> it does not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds i am opposed to the amendments which he has put forward and also to the governments response <e> <s> has the noble lord lord elliott considered that the statutory water companies to which he is so devoted and to which he has given such distinguished service will be defrauded by the proposals of the government announced this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister rightly paid tribute to my noble friend lord dormand of easington for his long concern over this matter <e> <s> however will he acknowledge that such long concern is necessary because the government talk but do not take any action <e> <s> will he now give a timetable for this consultation process and the enforcement of the licence to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble earl felt it necessary to return to general political accusations instead of responding more directly to the issue before us and contained in the amendments <e> <s> as he has done on more than one occasion he again seeks to make contrasts between the labour party approach which he describes as central government control and ownership and regulation <e> <s> it is the first time i have heard conservative privatisation philosophy described as a philosophy of regulation <e> <s> at least it is honest <e> <s> at least it recognises that in the pursuit of what i insist on calling the experiment of privatisation of the water industry which has grown up successfully as a public rather than a private enterprise it may be necessary to have literally hundreds of pages of regulation in a bill with no doubt thousands of pages of regulation in the form of regulation by the secretary of state codes of standards and interference by whitehall in private industry <e> <s> i wonder whether that is the image which the government wish to project <e> <s> certainly that is occurring <e>", "<cs> on the contrary i am trebly grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford first because he has given us the benefit of his unrivalled experience in the water industry secondly because he has confirmed that the availability of a general duty on the water authorities under the act was of assistance to him in persuading the chairmen of water authorities that they should act to improve river quality thereby in my view and i am not putting these words into his mouth confirming the necessity for a general duty to maintain and improve water quality and thirdly for rightly drawing attention to the value of an effective regulatory mechanism under the succeeding clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all members of the committee who leapt to my attack <e> <s> that contains general duties but does not refer to the important point so valuable in the act and which is not available here that is that it is a duty not just to achieve and maintain the objectives as the rubric to clause says but to improve river quality <e> <s> that is what we want to see that is what has been in other legislation and that is what is missing from this legislation <e>", "<cs> i share the anxiety expressed by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> in his reply the minister concentrated on the issue of the -mile limit <e> <s> he may be right because i do not know the rights or wrongs of whether miles is the best possible limit <e> <s> the minister made only a passing reference to the fact that the national rivers authority is only to have the power rather than a duty to control discharge within a smaller area of our coastal waters perhaps three miles <e> <s> i find it puzzling that whereas the nra has a duty when it is a matter of inland estuarial or tidal waters it has only a power when it comes to coastal waters <e>", "<cs> i was making an engineering analogy <e> <s> i was not accusing the engineers <e>", "<cs> i regret that that answer confirms our worst fears <e> <s> those fears led us to put down the amendments <e> <s> the minister describes it as irresponsible to suggest that the date by which compliance should be achieved should be the soonest practicable date <e> <s> he says that a formula of soonest practicable date ignores other considerations such as finance which ought to be taken into account <e> <s> i suggest to the government and to the committee that what they are ignoring are the costs not of compliance but of non-compliance the costs of having rivers which are below the standards which we are entitled to expect in terms of water quality <e> <s> there is the example of the damage which was done to the river avon and the costs that were incurred on the part of everyone living along the river avon <e> <s> it is not just a question of amenity economic costs are also involved <e> <s> that fact is totally ignored in the ministers formulation <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether silence from this dispatch box is taken as assent or dissent and i am inhibited from making a full intervention in this discussion because i was not able to be present immediately before the adjournment when the principal amendment was debated <e>", "<cs> this amendment has already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> it has already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that this amendment had already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> i should like to have an assurance that this means that the pollution caused by the horses of northumbrian raiders attacking my ancestral town of jedburgh and raping its women and children will be covered by this bill <e>", "<cs> it seems that clause imposes a new rather strict regime of what is called tripartite sampling which would tend to make it more difficult for groups like the anglers co-operative association to bring prosecutions <e> <s> after all the more simple sampling on the basis of results kept on the public registers which are based on samples taken by the water authorities at their own sewage treatment works but which have not been through the tripartite process have been accepted as the basis of prosecution <e> <s> if we are to accept the more rigid proposals made in these clauses we would make it more difficult for those who would wish to bring prosecutions against the water companies <e> <s> i support the amendment and i also support amendment no <e> <s> a which the noble lord lord norrie has put down on virtually the same point <e>", "<cs> the latter part of the noble earls reply relating to the amendments nos <e> <s> cb to cm is disappointing <e> <s> i do not believe that he has appreciated how inadequate are the existing procedures <e> <s> i do not believe that he has appreciated either how valuable for this purpose are the precedent of the highways act and the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> when i return to amendment no <e> <s> bi find that there is a curious alliance <e> <s> the amendments that i have just spoken to were prepared by the ramblers association <e> <s> in his reply the noble earl has referred to the public utilities street works act and the home report which was a review of that act besides the consultation document issued by the department of transport on th may of this year <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies it would be churlish of me not to express my support for the amendment which is so similar to one that i have already moved <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to add my support to this amendment which has my name to it <e> <s> it is the same as an amendment moved in committee in another place by my honourable friend dr cunningham <e> <s> there was an attempt to move it at report stage but the guillotine motion defeated it <e> <s> my honourable friend feels strongly as i do that the licensing of commercial netsmen who use t-nets which have a damaging effect on the stocks of migratory fish in the river wear is a thoroughly undesirable thing which ought not to be allowed under licence by the water authority and ought not be continued by the national rivers authority <e>", "<cs> i would like to welcome this amendment but in order to welcome it fully i should like some indication from the government that they think it right in accordance with my amendment no <e> <s> aza that the annual report which is to be published in such a way as the amendment proposes should contain a statement on levels of compliance with the effectiveness of the duties contained in clause <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied but i am grateful for that step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> before the noble lords respond to that invitation the government are engaged in a full consultation process on compensation which runs much wider than the implications of the bill <e> <s> i think that it is astonishing while the consultation process is going on that noble lords should think it proper to intervene on compensation regarding a small part of the issues involved and to take up the time of the committee at this length with something on which noble lords will have plenty of opportunity to submit evidence to the government <e> <s> it is really only marginal to the consideration of the bill <e> <s> i know that my own concern is for the progress and improvement of the water bill but i think that to some extent noble lords are taking advantage of the committee in this respect <e>", "<cs> i welcome the formula which the noble earl has found to introduce this amendment <e> <s> i commend it to him and his colleagues for the remainder of the committees business <e>", "<cs> i suppose that the words suitable opportunity are not as encouraging as at an early opportunity or the other phrases which ministers use to say that there is no place yet in the legislative programme to introduce a provision <e> <s> however the ministers other words are reasonably encouraging and we have certainly had the confirmation that the government accept recommendation of the home report <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall give that reply due consideration <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for it and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i just record the fact that the discussion in committee which the noble lord so inaccurately recounts took place not yesterday but the day before <e>", "<cs> before the question is even put i shall take the opportunity of concurring with what the noble earl has said both about the members of the committee who have taken part in this committee stage and about the officers and servants of the chamber who have put in exceptional duty over the past month <e> <s> there are many things still to be done on report and the time allotted for that will clearly not be adequate <e> <s> however as the noble earl said we have made some progress although some of it was against the wishes of the government <e> <s> the bill is already better <e> <s> let us hope that we can continue with that improvement <e>", "<cs> we are on tenterhooks <e> <s> what did the noble baroness do <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to congratulate my noble friend lord gregson on bringing forward this valuable bill which as the noble baroness lady robson said received unanimous support in another place <e> <s> it has been supported by all the responsible authorities <e> <s> on reading the second reading debate in another place i noted in particular the support of sir hugh rossi the chairman of the select committee on the environment <e> <s> he is also my member of parliament although i do not have the privilege of voting against him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in what the minister has just said <e> <s> i am not familiar with the phrase working up a bill <e> <s> can he tell us how far the bill has been worked up and what the timescale is likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that the question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter refers to individuals or families owning more than one home since they cannot occupy more than one home at the same time does the minister agree that his second answer is quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> ought not guidance to be given to indicate the original submission that individuals and families should make <e> <s> will he agree that decisions should not simply be left to appeals and tribunals but that clear guidance should be given in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two strands to the ministers reply both of which seem to me to be unsatisfactory <e> <s> the first is what one might kindly call architectural in the sense that it is concerned with the structure of the bill <e> <s> any attempt to amend the bill is criticised on architectural grounds rather than on the grounds of the substance of the amendments <e> <s> i make no apology for seeking to bring into part i of the bill a general duty to control prevent and reduce pollution in our waters <e> <s> such a general duty for recreational and environmental matters is contained in part i it is not contained in clause but the noble lord lord renton seemed to think that it is adequate to have many specific duties in part iii <e> <s> that is not the case for environmental duties and it should not be the case for the control of pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords clause and the surrounding clauses contain a number of references to the duties of the national rivers authority <e> <s> that is absolutely true <e> <s> but the analogy i have made is with the environmental and recreational duties which are treated as general duties of the national rivers authority and of the secretary of state and the director general of water services <e> <s> we are seeking to secure that the control of pollution is recognised as being of equal importance to those important recreational and environmental duties and is not relegated to part iii <e> <s> that is the purpose of this part of our argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures in front of me <e> <s> if i have quoted them incorrectly i apologise <e> <s> the fact remains that the average level of investment in the first five years and almost certainly for longer than that of the conservative government was lower than the average level of investment under the labour government <e> <s> i do not think that the noble earl will deny that side of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say straight away that i acknowledge the force of the points made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> in seeking to accommodate the very reasonable concerns expressed by the noble lord lord crickhowell and others to secure that sensible arrangements were possible in the opening years of the life of the national rivers authority we have gone too far <e> <s> we have sought in the text of these amendments to do something that we did not intend to do in our minds which was to prohibit all subcontracting whether to the plcs or to anybody else <e> <s> to that extent the amendments are not only defective but are gravely defective <e> <s> i shall not ask the house to divide on them <e>", "<cs> my lords sticky hands <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not read that speech with a great deal of conviction and i can understand why <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that by agreeing and we welcome his agreement that the treasury and the secretary of state should no longer have control over the numbers of national rivers authority staff he has blown a gaping hole in his case against amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment says that the treasury should not have control over the terms and conditions of service of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former quartermasters clerk never having aspired to the rank of quartermaster i wonder whether the minister appreciates a quartermasters range of activities <e> <s> one thing that quartermasters do not cover is pay although they do cover rations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that i had not sat down before the noble lord intervened because he made my point very clearly <e> <s> the point is that there is no global sum laid down in the bill <e> <s> a global sum was in effect laid down in the bill previously because there was treasury control over numbers and terms and conditions of service <e> <s> but now that the control over numbers has been removed there is no global sum left in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is very simple there is no global sum anywhere on the face of the bill <e> <s> we are asked to rely on a financial memorandum which we have not seen <e> <s> i suggest to the house and to the government that it is not adequate to rely on a financial memorandum which we have not seen <e> <s> unless it can be shown clearly to the contrary the concerns of noble lords on all sides of the house that what is being maintained here is a control of the detail of employment without a control on the total sum of money involved will not go away <e> <s> i believe i was asked to give way to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will be out of order <e> <s> it is my amendment and i am supposed to be winding up on it <e> <s> we are at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that an intervention can be intervened in <e> <s> there can be one intervention at a time <e> <s> i had better maintain my position at this dispatch box without sitting down and let other noble lords come in one after another rather than together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have the noble lords confirmation <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord now regrets that he was not in his seat when his noble friend lord renton referred to the clammy hand of the treasury <e> <s> the situation is as it was before these interventions all of which i may say i very much welcome <e> <s> the situation is that the government are in an impossible position <e> <s> if the minister is to avoid a vote which will depend with the exception of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for a majority for the government on those who have not heard the debate he should intervene and say he will think about the matter again before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord leads the interventions of other ministers who have not heard the debate <e> <s> i suppose that the right thing for me to do is to seek an opportunity to discuss the matter with the noble lord between now and third reading <e> <s> i do not think his response has adequately reflected the arguments that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down since he will not have another opportunity to answer although i shall i observe first that he makes these comments about the treasury in the absence of his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> secondly would he care to pass a judgment that i would much respect on my other amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and which are substantive amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords two issues have been raised in the debate <e> <s> if the noble lord lord renton will forgive me there was the minor or secondary issue and the other was the substantive issue of how to secure major capital works and planned programmes for flood relief and for environmental improvement paid for sensibly <e> <s> on the first issue which is treasury consent i should have been prepared if necessary to withdraw that amendment and to pursue amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton has a point about the need for treasury consent <e> <s> all i can say is that introducing amendment no <e> <s> is evidence if evidence were needed of my concern for the proprieties my moderation my anxiety to achieve results by agreement rather than by confrontation which has always been a feature of my approach to these matters <e> <s> but if i find myself criticised from the left by the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> from the left then i listen very carefully to what he says <e> <s> however the question does not arise because the noble earl lord arran has made what appears to me on the face of it a very useful reply <e> <s> i should like to read it carefully before deciding whether any further action is required at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are making life more difficult rather than less difficult for the nra and its regional advisory committees <e> <s> what is proposed is a helpful way of shortcutting what might otherwise be complicated negotiations and consultation with different local authorities in the area of a regional advisory committee and with different levels of local authority for example between county and district councils <e> <s> it would have been easier if the government had at least accepted the principle of dealing through local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that comment helpful <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for it <e> <s> it is one suggestion that i shall discuss with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am puzzled by the numbering <e> <s> if subsections and are to be taken out surely the numbering of the new subsection should be rather than otherwise there will be a gap between subsections and <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only because of our admiration for the persuasiveness of the minister and particularly of the difficult task he is setting himself in attempting to put himself above the other environment ministers in europe that we excuse him for what is after all a breach of the proprieties of this house in anticipating a future amendment because he cannot be here to move it himself <e> <s> it is not the right way to go about these matters <e> <s> the noble lord lord hesketh must feel that some of his thunder is being taken from him <e> <s> we do not mind and i am sure he does not mind <e> <s> he had better not because he is a junior minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble baroness lady strange would have been happy to welcome these amendments had she been here this evening <e> <s> i am a poor substitute i cannot be anything like as poetic as she would be in support of the amendments <e> <s> nevertheless i wish to welcome them wholeheartedly and to pay tribute not only to the noble baroness who urged the case but also to the consumer associations involved <e> <s> i should especially like to pay tribute to the national <e>", "<cs> my lords i am completely satisfied by that answer <e> <s> the amendment was intended as a probing amendment <e> <s> it has achieved the statement by the noble earl that the nra alone will be consulted <e> <s> if i missed that in committee i apologise <e> <s> however i do not think the noble earl said that before <e> <s> i think that what he said previously left open the possibility that the plcs would also be consulted <e> <s> he has now made it crystal clear that the functions responsibilities and rights will be transferred only to the nra and will not be retained in any way by the privatised plcs which is what we would have intended <e> <s> i am very happy for that to be done by an amendment to the general development order rather than by amendment on the face of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that clear reply <e> <s> i must say that i think he is putting a great deal of significance on to the one word properly <e> <s> all that paragraph a says is that it is the duty of the secretary of state or the director <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am not alone in being sincerely grateful to the minister for giving a full answer and for giving us the benefit of the best explanation that we have yet had from the government of current thinking as regards the reasonable rate of return which is specified in the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may make it clear to the noble lord lord renton in particular that my <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness was speaking before my noble friend sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds to the substance of the amendments perhaps i may say a word or two about the procedural aspects having nothing at all to do with the fact that he has addressed his two kind remarks to me and two unkind remarks to himself <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister permit me to intervene <e> <s> surely where there is a difference between market value and existing use value the secretary of state has powers to impose adequate covenant to secure a windfall profit <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary we have amendments down which force the secretary of state to impose covenants <e> <s> at the moment the ministers covenant provision is not adequate <e> <s> if he will agree to my amendment which enforces covenants i will agree to his argument about existing use value <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at the outset that when i replied on amendment no <e> <s> a i would not go over the whole ground of the other amendments <e> <s> i am confirmed in that by the helpful statement from the leader of the house who reminded us that these groupings are not binding and that i my noble friends and other noble lords who have tabled amendments to later clauses other than clause will have an opportunity to have them further debated and even decided upon at a later stage though i am sure noble lords will use that power with discretion and with concern for the proper procedures of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords what always amazes me is the extent to which lawyers in particular are happy to rely upon words like properly and reasonably to carry with them not just clauses but virtually whole bills <e> <s> this is the most important clause in the bill <e> <s> in subsection it says that the duty of the secretary of state and the director is to secure as the noble lords lord renton and lord trafford reminded us that the functions of the undertakers are properly carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am doubly grateful to the noble earl first because the amendment that he has moved gives us a form of words which we could use in amendment no <e> <s> c which gained the approval of the noble lord lord renton and secondly i speak on behalf of my noble friend lord carter and thank the minister for what i am sure he will consider to be a real improvement gained as a result of the pressure which he exerted in committee <e> <s> i know he is sorry that he was unable to collaborate with the government in the formulation of the amendment and that he is unable to be in the house today to welcome the amendment <e> <s> i share his gratitude to the government for the amendment and i am happy to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> he will not be surprised to hear that i do not find it particularly reassuring <e> <s> the problem as i have said with the drafting of the bill is not only that it is exceedingly complex but also that it relies on the concept of proposals <e> <s> the proposals are brought forward by the undertakers <e> <s> in other words nothing can happen except on the initiative of the water or sewerage undertakers <e> <s> that is what is unsatisfactory <e> <s> i listened carefully to the noble lord lord trafford on this point and he did not convince me either <e> <s> i remind him that jack cade said lets kill all the lawyers first <e> <s> we might move on to the doctors after that <e>", "<cs> my lords that should be amendment no <e> <s> and not amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what my noble friend meant was conserving buildings sites and fixed structures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful on behalf of myself and my noble friend lord howie for the consideration which the minister has undertaken to give to the phrase fixed structures <e> <s> in his examples he did not repeat the example of aqueduct which i gave <e> <s> he might also like to take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that reply curious in one respect and incomplete in another <e> <s> i find it curious in the sense that it would never have occurred to me that the words best secure to which the minister paid such attention should weaken other aspects of the obligations of the secretary of state <e> <s> best securing the fulfilment of the duties under subsection does not mean that it comes before any other obligation <e> <s> we have a difference in the meaning of words <e> <s> under those circumstances it is probably best if i may use that word if i take the matter away think about it and see whether the government would wish to think about it as well <e>", "<cs> my lords let us hope that they are best endeavours <e> <s> without best endeavours i am not convinced that we shall get the result that we all desire <e> <s> perhaps the minister would be good enough to let me know in good time before third reading whether his endeavours are likely to reach fruition <e> <s> i can then decide whether i need to return to this matter at that stage <e> <s> i am sure that with his usual courtesy he will do so <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i must say that i much respect his views on the framing of legislation <e> <s> will he be willing to share his views on a subsection which is of a purely declaratory nature which is what we were told subsection was <e>", "<cs> my lords that is nonsense and the minister must know that it is nonsense <e> <s> so far as concerns amendment no <e> <s> a the noble earl lord caithness said that the subsection was of a purely declaratory nature which did not alter the effect of the bill <e> <s> those were his words <e> <s> there should not be in legislation subsections which do not alter the effect of the bill <e> <s> otherwise one might go around putting in the words for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not influenced by that example <e> <s> if money is spent to improve a facility one is in effect providing a new facility which did not exist and the amendment would not cover that provision <e> <s> i cannot believe that there is any difficulty <e> <s> if we are going into textual analysis at such a level we shall find ourselves spending days rather than four days on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister could go an inch or two further than that <e> <s> first of all his example does not affect the case at all <e> <s> a new water ski ramp is a new facility and could be charged for <e> <s> but if the minister is saying that the wording of the amendment is defective but that its purpose namely to avoid new charges for existing facilities without change does command further consideration then i shall very happily withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed <e> <s> i thought that it was not a matter for confrontation <e> <s> i should have thought that we could find a way to achieve what so many of us want <e> <s> i believe that the wording is sound and that the argument about the grey area has no validity <e> <s> i am confirmed in that view by the fact that the minister has failed to criticise the wording <e> <s> he has simply criticised the objective which i feel as strongly as ever is important <e> <s> i shall therefore seek the opinion of the house on the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it curious that the minister should be so confident of his arguments in support that he feels it possible to give such an uncompromising response <e> <s> i did not move the amendment in that way but in the spirit of the governments own amendment at committee stage <e> <s> if the minister had been right and the conservation duties under clause had been of sufficient power to make these provisions in clause unnecessary amendment no <e> <s> itself would have been unnecessary <e> <s> the fact that the government brought forward the amendment and provided for this notification procedure is clear evidence that they recognise that the procedure is not sufficient <e> <s> they have provided for a notification procedure which is an improvement on the previous provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am however a little startled to find my wording and my intentions approved <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him before i finally proceed on the matter whether he will support the other amendments to which i spoke <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> on question amendment agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> certainly i should not wish to do anything which created a new conflict between subsections and <e> <s> i shall have to consider carefully the effect of the distinction that he makes which is not new to us between the duty on the secretary of state and the power of the secretary of state and think about its effect on the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> in anticipation of that i think it best that i should ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i thought that our thinking was close enough to that of the government to enable us to make some progress on this matter as we did at committee stage <e> <s> however i shall have to read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what clause says <e> <s> maybe it should say that but it does not <e> <s> what it says is that they have to fulfil their functions properly and to make a reasonable rate of return on capital <e> <s> it does not say that they should <e>", "<cs> my lords we are glad to hear of the governments interest in monitoring the greenhouse effect <e> <s> will the noble earl add to that by urging his governmental colleagues in the department of energy not to overturn the amendment carried by your lordships at the committee stage of the electricity bill to safeguard the conservation of energy which is the prime way of preventing the greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the noble earl referred to the energy efficiency office <e> <s> will he be good enough to confirm to the house that the budget of the office has been maintained in real terms and that it will be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad in a way that a number of noble lords have started by raising the historical record <e> <s> i am glad of that for two reasons <e> <s> first it enables me to apologise to the house as i have already apologised to the minister for a misstatement in a speech which i made last tuesday <e> <s> i said then that it was not until that investment in our sewerage undertakings regained the level it had reached when the conservative government came into office <e> <s> that was incorrect <e> <s> what i meant to say was that the investment in the sewerage undertakings did not regain the highest level it had enjoyed under a labour government until <e> <s> i believe that in fact it was later than that <e> <s> i apologise for that error <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly it must be right that there should be a degree of flexibility in setting the reference criteria <e> <s> on that basis i do not think that we would oppose the amendment <e> <s> however there are two directions in which the criteria may be varied namely upwards or downwards <e> <s> in other words one can make the powers of the monopolies and mergers commission more or less effective or more or less stringent <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has sought to make a distinction between the two amendments that we are debating <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat the reasons why the two are necessary and why they fit together in order that we may get more clearly in our minds the issue that is before the house <e> <s> i believe that the issue was well understood by almost every noble lord who spoke before the minister replied <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that you have to do both <e> <s> that is my point <e> <s> unless the general duty on undertakers includes a duty to make supplies available and also to make them available on a specific and fair basis then clause does not have its full effect <e> <s> that is why the two are put together <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to comply with the rules of debate i shall gladly give way to the minister <e>", "<cs> my amendment does not refer to all water supplies <e> <s> it refers to clause <e> <s> the whole point of the linkage between the two amendments is that my amendment does not propose any change in the charging system for all water supplies <e> <s> as amended by amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord stanley of alderley the clause would propose further protection for domestic consumers <e> <s> there is no conflict between the two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it could not conceivably transfer discrimination to urban areas because the amendment limits the opportunity for the water companies to discriminate on the ground of locality <e> <s> it would improve the position for domestic customers in rural and urban areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish in any way to interfere with negotiations between the government front bench and the government back bench <e> <s> on that basis although i believe that my amendment is necessary and may have to be re-inserted at third reading it is appropriate that i should ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find some parts of that answer distinctly disingenuous <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to argue that because the european commission has agreed to the enforcement procedures set out in clause then that means that it has agreed to the way in which these enforcement procedures are to be triggered <e> <s> nothing could be further from the truth indeed if the european commission had been so bold and intrusive as to say not only do we think that the wording for enforcement procedures is necessary but this is how it should be triggered and this is who the enforcement procedures should be available to there would have <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be useful for me to speak first to amendment no <e> <s> ca which is grouped with this amendment <e> <s> to put it politely there was a certain amount of confusion over this matter at committee stage and i confess that i was one of those who were confused <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> ca to some extent is intended to put matters right <e>", "<cs> my lords before the government rise to reply i must defend the word disaggregated which has been in common use for many years in economics as my noble friend lord jay and indeed the noble lord lord home of the hirsel who is such a distinguished economist will confirm <e> <s> unless one has the ability to disaggregate data to take data which is produced in aggregate terms and to apply it to specific circumstances then one is depriving oneself of one of the major tools of economics <e> <s> so far as i know ever since the word was first used years ago there has been no satisfactory alternative to it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i do not have the right to reply before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may thank him <e> <s> the provision in the conditions of appointment is an acceptable substitute and i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> ca <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble earl will permit me to intervene here <e> <s> subsection la does not say to maintain it says <e>", "<cs> my lords this argument is going from bad to worse <e> <s> what clause la says is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we are getting anywhere on this issue <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords these are major concessions which we are extracting from the government and we fully appreciate them <e> <s> in the circumstances without in any way claiming to understand the phraseology of the clause or in any way going back on my accusation of obscurity and moreover without accepting also that it would be right for the local authority and the occupiers to pay the cost of replacing piped supply which is not available because of the fault of the undertaker i think my only option now is to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> and celluloid collars <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend sure that he knows what he means before he reads what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene not to repeat the arguments which were as the noble lord said rehearsed at some length earlier this afternoon but to make clear that in our view this is not a private discussion between the front and back-benches of the conservative party this is something about which we on these benches feel most strongly <e> <s> we feel that the protection of those who happen to live in areas where the cost of supply may be greater should not be taken away simply as a result of privatisation <e> <s> the principle of an equal basis of charging throughout the country in all localities is most important <e> <s> it is one which exists in the public utilities and one which should be carried over even after privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords in the short version of his speech it seemed to me that the noble lord lord renton deployed his arguments to great effect <e> <s> i wish to add my support to them and to say also that it seems that those who are already worse off that is the tenants the people who are in the least favourable economic and financial situation are most likely to suffer from the provisions <e> <s> they pay their water bills as part of their rent <e> <s> they fulfil their contract with their landlords <e> <s> so far as they are concerned it is undoubtedly difficult enough to achieve that <e> <s> for them then to find that the law provides that they can be pursued simply because the landlords have not handed over the money to the water companies or because some other tenant or some other landlord at some other period of time has not handed over the money seems to us to be grotesquely unfair <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to respond sympathetically to the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the obscurity of subsections and is an additional reason for removing them <e> <s> it is rather like groucho marxs contract <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding let me start by putting at rest the mind of the noble earl lord balfour <e> <s> even the first amendment does not make any distinction between anybody who supplies without charging and anybody who supplies and makes a charge <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely happy with that assurance although i am conscious that there is only one later stage at which the minister can come back <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm that the minister treated the amendment with seriousness though i do not think he appreciated the full significance of what is being said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that this matter has arisen on the order paper again because it gives me an opportunity to thank the noble earl and to pay tribute to him for his personal efforts in the international negotiations on the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect <e> <s> it also gives me an opportunity to ask again the question to which i did not receive an answer yesterday <e> <s> will he urge his governmental colleagues in the department of energy to accept your lordships amendment to the electricity bill <e> <s> this would encourage energy conservation which the noble earl has agreed plays a significant part if not the only part in protecting the ozone layer and providing protection against the greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> i did not make the point myself because both of those interventions were peculiarly helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am thoroughly convinced by the arguments put forward by the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that she has got the wording right and that if she has the government will accept what she said <e> <s> however if the wording is not right i hope that they will find a way to put it right <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of order <e> <s> the minister has the right of reply but her noble friend lord stanley has only one opportunity <e> <s> he sought to reply and did not have an opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and before the noble lord lord norrie responds he has claimed in his reply to the amendments that there is already a power to review licences <e> <s> however the amendment moved by the noble lord lord norrie refers only to the power to review licences as a means to an end the end being to stop the damage to rivers by over-abstraction <e> <s> what is required from the noble earl if he is effectively to deal with the concerns which have been expressed by noble lords on all sides of the house is that he should indicate how there shall be a duty on the national rivers authority or whatever authority is concerned to secure that over-abstraction is put an end to and that our rivers are protected and returned to the state in which they ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be clear about the meaning of the amendment <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord wishes to abstract more water in other words he is going against the entire tenor of the previous debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he help the house by explaining what is meant by and cubic metres in terms with which noble lords are more familiar that is in gallons <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may seek to worm my way back into the favour of the noble lord lord stanley by saying that i support the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i thought that the crichel down principle had been well covered in the amendments moved by the government last week <e> <s> if i am wrong about that the noble lords amendments certainly deserve the support of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not even wish to bend the rules of the house but i have been referred to in the last two speeches <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am convinced by what the minister said even if by saying that i forfeit the friendship of the noble lord lord stanley <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only because of the intervention of my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon who is to be admired for his tenacity and clarity <e> <s> the labour party has in recent years been surfacing from a surfeit of doctrinal disputes and i want to make it clear that this is not a matter on which the labour party takes a party view <e> <s> anything that my noble friend and i say from these benches is said in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has referred at some length to points i made in earlier debates <e> <s> i want to make it clear that i did not accuse water undertakings of abuses <e> <s> our concern about the planning procedures was twofold <e> <s> it is right that where planning applications are specifically affected by water or sewerage functions there should be some opportunity for the water and sewerage undertakers to be consulted as any other interested party might be <e> <s> our concern was with the existing statutory rights of water authorities <e> <s> that should not be carried forward to private companies <e> <s> the reason for that was not only the theoretical <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to learn that in most cases the provisions of the order will be implemented and that therefore the object of this amendment will be achieved <e> <s> however i sometimes wonder whether the government have really learned the lessons of the many changes which have taken place as a result of legislation notably the abolition of one tier of local authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support to my noble friends amendment <e> <s> this bill is in itself an attempt to strengthen the law <e> <s> that is what it is about <e> <s> it has been brought forward because the existing law is not adequate to the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my support on behalf of my noble friend lord graham to the arguments of the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> it seems to me that the key to this and the reason why the amendment is necessary is in amendment no <e> <s> to be moved by the government <e> <s> if we had had a tribunal i assume that it would be constituted under the tribunals act and that the council on tribunals would make sure that there was a right of cross-examination <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am grateful to the minister for his courteous low-key and even candid response <e> <s> what he has in effect said to the house is that many of those matters cannot be presented to you because the decisions have not been taken and because i believe that i am quoting his words they have not been fully drawn up or as he said in his winding up speech before we have done all the work <e> <s> i suggest to the house that it is the governments duty to make their decisions before introducing legislation or before seeking to complete legislation <e> <s> i suggest that it is the governments duty to do the work that is necessary <e> <s> i suggest that it is the governments duty to draw up fully the instruments that are required to bring into effect legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness lady blatch is not present to thank the minister <e> <s> we give our general support to these amendments <e> <s> in addition i should like to say that i am delighted to see that the government are learning from the opposition about the effective use of paving amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulated the minister a moment ago on discovering the use of paving amendments <e> <s> i now withdraw those congratulations <e> <s> i think that what he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way but what we are asking in the amendment is that the charges should be at the same level <e> <s> i would argue as he has argued that the charges in both parts of the thames water authority area are at the same level <e> <s> the fact that they are levied at a different rate in the pound is neither here nor there <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies to that i should like to say that i only noticed half way through that he was departing from the grouping <e> <s> i had planned to give notice that in my view this grouping of all the amendments which are described as transitional or technical is not satisfactory to the house <e> <s> they are not related in subject they are only being grouped together on the grounds that the government think that they are not controversial <e> <s> if we recall what the government thought about amendment no <e> <s> which was the one which gives a -month moratorium to undertakings for freedom from prosecution for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that amendment no <e> <s> is in a similar situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not opposed to this amendment but i must express my regret that the government have not found it possible to agree to the more important amendments which we moved about notification of disconnection <e> <s> those amendments would have ensured that the customer service committees were notified of disconnections in particular for reasons of non-payment of bills and at any rate even if individual disconnections were not notified that there would be a statistical analysis of disconnections for that purpose <e> <s> if the customer service committees are to do their job properly they must know what is happening as regards disconnections in order to be sure that the disconnections code is being adhered to <e> <s> as i say i do not resist this amendment but the other amendments would have been much more important and more welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that there have been a number of misunderstandings about the amendments particularly among noble lords opposite <e> <s> the noble earl lord balfour seems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> yes i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> with these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i was entirely convinced by the ministers argument on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am satisfied that the local authorities should continue to have the responsibilities for local supplies that exist now and that he referred to <e> <s> i am less satisfied with the other assurances he has given us although in so far as they move towards the position that we are trying to achieve i thank him for them <e> <s> i particularly thank him for the assurances about the responsibilities of the assessors the drinking water inspectorate under our proposed subsection a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl knows that if he blows in my ear i will follow him anywhere <e> <s> when he describes his noble friend lord renton and myself as been persuasive he knows that he will have our support for the amendments <e> <s> it was always a nonsense that new occupiers could be pursued for the debts of old occupiers <e> <s> as a number of noble lords pointed out it is always better to rely on recovery through the courts as is the case for other debts <e> <s> we welcome the amendment and the removal from the bill of these unnecessary provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will not think that i am churlish if i still have some worries about its wording and some of its content <e> <s> it is clearly going in the right direction <e> <s> it is the governments intention to secure that there is no overcharging on resale of water supplies and to secure the protection which is necessary for tenants and those who live in houses in multiple occupation or as the noble earl lord cranbrook <e>", "<cs> my lords i am shocked that the minister should think that i have any interest in wrecking the governments timetable for privatisation <e> <s> as he well knows and as he acknowledged in his description of the purport of the amendments we are concerned that both investors and consumers but particularly consumers should have an adequate time to consider the figure of k which is an essential element of consumer prices in the judgment of whether privatisation is of advantage to the consumer as it is claimed to be and whether it is a viable basis for flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i have no objection to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most unhelpful answer to the major question that i put <e> <s> however i understand from what the minister said that there is a danger that the amendment as drafted would make it more difficult to apply higher qualities in the future <e> <s> that was not our intention <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the grouping which we agreed which includes our amendments comprises amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is curious that in making a speech in which he claims that there is such a major advance in government thinking the minister should have been so defensive <e> <s> i remind the house that this whole matter has been the subject of intense concern since second reading and in committee <e> <s> it was as a result of pressure on the government from all sides of the house that concessions were made on the disposal of land <e> <s> i remind noble lords that we on these benches welcomed those concessions although as will be apparent we felt that they did not go far enough <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express my gratitude to the government for these amendments which not only take up the points we raised at earlier stages but in fact extend them further than we asked <e> <s> they are very welcome and a real extension of accountability for these committees <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply was very carefully phrased and has not started to dent the arguments against this new government amendment <e> <s> the fact is that sampling is taking place now <e> <s> sampling is being carried on by he water and sewerage authorities and that sampling will be of no effect unless prosecutions can be mounted before the day of flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the occasion when we put aside the differences that have divided us over the weeks and months and pay tribute to those who have helped us and to those who have taken part in debate <e> <s> we also attempt a summary of the bill as it leaves your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the fiftieth piece of primary legislation affecting local government which has been introduced by the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the barking and dagenham is one local authority and not two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to pursue this matter but when the secretary of state made his original statement which was quoted by my noble friend he may have referred to a figure as being the current estimate of receipts but he gave a very clear indication to local authorities that they would have the ability to spend money from future receipts <e> <s> at that time nobody was making any estimate of what those future receipts would be <e> <s> the point is that those local authorities were encouraged to act on the basis that the money from the receipts would still be usable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again <e> <s> i acknowledged that the reducing balance method was preferable to the equal instalments of principle <e> <s> however i said that neither of those accord with modern accounting practice as would a straight line basis rather than a reducing balance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be forgiven for intervening again <e> <s> the ministers noble friend lord caithness had a principle which i believe was a very good one namely in a winding up speech he does not refer to interventions from noble lords who are not present <e> <s> i believe that it would be a very good idea if the minister followed that rule <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been accused in person of scaremongering in this house <e> <s> is that in accordance with standing order no <e> <s> which relates to asperity of speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to noble lords opposite all of whose contributions have been remarkably helpful to my case <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter whom i am delighted to see intervening on the bill i am sorry that we have not had the pleasure of his interventions before criticised my reference to the brussels meeting which he correctly described as a non-meeting <e> <s> i mentioned the brussels meeting because the secretary of state prayed that non-meeting in aid when he persuaded members in another place that our amendments were not acceptable <e> <s> if he had not raised the matter it would have been inappropriate for me to do so but i question whether there was not as i said earlier a risk of another place being misled into thinking that the european commission was satisfied with the british governments programme of compliance when that is most certainly not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is making a distinction without a difference between a plan and a programme and one which in a prospectus certainly has to be costed and has to include a timescale otherwise it would be in breach of companies legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords why do the government keep on pretending that private ownership of nnrs and sssis is adequate for their protection <e> <s> surely the government themselves in their very welcome amendments to the water bill recognised that as regards the disposal of water company land an offer for the surplus land to go into public ownership is a valuable protection which cannot be provided in private ownership <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the noble baroness not only on her fine sense of time and space in slipping in the amendment at the beginning of the committee stage of the bill but on the forthright way in which the amendment has been drafted and on the forthright way in which she has addressed it <e>", "<cs> this debate is getting off the rails very early on <e> <s> many of the contributions are not about the amendments which are before the committee <e> <s> i find that very unfortunate <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in particular is about candidatures <e> <s> it accepts that it is not possible to be a senior officer of a local authority and to be a member of parliament or a member of the european parliament <e> <s> i think that that is common ground between us <e> <s> however there are cases where people can be and should be allowed to stand as prospective candidates without losing their job as the result <e> <s> all the examples i know reflect on the conservative party rather than on the labour party <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one more word <e> <s> the minister has failed to address or to understand amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i remind the committee that amendment no <e> <s> provides that candidature for the house of commons or the parliament of the european community shall be a possible exception in regulations laid down by the secretary of state <e> <s> in other words the secretary of state has the power even if the amendment is carried to make such provision for very senior and politically sensitive posts and we shall be debating the matter in detail in a moment if there is any conflict <e>", "<cs> i do not have any doubt that the minister was seeking to be helpful in his reply <e> <s> indeed there were helpful elements <e> <s> it is helpful to know that the consultation document will go to the local authority associations in august <e> <s> that means that though the time for consideration of this part of the bill in committee will have passed nevertheless there will be something that we can get our teeth into at report stage <e> <s> it is helpful to know that we have learned a little more about appeals <e> <s> unfortunately in his reply the minister is now using the consultation document as a way of saying that he cannot give firm answers to the questions raised by members of the committee on all sides of the chamber <e>", "<cs> in his reply the minister referred to the earlier local government act which laid down the controls on party political activity by local authorities <e> <s> he sought to draw an analogy between that and local government officers <e> <s> as i believe he was not involved at the time i should perhaps remind him that that act went against the recommendations in the interim widdicombe report in one significant respect to which the noble lord referred namely widdicombe did not think and we did not think that the intention of the local authority was the proper test <e> <s> we have always believed that it should be the effect of the local authoritys activity rather than the intention of the local authoritys activity because intentions are peculiarly difficult to define objectively and accurately <e>", "<cs> in due course we might have to return to the concept of a registered charity <e> <s> in the long run that might be the protection that we shall be forced to seek but it would be very much a fall-back position <e> <s> voluntary organisations more widely defined have a valid role even if their activities are campaigning and those activities are occasionally in line with the objectives of one or more political parties <e>", "<cs> it would be dignifying the ministers reply to my amendment to say that it was disappointing <e> <s> it was almost wholly irrelevant <e> <s> he repeated the claim that there is an affinity between the proposals for the local government service and those for the civil service code of practice <e> <s> yet he did not answer one single detailed and major point of difference that i made <e> <s> he did not answer the point that the civil service makes a distinction by grade rather than by an arbitrary salary level <e>", "<cs> that was a peculiarly specious argument quite apart from the fact that st augustine of hippo said make me chaste but not yet <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the intervention of my noble friend lord monkswell who is a serving councillor <e> <s> if my noble friend lord irving of dartford were here he would no doubt echo what my noble friend said <e> <s> i know that the ministers mother is a serving councillor and i have no doubt that he is well informed about members allowances <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the ministers reply <e> <s> what he has said to the noble earl lord carnarvon is not totally hopeless but he has not really addressed the fundamental difficulty on which i was concentrating when i moved the amendment <e> <s> he has not addressed the issues raised by the two linked amendments amendments no <e> <s> and <e> <s> the fundamental point is that the government are seeking two different but overlapping criteria for imposing restrictions on local government officials <e> <s> one is a series of criteria about the nature of the work and the other which <e>", "<cs> the offer of reconsideration was strictly limited to two amendments which propose a change to a different salary level <e> <s> i have heard nothing from either minister to indicate the fact that the government recognise the fundamental unacceptability of having both the criteria in terms of job and salary <e>", "<cs> the minister must do so in the light of the opinion of the committee on the fundamental issue <e>", "<cs> the minister is right <e> <s> it is obvious that the acceptance of amendment no <e> <s> has made necessary a large number of consequential amendments not only to clause but to later parts of the bill <e> <s> i accept that it is my responsibility having moved the amendment to attempt to put the bill right before it comes before the house on report <e> <s> in the meantime it would be better if i withdrew this amendment did not move other amendments and opposed the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that <e> <s> i accept the rebuke that it would have been better if in moving amendment no <e> <s> i had indicated that there were further consequential amendments <e> <s> this is a failing that has happened when the government have introduced amendments at a later stage consequential on amendments introduced at an earlier stage <e> <s> there is nothing remarkable or unusual about it <e> <s> i do not feel guilty that i failed to do what i should have done <e> <s> however it is an omission for which i apologise to the committee <e> <s> in the circumstances i give notice that i shall not move any of the amendments standing in my name namely amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e> <s> we can therefore proceed to the motion that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill for the reasons already explained <e>", "<cs> the minister could have fooled me <e> <s> my noble friend lord sefton does less than justice to the government and the motivation behind clause <e> <s> after all he comes from well-run authorities such as liverpool and merseyside where there would be no justification for the kind of detailed intervention proposed in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather taken aback by the intervention of the noble lord lord renton who is so expert on legislation <e> <s> he says that it would be wrong to give some elements more weight than others <e> <s> all legislation gives some elements more weight than others it puts some on the face of the bill and some in schedules and it allocates some to regulations <e> <s> legislation by this government is almost entirely by regulation presumably on the basis that it is given less weight than provisions which appear on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond to the specific point made by the minister when he challenged me to agree with him that he had not been taking specific cases and had not been making particular allegations about individual councils <e> <s> that is certainly correct and i can confirm that <e> <s> that applies also to the noble earl lord caithness <e>", "<cs> i have two difficulties with that response <e> <s> first it reminds me of nothing so much as the left wing glc and the islington haringey and camden borough councils having their womens and race relations committees <e> <s> in every report it was their job to say that there was no race relations or sex discrimination <e> <s> it mattered not whether it was the provision of a sliding pole for a fire station or any other non-controversial business <e>", "<cs> nothing in my amendment says that there should be more than three <e> <s> there could be fewer than three if that seems appropriate <e>", "<cs> if the minister is going to be moderate he should accept that the governments position is rather extreme that the noble lord lord trafford is really extreme and that i am the moderate in this matter as is so often the case <e>", "<cs> i have not run a local authority <e>", "<cs> when the minister said that he was in the middle my noble friend lord graham and i barely resisted the temptation to think pig in the middle <e> <s> however i must remind the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides whether to withdraw his amendment i have some sympathy with what he is trying to achieve although i am more attracted by the governments approach to it <e> <s> what really worries me is the combination of this amendment and the next amendment which would extend the declaration to non-pecuniary interests <e> <s> that really worries me <e>", "<cs> i did not think i had used blandishments <e> <s> i thought i was putting a case for members of this chamber with respect to the legislation we pass to behave as though we were ourselves affected by it <e> <s> that seems to me to be a totally responsible approach and not a blandishment <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced by that argument <e> <s> there are perfectly good rules for distinguishing between general interests and particular pecuniary interests <e> <s> in local government for example it has always been accepted that council house tenants can vote on council house rents <e> <s> in many councils there would not have been anyone to vote except the council house tenants <e> <s> similarly i do not think that there would be any difficulty in accepting that farmers could vote on matters affecting the regulation of farming <e> <s> those are general matters <e> <s> however there are specific matters in which noble lords and members of the other place have a specific interest <e> <s> in many cases they are paid fees in order to affect the results of parliamentary proceedings <e> <s> in those cases i think that the rules that govern us should be no less severe than those governing local authorities <e>", "<cs> what the noble earl has said sounds reassuring <e> <s> if the commissions are to confine their advice and guidance primarily to good administrative practice in relation to the pattern of complaints of maladministration that they have received the governments intention is close to that which we intended in moving the amendment <e>", "<cs> that was very much the reply that i feared <e> <s> it shows that the governments thinking has not only not advanced since we last talked about these matters last year but in some ways has actually retreated <e> <s> the whole point of the local ombudsman system as my noble friend lady serota has made clear is that it is a system which is applied selectively when it is really necessary <e> <s> it is an economical and efficient system for remedying maladministration <e>", "<cs> i accept as the minister said that the amendment is technically defective <e> <s> therefore i should say at once that i shall not seek to divide the committee on it <e> <s> however i am very dissatisfied by the tone and content of the reply which has been given <e> <s> it seems to me that what is being proposed is the worst of all possible worlds in that local authorities shall pay for the local ombudsmans services just as they do now but they shall have no effective say in determining what the expenditure will be <e> <s> further they will have no very effective way of commenting on the work of the local ombudsman <e>", "<cs> i suppose that i shall have to be satisfied with that response <e> <s> the problem is that the government are forcing local authorities to undertake more and more of their business in the form of commercial and contractual transactions <e> <s> therefore if the government have an opportunity to pursue that policy more and more of the local authoritys business would fall outside the jurisdiction of the local ombudsman <e> <s> that cannot be desirable <e>", "<cs> in so far as the administration of the school by the head teacher is within the scope of the education act it would be excluded because the education act proposes ways of remedying maladministration by head teachers <e> <s> the way that head teachers themselves are chosen could be an administrative matter <e> <s> decisions taken by local authorities on administrative matters rather than by the head teacher are matters which we consider to be analogous with administration of other local authority services <e> <s> where they are education matters and dealt with by the education acts we do not think that they should be included <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to speak again before the minister replies <e> <s> the noble baroness has made an interesting point but i am not convinced by it for the following reason <e> <s> parliament spent a great deal of time in and debating education legislation which as the noble baroness lady blatch rightly said devolved a considerable amount of power from the local education authorities to head teachers and governing bodies <e> <s> the basis of the existence of the local ombudsmen is that they deal with the responsibilities of local authorities and maladministration by local authorities <e> <s> the governments education acts have sought to draw a distinction between what is the local authorities responsibility and what is the responsibility within the schools <e> <s> whether or not they have drawn it correctly remains to be seen but they have sought to provide remedies for injustice in our education establishments our schools and colleges where the local authority is no longer responsible for the detail of them <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the amendment has effectively achieved its objective <e> <s> as i read it again i now realise that the word administration is difficult to define just as it is difficult to define in education bills <e> <s> i do not claim any greater wisdom than parliamentary draftsmen in this matter but i do not think that i made it clear in drafting the amendment that it was the responsibilities which remain in the hands of local authorities that we intended to attack <e> <s> i shall have to take the amendment away and think about it rather than ask the government to take it away and think about it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is probably the most difficult and contentious issue to face the committee in dealing with part ii of the bill <e> <s> it is certainly true as the noble baroness said that enforceability of the ombudsmans findings through the county court is established in northern ireland it does not involve an increase in court cases nor extend the length of the inquiries <e> <s> and it is supported by both the commissioners themselves and widdicombe <e>", "<cs> i have a compromise to suggest to the minister <e> <s> why not have enforceability only in the city of westminister <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been in his job for months now <e> <s> i have faced him across the dispatch boxes for all of that time <e> <s> he is by no means as naive as he would like the house to think him either in terms of the procedures of the house or in terms of political debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it was equally inexcusable whatever he referred to <e> <s> it was inexcusable to drag up history of more than years ago to bolster a very weak case <e> <s> if the case had not been weak he would not have thought to intervene in the way that he did <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to learn from the minister that a consultation document will be produced within the next couple of days <e> <s> in the light of our debate on statutory instruments relating to the water act it is an extraordinary piece of bad timing that the government have chosen to issue a consultation document two days after the matter has been considered in this committee <e> <s> it must raise the question of whether the government want the bill and the whole issue to be debated properly in this committee <e> <s> how are we to take on trust something that will be issued in two days time when we have not seen it and do not know of its intentions <e> <s> it is simply an invitation to us to withdraw the amendment but to bring it back at the report stage <e> <s> we certainly cannot be satisfied with the vague assurance that there will be a consultation document <e>", "<cs> the minister has been badly briefed about employment statistics <e> <s> of course they are brought together in travel-to-work areas but i hope that he is not seriously telling us that in the whole of london only one employment rate is available for london and a second for heathrow <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> traditionally unemployment statistics were collected by what was called employment exchange areas which are now much smaller <e> <s> there is no shortage of statistics about employment in areas much smaller than travel-to-work areas <e>", "<cs> the only answer to that is that we should now adjourn because it is clear that the proceedings in committee are incomplete <e> <s> are we seriously being told by ministers on the government front bench in this committee that we must sit tight and wait and have faith in something that is known already but we cannot be told about <e>", "<cs> i am always grateful to the noble lord lord jenkin of roding for his reference to my career in local government <e> <s> he seems to be stuck on one point <e> <s> he seems to know nothing else but nevertheless it is nice to hear that he has <e>", "<cs> that is very nice to know <e> <s> how are we to be assured that this subsection provides only a reserve power <e> <s> it does not say anything about a reserve power <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> there are two overwhelming answers to that <e> <s> the first is that of the noble lord lord hylton who said that in the end there is no free ticket to over-expenditure <e> <s> those who spend too much money will have to face the ballot box in the end they will have to face re-election <e> <s> if they have behaved wrongly in their electors view they will be kicked out <e> <s> that is the first answer <e>", "<cs> i rise only to welcome what the noble lord has said about the co-operation between local authorities and the private sector <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> it is sometimes said that in times of economic hardship the rich are uncomfortable the middle class suffer and the poor starve <e> <s> at times of fiscal uncertainty and uncertainty in public expenditure central government are uncomfortable local authorities suffer and the voluntary organisations starve <e> <s> i hope that the government will look sympathetically at these important amendments which are not enormously costly and which were so well moved by the noble lord lord hayter <e>", "<cs> i am reasonably satisfied by that reply <e> <s> i am glad to learn that there are no foreseeable circumstances under which the secretary of state would exercise his power to make a general reduction in the limits <e> <s> i am also interested by what the minister said about the section position <e> <s> that may enable us to cut short the debate on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> without further ado i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is certainly true that the removal of the economic development expenditure from the section expenditure makes a substantial difference in the short term to the amounts of money which local authorities are going to require <e> <s> it is also true as i made clear in my own introduction of the amendments that most local authorities do not come anywhere near the ceiling and that the average take-up is only per cent <e> <s> of the ceiling <e>", "<cs> that sounds quite hopeful <e> <s> the minister said that the government are negotiating now with the local authorities <e> <s> can he tell us whether the negotiations are likely to be concluded before we come back to this matter at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that reply <e> <s> if there is anything further that we need to say when the negotiations are concluded we shall do so <e> <s> in the meantime i think we accept that scrutiny is as good as review although i am not quite sure that i completely understand the difference <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that detailed explanation which was necessary even at this late hour of the night <e> <s> i was particularly flattered that he should describe my amendments as municipal socialism on a grand scale <e> <s> i shall not let him have my copy of that great book by bernard shaw <e>", "<cs> the answer is that historically it has worked by dint of public investment in the first place when private investment was not available <e> <s> the public investment has proved to be justified <e> <s> the first square metres of the birmingham international exhibition centre is profitable <e> <s> it is a successful example of municipal trading <e> <s> what we are now looking for is an assurance that it can carry on to the next stage to enable it to continue to compete successfully in the international exhibition centre market <e> <s> so the answer to the noble baroness is that there is every reason to suppose first that it needs public investment and secondly that public investment works <e> <s> that has proved to be the case from historical fact <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely surprised to hear that but the minister will know that mr ridley the former secretary of state agreed to meet sir dick knowles last wednesday <e> <s> however he was not able to do so <e> <s> when the meeting was cancelled no further date was set <e> <s> if mr patten is able to meet sir dick knowles that will of course satisfy us entirely <e> <s> we are very pleased to hear that news <e> <s> however i hope the general point is well-established that this is one example of a joint venture i could produce many more and the minister has produced examples himself despite the misgivings of the noble baroness lady blatch has proved successful but which continues to need a public sector involvement <e> <s> like the national exhibition centre these joint ventures may be involved in the economic development of an area they may be concerned with training or many other aspects of the economic and social life of our cities and districts <e>", "<cs> if the minister were to read his own reply in the cold light of day he would realise that the government have become so clever that they have caught themselves coming back <e> <s> it is all very well to say that there are only fleeting occasions when you can catch companies of this kind <e> <s> if that is the case then what we are doing is revealing a profound over-complexity in the governments thoughts <e> <s> if they are reduced to the concept of intention in order to catch influenced companies and to place restrictions on them then they have allowed their overpowering desire to control every aspect of local government activity to get the better of them <e> <s> i am sorry to hear that reply <e> <s> it is not appropriate to divide the committee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it would not be so bad if the position of being an influenced company did not then start to lead this company to be subject to the capital controls on local authorities <e> <s> despite the tortuous argument advanced by the noble lord it is difficult to see why so many members and officers of local authorities should be excluded <e> <s> after all they have other interests <e> <s> they are human beings <e> <s> they take a part in their local communities and get involved in undertakings which may be purely voluntary and charitable and concerned with enterprise <e> <s> to exclude them simply on the basis that they happen to be members or officers of local authorities seems to be starving to an unacceptable extent the voluntary sector and starving the sector of companies co-operating with local authorities <e> <s> we may wish to return to this matter at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of the ministers last comments i invite him to look at the position in the conservative-controlled london borough of bexley which is doing what ministers in his department have urged it to do namely selling all its housing stock to a new company formed for that purpose <e> <s> as i understand it the director of housing the principal projects officer of housing a senior officer in the finance department and one other whose position i do not know propose to be the managers and even the directors of that new company <e> <s> i invite the minister to look at the famous city of westminister where the senior officers of the cleansing department tendered successfully for the cleansing contract <e> <s> ministers continue to refer to allegations of abuses by labour-controlled authorities <e> <s> they forget that it is above all conservative-controlled councils which involve themselves in such deals <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says sexist <e> <s> i am not sure that i could say that <e> <s> clearly spouses works in both directions <e> <s> i think it is offensive to both men and women i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> it is offensive to both men and women to assume that their actions and opinions will be the same as those of the women and men to whom they are married <e> <s> i hope that the government will look favourably upon this amendment <e>", "<cs> even if that were true which it is not what does the minister think about the possibility of enforcing a provision of this kind <e> <s> who are the thought police who will spy into the marital relationships of councillors and officers of authorities <e> <s> is this not an open invitation to live in sin in order to avoid the conditions of clause of the bill <e> <s> who in their right minds will enter into the holy estate of matrimony if they are to be accused of not just loving and honouring but of agreeing with every single thing that their spouse says <e> <s> the situation is absurd <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it would have been better if the minister had cut the gordian knot and removed the subsection as a whole rather than seeking to amend it <e> <s> however i shall listen carefully to the ministers arguments on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is better than nothing <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister is responding to amendment no <e> <s> b rather than to amendment no <e> <s> a which is a new clause after clause <e> <s> it is very interesting to have the ministers speech which will appear in <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to welcome the noble lord into the group of the ministers who read out the answer to the wrong amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington has the prize for that because not only has she been known to read the wrong answer but no one noticed until afterwards <e>", "<cs> this is as far as the minister got at one oclock on tuesday morning <e> <s> perhaps i may congratulate him on reading his brief this time rather more slowly than he did then <e>", "<cs> at least i should like to believe that the government have some good intentions in some parts of the bill <e> <s> i cannot believe that the government intend the meaning carried in clause <e> <s> if they are to defend it and say that there are abuses which will be corrected by the provision let us at least know what the abuses are <e> <s> it is difficult for me to understand what they could possibly be <e> <s> the example that i have given is by no means outrageous or untypical of the way in which the clause can operate <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> the deep suspicion in my mind is now crystallising <e> <s> i had forgotten that today is a garden party day and that the government do not want a division on the bill at this time <e> <s> that is why they are now making nice noises about several of our amendments in turn <e>", "<cs> in all conscience i cannot force the committee to a division on matter about which the minister has not only said that he will return to it at a later stage but that he recognises the justice of our case <e> <s> the government have dug a hole for themselves and they have fallen into it <e> <s> all credit to the minister because he is trying hard to clamber up the sides of that hole <e> <s> i congratulate him <e> <s> i hope that between now and report he will find some suitable hand and foot holds and that he will come back with an amendment which satisfies what he recognises to be the valid point made in our amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord montagu has made an incontrovertible case for the exclusion of building preservation trusts from the controls of part v of the bill <e> <s> he set out the additional work that would be required of building preservation trusts if they were to be covered by the bill <e> <s> he explained the effect on local authority capital finance and the difficulties there would be in receiving as they do now local authority capital for their work <e> <s> he did not especially refer to it but it would also affect government controls over local authority participation because part v of the bill provides that in these circumstances the secretary of state shall have substantial controls over the ways in which local authorities participate in such companies <e> <s> the noble lords case for the damage that would be done is overwhelming <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord asks leave to withdraw his amendment may i have a reply to the points that i made to the minister <e> <s> they deserve a reply <e>", "<cs> i thought so at the time too <e> <s> however the noble lord is continuing to say as if he had not given the undertaking to the noble lord lord hayter that specific bodies shall have an opportunity to go to the department and argue for their independence <e> <s> he made the point to the noble lord lord hayter about the national association of citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> he made a similar point about building preservation trusts to the noble lord lord montagu <e> <s> but what he is saying about going to the department and arguing the case is in conflict with the offer he made to the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> we want a clear assurance that the government recognise that this cannot be done by the department case by case <e> <s> it has to be done by amendment to the bill <e> <s> that is the answer i want from the minister <e>", "<cs> i think that amendments nos <e> <s> j and k should be dealt with before this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is a pleasure to welcome the paymaster general to the bench on this bill <e> <s> in the negotiations with central government to which i have become accustomed over the years there is always at one end of the table a person from the treasury <e> <s> he tends in the end to have the say on what is decided whether or not departmental officials want it <e> <s> negotiations depend almost entirely on what the treasury official decides <e> <s> we have here <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i should certainly not wish to be accused of trying to introduce circularity into the argument for the bill <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that if i came to this dispatch box and said in support of my case that a district treasurer had written to me expressing concern about government proposals i should get short shrift <e> <s> an unnamed district treasurer says something which happens to be convenient to the government but the minister has not told us whether district treasurers or the society of district treasurers have written to the contrary <e>", "<cs> that explanation is irrational for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the example given by the minister that something should be taken out of basic credit approval and used for supplementary credit approval can be done without that phrase in subsection <e> <s> the basic credit approval should therefore just be less than it would be if the amount involving government grant were included in it <e> <s> the second reason why it seems irrational is that apart from the one inconsequential example the government have not indicated the purposes for which the approval may be used <e>", "<cs> i suppose that is an explanation of a sort of what is intended by the whole business of grant <e> <s> i cannot say that i am satisfied <e> <s> we shall have to consider what further amendment may be necessary to deal with the problem at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister was speaking to the right amendment <e> <s> i only spoke to a single amendment amendment no <e> <s> zza <e> <s> i was not particularly talking about the criteria for credit approvals which are in amendments nos <e> <s> zzb and zzc which my noble friend lord graham will move in a moment <e> <s> if anything it seems to me that i understated the case for my amendment because i did not make the point for which i am grateful to the minister that it is the very fact of the public expenditure planning totals procedure which is to be adopted from that makes it possible for us to ask for these provisions for local authority capital finance <e> <s> they make it possible for us to ask for the same opportunities for sensible forward planning which central government plan for themselves <e>", "<cs> but the amendment only asks for a provisional total for the authoritys credit approval for the two succeeding financial years <e> <s> therefore it is not demanding a statutory basis <e>", "<cs> then local authorities could be forgiven for thinking that the government do not mean what they say when such a modest amendment is put forward <e> <s> if the government stand by paragraph a they ought not only to accept this amendment they ought to accept an amendment which went further and said that the final bcas would not be based on approved capital guidelines lower than those specified in year one <e>", "<cs> i think that the government are groping towards an answer to the question <e> <s> i shall not push the amendment any further now <e> <s> we shall have to have better answers by the time we come to the report stage <e> <s> we shall have to have some indication of the justification for not including in the bill the in our view essential indications which were included in the consultation paper a year ago <e> <s> it is more than months since <e>", "<cs> this series of amendments although moved seductively reflects the constant schizophrenia in government thinking between the claimed desire to give local authorities greater freedom to plan their capital expenditure in a rational way to reflect their local needs and the constant fear that as soon as that has been done and there is any gesture towards independence by local authorities they might misuse such independence and therefore it must all be taken back again <e> <s> the paymaster general is telling us that we are on that part of the cycle that says we are terrified that local authorities while not spending more than they are supposed to because that is already adequately controlled might not spend the money on exactly the thing that central government wish them to spend it on <e> <s> they might not get exactly the same balance between home improvement grants for example and other forms of capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> the minister chose to quote from other parts of the speech made by the secretary of state and that made at an earlier date <e> <s> he then chose to quote from the january green paper but not from the february consultation document <e> <s> in none of those statements was it said that the receipts from the existing system would not be available <e> <s> a qualification was always made but it is not now being made because it is irrelevant <e> <s> it was that there could be a change in the timing of the availability <e> <s> as the noble lord lord jenkin said the question was the pace at which the receipts <e>", "<cs> interspersed with these amendments so ably spoken to by the noble lord lord ross there are amendments of mine which attempt the same objective but which produce slightly different figures <e> <s> it does not matter at all because both sets of figures are much better than those of the government <e> <s> we need not feel ashamed about the discrepancy <e> <s> in two cases our figures are more moderate than those of the government <e> <s> we are allowing them to reserve more of the receipts from the disposal of dwellinghouses and more of other receipts than the noble lord lord ross proposes <e>", "<cs> in a just world the speech that has just been made by the paymaster general would not merely be immortalised in <e>", "<cs> the minister asks rhetorical questions about when a debt is likely to be collectable or uncollectable <e> <s> he gives examples of three months six months months when a tenant has moved or when nobody knows who the tenant is <e> <s> there is a simple answer to that question which is that a debt is collectable when the auditor certifies it as collectable <e> <s> it is an established principle of private sector financing where at the end of each year there has to be a statement of bad debts and where a debt is outstanding for more than a certain period the directors of the company have to certify that a debt is collectable before it can be included in the accounts <e> <s> the same would apply here <e> <s> the auditor would be able on the basis of past experience and without going into every single rent or rate arrear to establish a perfectly reasonable principle upon which to assess the proportions of the debt outstanding for particular periods which would be collectable and he could provide a certificate to that effect <e>", "<cs> as long as the minister accepts that it works both ways we shall shoot the messenger if he brings bad news <e> <s> i believe that the minister has set out very clearly in his reply the reasons why we find these amendments necessary and the governments proposals unacceptable <e> <s> he is very simply saying that the men in whitehall and marsham street decide that what they think goes and that local authorities will follow whatever accountancy method these men find preferable <e>", "<cs> some draftsmen may prefer their local authorities singular and some of them plural <e> <s> we prefer our local authorities independent <e> <s> the government propose to have them completely under the thumb of central government <e> <s> that is the difference which divides us on part iv and on so many parts of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord leaves that point i wonder whether he will elaborate a little on the terms of reference which the select committee perceived for itself <e> <s> as i understand it the select committee in another place concerned itself with planning matters and went so far as to make amendments which affected the section agreement <e> <s> is there a difference between the procedure of this house and that of another place on the proper remit of select committees <e> <s> if not why does there appear to be a difference between your lordships select committee and the select committee of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord lord brightman for his very clear exposition of the conclusions of the select committee and to the noble and learned lord and all the members of the select committee for the devoted work which they clearly put into preparing this report <e> <s> i wish to refer to a number of items <e> <s> the first is the issue which the noble and learned lord spent some time discussing the traffic congestion at temple mills and the difficulty that will exist until the m extension is open <e> <s> secondly i wish to deal with the issue of the remit of the select committee that is whether it is proper in the words of the noble and learned lord to act as a court of appeal against the decisions of planning committees <e> <s> finally i shall deal with the question of the status of this house at third reading in considering the report of a select committee of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be pleased to hear the news which the minister has just given about the government signing the convention <e> <s> how many other nations are required to sign before ratification <e> <s> when does he expect that ratification will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that we should allow this procedural motion to pass without registering the strongest possible disapproval of the behaviour of the government in recent weeks regarding their plans for this bill and indeed the plans for legislation in the department over a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me not to accept the apologies of the noble lord the leader of the house and indeed the apologies expressed by the noble lord lord hesketh in a letter which he wrote to me last friday <e> <s> the noble lord is certainly right <e> <s> we have sought and have been given an opportunity to consult about many matters as regards this bill as indeed we always are <e> <s> however that does not go far enough in dealing with the prime issue with which i am concerned namely that this large number of amendments was not only put down very late i say this to the noble earl lord halsbury who i do not think was referring to the first committee day after two months of summer recess but it was also put down after two months in which the government had had the opportunity to consider their position <e>", "<cs> i should dearly love to follow the noble lord lord jenkin and the noble baroness lady gardner into the history and philosophy of the economics of public housing <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner raised the very fundamental issue and i am glad that she did about whether one should subsidise the property or the person in public policy <e>", "<cs> i am always glad to know that there are issues on which we are generally in agreement with the government or on which they are generally in agreement with us <e> <s> i am a little unnerved by some of the metaphors of the noble earl <e> <s> he talked about us being in tune <e> <s> we may be in tune but that rather depends on what song is being sung <e> <s> when the noble earl talked about tiers of a ring fence i wondered whether he was thinking about something from showjumping or about a fence which has some effective meaning as regards excluding or including <e> <s> the noble earl did not respond to my detailed questions about what should be included in the housing revenue account <e> <s> he did not answer the particular examples that i gave of things which could be included and things which should be excluded <e> <s> will the noble earl write to me about the governments thinking on those matters <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that <e> <s> i am aware that consultation is going on and that final decisions cannot be taken until it is complete <e> <s> however it is always helpful to have from the dispatch box as much of the government thinking as possible in order that we the local <e>", "<cs> it does not matter which way we deal with it <e> <s> by all means i shall introduce the amendment which as the noble earl and the noble lord lord ross said has very much the same effect as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although the amendment of the noble lord lord ross is more precise he has himself admitted in introducing the amendment that the figure of per cent <e> <s> that he proposes is notional <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come back to the point but the ministers reply raises more doubts in my mind than i had expected because it goes very wide of the way in which the amendments have been drafted and moved <e> <s> i must therefore express my concern about some of the governments thinking <e> <s> the minister challenged me not to say whether or not we supported subventions from the general rate fund for the housing revenue account but to say whether we supported huge subventions <e> <s> that is a very curious way of putting even a rhetorical question <e>", "<cs> i should like to correct any possible implication that i was attacking housing associations <e> <s> the relative size of housing associations compared with council housing needs to be taken into account <e> <s> housing associations have half a million dwellings whereas local authorities have over million <e> <s> my defence of local housing authorities should not be taken as any criticism of housing associations <e>", "<cs> i intervene only to welcome the noble lord lord reay to the government dispatch box <e> <s> i hope that there will be more meatier amendments which we can debate with him in subsequent proceedings of this committee <e>", "<cs> the minister asked me to welcome these amendments on the ground that they had been amended in consultation with the local authority associations <e> <s> it is indeed my understanding that they have been amended in consultation with the local authority associations but it is not my understanding that they are satisfied with the result <e>", "<cs> i hope it is only because we are in conservative party conference week that we have had the most disgraceful reply i have heard from a government front bench speaker in the course of this bill <e> <s> we have heard a most disgraceful proposition from the government and a most disgraceful defence of it <e> <s> the minister seems to delight in picking out a small number of local authorities which he claims to be in default <e> <s> he attacks not only their efficiency but their motivation as well <e> <s> he says that their arrears arise because they are no doubt influenced by the availability of ratepayers money to make good any shortfall <e> <s> he is accusing them not only of being incompetent but in effect of being crooked <e> <s> i do not think that that is acceptable in this committee <e> <s> i do not think that we should conduct our debates in such a way <e>", "<cs> they are able to deal with the bad debts by repossession and by eviction <e> <s> that option is not open to local authorities <e> <s> that is the fundamental difference <e>", "<cs> has the minister ever seen a profit and loss account or a balance sheet <e> <s> provision for bad debt is not the same thing <e> <s> of course people make provision for bad debts as a business precaution <e> <s> that is not the same position as the local authorities in their housing revenue accounts and above all the council tenants who are paying will find themselves in if these amendments are agreed to <e> <s> they will suffer and they will suffer directly <e> <s> that is quite different from provision in the accounts <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have misunderstood the minister and that he is not saying that we shall see another example of this departure from reality towards notional figures and notional concepts which is so much a feature of the bill <e> <s> he used the phrase projects would be deemed to be funded from borrowing <e> <s> well either a project has been funded from borrowing or it has not <e> <s> therefore to talk about deemed to be funded from borrowing simply leaves the secretary of state in a position where he can say what he thinks regardless of the reality <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that conciliatory reply <e> <s> of course the amendment does not refer to deemed to be funded <e> <s> it is true that the expenditure from revenue and expenditure from usable receipts will be a part which ought not to be hypothecated of the councils permitted expenditure <e> <s> it certainly ought not to be the case that that aspect is put to one side and i understand <e>", "<cs> i have a quite different question to put to the minister <e> <s> it refers to the first amendments that we debated this afternoon <e> <s> at that time we were told that the concept of affordability was an unreal one and that it was not capable of precise definition <e> <s> we were told by the noble lord lord jenkin and this was echoed from the front bench that we could not put affordability into the basis of calculation of housing subsidy because it was such an imprecise question and because in any case the government were moving ideologically away from that concept in order to deal with poverty by housing benefit rather than by the overall level of rents <e>", "<cs> i am content to leave the substantive discussion until another day <e> <s> however the minister has answered only part of my point <e> <s> he said that it would be wrong for that part of the mandatory grant system which related to the councils own property to detract from its ability to carry out its housing programme in other areas and we are grateful for that <e> <s> but surely the same argument applies with equal force to mandatory improvement grants which are not on the councils own property <e> <s> can the minister give us any further indication on that point before i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> i am interested in the phrase separate allocations for demand led money required from the private sector <e> <s> i have listened to what he said about not affecting the hra subsidy level <e> <s> if it means what on the face of it i think it means i am moderately encouraged <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what the noble earl has said before we come back to our more detailed amendments next time without any commitment that i am satisfied <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> nobody wants the discussions to come to a halt but i fear that the minister and the government are getting themselves into what is becoming a theological trap between capital and revenue expenditure <e> <s> after all in many spheres of business life the decision about whether to capitalise what could be revenue expenditure or to revenuise what could be capital expenditure is a matter of judgment from time to time <e> <s> i should hate to think that the government were digging themselves into a trap by trying to set up a hard and fast distinction between the two at all times <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i take the phrase another stage to mean that we shall have something more definite on report <e>", "<cs> it had better be more than hopefully otherwise there will be hell to pay <e> <s> the matter is causing concern not only to local authorities and their tenants but to the whole construction industry <e> <s> i more than hope it must be a demand that we have something concrete to debate by the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> clause even as amended is described in the weasel words of the side heading as <e>", "<cs> we can easily deal with that point <e> <s> if we take out clause and for a wild moment i thought the noble earl understood the argument for doing that of course we should have to replace the provision for war disablement pensions or war widows pensions <e> <s> that is not the problem <e> <s> no what we have here is a deep misunderstanding both of social conditions and of the facts of economic life <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the minister sounded very convinced about what he has just said <e>", "<cs> if i had been on the government front bench i should be ashamed to make that response <e> <s> the government proclaimed the tenants choice procedures only a year ago as being the great solution to the housing problems which they claimed were the responsibility particularly of labour local authorities <e> <s> they said that it was labour local authorities who dragooned their tenants were unpopular with their tenants and treated their tenants badly <e> <s> they claimed that labour local authorities were responsible for so much of the misery in our housing policy and in our housing situation <e> <s> they proposed this dramatic and brave new world of tenants choice where tenants would have the ability to go out and find new landlords or new landlords would put themselves forward and somehow all would be well <e> <s> within months that has all fallen apart <e> <s> it is not just a case of concrete slabs falling off the sides of buildings but of the whole policy falling apart <e> <s> it is not working in the sense that even with their rigged ballots tenants choice is not taking place <e> <s> the government are not prepared to apply it to the properties which are most in need of repair in other words those which would need dowries <e>", "<cs> that reply is slightly less equivocal than the answer given by the minister a minute or two ago <e> <s> to that extent i am grateful for his response <e> <s> i am fascinated to see that a year after the enactment of the housing act and six months after the implementation of this part of the act the minister can give no forecast regarding the number of transfers which will take place <e> <s> i should have thought that if there had been any significant movement in that area many applications would now be in the pipeline and that such information would be available to his department at least concerning what will happen this year and next even if he cannot give any forecast as to the future <e> <s> i can perhaps be forgiven for thinking that this inability to give any indication of what is likely to happen is a confession that this part of the housing act has been a dismal and deserved failure despite the rigging of the electoral system <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> in procedural terms it is not as satisfactory as having a separate provision but if as i understand it the minister is saying that central government will meet all the costs then clearly he has gone some way towards meeting some of the anxieties which we have expressed <e> <s> i look forward to further amplification of what he said because it is certainly not to be found on the face of the bill <e> <s> i assume he means that the government will have to bring forward further amendments on report in order to give effect to the undertaking just given <e> <s> i look forward to seeing such amendments <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the ministers quotation from the bill was inaccurate <e> <s> he spoke as if the bill said such associations representative of local government as appeared to the secretary of state to be appropriate <e> <s> the bill does not say that <e> <s> it refers to such representatives of local government and does not make any reference to associations <e> <s> i am not saying that this is a major point on which we shall go to the stake <e> <s> certainly i do not believe that the form of consultation should always be laid down with enormous precision because it would make it difficult to keep up with changes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that <e> <s> perhaps he would like to read his speech both in the original version and in the revised version <e> <s> he might then consider whether the defence he made of his misquotation of the bill is appropriate to the bill as it stands whether such representatives is an adequate definition and whether there is an adequate precedent for it <e> <s> i do not wish to push the noble lord now <e> <s> i ask him to think about it further and perhaps write to me if he has any further thoughts <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> ministers have been at pains to assure us on more than one occasion today that there is nothing sinister behind the wording of the bill as we see it <e> <s> i cannot think that in his response to this amendment the minister has been properly advised if he thinks that there is anything as sinister as he claims in the wording of the amendment <e> <s> nothing in it says that no council house rent shall ever change <e> <s> nobody says that the <e>", "<cs> it does not make a great deal of difference to us <e> <s> let me say at the outset that in general we are in agreement with the proposals for housing renewal areas <e> <s> organisations representing public housing throughout the country have recognised the value of the housing renewal area proposals <e> <s> it is fair to say that the proposals would not be possible if it had not been for the planning work carried out by local authorities throughout the country <e>", "<cs> i am sure that it cannot be deliberate but the minister has seriously misrepresented the case i put forward <e> <s> he suggested that by requiring in the amendment that the report <e>", "<cs> i am fed up to the teeth with frameworks and with the government proposing changes in the structure of subsidy policy rather than providing any money <e> <s> we had all that last year <e> <s> we had that with housing action trusts and with the tenants choice proposals <e> <s> all of them were proposals to change the framework and not the reality <e> <s> what about a picture inside the frame for a change <e> <s> in particular what about a picture of a few bank notes <e> <s> that is what is in fact required <e>", "<cs> that is a very eloquent attack on the housing act <e> <s> in defending the wording of the present bill the minister has given no indication as to why the housing act used different words <e> <s> he has given no indication as to why it should be thought that mismanagement of housing stock is not one of the major reasons why special measures such as the establishment of a housing renewal area may be required <e>", "<cs> i shall not resist the idea that local authorities should take the initiative in carrying out their own surveys to complement and update the english house condition survey of <e> <s> i welcome the scraps of indication that the government have an interest in evidence <e> <s> i still believe that they are standing too far back from the responsibility that they ought to have in securing that the evidence on which the policies are based is correctly and adequately obtained above all with reference to amendment no <e> <s> a that the resources are available <e>", "<cs> i really did not want to pour cold water on the whole idea of housing renewal areas <e> <s> as i have said it is very largely a local authority initiative and that of professionals in the field which the government have taken up <e> <s> the answers that the government have given to all the amendments we have tabled have aroused in me the greatest misgiving that the government are not treating this matter as anything other than a policy gesture <e> <s> i do not believe that they really want to devote additional resources to it <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the minister for his careful exposition of this very complex series of amendments <e> <s> the government will know that we are unhappy about substantial parts of the new proposals for housing improvement grants and we shall be coming on to those matters as we deal with subsequent amendments <e>", "<cs> again this is part of the provision for housing improvement grants with which we agree in principle <e> <s> so far as we can follow the very complex series of amendments we think that they appear to be an improvement on the existing provision <e>", "<cs> am i correct in my assumption that there is no means test for common part grants <e>", "<cs> that was what i feared <e> <s> i heard what the minister said about the test of resources in clauses and but does he not recognise that this could be an impossibly complicated problem for local authorities to means test each individual tenant in the case of an application from a number of tenants or a landlord for improvements to common parts <e> <s> would it not mean that any application which caused difficulty to even a single tenant as a result of the means test would fail and that the other tenants would be denied the grant towards improvement of their common parts <e> <s> is the minister willing to look at this again <e> <s> it is a matter of grave concern because it may frustrate the laudable objectives of the government in simplifying and improving the common part grant procedures <e>", "<cs> the minister is anticipating one of my later amendments or perhaps is misinterpreting it <e> <s> we are not resisting any kind of means test nor are we doing so in amendment no <e> <s> j to which we shall come in a few minutes <e> <s> on the contrary our proposal is much more reasonable it deals with blocks of luxury flats and would give the local authority some discretion in the matter <e> <s> what is unsatisfactory about the procedures proposed by the government is that the local authority has no discretion and that as the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said i am grateful for his intervention reasonable proposals for improvement grants would perhaps be frustrated because one or two tenants were put off by means testing procedures <e> <s> a large number of people refuse to take part in means test procedures on principle <e> <s> they find great difficulty in submitting themselves to means test inquiries <e> <s> if it affected only them one might say that it was their privilege but if this refusal on principle by one or two tenants in a block is likely to frustrate the improvement of the common parts for everybody else that is a more serious matter <e>", "<cs> the minister sought to reassure the committee by setting out and we are grateful to him for it the basis on which the means test is to be applied <e> <s> he sought to reassure us that it will not be as severe a means test as the housing benefit procedure though he has now conceded that it will be varied as housing benefit varies <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord stallard says housing benefit has varied nine times in recent years and that means there will be constantly shifting goal posts for the means tests for grants just as there are for housing benefit <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a recipe for confusion <e>", "<cs> the word opinion must be taken with the word hardship <e> <s> the word hardship has been well established in legislation <e> <s> indeed the noble lord has taken part in many local government debates and has often defended the <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that answer even starts to meet the points which i made and it certainly does not answer the very specific questions which i put to the government when i moved the amendment <e> <s> the minister seeks to persuade us that this procedure will turn local authorities wrongly towards a policy of clearance rather than towards a policy of renovation <e> <s> however the rules and the authorisation needed for clearance are already quite severe <e> <s> it is not easy for local authorities using their existing powers to go for substantial areas of clearance <e> <s> for example they can be frustrated by the refusal of compulsory purchase orders <e> <s> i do not think that this is a realistic alternative even for a local authority with the worst possible will in the world <e> <s> i cannot see any good reason for a local authority to be so perversely determined to frustrate the wishes of government in this matter <e>", "<cs> i only wish to put on record that we agree with the amendment so ably moved and supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not allowed to respond to my noble friend lord stoddart but will the minister confirm for the benefit of my noble friend that european directives are necessary because governments including particularly the government of this country have failed in their duty to keep water as clean as it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the timing is normally agreed between the usual channels but the timing of the availability of the text of the statement is not usually agreed <e> <s> we have not yet had it <e> <s> does that mean that the government have not made up their mind about the community charge <e> <s> why could it not have been made available to us long before now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that assurance that the normal courtesies will be observed <e> <s> i am still left with the question as to whether the government who usually stage-manage their party conferences rather effectively are succeeding in doing so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but i think his amendment is amendment no <e> <s> nb <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> he has been very helpful in giving the numbers of people who have remedies <e> <s> he mentioned tenants who are rent free and the who can register their rents <e> <s> can the minister complete the sums and tell us how many tenants do not have a remedy <e>", "<cs> we have come to the seventh day of the committee stage <e> <s> there are pages of amendments in the seventh marshalled list <e> <s> most of them are government amendments either to their own bill which is before parliament now or to legislation which has been through parliament within the past months notably the local government finance act and the housing act <e> <s> the government are clearly unable to control their own department their own drafting facilities and their own political will in these matters <e> <s> yet the minister has the nerve to stand up and accuse me in putting forward an amendment with a new clause less than one page long of introducing complicated legislation <e> <s> i could hardly believe my ears when i heard that <e> <s> i could hardly believe that that was the most serious answer the minister could give to what after all even on his own figures is a problem affecting people <e>", "<cs> there is a series of possible remedies to the injustice which has been identified <e> <s> the first remedy would have been the action taken by a conservative government in when the valuation and rating scotland act was passed <e> <s> the first action would have been to make it illegal <e> <s> we did not propose it in those terms <e> <s> we proposed a more reasonable set of procedures <e> <s> we proposed notification to make recourse to the courts only a last resort <e> <s> the third possibility was that proposed by the noble lord lord coleraine which was rejected out of hand by the minister <e> <s> he did not say that he would take it away and think about it <e> <s> he said that he would not do it <e> <s> when the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls asked what would be done if it was not done in this bill he was told that there would be nothing more than information no legislation now or at any other time <e> <s> my noble friend lord northfield made his point twice and failed to get a response <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that intervention <e> <s> as i said if landlords had all been like the noble lord lord campbell there would not be a problem <e> <s> the confederation of scottish local authorities is in touch with these issues over the whole of scotland <e> <s> it estimates that the shortfall in other words the profiteering by bad landlords in scotland could have amounted to million <e> <s> that is not a trivial amount <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord northfield asked a specific question of the minister on the basis of which i might be persuaded to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> he asked whether the minister would provide for it in a way to satisfy me by legislation <e> <s> i am encouraged by the intervention of the noble and learned lord to think that legislation even if we do not have the wording right is not impossible <e> <s> if the minister will say to <e>", "<cs> i think that we are nearly there <e> <s> no one is asking for any guarantee of success <e> <s> i did not ask for a firm commitment i said that the minister should use his best endeavours <e> <s> but the phrase we want from him is that he recognises that an attempt to secure a remedy by legislation is what noble lords on all sides of the committee are seeking <e> <s> if he will confirm that fact i should be delighted to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that i can pursue the matter any further <e> <s> i can only say that the committee will be gravely disappointed especially after the intervention of the noble and learned lord lord brightman if the government do not find it possible to do something which is widely agreed across parties as being necessary to secure justice <e>", "<cs> i meant that the committee would be gravely disappointed if these attempts failed <e> <s> if that were the case then we would certainly find it necessary to put this amendment or a similar one forward again <e> <s> everyone is now agreed that there is a case in justice for something to be done in the matter <e> <s> i think that virtually everyone is agreed that leaflets and propaganda are not good enough and that legislation will be necessary to deal with the issue <e> <s> it is on that basis which is a view i take to be widely held in the committee as a brief if you like for the minister to take back to the department that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for making the statement <e> <s> he made it with admirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister will agree that the crux of the statement he has made is the proposal for a new system of transitional relief for individuals and households who face significant increases in the community charge <e> <s> will he not now come clean and agree that none of this would have been necessary if the government had accepted when the bill was going through the house the proposal that the community charge should be based on the ability to pay <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be able to respond to those very reasonable pleas <e> <s> i found his answer to this whole series of amendments quite unconvincing <e> <s> i have seen the mirror image to that argument so many times in official briefs that i was astonished that he could stand up and make it with a straight face <e> <s> the argument that is usually put forward is that once one has a list of exceptions as there is in clause anything that is not on the list is thought to be treated differently <e> <s> therefore one avoids having lists <e> <s> ministers have stood up time and again and those facing us now have done likewise and said that they are not going to make a list because if they do so the implication would be that the items not on the list would be treated differently <e>", "<cs> i believe that the issues raised by myself and the noble lord lord harris show that the government should be challenged on this aspect of their legislation <e> <s> we have listened patiently to assurances that one does not have to have a list because leaving a matter off it has some meaning <e> <s> that assurance should be challenged and the different procedures that are now adopted despite the friendly words of the minister should not be accepted at face value <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the intervention by the noble lord lord hylton he is well-informed about such matters <e> <s> however my amendment does not raise the large issues to which he has drawn attention as regards which refugees are entitled to be in this country it is concerned only with the issue of government and local authority support for communities which already find themselves in the country <e> <s> nevertheless it was as well that he reminded the committee of this group of people who as he said are not from commonwealth countries <e> <s> that aspect reinforces one of the points i made <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am happy with that response <e> <s> the minister would not expect me to be happy with it <e> <s> we know the period of consultation <e> <s> there must be a limit to the amount of time that the government require to consider the results of the consultation <e> <s> the government are already aware as the minister has said that some recommendations if they are accepted will require legislation <e> <s> it would be tragic if we lost the opportunity of the bill to promote legislation to deal with the more obvious deficiencies of section of the act within the course of the next session of parliament <e> <s> can he say that he will be pressing for legislation within the next session of parliament <e>", "<cs> i am persistent with good reason <e> <s> i have already made it clear that the legislation is defective <e> <s> i am disappointed that the minister is not prepared to go any further <e> <s> i shall have to consider whether this is an issue to which we should return at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this has been a curious little debate <e> <s> first its status in the committee is curious secondly its timing is curious and thirdly the content of the amendment is curious <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that comment <e> <s> i apologise if i implied that the amendment went beyond local authorities but the issue clearly goes beyond local authorities <e> <s> it could cover all kinds of public authorities <e> <s> it is an important element of commercial transactions <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can be any more precise than the rules of debate which state <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has paraphrased rule xiv <e> <s> i have not sought to do so <e> <s> i simply read it out <e> <s> i have made it clear that i make no allegations against the personal honour of any noble lord <e> <s> i simply draw the attention of all noble lords who take part in advocating promoting or opposing legislation to the content of rule xiv <e> <s> it is for members of the committee to make their own individual judgment as to whether they consider that being involved in a corporate manner rather than for an individual fee absolves them from the conditions of rule xiv <e> <s> it is not for me to say <e> <s> it is ultimately a matter for individual noble lords and for the chamber <e> <s> i would not seek to paraphrase or expand in any way upon the rules of this chamber <e>", "<cs> i would only add that whether the standards of this chamber are upheld is not for me or even the leader of the house to say <e> <s> that is a matter for individual members who have taken part in this debate to say <e> <s> that is the tradition and custom of this chamber <e>", "<cs> fortunately we have with us this evening my noble friend lady birk who has been involved at a number of stages over a number of years in this sometimes tangled history of the right-to-buy legislation <e> <s> she certainly can put the matter into perspective much more effectively than i can <e> <s> she enables me to speak at much shorter length than would otherwise be necessary <e> <s> however there are two or three points that i feel i have to make about the situation as we find it now particularly the situation that we have found since the debates on the right to buy for the disabled last year <e> <s> i do not intend to go over that ground at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way because this was a point on which the noble earl lord kinnoull specifically challenged me <e> <s> he asked me whether i thought there was discrimination against those who were being denied the right to buy <e> <s> i have to say that whatever one does with housing for the elderly or with housing for anyone in special need there are bound to be fewer resources than there is demand <e> <s> but the discrimination which this amendment is supposed to be remedying and which the noble earl is so concerned about is discrimination against a particular subgroup of the elderly and not the elderly as a whole <e> <s> it is the subgroup least in need <e> <s> they are least in need first because they already have accommodation which is particularly suitable for them in other words they are not living in unsuitable accommodation for example up flights of steps or without adequate facilities and secondly those who are protesting to the department i do not deny that the department has received representations are the least in need of that least in need group <e> <s> they are the ones who have the money to buy <e> <s> the role of the private sector has been referred to <e> <s> indeed why do they not buy for example the properties provided by mccarthy and stone and other builders who provide for elderly people <e>", "<cs> i shall read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not going to move amendment l <e>", "<cs> we certainly do not object in principle to the concept of performance indicators and annual reports on performance indicators though it is conspicuous that the government are better at seeking to impose them on other people than taking their own medicine and producing such reports <e>", "<cs> the critical phrases which i snatched from that reply as it rushed past me with the speed of the valkyrie was that the tenants wishes would be respected and that the consultation would include a ballot and the tenants choice would be honoured <e> <s> if the remainder of the reply lives up to those phrases it looks as though the problems that have been experienced particularly in telford and with wrekin district council may be approaching an end <e> <s> we and they would be grateful for that <e>", "<cs> this amendment returns to an issue that we discussed on monday night the question of dowries <e> <s> the government amendment states that on a tenants choice transfer the local authority can choose to pay the dowry <e> <s> i understand that the period will be for five years <e> <s> that is the instalment period proposed in the amendment <e> <s> surely the government are being forced to admit that already after a very short period six months experience the original legislation was defective <e> <s> we have discussed the question of the walterton and elgin estates in westminster <e> <s> the possible cost of the dowry here will be between million and million <e> <s> will westminster city council be given additional credit approval to fund the dowry <e> <s> moving on from that specific point is it the case that generally speaking councils which are facing dowries will be given additional credit approval for that purpose <e>", "<cs> the government will not be surprised to learn that we are very unhappy with the effect of amendment no <e> <s> c in that it would rule out the possibility of our moving amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> in his speech the minister referred to a transitional period <e> <s> it is not really a transitional period in that sense because this is retrospective legislation <e> <s> what we are concerned about is people who started their existing long leases at a low rent before the new legislation came into effect on th january this year <e> <s> i give as an example a widow aged who in buys a lease with years to run <e> <s> twenty years later she will be and it is still quite likely that she will require the property <e>", "<cs> i did not speak to amendment no <e> <s> j <e> <s> it was not part of the group and i was not proposing to move it <e> <s> however i was interested to hear the ministers reply to an amendment which has not been spoken to <e>", "<cs> that is a government amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister will forgive me <e> <s> the amendment grouped with this is no <e> <s> dd not d in other words the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord ross not a government amendment <e>", "<cs> i should be glad to expound at length on the way in which the numbers of the amendments that we have been dealing with over the past few days have been not in accordance with the somewhat convoluted but nevertheless previously perfect logic adopted by the public bill office <e> <s> we have been caused a great deal of difficulty by the numbering of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i do not object to the amendments but i think that we should have been warned that they were to be taken together <e> <s> they are not grouped <e>", "<cs> first this amendment should not be in the bill at all <e> <s> it is an education amendment which should be in an education bill <e> <s> it should not simply have been spatchcocked into the bill from the department of the environment <e> <s> secondly even if this were an education bill and were being properly discussed as such the amendment is grossly over-prescriptive <e> <s> not only for the education committee but for the sub-committees of the education committee the secretary of state will issue directions about their composition and their additional members <e> <s> that is a gross intrusion on the responsiblity of education committees <e>", "<cs> these amendments too are quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> they should not be here at all <e> <s> they probably belong in part i certainly they should be in part v of the bill and should not be introduced at this stage to be dealt with in this way <e> <s> apart from anything else there are issues relating to part v which are still outstanding in a consultation paper that we have not seen although it is still promised before the report stage <e>", "<cs> does the minister not feel that it would be wise to do what i have suggested <e> <s> since there are matters here which are still outstanding for consultation what loss could there be in withdrawing this amendment and putting it forward again at the report stage at the right place in the bill <e> <s> i appeal to the minister and the government to treat these matters properly <e> <s> they are not matters which should be dealt with at four oclock in the morning in the wrong place in a bill <e> <s> it is not courteous to the chamber and not proper parliamentary business <e>", "<cs> i should like to reciprocate the thanks that the minister has expressed to him and to all noble lords particularly my noble friends who have taken part in the work on the bill in committee <e> <s> it has been a most unsatisfactory committee stage <e> <s> the bill has been used as a dustbin for all sorts of amendments and rethinking which should not have taken place and should not have been necessary <e> <s> it has been conducted by noble lords with courtesy and restraint and i am grateful to them for that <e> <s> i also echo sincerely the thanks which the minister expressed to the staff and all concerned with helping the members of the committee in the consideration of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am familiar with supplementary questions being wide of the original question but this is the first time that i have heard a supplementary answer being wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer a specific question about the effect of the amendments <e> <s> some noble lords on these benches notably the noble lords lord irving and lord monkswell are members of local authorities <e> <s> if they were to become vice-presidents of the ama would they then be in breach of the law if the amendments were to be passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i think the noble baroness is misinterpreting what noble lords on these benches have said <e> <s> the workplace branches are part of the constitution of the labour party <e> <s> they can exist anywhere <e> <s> they exist in conservative local authorities <e> <s> where we are in agreement is that they should not meet on the premises of the local authority association <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear at the outset that since these amendments were contributions to a debate on a consultation document the time for which has yet to expire they would not be pursued to a vote <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for the detail in which he has set out his response <e> <s> indeed i am grateful for the content of some small part of it <e> <s> as regards what he said about posters i shall possibly inscribe my thanks on my elephant and leave it standing peacefully outside my house for him to see <e> <s> however i do not think he would welcome it if i left it standing peacefully outside his house <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the noble lord for his penultimate remarks <e> <s> it is vitally important that clear guidance notes should be made available as soon as possible to all the local authorities and employees of local authorities <e> <s> i quite understand the constitutional position that it would be improper to do so before another place has considered these amendments <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that the opposition in another place are not going to query the principle behind them or seek to delay the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> his explanation provides a better idea of the governments position <e> <s> however it does not satisfy me that it is right <e> <s> in talking about the monitoring officers role the minister has not paid adequate attention to the adjudicators changed role <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that response <e> <s> i am sure that the local authority associations will also be grateful for it <e> <s> it shows that the government are willing to listen to argument and that they take consultation seriously <e> <s> the noble lord rightly referred to the high court judgment of april which upset the previously understood balance between accountability and privacy <e> <s> it is right that the balance should be restored to what had generally been agreed was the right position and it is right that this bill should not seek to upset consultations and discussions which are in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for setting out so clearly this complex series of amendments to deal with a complex question one to which it is perhaps impossible to find a perfect answer <e> <s> there will always be a degree of compromise among the different elements of local government concerned and the interests of central government in the control of expenditure <e>", "<cs> it is copyright <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene before the minister sits down <e> <s> in speaking of financial loss allowance he has confused two different issues <e> <s> i was not referring to appointed members <e> <s> a number of elected members not only have jobs but have flexible jobs which allow them to have the amount of their financial loss allowance deducted from their wages and salaries <e> <s> that is not an uncommon situation <e> <s> it was made very unattractive in the s when i adopted it but i thought it was right <e> <s> i still think that a financial loss allowance combined with adequate encouragement to employers to make use of it would be a valuable part of members remuneration <e> <s> i am sorry that the government appear to have rejected that completely <e>", "<cs> my lords modified rapture <e>", "<cs> my lords i was taken comprehensively to task by the noble baroness lady stedman for inconsistency in that i felt differently months ago <e> <s> i plead guilty to that <e> <s> i approached the matter months ago with less information about the subject than i should have had and now have <e> <s> i should have known about the report of justice because my father-in-law was its secretary at the time <e> <s> he was one of the instigators of the ombudsman system in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> it seems to follow very closely the content of a debate which we had in committee <e> <s> from my time in london local government i am conscious of the increasing demands which are made on section expenditure <e> <s> with the increasing powers of local authorities it is not as if the need for a residual power for such authorities is declining indeed on the contrary as social problems increase especially those in inner urban areas which had not been anticipated in legislation and are not therefore within the specified powers of local authorities the need for this reserve capacity is even greater <e> <s> this is a modest amendment providing only transitional relief <e> <s> i would wish that it were more but it seems to be what the government indicated might be acceptable to them <e> <s> i hope that it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is calling in evidence the fact that many local authorities do not use the powers to the full however has he any evidence to show which authorities in inner urban areas which is what we were talking about do not use such powers to the full <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right in saying that the amendment looks to the future <e> <s> it only does so in a sense because we have despaired of the government doing anything other than sweeping the crumbs from the table onto the poor mans plate in the shorter term <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support and the support of these benches for the amendment <e> <s> i said earlier this evening that the range of demands on local authorities has increased is increasing and shows no sign of abating <e> <s> one of the most conspicuous of those demands is for advice in particular on individuals rights and obligations <e> <s> some of that advice is provided by voluntary organisations such as the citizens advice bureaux some of it is provided in some local authorities by the authorities own staff <e> <s> but whoever carries it out it is important that it should be officially recognised as a proper duty of local authorities and a proper use of local authority financing and that it should not be at the expense of other matters which come under section of the local government act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that response which i shall have to read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> however i suspect that in a sense he spoke against the amendment which i have been forced to put down <e> <s> he rightly complained about the bureaucracy involved in making applications to the secretary of state whereas the amendment provides that there shall be on the face of the bill a power to make application to the secretary of state <e> <s> i agree with him i would rather sweep the whole lot away <e> <s> i can give him an assurance that the next labour government will sweep the whole lot away <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is seeking to persuade the house not that justice is being seen to be done but that justice is in practice being done <e> <s> i do not doubt his good will <e> <s> i do not doubt the improvements that have been made in the consultation documents which have recently been issued <e> <s> however the fact remains that the government have been quite unable to define in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of newport answered one part of the objection to the amendment put by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls when he said that it is necessary to put these proposals on the face of the bill in order to make the position clear from the outset without waiting for regulations <e> <s> there is a further point that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls might like to consider <e> <s> regulations which give can also take away and the power of the secretary of state to shift the goal posts in the exemption of voluntary organisations from coverage under part v of the bill can work in both directions <e> <s> in my view that is an additional reason why it is necessary indeed essential to have this amendment on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little cheeky for the minister to give me an undertaking that this matter will be examined in the course of the consultation process <e> <s> the matter will be examined in the course of the consultation process whether or not the government like it <e> <s> submissions to him in response to the consultation document will make the point that i have been making <e> <s> i was drawing the attention of the house to the matter because it is something on which we need further assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has chosen to give a procedural rather than a substantive answer <e> <s> of course it is possible to argue in relation to any of these amendments which reflect the consultation document that it would be wrong for parliament to prejudge the results of the consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister knows perfectly well that that is no answer <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the government are so paranoic about local government and so determined to bind it hand and foot that even where there are organisations which have existed in some cases for many years and even where there is legislation which has been on the statute book for three years the government are not even prepared to look for let alone to report any abuses before adding another shackle to the chains which already bind local government <e> <s> in my view that was a thoroughly unworthy response from the government <e> <s> therefore i think it is only proper that i should seek the opinion of the house on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that this is another case of our having to respond very rapidly to a consultation document which ought to have been produced a long time ago <e> <s> i am interested i do not believe that i should say more than that to hear what the minister said <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what he said <e> <s> i do not believe that it is appropriate to seek to come to a conclusion on the matter now or to seek the opinion of the house on the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can help me a little more <e> <s> i appreciate what he said and i find his sympathy very helpful <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to pursue the amendment <e> <s> however he used the phrase any network of advice centres <e> <s> law centres do not normally exist as part of a network of advice centres <e> <s> law centres are set up in a certain part of a borough district or town by a local authority or by neighbourhood initiative and subsequently gain local authority support <e> <s> would the minister be willing to reconsider the use of the word network which seems to be unnecessarily restrictive for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made that difficulty for themselves in proposing a formulation that works perfectly well for citizens advice bureaux which are part of a network but does not as i have indicated work for law centres which are not necessarily part of a network <e> <s> i apologise for this interrogation at report stage but we are dealing with something that could not be raised in committee because the consultative document had not come up <e> <s> is the minister willing to think about the restriction that the use of the word network imposes on the secretary of states freedom of action <e> <s> he expressed sympathy for the proposal to exempt law centres and expressed appreciation of their work <e> <s> it would be a pity if they were to suffer because they are not part of a network <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can help us any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a purely fictitious problem <e> <s> i do not think that the question of having a national association or not is anything other than for the convenience of the secretary of state rather than of the essence of the nature of law centres <e> <s> there is an association of law centres but i do not know whether all law centres belong to it <e> <s> this is perhaps a matter about which the minister might be willing to talk to me before third reading <e> <s> the government are causing themselves difficulty which i am sure that they would not wish to do on mature reflection <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that assurance which goes a long way to meeting the point that i sought to make in moving the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes some way to meet the points that were made <e> <s> when the minister refers to gilt-edged securities and loans to and deposits with banks building societies and other recognised financial institutions he goes some way towards the definition which we are seeking <e> <s> i would have hoped that he might go further and include in approved investment loans to the authority in substitution for external borrowings loans to other local authorities that are subject to the new system and loans to other public bodies whose external finance or capital expenditure is classified as public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords let me deal first with amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> i understand the point which the minister makes about the amortisation period and i am glad to have his assurance that it is not intended that there should be any change in the system for amortisation which was amended as he has reminded us at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the minister gives me any choice <e> <s> he has not sought to defend the timetable as it has taken place up to now rd october <e> <s> he cannot possibly expect us to believe that this is going to be one of the nine times out of ten when there will be a final decision by the th december <e> <s> i think it is necessary to show the government that this is not a matter on which local authorities can continue to be led by the nose <e> <s> i think the noble baroness wishes to intervene and i will gladly give way <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a somewhat lengthy intervention <e> <s> i must remind the noble baroness and the house that we raised all these matters in committee <e> <s> we proposed a <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the minister <e> <s> there were times when he almost convinced me i shall not say that he <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that when the noble earl says deserved he means reserved <e>", "<cs> my lords we have departed to some extent from the rules of procedure at report <e> <s> although my noble friend lord dean moved only one amendment the minister has taken the opportunity to respond not only to that amendment but also to the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and a whole series of his own amendments which appear to be significant <e> <s> we shall have to read very carefully what he said because it appears that he has signalled significant changes in government policy on debt redemption and reserved amounts <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a powerful case to make and he has made it powerfully <e> <s> there will have to be some very good answers to the horrific experience that he has described in lewisham <e> <s> he approaches the matter from a slightly different point of view from mine in that his interest in this is that of the private sector collaborating with local authorities whereas mine tends to be that of local authorities collaborating with the private sector <e> <s> but from the point of view of what they are concerned with it comes to the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i found a large part of that answer only peripherally related to the thrust of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord closed by saying that his proposals would provide more <e>", "<cs> my lords with all the charity in the world that sounds to me like a half baked policy half presented <e> <s> of course we are glad to know that in principle per cent <e> <s> of the receipts from the disposal of capital assets will be available to local authorities for their own uses <e> <s> however i note that the amendments say that the secretary of state shall by regulations specify what those uses shall be <e> <s> the minister did not volunteer any indication of what the regulations might say <e> <s> perhaps he could help us on that score <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is suitably modest about the role of the treasury in the formulation of government economic policy <e> <s> he knows that economic policy is made only in part in the treasury <e> <s> it is made in part in the advisers offices of no <e> <s> downing street <e> <s> i had not noticed any adequate provision being made for the demands of sir alan walters for information from local government <e> <s> perhaps there will be an amendment at third reading to ensure that this excessive favouritism to no <e> <s> downing street is corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords the paymaster general sought to chide me for repeating arguments that had been put in committee <e> <s> i certainly cannot make the same accusation about him because when he came to the committee only two weeks ago he told it that the maximum increase would be of the order of <e> <s> it takes only two weeks for that to be disproved and for us now to hear the truth which is that the maximum increase will be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my recollection <e> <s> neither of us has it in writing <e> <s> perhaps we had better deal with it in writing between us <e> <s> i do not think that i have invented such a figure <e> <s> it may not have been the noble earl himself who mentioned it but that is certainly my recollection <e> <s> we shall find it necessary to return to this matter at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong this point but the figure has not been rebutted <e> <s> the noble earl has not said that he made any other assumption <e> <s> i have said that we shall both together or separately establish the truth of the matter <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall apologise <e> <s> i do not think that the house would expect me to do anything more in the circumstances <e> <s> the matter will come back to your lordships house on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords before i move amendment no <e> <s> e i should like to refer to a matter raised by the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> he queried something i said earlier in the bills proceedings <e> <s> i originally said that the government had argued that rent increases this year would not exceed <e> <s> in one sense i was wrong because the statement about the was mine and not his <e> <s> i said in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we are almost there but before the minister sits down i wish to ask one further question <e> <s> it is reassuring to know that they will be taken into account per cent <e> <s> is that true for every local authoriy or will some local authorities not have their residual debt subsidy taken into account per cent <e> <s> while others will have more taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> it sounds as though we have achieved our intention <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is in my name and i was responsible for putting it down <e> <s> i can only apologise i did not notice the error until we saw it this morning <e> <s> we typed national we corrected it to notional in the draft and hoped that it would also have been corrected in the printing <e> <s> i am responsible and i must apologise to the minister for the error <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply degenerated into such a list of acronyms that i did not even know that the noble earl had finished <e> <s> i apologise for the delay in rising to my feet <e> <s> i still think that he did not turn over the page <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether that helps but it is as well to have the record straight <e> <s> we shall have to read carefully what the minister said <e> <s> in order to do so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply indicates the most breathtaking arrogance on the part of government <e> <s> i do not refer to the minister personally but the government <e> <s> they have created the problem <e> <s> the government have decided that only per cent <e> <s> of capital receipts will be available to local housing authorities for the purposes for which per cent <e> <s> of receipts have been available in the past <e> <s> the change is therefore not one that is introduced by local authorities <e> <s> it is introduced only by government and by the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords a capitalised maintenance project has been within the law <e> <s> that has been legal under the provisions of the act <e> <s> the minister is now applying retrospective disapproval to something which has been legal since and which has contributed very substantially to the improved quality of our urban housing <e> <s> the distinction between capital repairs and maintenance may be an important distinction to an accountant or to the minister <e> <s> however in reality it means that there is a whole range of council houses and flats some of which are in a very bad condition about which the accountants will say that that is a genuine capital repair <e> <s> some are in less bad condition and an extended programme of maintenance is required <e> <s> it makes no difference to the tenants <e> <s> they merely want somewhere decent to live <e> <s> that has been provided out of the capitalised repair programme and that has contributed to what has been salvaged in the s from any realistic housing policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which is grouped with these two amendments although i do not really want to speak only to my amendment because i believe that it has virtually the same effect as the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord swinfen and the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i support those amendments because i support the intention behind them <e> <s> as the noble baroness said this is a rather basic obligation <e> <s> even if the number of people who would suffer from a means test is small because so many disabled people are in fact poor in our view it would be wrong to subject disabled people to a means test <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> if he were to accept my amendment no <e> <s> a he would not be placing further burdens on local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> what estimates does he and his department have of the likely take-up and cost of the mandatory grants <e> <s> he appears to be referring glibly to what are unknowable statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a shocking and cynical reply <e> <s> i am disappointed that the minister should find it possible to stand up with a straight face and put it to the house <e> <s> he is saying that grants which appear to be mandatory in other words obligatory on local authorities are not obligatory <e> <s> local authorities have three what he calls gates which enable them to juggle with the conditions of mandatory grants <e> <s> but he is encouraging them to do so for resources reasons financial reasons <e> <s> that is the effect of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will give way <e> <s> the government are asking for a lot more than <e> <s> the sum of only applies where the local authority can keep to the standard community charge not where the local authority in fact performs its obligations to its electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down let me assure him that i would wish in other circumstances to reply immediately to the direct challenge that he has put to me <e> <s> however i understand that the minister will reply to the debate before formally putting the amendment <e> <s> that will give me an opportunity to come back after he replies to the debate <e> <s> if that procedure meets with the approval of the house it would be more appropriate for me to reply then to the noble lord and also deal with other points made in debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for responding to my amendments and thereby giving me an opportunity to respond to them and to those aspects of the debate which relate to them <e> <s> they are rather wide-ranging because my amendments and the government amendments together necessitate a cold look at poll tax legislation as it is now proposed <e> <s> it is not a matter where one can say that an opposition amendment says one thing which must be considered by itself and a government amendment says another which must also be considered by itself <e> <s> if we are to act responsibly in this house we must ask how that leaves the poll tax legislation <e> <s> when i look at the legislation i find that it leaves us a very long way from the claims made about it when it was first introduced in this house on second reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know that the noble lord was going to move this amendment formally <e> <s> in the absence of any statement from him i welcome the amendment <e> <s> as far as students are concerned this concession reflects many of the matters that we have been putting forward as the poll tax legislation has been proceeding <e> <s> we believe it to be a significant change and we are grateful for it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is also welcomed and we are grateful for it <e> <s> it goes perhaps

committee date <e> <s> it has not had a reply so far as i know <e> <s> is the minister able to say whether a reply has been prepared and what the reply contains <e>", "<cs> my lords the protection on which the minister is now relying is the protection of the appeals procedure <e> <s> that was not the burden of the complaint <e> <s> the burden of the complaint is that employees of housing associations are being required to report on the family composition of their tenants <e> <s> it is none of their business and they do not think that it is any of their business to report on the family composition of their tenants <e> <s> the appeals procedure has nothing to do with it <e> <s> it is not a question of the quality of the information they provide <e> <s> it is a question of the intrusion into the personal privacy of the tenants of housing associations <e> <s> that is an unsatisfactory response <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to the previous amendment moved by the noble lord lord ross of newport the minister described amendment no <e> <s> b as putting the issue in starker terms <e> <s> it does indeed as noble lords who have already spoken to it have made clear <e> <s> my noble friend lord sefton asked what the principle could be in treating the national non-domestic rate differently from the poll tax when as we all know million from the exchequer is to be given in the form of the new transitional relief plus probably about million in transitional relief in the first year to london boroughs in respect of ilea <e> <s> altogether nearly million is to be given from the exchequer in relief for individual poll tax payers in more wealthy areas <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept the assurances of the minister that the amendment does not contain new policies <e> <s> it is not easy to verify it ourselves in the time available <e> <s> on behalf of these benches we accept the apologies that he has offered to the house for the submission of a manuscript amendment <e> <s> he is aware that it causes difficulties for us <e> <s> on the other hand since the government have spent the whole afternoon indeed much of the last four days of business introducing amendments which at the very last minute correct their earlier mistakes i do not suppose it is all that surprising <e> <s> it is the general procedure and the way in which this bill is being put forward and amended at a late stage that is unacceptable to us not the transgression for which the apology has been offered <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is so <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect the noble lord is under a misapprehension <e> <s> the amendment refers to schedule which is concerned with the english and welsh but not the scottish legislation <e> <s> subsection provides that a notice shall be served not later than st march <e> <s> in england and wales that is the year in which rates are payable and refers to the current year <e> <s> therefore it refers to a year in which rates are payable so the difficulty to which he refers in scotland does not arise <e> <s> if the amendment is agreed similar amendments must be moved for scotland <e>", "<cs> with respect we know the domestic rates for because we are paying them <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friend lord graham moved the amendment it is in my name and i owe an apology to the house <e> <s> as the noble lord lord coleraine rightly pointed out subsection of the amendment is missing from the marshalled list <e> <s> that makes the amendment hopelessly defective and without waiting for the ministers response it is better to withdraw the amendment as noble lords have not had an opportunity to see the amendment as it was drafted <e> <s> therefore it would be impossible for me to ask noble lords to take a decision on this matter <e> <s> i believe that the only right thing for me to do is to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that <e> <s> i believe that we must be careful not to trespass on the time of the house since the amendment is defective through my fault <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that both interventions have been helpful in enabling us to decide what to do to correct our mistake on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to sound ungrateful but this is only a framework <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order i should like to speak from the dispatch box as chairman of the computer sub-committee of your lordships house <e> <s> in doing so i support most strongly the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> it is minimal at the present time <e> <s> however weekly we are installing new fax machines in various offices in the palace and when even the public bill office has a machine surely the time has come for them to be recognised in local government <e> <s> i hope that it will be a beginning in the breakthrough of recognising the possiblities of modern technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the minister has repeated the arguments that he put forward in committee <e> <s> i do not believe that he has added anything new <e> <s> however there is a very valid and important point which has been raised by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth to which i wish to reply quite specifically <e> <s> she has done what nobody else has done and that is to look at the detail of paragraph of schedule to the act <e> <s> that part of the act refers not only to persons of pensionable age but also to those who are physically disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords as the person who moved the original amendment no <e> <s> b which has just been agreed to i must confirm what was said by the noble viscount lord bledisloe and my noble friend lord northfield <e> <s> the amendment which has been carried refers only to housing completed before the date of royal assent or at such later date as the secretary of state may specify <e> <s> therefore as my noble friend lord northfield says it does not apply to future dwellings built in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made the drafting change on the advice of parliamentary counsel <e> <s> however i am happy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rippon had taken great care to ensure that i would be here to move that amendment <e> <s> i take deep offence at this insult <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the scottish local authorities who were concerned about this matter will read very carefully what the noble earl has said and pending such reconsideration i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is looking into the matter will he also look into the possibilities of breaches of the principle by central government <e> <s> is he aware that in my part of north london many properties were blighted for months by the threatened parkland walk motorway which was announced merely on the results of consultants preliminary studies rather than as a result of any notification to local residents <e>", "<cs> my lords does the protection afforded by the declaration of an area as a conservation area extend to protection at christmastime from parliamentary questions about pelicans <e>", "<cs> my lords i first enter this fascinating debate by confessing a disability which is shared only by the noble lords lord crickhowell and lord bridges and no others i am not a farmer and know nothing about farming other than what i read <e> <s> however i have caught up a certain amount as a result of this excellent report <e> <s> i must congratulate the noble lord lord middleton the members of his sub-committee their specialist adviser and clerk and everybody who submitted evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does less than justice to the drafting of my amendment <e> <s> we anticipated the response that some people would be both giving factual information and representing the authoritys policy <e> <s> that is why in the amendment we refer to the principal form of contact with journalists or broadcasters <e> <s> i had hoped that that would have helped the minister to take a slightly more favourable attitude than he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sad that we have reached this point without agreement <e> <s> i do not think that the ministers reply covers the complexities of situations that are found in local authorities <e> <s> he did not refer to the example that i gave of someone who is responsible for the mayors diary for ceremonial functions or for a members services <e> <s> such people meet the qualification for political restriction because they report entirely to a chief officer the director of personnel or the chief executive <e> <s> they do not report to anyone else <e> <s> there is no one else between them <e> <s> nevertheless they are not giving advice to committees or taking part in the policy of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be grateful for the indication that the matter will be included in the consultation document and also for the assurance and reminder that powers are available to make regulations and orders giving effect to our request <e> <s> i should have wished the consultation document to include all the cases raised by the amendment <e> <s> however the fact that any are to be raised is a step forward and gives me art opportunity to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the minister listened to what i said <e> <s> i said that the government could give temporary borrowing powers to local authorities for that purpose <e> <s> in other words the local authority and community charge payers would take responsibility for it and not taxpayers as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have preferred assurances in respect of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however assurances in respect of amendment no <e> <s> are certainly most acceptable <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when a minister says that he will listen sympathetically to applications that is certainly a good basis on which one should not pursue an amendment <e> <s> if the law centres have any sense and this is a word to the wise they will seek to strengthen the rules of the law centres federation in other words they will seek to make themselves more like the national association of citizens advice bureaux than they are at present <e> <s> that may or may not be good <e> <s> i do not know enough about law centres to tell whether or not that is so <e> <s> clearly there would be no difficulty for law centres which operate in very much the same way throughout the country to do that <e> <s> therefore there seems to be a good chance on this ground as well as on other grounds for law centres to be exempted by regulation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always disarming when a minister says that he is grateful to the opposition for introducing amendments which clarify the rules <e> <s> i suppose that i am expected to smile gracefully and withdraw <e> <s> however i am bound to say that this is a failure of legislation <e> <s> the government having introduced extremely complex rules are forced to say at the end of it that they do not believe that their rules however complex will work and the secretary of state will have to introduce individual exemptions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl the paymaster general settles into his duties in the treasury he will no doubt have to deal with the finance bill if not in this house then as part of his departmental responsibilities <e> <s> he will find that the distinction that the government are now seeking to make between enhancing an asset <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> throughout his explanation of this amendment he has been using a word which is not in the dictionary <e> <s> he used it at the committee and report stages <e> <s> the word that i know is adaptation <e> <s> is it in the noble lords brief as adaption <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that i am grateful to the noble lord for that response would be an understatement <e> <s> the response of the government has been most generous <e> <s> it has reflected a view which was not only carried on a division last week but much more importantly has been a matter of decision by this house over a period of eight years <e> <s> on some occasions that has been with the agreement of the government and on some occasions it has been on divisions carried against the government but it has been a fairly consistent view <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the minister meant the word ingenious as a compliment <e> <s> nor do i think that his objections to the scheme hold water <e> <s> the changes in the rateable value in a local authority from new construction in any one year from one year to the next or even over a period of three years will not be significant <e> <s> removals do not affect it <e> <s> in order to calculate the rates that would have been paid one has only to consider the rates chargeable in the amount of money raised from those rates and how much is required to be raised from local authority taxation in the succeeding years <e> <s> one then calculates a rate figure accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords they are issues which arise because the government have been forced into recognising that the simple-minded approach which was adopted in the local government finance act will not work <e> <s> the provision is a belated and inadequate recognition of the imperfections of the local government finance act and of the poll tax proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be clear about the position <e> <s> does the expression purely on technical grounds mean purely on grounds of residential qualification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful as i am sure will be those concerned with alzheimers disease <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for these helpful drafting amendments <e> <s> they improve the amendments tabled in my name and agreed by the house on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is appropriate at the conclusion of this complex bill to attempt as briefly as possible a summary of the results of our very long considerations of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will confirm that he was merely asked to read out figures which is surely not too taxing for the intelligence of this house <e> <s> turning to the substance of the answers i note that he did not deny what my noble friend lord dean of beswick said namely that we have lost half a million public sector houses as a result of the cuts <e> <s> will he confirm that the figure of half a million houses which have been lost is as great as the number in the entire housing corporation housing association sector in total <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the thanks which have been given to the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this very important subject and indeed achieving prime time for it <e> <s> the noble lord succeeded so well in achieving prime time that i must apologise to him for being three <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no objection to the content of these amendments <e> <s> they do indeed remedy errors which were made when earlier amendments were introduced during the passage of the bill <e> <s> however we are reaching a stage where the government are rethinking a bill as it proceeds on its course and the situation has got beyond a joke <e> <s> it is bad enough for this enormous number of amendments to be introduced during the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is too modest in his own defence <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord simon was reading a version that i have and which was published last thursday <e> <s> if the minister looks at his white copy which was published today he will see that the error has already been corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take a moment to deal with the relatively minor point of the trial period before moving on to the major impact of what the minister has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will appreciate the depth of interest and concern which my noble friend lady birk has expressed <e> <s> she has been involved in the frequent debates on the issue which have taken place over the past decade <e> <s> she was involved on the first occasion on which the government were defeated on this matter in a division in your lordships house <e> <s> but she confirmed what i confirmed namely that as the minister reported in his speech it is not perfect <e> <s> there are still things which we should like to have done but we believe that we have come to a conclusion of the matter which is substantially better than that originally proposed by the government <e> <s> in those circumstances i shall not oppose the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with all noble lords who have spoken in this debate in adding my congratulations to the noble earl lord cranbrook to all his colleagues to his special adviser to his clerk and to all of those who have given evidence to him upon what is a most excellent and timely report <e> <s> unusually i allowed myself the indulgence of reading it the right way round this time in other words i started with the minutes of evidence and did not turn to the report itself until i had almost completed reading the minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the answer he gave just now to my noble friend lady nicol was in essence the same as the answer given by the noble earl lord caithness in april of this year and those given by other ministers on no fewer than six occasions over the past four years answers to the effect that no progress has been made <e> <s> if he can confirm that why is the wording in his answer slightly different <e> <s> will he not remind his officials of the strictures of sir ernest gowers against elegant variation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me to intervene <e> <s> she criticises my colleagues in another place for not having commented in detail on the bill <e> <s> neither they nor we have seen the bill <e> <s> it is not too surprising if we are silent about something that we have not seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i mean no disrespect to the noble baroness or to the importance of the subjects with which she has dealt in her speech when i say straightaway that i shall be dealing with the matters of debate in the order in which they appear on the order paper in other words i shall concentrate on the environment rather than food and agriculture which will be dealt with by my noble friend lord gallacher <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not clear whether the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter or the government are taking credit for what they appear to be claiming to be an advance <e> <s> if it is the case that there has been a reduction in the number of local government officers can the minister tell us what has been the increase in the number of pages of local government legislation passed by this government which must be enforced by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has now given two totally inadequate answers to successive questions <e> <s> does he not agree that the audit commission report refers not only to the administrative costs of the changes in housing benefit but also to the fact that housing benefit has been lost by those who find it most difficult to pay and that therefore there will be a continuing rise in rent arrears as a result of the changes in housing benefit which are nothing to do with the administration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has again repeated an answer which is straightforwardly wrong <e> <s> he says that it is up to the local authorities to deal with the cost of the arrears <e> <s> is it not the case that the local government and housing act states that because of ring fencing of the housing revenue account it is the responsibility of the good payers <e> <s> will the noble lord now take the opportunity to correct a mis-statement which he has twice made <e>", "<cs> my lords the competition for the ministerial under-statement of is still open <e> <s> the minister has made a valiant attempt to close it with the statement that a number of reforms have been made over the past years <e> <s> does he agree that all those reforms have tended to weaken local government in favour of central government <e> <s> does he agree that the reform that is required although we do not dissent from the view of the noble lord lord hooson is to give local <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord parry has done well to raise this very important subject in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> it is particularly well that it should be done in this house which is perhaps better known as the westminster branch of the country landowners association rather than the westminster branch of the agricultural section of the transport and general workers union <e> <s> the noble lord has done particularly well to draw attention in such a vivid speech to the advantages and disadvantages of decentralisation and their effect on suburban and rural communities <e> <s> he has done well to draw such a high quality of speeches though perhaps a small quantity from other noble lords <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the question of suburban and rural communities attracts so many fewer speakers to a debate in your lordships house than does the subject of museums and works of art <e> <s> i wonder whether there is any moral to be drawn from that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not usual to use the word socialism from this dispatch box although i have done so when i have felt <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the congratulations offered to the noble lord lord campbell of croy on choosing this issue for debate today <e> <s> in particular i want to concentrate on what seems to me the most important word in his motion that is the word international <e> <s> we have debated our own policies for environmental protection at some length most recently in the debate on the queens speech and we shall undoubtedly be doing so at even greater length when we come to the environmental protection bill which will presumably reach your lordships house in the summer <e> <s> however the international issues are of such gravity and have received so little detailed attention plenty of public relations attention has been given to them that the noble lord deserves the congratulations of the house on raising them <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that this house like another place spent many hours considering the economic development powers to be given to local councils in the local government and housing act will the government now announce measures to extend the resources available to them <e> <s> will the government now recognise that the role however valuable it may have been in limited areas of the urban development corporations might with advantage be taken over by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with all noble lords who have taken part in this very interesting debate in congratulating the noble and gallant lord lord carver and his noble friends for a first-class and extremely important report <e> <s> when i have to deal with select committee reports i like to read the evidence first and then look to the report <e> <s> however i must confess that a large part of the evidence and a considerable part of the report defeated me <e> <s> as a non-scientist i was not able to keep up with the language and i am afraid that in many ways i was not able to keep up with the thinking <e> <s> therefore i was particularly grateful to the noble and gallant lord lord carver for the clarity of his exposition in introducing the report <e> <s> the fact that the noble and gallant lord was able to bring together the fundamental assumptions and conclusions of the report in the clear way that he did made life much easier for me <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter is still the subject of a great deal of debate <e> <s> the noble lord is entitled to his opinion as i am to mine <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that adequacy of water requires not <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has been welcomed by every speaker who has addressed the house this evening and i do not intend to break with that <e> <s> i welcome the bill i welcome the thinking behind it and i welcome any attempt which is made to strengthen the provisions of the montreal protocol and the decisions which have been taken by this and other governments throughout the world to deal with the horrific problem of the depleting ozone layer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to his explanation of why the timetable proposed in the bill is thought to be impracticable <e> <s> can he answer the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> lady robson as to why sweden has been able to improve on it <e> <s> can the minister say what it is that the swedes have discovered apart from social democracy which makes them so much better at this issue than us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> the noble lord should have been able to answer the question because it is well known that sweden has an earlier deadline <e> <s> if the noble lord cannot answer now will he be good enough to write to me and to the noble baroness lady robson with the information that is required <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord must not keep us in suspense <e> <s> what did he do <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a remarkable and very welcome bill <e> <s> i have spent seven years in this house for too much of which i have been involved not so much in legislation as in opposing government legislation <e> <s> it would never have occurred to me although i have tabled literally hundreds of amendments to government bills that i could even approach the skill that the noble earl has shown in drafting a bill of nearly pages <e> <s> it is an astonishing achievement one on which he deserves to be congratulated professionally as well as in terms of his intentions and of the substantial achievements of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of reasons to congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of croy on having introduced this debate this afternoon <e> <s> first he is himself a distinguished former chairman of the advisory committee on pollution of the sea of which my noble friend lord callaghan of cardiff has been president <e> <s> secondly as he said it was timely that he should win the ballot for short debates only three weeks before the hague convention opens <e> <s> thirdly as a number of noble lords said the debate is timely because we have just passed the deadline for the prohibition of dumping of industrial waste in the north sea which was required by the second conference in london in <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has already been made to the important debate on that subject which was held in the house a few weeks ago <e> <s> does the minister recall that a major conflict was pointed out between his departments forecasts of the emission of greenhouse gases in the form of carbon dioxide and those implied in the department of transports forecasts of increased car ownership <e> <s> can he say whether his department is winning the battle against the department of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the thanks which have already been expressed on behalf of myself and the crowded benches behind me to the noble lord lord raglan for the very expert way in which he has introduced this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i entirely accept and would never dream of denying that planning policy guidelines are available to councils and to the general public <e> <s> however that is a different matter is it not <e> <s> from having them subjected to political debate <e> <s> for example it is different from having them presented to parliament by secretaries of state or even better being the subject of legislation <e> <s> the noble lord will agree that there have been major changes in the emphasis of these planning policy guidelines <e> <s> i should have thought this was a matter for debate in parliament <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord say when that will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister now has a third opportunity to answer the original question <e> <s> why does he not answer in regard to the inflation rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it required asking three times to get a simple straightforward reply to the simple straightforward question from my noble friend lord donoughue <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that indicates as regards the assumptions about inflation as in all matters relating to the calculation of the poll tax that the government have got the answer very badly wrong indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is referring to transitional relief and to the safety net <e> <s> will he confirm that the london borough of wandsworth which has been so praised in the tory press is obtaining per poll tax payer from the safety net whereas conspicuously poorer boroughs such as hackney brent camden and islington are contributing to the safety net <e>", "<cs> my lords even if the ministers department does not have the opportunity to do so surely the minister can read the papers <e> <s> he can find out and brief himself properly <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer the minister stated that the district auditors findings were preliminary <e> <s> will he do his best to ensure that the district auditor now produces his final report in good time for the electors of westminster to receive it before the election on rd may <e> <s> will he confirm the governments view that the remedy lies with the electors of westminster and that this is their opportunity to turn out this dishonest administration <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is again sheltering behind the pretence that the government do not intervene in the finances of local authorities <e> <s> will he not now acknowledge as my noble friend lord stallard challenged him to that it is the local government finance act and the two housing acts which have caused these vast increases in local authority rents <e> <s> it is not interference in any individual local authority which is required but interference to restore the level of government support for affordable rents <e>", "<cs> my lords in an earlier reply the minister claimed that the government do not intervene in the ring-fencing of the housing revenue account <e> <s> is it not a fact that rent arrears are not paid for by ratepayers as a whole but are paid for only by those council tenants who pay their rents on time <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble earl is not suggesting that we have had something so awful as inflation in the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the minister should have the temerity to bring forward regulations which relate to the local government finance act especially on this day when it has become clear that the people of this country do not want that legislation and that they will throw out any government who persist in its enforcement <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be a kind of wisdom on the part of the government and all members of the government to seek to withdraw as rapidly as possible from the position of supporting the local government finance act <e> <s> however the minister has put forward a reasonable case for these very minor amendments which we on this side of the house accept <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not one more example of the growing absurdity of the standard community charge <e> <s> it is now clear that it will discriminate against student nurses as compared with trainees in the armed forces <e> <s> it will also discriminate against single mature students and those in long-term stay in hospital <e> <s> can the minister name a single day during the past month when a new absurdity in the concept of the charge was not revealed <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has the petition in front of him can he confirm that it is counter-signed by the county treasurer <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a fascinating and very well informed debate <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman is to be congratulated both for having introduced it and for the way in which she introduced it <e> <s> it has been particularly fascinating to hear the balance of opinion in the house <e> <s> if one looks at the party affiliations of those noble lords who are to speak one finds that there are six conservatives nine from opposition parties and one from the cross-benches <e> <s> yet when i look at the speeches made of those speeches have been almost unequivocally antagonistic to the poll tax one if the noble lord lord colnbrook will forgive me could best be described as a dont know and the noble lords lord jenkin and lord harmar-nicholls were the only noble lords who dared to come out in support of the poll tax <e> <s> if i have misjudged the conclusion to which the noble lord lord colnbrook has come then i apologise to him <e> <s> he was certainly expressing substantial doubts in the course of his speech even if he came down on the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to look at the figures <e> <s> i was not querying the figures i was querying the basis on which the noble lord drew political conclusions from them <e> <s> they are based on a false presumption both with regard to what the government intended and even more with regard to what is happening on the balance between the poll tax and other sources of local authority expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the next government <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue which my noble friend lord dean has raised this evening is of great importance to a large number of people <e> <s> it is dispiriting that no other members of your lordships house have felt it appropriate to put their names down to speak on the issue <e> <s> it is dispiriting but not surprising <e> <s> one only has to look at the composition of the house to realise that million council tenants between and per cent of the population live in council houses are not proportionately represented in your lordships house <e> <s> there are far more lawyers and judges than council tenants here far more salmon fishers here <e> <s> i wish that the noble lord lord borthwick had still been present i believe that there are more chiefs of scottish clans than there are council tenants in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not why sensible housing authorities have a varied portfolio of property of different ages and reflect not the replacement cost of an individual property in their rent policies but rather the replacement cost and the original cost of the entire portfolio <e> <s> that is possible for local authorities but it is only possible for a very few private landlords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way again <e> <s> however i did not suggest that council tenants were paying for rebates <e> <s> we have said that they were paying for other council tenants who were in arrears <e> <s> that was the particular point that we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wish to assure him that these days we hold both poles of the banner and all the supporting strings <e>", "<cs> speak for yourself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am acutely aware of the restrictions which the conventions of the house place upon me in this position <e> <s> i am also aware that much as i would like to do so it is not permissible for me to respond in detail to the arguments which have been put by the minister <e> <s> if i were allowed i should very much like to point out to him that it is very easy once you have <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was very wise to gabble his first answer to my noble friend lord dean because he knows that it was incomprehensible <e> <s> that is evidenced by the fact that no one from his benches has sought to join in <e> <s> are there not three much simpler ways in which the government could have gone about

establishment of the national rivers authority on the grounds that he has just argued which are that to assign the functions of the secretary of state to a body which is not under his direct control

cranbrook <e> <s> however he is now saying that the amendment is objectionable because the specific functions proposed in the new clause under subsection are wider than is democratically desirable

last remarks about what he calls the peculiarly british solution <e> <s> it is indeed in many respects the peculiarly british solution that has landed us with the name of the dirty man of europe with a less effective system of pollution control than the united states has had for many years and a far less effective system of pollution control than many european countries <e> <s> it has also led us to be under continuous attack from international organisations and the european commission over the inadequacy of our response to environmental protection matters <e> <s> i acknowledge that the bill is an attempt in some limited way to deal with the problems which may be identified as going along with a peculiarly british solution but if i were the minister i should not boast about it <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge what the noble lord lord campbell says in england and wales <e> <s> the objective of the amendment and the reason that it is deliberately phrased in this way is so that there should be a co-ordinated view of environmental protection and that it should take into account later amendments will spell it out in more detail the responsibilities of the secretaries <e>", "<cs> i take it that the minister means a veritable flood of questions rather than a veritable drought <e>", "<cs> whether the government wished it or not in changing the ownership of the water and sewerage industries the

tuppence-coloured all-bells-ringing white paper to come out for the conservative party conference <e> <s> no doubt the first priority of the government at the present time is to rally and restore

attempt a textual analysis with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord crickhowell does not feel he is tarnished by my support <e> <s> the experience with the water bill last year in which we provided general control of pollution and then sought to specify that in more detail sometimes by reference to the european commission showed that was the right approach <e> <s> therefore i think the governments approach is right <e>", "<cs> i find that the most extraordinary answer and i suspect that local authorities will too <e> <s> i almost pass over although perhaps i should not that statement that the minister made in the early part of his reply in which he said in effect that environmental health officers are all very well but that they are not capable of dealing with technical matters that those matters are far too complicated for people who live in bristol aberdeen birmingham or wherever it may be and that such work can only be done by the real experts sitting in marsham street <e>", "<cs> i fear that the minister is taking an unduly narrow view not only of what the amendment intends but of what the amendment actually says <e> <s> i welcome the assurances which the minister has given that there will be a full statement before the end of july about processes in respect of which regulations have been made and are intended to be made <e> <s> that is extremely helpful since we understand that the report stage of the bill will be in october rather than in july <e> <s> that will inform your lordships debates considerably and to that extent your lordships may be sure that we shall return to this matter <e>", "<cs> i rise to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> although i regret the absence of the noble lord lord ezra i am delighted that the amendment has been moved so effectively by the noble lord lord hampton <e> <s> i wish to make two additional points to those which have already been so effectively made <e>", "<cs> members of

one of the most serious sources of the emission of pollutants in this country <e> <s> after all the bill is supposed to cover the emission of pollutants <e> <s> i do not see how we can conceivably cover the bill effectively and honourably if we do not consider the emissions from power stations as did my noble friend lord williams and others <e> <s> indeed other members of the committee have spoken of the opportunities which arise through energy conservation <e>", "<cs> my best understanding is that the figures will apply to england and wales <e> <s> the convention of scottish local authorities has not so far as i know contributed to the figures <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall certainly do what ministers say and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> it is only out of keen sense of consideration for members of the committee that i did not do what i could have done which is to spell out the obligations which exist on local authorities under part i of the bill <e> <s> i have with me a whole page of them <e> <s> i could have started by saying that under clause they have to deal with applications for authorisations by requiring relevant <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ross decides what to do with his amendment i should say that i find that reply curious as it is in two parts <e> <s> the first part claimed that it is satisfactory to have the attempt to deal with pollution before it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> i am well aware that when one comes to formulations such as batneec or bpeo one could land up with what in effect is a theological discussion <e> <s> i certainly do not want to become involved in a discussion about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin <e> <s> it may well be that in good hands batneec under certain circumstances could result in effects comparable with those of other formulations <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i was not aware of that particular formulation but it makes extremely good sense to me as i read it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing it forward <e>", "<cs> i am sufficiently satisfied by the comments of the minister that the wording is defective and that for example the use of the word estimated is undesirable to be able to say straight away that i shall not press these amendments to a division at this stage <e>", "<cs> i have no problem about the matter being presented in that way because the original amendment by the minister in a sense determines the significance of all the other amendments <e> <s> i say straightaway that i am sufficiently satisfied by the ministers answer not to want to pursue amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> he has not persuaded me at all about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it is a government

case that the department of transport legislation already adequately covers the problems which we have identified only goes part of the way towards relieving my concerns <e> <s> i made clear that i was not certain that transport legislation was adequate for the purpose <e> <s> however even if i had been certain that it was adequate for the purpose i would still think that this provision ought to be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances the word insinuated was incorrectly used by the minister <e> <s> i said nothing about the governments intention <e> <s> i said that they had not introduced the regulations and that is all i said <e> <s> it has been a long time since the bill was passed in the last session <e> <s> i am not aware that the regulations have even gone out for consultation yet <e> <s> the passage of time may reflect the detailed and sympathetic thought but it is much more likely to reflect putting the measure on to the back burner <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl has misinterpreted the definition of controlled waste <e> <s> special waste is a category of controlled waste and one to which special precautions apply <e> <s> it is not a discrete category from controlled waste <e>", "<cs> that is because in this amendment we are seeking to secure that waste which goes to a licensed disposal site is covered whatever it is and whether or not it is controlled <e> <s> we have specified that waste which is not controlled waste must be considered as controlled waste and treated as such <e> <s> to introduce the category of special waste into the amendment would be like introducing the categories industrial commercial or household controlled waste <e> <s> it would be an irrelevance <e>", "<cs> we have no complaint with the objective of the amendment <e> <s> what worries me about it is the provision whereby individual local authorities shall submit to the secretary of state details of the administrative arrangements that they make and the secretary of state shall give directions to individual local authorities <e> <s> the thought of that happening throughout the country without any general rules being set by the secretary of state as to what the administrative arrangements should be fills me with dismay <e>", "<cs> that is unfair and unreasonable <e> <s> i do not treat local authorities separately from any of the other bodies that have to deal with government <e> <s> i am simply suggesting for the sake of better administration both of central government and of local government that there should be general guidance given first so that there can be exception management in cases where something is absolutely necessary as i said as a last resort <e> <s> the minister acknowledged that to some extent in his reply <e> <s> what he has not done is to say how it is achieved by the amendment <e>", "<cs> i asked for it not to be so grouped <e> <s> i have not seen the final version of the groupings <e> <s> i apologise <e>

that reply <e> <s> i have no intention of dividing the committee on the matter <e>", "<cs> great minds do think alike but not identically <e> <s> i thought the noble lord would comment on the fact that his amendment refers to controlled waste whereas the amendment in the names of the noble lord lord layton and myself refers to waste in general <e> <s> in view of the earlier debate on that kind of waste which can be damaging for example non-agricultural waste from agricultural establishments and non-mining waste from mines and quarries and the fact that such waste is excluded will the minister give some consideration to whether or not the word controlled should appear in his amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i tried to write down what the minister has just said <e> <s> since he has a text and i do not i hope i have it right <e> <s> i am grateful to him for referring to clause c in particular <e> <s> he quoted the passage that i had quoted about treating keeping or disposing <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will forgive me <e> <s> can he say what he said after that because what followed were his own words and not those that are in the bill <e>",

activities imposed on local authorities would be covered <e> <s> i am not satisfied that they are going to be covered by the charging mechanism <e> <s> if i correctly understand the ministers reply he is not claiming that they will be covered by the charging mechanism <e> <s> he is saying that in the end the charges will have to be covered by the community charge and grant mechanism <e>", "<cs>

does not answer my questions at all <e> <s> i had very specific questions <e> <s> under what circumstances do the government believe that a waste disposal authority will let the local authority waste disposal contractors those are the ones about which i am concerned the lawds have control of its land <e> <s> why am i thinking that the natural tendency will be for the waste disposal authorities to keep control of the land and assets and simply let out a tender to labour-only subcontractors <e> <s> i did not receive an answer to that question <e>", "<cs> i shall not pursue this exchange as a dialogue in which i do not receive any answers <e> <s> this is a matter to which we may have to come back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to echo the immortal words of the noble lord lord reay in his response to an earlier amendment <e> <s> we welcome these amendments but have some doubts as to their practicality <e> <s> in order not to provoke a comment from my noble friend lady phillips i shall try to explain those doubts simply in words of one syllable <e>", "<cs> it is right that there should be intervention and that the intervention should be as widespread as possible <e> <s> the moves which the government are now making to advance on the present permissive arrangements for local and waste disposal authorities are very welcome <e>", "<cs> i fear that the minister is playing with words <e> <s> it is a question of what is a good word and what is a bad word <e> <s> what i call a subsidy he says is all right because it is only a credit <e> <s> when i say that something is market led he describes it as being the command economy <e> <s> however he goes on to describe his amendments as being prescriptive which appears to be the same as issuing commands <e> <s> if i am wrong about my interpretation of those words i stand to be corrected <e>", "<cs> it is obvious from debates on previous amendments that we are sympathetic to the ideas behind this amendment <e> <s> we believe it shows a considerable degree of ingenuity in the design of financial incentives <e> <s> i do not wish to criticise the detail of the wording especially as the noble lord lord mcnair to a considerable extent answered the criticisms already made <e>", "<cs> the government must have some mind whether closed or open <e>", "<cs> of course we are sympathetic to the idea brought forward by the british secondary metals association that there should be an exemption from the onerous obligations of regulations which necessarily apply to large numbers of categories of controlled waste <e> <s> before saying that we can support this amendment i would have to be sure that it does not go further than the noble lord lord ezra intends <e> <s> with this <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that i am reassured <e> <s> we understood that it was to be a last resort provision <e> <s> that was never in question <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand why as we have the governments assurance that the waste regulation authorities will be consulted they cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> after all it will not be a terrible burden on the secretary of state as he will use these powers very infrequently <e> <s> in this case the government could have shown a little generosity and flexibility <e> <s> the amendment cannot do any harm and it adds to the clarity of the bill by introducing those provisions which the government have made clear they intend <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord balfour does that much more quickly <e>", "<cs> my name is also attached to this amendment <e> <s> i should like to add my support for the remarks made by the noble lord lord layton <e> <s> we are not seeking to implement something new in this proposal we are seeking to apply the principle of strict liability to clause <e> <s> we are doing so in line with recommendations from the european commission which set out proposals in october to apply a common system of strict liability for waste throughout the community <e>", "<cs> i shall have to think carefully about that point <e> <s> it certainly was not our intention to weaken the legislation <e> <s> very often the concept of proceeding against the occupier has been unsuccessful <e> <s> our intention was to pin the blame on the <e>", "<cs> in other words the occupier is innocent if he did not deposit the waste or cause or knowingly permit the waste to be deposited <e> <s> on reflection i do not think that the noble lord lord renton is right <e> <s> however this gives me an opportunity to rectify my negligence in failing to answer the noble lords question earlier when he challenged me to define a producer of waste <e> <s> the european commission defines a producer of waste as someone producing the waste in the course of his occupation or activity <e> <s> that is the definition we had in mind <e> <s> however i concede that the wording we have used has not been adequately defined in that way <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord renton responds to the amendment i wish to add my support to what was said by the noble lord lord crickhowell particularly as he referred to the remarks made by my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> it is extremely important and by now extremely urgent that the governments commitment to provide at least a register of contaminated land should be honoured <e> <s> we should be given a better indication of the reason why a commitment made in another place has not yet been honoured <e> <s> since amendments have not appeared we must at the very least be given a commitment that they will appear in good time before the report stage in this house <e> <s> the reminder given by the noble lord lord crickhowell is extremely valuable <e>", "<cs> it does not come very well i suppose to stand up from this dispatch box and oppose the recognition of hardship <e> <s> however i am worried about the opening which is given by amendments nos <e> <s> j and l <e> <s> the point is that we are trying to defend all the time the polluter pays principle <e> <s> the minister has given in the example that he chose a touching case of owner-occupiers who have inherited much later pollution which is on the land they own but for which they had no responsibility at the time the pollution was caused <e>", "<cs> i do not suggest there should be no rules i suggest that the amendment should be more tightly drawn <e> <s> if that is what the government intend that may well be a geniune case and i do not dispute it the amendment should be drawn to cover only those cases where the occupier or the owner bears no causal relationship to the person who caused the pollution <e> <s> as the amendment stands the original polluter who is still the owner or occupier may plead hardship and get away with it <e> <s> that is not acceptable <e> <s> even if we do not oppose the amendments and they arc incorporated in the bill the government should at least agree to look again at the matter and try to distinguish between the innocent parties and the guilty parties <e>", "<cs> the examples that the minister gave are not the same as those that would be covered by the amendment <e> <s> the amendment does not distinguish between innocent parties and guilty parties <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> i recognise that these amendments are comparable to those that we have already discussed <e> <s> i am still puzzled by the relative timescales involved <e> <s> we are talking about a determination of confidentiality which will last four years <e> <s> the amendments propose that a determination has to be made within a period of days beginning with the date of the application <e> <s> i assume that that means calendar days not working days <e> <s> i should be glad to have that confirmed or otherwise by the noble lord on behalf of the government <e> <s> i do not know what his experience of local government is but that means that such a determination has to be made by officers <e> <s> it cannot be considered by elected members <e> <s> i am not sure that that is desirable nor am i convinced that the contrast between days for the determination and four years for the life of the determination is the right balance <e> <s> can the minister say anything on that which will help us <e>", "<cs> i find that quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> i know that it is meant well but to tell us that the government propose to put on to the face of the bill not in regulations a requirement for a determination to be made in days and then for the noble lord on behalf of the government to say that if it proves to be unworkable the secretary of state will take it back is not the way to propose legislation <e>", "<cs> that is an open invitation <e> <s> when the minister says that a substantial amendment of this kind is a drafting amendment <e> <s> i have to question him on what the drafting means <e> <s> the amendment in four different parts defines premises reasonably precisely <e> <s> does the definition include factory farming <e>", "<cs> it is very real and a real producer of waste as the minister will recognise <e> <s> we have debated this matter before <e> <s> there is such a thing as agricultural waste arising from agricultural premises <e> <s> there is a substantial possibility of very dangerous waste being exempted as agricultural waste arising from agricultural premises <e>", "<cs> i am reluctant to pursue this discussion in this way <e> <s> it arises because the minister fails to answer my question <e> <s> we should not be carrying on this duologue if i had been given a straight answer to my original question <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with the ministers answer <e> <s> it appears that the amendment has been drafted without regard to the events of the last years <e> <s> this is perhaps a matter to which we shall return at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister will not object if i describe that reply as being worthy in principle and pointing in the right direction but unsatisfactory in outcome <e> <s> he acknowledges that the material in wath is still there <e> <s> when he says that it can in principle be returned to the united states he is in fact saying that it is not being returned to the united states and that there is no genuine prospect of it being returned to the united states because of its status as a signatory and not a ratifier of the basle convention <e>", "<cs> i am not going as far as that <e> <s> i simply ask the minister to agree with me that on the face of it the requirement for sampling would be a protection which the requirement for pre-notification does not provide <e> <s> without any commitment to what any of his right honourable or honourable friends might think i ask the noble lord to agree to recommend that there should be a british government contribution to the negotiations at european basle convention and national level <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fear that there is still a substantial level of misunderstanding of the content of the amendment shown by the reply <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> that was a classic case of setting up an aunt sally in order to knock it down <e> <s> the amendment says nothing about an enormous register <e> <s> it provides that the secretary of state shall by regulation set up a registration system <e> <s> the secretary of state has the freedom to make that registration system as restricted as he wishes and in order to make it effective to concentrate as necessary on the major producers and importers and exporters of waste <e> <s> it does not invalidate the amendment to state in it that adequate resources should be provided <e> <s> of course adequate resources should be provided they should be provided for all the provisions in the bill <e> <s> it would have been neglectful of us not to make that provision in the amendment <e>", "<cs> the idea that we should proceed to the end of part iii of the bill was originally a proposition which i put to the government some four weeks ago <e> <s> it is always difficult early on to anticipate what the volume of business is likely to be on any particular day <e> <s> members of the committee will have noticed that a large part of todays business has not come from the opposition front bench <e> <s> perhaps our anticipations in that respect were not correct <e>", "<cs> when i first heard that response i thought it was over the top when i heard the noble earl quoting donne in his defence i knew it must be over the top <e>", "<cs> the ministers response was not very well directed to the nature of the amendment <e> <s> it is by no means the case that the amendment specifies a selective list of duties on a local authority which by implication excludes other duties <e> <s> all the amendment requires is that <e>", "<cs> touch <e> <s> the minister is certainly right in saying that our approach to part <e>", "<cs> no not minor <e> <s> i yield to my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> perhaps there has been a significant shift in the governments attitude on that <e> <s> our view is that if we are to have integrated pollution control we must include motor vehicles in that provision <e> <s> that is why both in part i and in part iii of the bill we have introduced appropriate amendments <e>", "<cs> i can save the government the obligation of replying <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton has made a very valid point <e> <s> i shall not wait for the governments reply <e> <s> i shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment and bring it back at a later stage in the form which has been suggested <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is disappointing that the minister has not been able to come to the chamber with amendments but i understand the point that he made about the short time available for consultation <e> <s> i accept with gratitude the offer <e>", "<cs> it is certainly true that it would be a serious step i do not deny that <e> <s> but i am not convinced that the government have shown in that reply a proper understanding of the balance between the need for proper continuity of response to those who are committing statutory nuisance <e> <s> one must pity the sinner as well as the victim and also consider the needs of those who are suffering from statutory nuisance <e>", "<cs> i was relying on the indication in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee <e> <s> if the noble earl is writing to the noble lord lord renton i should be grateful for a copy of the letter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that last comment <e> <s> i shall therefore withdraw amendment no <e> <s> b with a good deal more alacrity than i shall show in not moving amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the minister said <e> <s> i do not believe that he will have satisfied those who have the day-to-day responsibility for enforcement of this legislation <e> <s> i fear that an opportunity has been lost <e> <s> however in order to consider the matter further i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is a complex answer which deserves careful study <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for referring to the <e>", "<cs> the minister appears to have misunderstood the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> under compulsory competitive tendering a local authority must go out to tender for such of its services as are covered by the provisions of the local government act <e> <s> competition for that tender can be between private contractors and the direct service organisation acting as a tenderer in exactly the same way as the private contractors <e> <s> if the direct service organisation wins that tender as has happened in a significant number of cases its contract with the local authority is exactly on a par with that which would have existed with the private contractor <e> <s> therefore the local authority is in a position to contract with the direct service organisation and it is not required to contract with itself <e>", "<cs> what the minister has said does not make sense <e> <s> i do not care whether or not it is a contract that is the word that the government insist on using <e> <s> if there has been a competitive tendering procedure and if a local authority direct service organisation has won the competitive tender that organisation is under exactly the same performance requirements as would have been an outside contractor <e> <s> it has responded to exactly the same tendering documents as did the outside contractors <e> <s> therefore the requirements of what the minister refuses to call a contract are the same whoever wins the tender <e> <s> the difficulty of changing those requirements to meet the codes of practice laid down in the bill are exactly the same whether or not they are carried out by a direct service organisation <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that this is an area in which the definition of relevant land is extremely critical <e> <s> it is certainly not our intention in the amendment to curtail the rights of enjoyment of ones own property <e> <s> the difficulty is when those rights of enjoyment of ones own property are excessively abused to the deteriment of the environment as a whole <e> <s> the example of my noble friend lord parry is a good one <e>", "<cs> that is only part of the answer <e> <s> i do not deny that it is an offence but the problem is how it is to be cleaned up <e> <s> that is what interests the noble lord lord jenkin and the rest of us who suffer from the same problem <e>", "<cs> this may be described as a technical amendment but necessary or expedient is after all extending the power of the secretary of state to be satisfied that it is necessary to transfer the duty to prevent or minimise interference with the passage of traffic <e> <s> i realise that the phrase necessary or expedient has a long history in legislation but it would be useful to have examples of what the minister means in practice <e> <s> on what <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not answered my second question <e> <s> will adequate notice be given to authorities of any decision of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> i referred to dogs because as i said per cent <e> <s> of the nuisance in public places is caused by them <e> <s> i was using dogs as shorthand for animals as a whole <e> <s> i do not know what the government feel about it but if my first amendment is agreed to i shall be perfectly content to agree to the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord stanley and to restrict the provisions of the amendments to dogs alone <e>", "<cs> no doubt the noble viscount will introduce amendments to ensure that the curfew continues to toll the knell of parting day <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the minister <e> <s> to stand up with a straight face and make that statement about the difference between droppings from a dog and droppings by the individual in charge of the dog required some nerve <e> <s> is it not the case that dog droppings are enormously more offensive than a cigarette packet or a piece of wrapping paper dropped by an individual <e> <s> is it not the case that a dog in a public place is or ought to be in the charge of its owner <e> <s> is it not the case that though a piece of litter like a cigarette packet is offensive dog droppings are particularly offensive when they have first been dropped <e> <s> the only effective remedy is the remedy under the litter laws requiring the owner of the person in charge of the dog to clean up immediately <e>", "<cs> i have obtained two overwhelming impressions from this short discussion <e> <s> the first is that it seems to be assumed that what we are proposing is a radical extension of impositions on manufacturers of packaged goods <e> <s> i do not believe in going in for what are sometimes quite unnecessary warnings <e> <s> when i was in california earlier this year i became thoroughly fed up with the fact that every restaurant was required to display prominently a notice stating that even a glass of wine is dangerous for pregnant women or could damage the health of an unborn child <e> <s> bottles of champagne had warnings carefully plastered across their labels advising people as a health warning to hold the bottles away from them while they opened them as injuries had been caused to peoples eyes by opening bottles of champagne with the cork facing them <e> <s> that is going much too far and that kind of measure is not the intention of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very attracted by the noble earls argument <e> <s> does he ever travel on top of a bus and look down at the tops of bus shelters <e> <s> that is throwing up <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister is right <e> <s> i also hope that experience will show that the figures that he quoted for westminster are applicable to other local authority areas <e> <s> however i fear that in those other areas public support for litter control officers may not be so strong <e> <s> only time will show whether that is the case or whether as i fear the lack of enforcement powers will result in the fixed penalty notice falling into disrepute and being abandoned <e> <s> that is not an event which either of us can predict accurately <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister now acknowledge that that series of unsatisfactory answers has blown a gaping hole in the amendments which he has put down for the next day of the committee stage of the environmental protection bill <e> <s> those amendments were available in print only this morning <e> <s> how can the government propose a joint committee when they do not have the faintest idea what the staffing costs will be <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to what the noble lord the leader of the house has just said it is only fair to say that we received a draft set of groupings from the government yesterday afternoon <e> <s> it took us most of this morning to make our own revision as to what we thought was necessary <e> <s> i am also very pleased to confirm what the noble lord the leader of the house has said that there is an opportunity to

that could be easily overcome <e> <s> all you have to do is to allocate the frequencies which radio caroline presumes to use and then it will cause interference <e> <s> the law could therefore take its course according to the amendment of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i was also surprised to hear the minister refer to dumping at sea <e> <s> the controls that we rightly have over dumping at sea are controls over british citizens dumping on the high seas <e> <s> those controls are already in place under the act <e> <s> this amendment does not seek to take them away <e>", "<cs> is the minister suggesting that the home office would delay enforcement in such a case and would cause me if i were involved in the matter to lose money as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps may first welcome the noble baroness to her responsibilities on this bill <e> <s> as we have come to expect of her she has responded to the debate with lucidity and courtesy <e> <s> unfortunately that did not make her arguments any stronger <e> <s> there is a sharp contrast between the very limited mechanistic approach which is undertaken in the bill towards global environmental problems and the rhetoric which is so prevalent in the white paper <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i can deal with the issue to avoid clouding the rest of the debate because since this is report stage it is not possible to come back to the point after the government front bench has replied <e> <s> i yield to the experience of the noble lord as a former secretary of state <e> <s> the difficulty that he sees in the amendment arises as he will recognise in every single part of the bill <e> <s> the secretary of state always refers to different secretaries of state for different parts of the country and often to a plurality of secretaries of state for different purposes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish the sentence <e> <s> the rest of the clause and many clauses throughout the bill go on to prescribe the duties of inspectors to the secretary of state or the duties of local authorities to the secretary of state <e> <s> they simply take into account almost by ignoring them the fact that there will be different secretaries of state <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the difficulty is far greater for the government than for us in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i believe that he is speaking to the wrong amendment <e> <s> i have moved amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not only shaking my head i am reflecting the terms of the amendment <e> <s> it proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by dealing with the interventions by two former distinguished secretaries of state <e> <s> i have never been a secretary of state and have only run a small business so i certainly do not have their experience of government machinery <e> <s> however i suggest that they have been adequately answered by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> there is a perfectly good and effective precedent for an independent agency of the sort which we are proposing here in the example of the health and safety executive <e> <s> that is not responsible only to the secretary of state for employment although the department of employment is the lead department <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ezra said it works effectively and references can be made to it by any of the secretaries of state originally responsible for setting it up <e> <s> it reports to them as regards their own departmental responsibilities <e> <s> above all it is an effective body which ensures that a policy function exists even when it cuts across departmental boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords there could be but it is not necessary to decide that now <e> <s> the bill does not decide that now <e> <s> i cited clause which states that there will be a body of inspectors and that there will be a chief inspector for england and wales and a chief inspector for scotland <e> <s> it does not state that that means that there will be a separate inspectorate for scotland and for england and wales <e> <s> the question of what happens as between england wales scotland and northern ireland need not be decided on the face of the bill <e> <s> the government have not done so and we do not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to detain the house very long on this matter <e> <s> obviously we are aware of the meaning of the words of the amendment <e> <s> we are also aware that any secretary of state may delegate any of his functions <e> <s> to answer the noble lord lord renton we are very well aware that parliament does not lay down which particular minister in a government shall do what <e> <s> that is why we use the word may in the amendment <e> <s> in this amendment we are not attempting to overthrow the constitution or anything as grand as that <e> <s> we are simply drawing attention to the undoubted fact that the department of the environment does not of itself encompass all environmental responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very complex answer which i shall have to read carefully <e> <s> however i have a terrible feeling that i have heard it all before <e> <s> we had the same debate in committee when the answer was in broad terms that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made it entirely clear that these amendments do not cut across the governments objectives <e> <s> they do not interfere with the process of consultation which is now in force and do not interfere with the desirability of a european-wide labelling system <e>", "<cs> my lords that answer is quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> in order not to draw out the proceedings unnecessarily i shall concentrate on the issue of public information and the public registers <e> <s> the minister confidently said that no loopholes can be found in the governments provision <e> <s> i refer to the speech of the noble lord lord hesketh who was the minister during the committee stage on th june <e> <s> his answer in respect of amendment no <e> <s> was reported at cols <e> <s> to of <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a curious reply <e> <s> it did not comment on the really important issues contained in this series of amendments <e> <s> it did not comment on the important argument which is well accepted in the united states that it is important to have a series of explicit principles which may be used by companies in forming their own management policies for the protection of the environment <e> <s> there was no reference to that in the ministers reply <e> <s> the minister chose instead to look specifically at three of the items included in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> her comments on those three items i am bound to say were curious contradictory and in conflict with the grand words which appear repeatedly in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not convinced that the ministers answer meets the point raised by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> the distinction he was making was between statutory powers which the minister has quite convincingly said are available and statutory obligations <e> <s> the european commission issues directives <e> <s> the government then take steps to implement them whether by regulation if possible or by primary legislation <e> <s> in other words there is a gap between the issuing of a directive and the date of implementation by the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed recall that <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that when we debated the water bill last year we found that directives had been issued <e> <s> targets had been set and dates had been set by the european community but the government had completely failed to do anything about them <e> <s> in the european commission in a directive set the government a target of in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> i wish that the noble lord lord hesketh when he responded to a similar debate in committee had given the same kind of assurance <e> <s> at that time he said that although we were committed to tough new standards a distinction had to be made between different sizes of car <e> <s> in her reply this evening the noble baroness said something different <e> <s> she said that the same standard should apply to all sizes of car <e> <s> i find that a welcome advance <e> <s> on the basis of what she said one must hope that we have made enough progress to justify my asking leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my support to the amendment and i recognise the able way in which it has been moved <e> <s> the noble baroness lady robson was in some ways too kind to the white paper <e> <s> it is not so much that the amendment reproduces what the white paper says but rather that it reproduces what the white paper would like to appear to have said without having committed itself to anything practical <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a peculiarly unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> it was almost as though the minister had not heard the points raised by the noble lords lord stanley and lord hylton let alone anything that i had said <e> <s> in committee the noble lord lord stanley gave the minister plenty of warning about his anxiety as regards renewable energy <e> <s> he asked the specific question which he asked previously about whether grants would be available to farmers who use this form of diversification <e> <s> i believe that he deserved an answer on the spot rather than be told that he would be written to afterwards <e> <s> it was not as though it was not obvious that the question would be asked again <e>", "<cs> my lords with great reluctance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for agreeing that my amendments should be discussed with his <e> <s> i agree that to a considerable extent my amendments support his amendment which if i may say so is a neat little amendment <e> <s> it goes very well in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i am grateful to her for setting out in detail the governments position <e> <s> i think that i followed a good deal of it although i certainly cannot claim to have followed all of it <e> <s> as i understand it when we are talking about any possible conflict between subsection and subsection of clause bpeo is a fallback position <e> <s> it is what comes into play if batneec does not operate when there is emission into more than one medium <e> <s> okay so far so <e>", "<cs> my lords from the tone of that answer the secretary of state should have no fear about the proposal in the amendment that he should present a report to parliament <e> <s> it all sounds grand does it not <e> <s> i am only partly reassured because some of the evidence goes in the other direction <e> <s> much of the integrated pollution control as proposed in part i of the bill will not be introduced in april but only in april <e> <s> i accept that some specific parts will be brought in next year <e> <s> however most will be postponed until the following year <e> <s> that must be in part at least because of the lack of skilled staff to carry out the work <e>", "<cs> my lords that response is simply an assertion and no evidence whatever is produced to support it <e> <s> the arguments that the minister put forward in committee were shot down in flames <e> <s> indeed he has not sought to revive them <e> <s> he has not told us again that what we are proposing would cut across the aims of clause <e> <s> he now says that it is not appropriate or not relevant to part i in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that comprehensive reply <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord lord tordoff will be happy with the answer that he received because as i understood it he was making a relatively simple point not that national security should in any way be endangered by his amendment but that the extension of the concept of national security to deny even that such establishments existed and that people did not know about them was going too far <e> <s> that point was not answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that important statement amplifying the governments position on fit and proper persons <e> <s> she will be aware that amendment no <e> <s> a which comes later in the marshalled list sets out certain provisions that we wish to add to the legislation <e> <s> clearly we shall be dealing with that amendment considerably later this evening <e> <s> i say with some trepidation in the presence of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that it might be for the convenience of the house if the minister were to let me have a copy of that statement it is a formal statement not related to this amendment and perhaps put a copy in the library so that it will be available for more informed debate when we come to it later this evening <e> <s> perhaps i may give way to the minister so that she can respond <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> to satisfy the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that all members of the house should be treated properly i am sure that the noble baroness will wish to make the statement available in the library of the house as soon as possible <e> <s> it is important that our debates should be as well informed as they can be <e> <s> i am glad to see that the precedent which was inadvertently set sometime last year is now accepted as a helpful one <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord will forgive my intervention at this point <e> <s> i think that it would be better and lead to a fuller debate if my noble friend lady david was now to move her amendment no <e> <s> a and speak also to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> these are amendments to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if we follow that course the debate can take in both the governments new clause as proposed by amendment no <e> <s> and also the arguments contained in the amendments of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my support to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i have a local interest in the amendment too <e> <s> as the noble lord said richmond is a member of the statutory west london waste authority whereas my borough of haringey is a member of the statutory north london waste authority and finds itself in exactly the same position as richmond <e> <s> when the statutory waste authority is disbanded haringey will become both a collection and a disposal authority and will according to the terms of clause as drafted no longer be able to undertake recycling work directly <e> <s> it is true that clause states that a borough may make arrangements for a contractor to carry out the work <e> <s> however all that we know about recycling reveals that it is not very often a commercial proposition <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra is one of the leading experts in the country on this subject and i am sure he will confirm that i am right <e> <s> for a recycling scheme to work there has to be preferably active management involvement on the part of local authorities and certainly financial management on their part <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect the last part of that answer is beside the point <e> <s> of course it is true that a lawdc will be in the same position as a local authority department <e> <s> the point is that a lawdc will be in competition not with other local authority departments but with the private sector <e> <s> if the government intend there to be arms length operation whether it is fully privatised or not then the government must ensure that there is a level playing field <e> <s> they must ensure that a lawdc which is competing to carry out waste disposal work is doing so on equal terms with a potential contractor from the private sector <e> <s> that is not what is achieved by the bill as at present drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am supposed to thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i do not believe that it was intended to be helpful <e> <s> it was intended to impose a rigid procedure for compulsory competitive tendering even when the secretary of state has an opportunity to be satisfied that the existing arrangements are satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that most of the amendments are drafting or tidying amendments <e> <s> however i am a little more concerned about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the secretary of state already has fairly wide powers in schedule to issue vary revoke or substitute a direction <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> proposes that he may vary or revoke a direction at any time before the vesting date whether before or after the company has been formed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i can say that i am grateful to her for that explanation <e> <s> however phrases are being used which do not appear in the amendment <e> <s> a perfectly unexceptional example was given of two lawdcs wishing to combine <e> <s> the minister said with the consent of the lawdcs <e> <s> the amendment does not say that <e> <s> the powers in amendment no <e> <s> are much wider <e> <s> they can be used whether or not the lawdcs agree <e> <s> i do not think that the ministers gloss using the words with the consent of the lawdcs is borne out by the terms of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again at report stage but the matter is becoming less clear and not more clear <e> <s> the minister is now saying that there is an opportunity to change a direction after a scheme has been put forward by a shell company and before vesting date <e> <s> the amendment would be much more reasonable if it said that <e> <s> it does not say that <e> <s> it says that the secretary of state can revoke suspend amend or substitute the direction at any time for any reason not in response to a transfer scheme put forward <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister but i am interested in that proposal for constitutional reform from the government front bench <e> <s> is it now intended that the term of office of members of the house shall not be for life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i tabled this amendment but not for the reasons put forward by the noble lord lord renton because the amendment does not seek to do what he says <e> <s> we are not insisting that something should be well done <e> <s> we are merely saying that there should be consultation <e> <s> i am sorry that i tabled the amendment because we have moved backwards <e> <s> an assurance given by the noble lord on the government front bench in committee has now been withdrawn with apologies to the house <e> <s> i took the government at their word <e> <s> i thought they meant that the normal principles of administrative law would require consultation with authorities in all cases <e> <s> i am still not sure that that is not the case <e> <s> i should have thought that a local authority would have a good case for judicial review if it found that a direction of this kind had been taken without consultation <e> <s> local authorities themselves have often had their decisions overruled on the grounds not just that consultation had not taken place but that it was inadequate <e>", "<cs> i said full of fine words not very good <e> <s> there is a great difference between fine words with no action and indications of action <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had been searching for a test case of the conflict between the fine words of the white paper the public presentation of so-called green policy by the government and the reality of what the government propose to do about it i could not have chosen a better example than this one <e>", "<cs> my lords that is even better <e> <s> do not do anything just examine the potential <e> <s> we have before us an opportunity not to examine the potential but to do something about it <e> <s> we have a proposal for waste disposal licences for site operators <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord on the front bench saying that that is the end of the cycle of waste <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of newport is right to draw attention to the analogy with planning applications <e> <s> it is common experience that local planning authorities do not deal with planning applications in the specified time <e> <s> indeed the department of the environment has for many years kept statistics of the proportion of planning applications that are dealt with within the specified time <e>", "<cs> my lords those are complex answers and they need careful consideration <e> <s> first i respond to the noble lord lord jenkin who raised significant and important issues particularly about insurance <e> <s> he rightly referred to the european parliaments directive on civil liability issued in june of this year <e> <s> it stated that producers must obtain compulsory insurance <e> <s> however the noble lord did not mention its proposal that there should be a european fund for compensation for damage caused by waste <e> <s> in other words the european parliament took the view and i believe that it is right that the insurance industry was not keen on such a risk and would rather not be troubled with it <e> <s> if we accept the view of the insurance industry and do not make separate provision in the form of a fund we should be at serious risk of running away from the principle to which we are supposed to adhere that is that the polluter pays <e> <s> the polluter only pays if he can be forced to pay and if he continues to have the ability to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose the noble earl must say that <e> <s> no one from the government front bench can stand without making the patently incredible claim that the governments rate support grant settlement as i insist on calling it is adequate and takes into account all relevant considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords agreement to accept my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all i can say on his response to the other amendments is that the complexity of the subject has defeated him nearly as much as it has defeated me <e> <s> i do not think that even the noble earl lord balfour would care to speak in the pulpit on this subject with any confidence that his congregation would understand what he was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that the noble earl lord balfour was intending to speak also to a number of other amendments which are grouped together notably amendments nos <e> <s> a which is his own to and <e> <s> i have agreed to a request that my amendment no <e> <s> a should be included in the group <e>", "<cs> my lords that was my understanding too <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl lord balfour wishes to speak to his amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i will gladly speak to amendment no <e> <s> a if that will benefit the debate but the noble earl lord balfour has not yet spoken to his amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> clearly he will be doing so later and that creates some difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords on that basis i apologise <e> <s> i am happy to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a although it is on a slightly different subject <e> <s> we are concerned here with the labelling of products derived from recycled waste <e> <s> the amendment says that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves her own amendments can she help me on one small point <e> <s> i do not expect to receive an answer immediately <e> <s> i understand that the department has been carrying out a survey on the level of rebates <e>", "<cs> my lords one must not be ungrateful for what is clearly a well-intended amendment which aims to reflect the spirit of the amendment moved in committee <e> <s> however it appears to us to be a little restricted <e> <s> it allows for consideration of modifications <e> <s> but if one is modifying a waste disposal plan there may be various ways of modifying it some of which may be better than the first one that occurs <e> <s> surely there ought to be the possibility of considering alternatives to the modification proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the assurance that the government is in agreement with the spirit of these two amendments <e> <s> however to my embarrassment i realise that i did not complete my argument <e> <s> i talked about different ways of calculating the savings from recycling and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a to f inclusive <e> <s> all of the amendments are concerned with the public registers which are to be kept by waste regulation authorities <e> <s> they add to the list of items which are to be included in the public registers <e> <s> the amendments are self-explanatory <e> <s> i do not know whether it is the wish of the house that i should argue them at length possibly not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i express my gratitude to him for drawing attention to the amendment which i should have spoken to and not moved namely amendment no <e> <s> g which is comparable to an amendment which we had in part i and which increases the time available <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do that in a minute <e> <s> i recognise that point as well <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> g extends to days the period available for a determination of whether an item should be excluded from the register on grounds of commercial confidentiality <e> <s> i follow the point that the noble earl made that this is consistent with other provisions in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is given to mere mortals to intervene in the grand order of things as described by the noble earl <e> <s> however i wish to comment on amendment no <e> <s> over which he passed relatively quickly perhaps it is not quite so grand <e> <s> its implication is that the secretary of state has the power to set such dates as he wishes in introducing compulsory competitive tendering for waste disposal <e> <s> we understand that he will use the power only when there is a reluctance on the part of waste disposal authorities to achieve the creation of lawdcs <e> <s> it is an open-ended power as the amendment is drafted which in effect extends the operation of the act <e> <s> i am far from convinced that it is right to extend that act under cover of what is only a minor amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to put one or two questions to him <e> <s> first can he be more precise about the timetable for the european community regulations to which he referred <e> <s> secondly if as he says the government are pressing the community for the sample to be produced by the waste producer rather than by the regulatory authority does that not mean that the waste producer will have to be inspected in producing that sample in order to ensure that it is an honest sample <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to know that i find both those answers unsatisfactory <e> <s> he cannot do anything about the timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is all very well in a situation where the exporting producer is a member of the european community <e> <s> however what happens when that is not the case <e> <s> will the same provision apply if the waste comes from zaire bangladesh or venezuela <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot continue to ask questions because this is report stage <e> <s> however i do not believe that the european community has the power to enforce these regulations if they are supposed to apply to zaire bangladesh venezuela cuba or wherever else it may be <e> <s> i am not satisfied with the answers which have been given and if it were not for the late hour i should certainly seek the opinion of the house on the matter <e> <s> it is an issue to which i may return on third reading <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says in her reply that it is too late in the progress of the bill to consider major changes <e> <s> does she not recognise that the welcome point which was made from the government front bench that the staff of the joint committee would be indicates that the noble lord lord buxton is approximately right in his calculation <e> <s> what amount is being negotiated for public expenditure in the next round for the continuing costs of the reorganisation <e> <s> if the secretary of state intends to ask for these extra costs does that not mean that he will have a hard time in the star chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords we all agree that co-operation is essential both in designating and in operating a marine nature reserve <e> <s> however is it necessary to have per cent <e> <s> agreement for each reserve as i understand was the case at skomer <e> <s> the requirement to seek consensus before acting has never been evident in any other part of the governments policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with all noble lords who have paid tribute to the work of the noble earl lord cranbrook and his colleagues in producing this excellent report <e> <s> indeed only somebody of his international distinction in this subject could possibly have dared to chair such a well-informed committee <e> <s> i tremble at the task of seeking to wind up from this despatch box after so many speeches from noble lords who have not only been eloquent but are clearly enormously better informed about the subject than i can ever be <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister in all these replies reveal a blinkered view of what planning is <e> <s> it is not simply a matter of land use <e> <s> as other noble lords have said it is a matter of traffic and transport and everybody knows that traffic and transport are in chaos in london <e> <s> it is also a matter of homelessness and housing and everybody knows that there are different standards some of them very low in different parts of london <e> <s> it is in addition a matter which concerns the social structure of our city <e> <s> all those considerations are missing from the present arrangements <e> <s> that is why the city is going downhill <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is extremely confident that there is wide understanding of the phrase a statutory nuisance <e> <s> i have no doubt that there is wide understanding among environmental health officers perhaps even among magistrates and certainly among parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> however if the minister went out into the street and asked the first people she met or even took a proper sample of the general public in this country what was meant by the phrase a statutory nuisance she would receive confused and confusing replies <e>", "<cs> my lords having put down a mixed bag of amendments i suppose i must expect a mixed bag of answers which is what it was <e> <s> i listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord jenkin said about straw and stubble burning <e> <s> as he has been told that is dealt with by clause <e> <s> it was not intended to be covered by the amendment <e> <s> i sympathise with him and those who complain <e> <s> i am not reassured by the existence of a code of practice as he described its effect <e> <s> i am not convinced i may have misinterpreted the answer that the minister is right when she says that penalties exist for breaches of the code of practice <e> <s> there are no legal penalties for breaches of the code of practice unless i am much mistaken <e> <s> there is likely to be two further years of the kind of difficulty described by the noble lord lord jenkin <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that we welcome the amendment and i am grateful to the noble earl for moving it <e> <s> it places a new duty upon local authorities because it means that it is more difficult for them to plead shortage of resources as a reason for not investigating a nuisance <e> <s> the question must and will arise as the grant timetable winds its way through the parliamentary year as to how local authorities will have the resources to do the work <e> <s> it is a welcome measure but it is pointless unless the local authorities have the resources <e>", "<cs> my lords let me at once acknowledge the truth of what the minister has just said that in general the bill reduces the immunity on crown property and the armed services <e> <s> in so far as the immunity of the armed services from prosecution is part of a general policy as with hospital kitchens for example we welcome it and we think that it goes in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> i wonder whether the ministerial car which the minister uses is completely insulated from the outside world or whether he ever leaves his car <e> <s> i wonder whether he has been on the streets at any rate of london in recent years <e> <s> it is obvious that enormous numbers of vehicles are breaking the construction and use regulations and emitting smoke and noise which are of a quantity that breaks the law <e> <s> no one is saying that the construction <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed that in his reply the minister did not even seek to answer the questions which arose about the enforceability of the different standards <e> <s> certainly i understand with regret that the government are determined to have different standards for different forms of pollution <e> <s> that is why we did not bring back at report stage the same amendments that we moved in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i withdraw the word crude <e> <s> the noble earl may have used the word unsophisticated or something of that kind <e> <s> he said something to that effect which indicated to me that this was not as powerful a weapon as it ought to be <e> <s> as i said clearly we shall not make progress <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a strange answer <e> <s> in committee the minister said that it was clearly desirable that there should be a power to remove equipment and that it was simply a question of drafting as to whether equipment was included in the word articles <e> <s> he now says that it is undesirable <e> <s> he has still not made it clear whether the word articles can be interpreted to include equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment does not refer to all the equipment <e> <s> the noble earl has still not answered his own question <e> <s> it is a matter of doubt as to whether the word articles can be construed to include equipment not the whole of an item of equipment but such amount of equipment as is necessary to prove a case at law <e> <s> we still do not have an answer to that question <e> <s> i do not know whether an answer is about to arrive now <e> <s> can the word articles be construed to include equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords why did not the minister say so and save us all that trouble <e> <s> he asked himself the question more than three months ago and should have been prepared to answer it <e> <s> i am pleased to have an answer but i am not pleased with the answer <e> <s> the answer appears to be that because the government are wilfully misinterpreting my amendment to suggest that it means all of any item of equipment equipment should therefore be excluded from this part of the bill <e> <s> it may well be this is the only reason i am not seeking to divide the house on the matter that we should seek to amend the bill in more than one place <e> <s> the answer and the process that i have had to go through to drag an answer out of the government are totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for speaking to all those amendments so clearly <e> <s> i shall restate briefly it is important that it should be on record the two cases being put forward <e> <s> as we understood it the situation at committee stage was that under the public health act it was possible for tenants who could claim that the condition of their property was such as to create a statutory nuisance to go to the courts without giving notice <e> <s> if their case was proved they could receive the costs for that court action <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to read carefully what the minister said but i reaffirm that with the exception of these minor amendments to which on reflection i do not think i am entitled to be responding because amendment no <e> <s> has not yet been moved we are at one on the thrust of most of the government amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tabled amendments to amendment no <e> <s> perhaps it would be better if we took the earlier amendments first <e> <s> at the risk of tedium perhaps we should take them one by one <e>", "<cs> my lords no i did not mean million in addition to the million already provided <e> <s> i meant million in addition to the existing costs <e> <s> that refers only to metropolitan districts because the costs in shire counties and districts will be on top of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that there is so perhaps i may first deal with the statistical side <e> <s> the noble baroness is in error in believing that only half of the authorities responded <e> <s> thirty-five were able to supply information <e> <s> more local authorities were asked but the estimated additional cost of meeting the code standards for / totals million for the authorities able to supply the information <e> <s> we reach the figure of million and per cent <e> <s> by taking the means and grossing it up to the number of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> therefore it would be wrong to assume that that is only a little more than the million already provided <e> <s> as i said in my intervention my figures apply only to metropolitan authorities and not to shire counties and districts <e> <s> the cost will be substantially more than the million provided <e> <s> i also wish to recognise the point that the proposals for the litre bins and their spacing were put forward by my noble friends organisation tidy britain <e> <s> in many ways i am relieved to learn that they have not been adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that but i had hoped that the minister would say that the evidence for such a review will be collected afresh each year <e> <s> however i shall not abuse the procedures of the house by seeking to pursue the matter with her now <e> <s> on the basis of my understanding of what she said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the noble lord lord stanley of alderley is one up on the minister in terms of numbers of children and dogs <e> <s> his opinions should have the weight of seven as against the weight of five <e> <s> i am sorry that we have gone back to an issue which is wrong and which i believed had been cleared up in committee <e> <s> no one denies that local authorities have the power and duty to clean up dog mess from the streets <e> <s> that is not the point at issue <e> <s> everyone knows that local authorities are supposed to keep their streets and pavements clean although it is much more difficult to keep playing fields and parks clear of dog shit but that is not the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble earl is speaking to my amendment no <e> <s> a and the other amendments in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord attends conservative party conferences <e> <s> however if he attended labour party conferences he would discover a long line of people distributing leaflets which are thrust into the hands of unsuspecting or perhaps suspecting delegates <e> <s> i certainly fall into the category of a suspecting delegate and i object as much to green leaflets as to trotskyist leaflets <e> <s> both constitute litter in my opinion <e> <s> i would rather not be given them and i hope that the bill will make such leaflets the responsibility of the distributor rather than of the recipient <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we strongly support the amendment which seems to have overcome all of the rational difficulties which were suggested against it at committee stage <e> <s> although it may seem a very minor matter as the noble lord lord stanley said it represents a health risk and is something that could so easily be put right and should be put right <e> <s> there is experience i believe in south australia of the proposed measure having been made to work effectively and there is no reason why we should not introduce it here and now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that very complex reply and for the assurance that there will be consultation <e> <s> i am sure that the local authority associations will also greet that assurance warmly <e> <s> the fundamental point that we have to secure is that the consultation will produce a formula which will deal with the most difficult case that will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i shall not get any further than that at report stage <e> <s> however the point has been made <e> <s> there will be risk of a very expensive and unsatisfactory renegotiation procedure which nobody wants neither the local authority on one side nor the contractor or dso on the other or of some relaxation of the rules <e> <s> neither is perfect but the second is a good deal less imperfect than the first <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord is not suggesting that co-op supermarket trolleys become litter is he <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would permit me to say this <e> <s> he has already spoken for minutes on this amendment in an earlier group <e> <s> is he going to speak for another minutes on the same amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an abuse of the procedure of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there will be widespread support for the proposal made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford who has enormous experience in these matters <e> <s> there should be a survey into the relationship between supply and demand is she also aware of the pleasure that will be given by the news about the survey which the nra has just started <e> <s> does the minister not also agree that the prospects of the results of such a survey being implemented effectively must have been diminished by the fact that the water companies have now been privatised and that they are under less direct control <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one of those who agreed that this statement should be made <e> <s> however i confess that a statement which lasts eight minutes puts us in a totally impossible position <e> <s> all the way through the passage of the bill we have asked that we should be given adequate information <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish the house or the noble baroness to misunderstand me <e> <s> i said that of course she personally has been as helpful as she could <e> <s> however if we take the position of the government as a whole they have had since june to make up their minds about these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords no we finished the committee stage in june <e> <s> it is not good enough for a statement of this kind to be prepared on the morning of the debate after all opportunity for amendments has passed <e>", "<cs> my lords things have now got completely out of hand <e> <s> i asked for help and the noble baroness was courteous enough to give me help <e> <s> i asked for the information from the government which had been promised in committee and which would enable us to table serious and responsible amendments on the resources for nature conservation in this country and indeed all the countries concerned <e> <s> that information ought to have been available in good time for this house to consider it and for noble lords to be able to table amendments for this stage of the bill <e> <s> however the information was not available and we are now told that it was hastily put together this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that at the insistence of the noble lord the chief whip we are debating amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> surely the best thing to do is to get that amendment agreed to and then to adjourn during pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure and that consideration on report should not be resumed before pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree to that on the explicit assurance that the text of the statement of the noble baroness is now available to us <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure and that further consideration on report be resumed at oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i say that the matters which were considered immediately before the adjournment affect a very large number of amendments for debate this afternoon but in particular my amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore noble lords will wish to know that we on these benches propose to make clear our position and our mounting dissatisfaction with the way in which the government are proceeding in respect of the debate on amendment no <e> <s> and associated amendments <e> <s> i do not dissent from amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not made intemperate attacks upon the government front bench <e> <s> i have defended the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> i have not accused her of any discourtesy <e> <s> i have attacked the government <e> <s> that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> i believe that when she reads the record she will find that i did not refer to a disgraceful lack of concern for environmental issues by her department <e> <s> i was criticising the conduct of the bill <e> <s> i was not criticising the departments general concern for environmental issues <e> <s> it would never cross my mind to do such a thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkin is certainly right about one thing which is that the noble baroness is capable of taking care of herself <e> <s> she has indeed taken care of herself <e> <s> i should make it clear from the outset that i have not criticised the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that i have never criticised individual members of the government during my period in the house <e> <s> i always seek to criticise the government and to attack the government when i think that they are wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to intervene because the amendment has already been adequately debated <e> <s> however i wish to raise the question of whether we should continue through the normal dinner hour <e> <s> i do not recall the chief whip suggesting that we should stop for dinner <e> <s> i raise the matter on the floor of the house in case any noble lords might find that particularly inconvenient <e> <s> i should be content to continue without a break <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as possible i shall also follow that example by not repeating the arguments so ably put by the noble lord lord norrie <e> <s> however i must intervene because of what has been said by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i hesitate long before saying this but he has misinterpreted the group of amendments <e> <s> he seems to think that to introduce the word countryside into the bill as the amendments do would be to duplicate the work of the countryside commission <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is too courteous <e> <s> she was treated scurvily at the end of july <e> <s> she asked a question and was assured by ministers that there would be a satisfactory answer and on that basis she did not pursue the matter <e> <s> however she then found that the refusal of this government to implement their own manifesto policy from was being continued <e> <s> it was a most unsatisfactory little episode and the government now have an opportunity to put matters right and to do what ought to have been done in response to my noble friends persistent but always courteous reminders about their duty <e>", "<cs> my lords when we are dealing with amendments that have been spoken to it would be helpful to those of us who are trying to keep up with the business if the minister would say when she introduces such amendments with which previous amendment they had been discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord slid over that one very neatly <e> <s> however what he did not say was that the ambiguity in the drafting arose from the governments own amendments which were put forward in committee <e> <s> in other words the government are now at almost the very last moment discovering errors in the drafting of their own amendments <e> <s> in my view that is pretty poor <e> <s> in fact i wonder whether the government have got it right even now <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has every confidence <e> <s> i suppose that at this time of night i cannot pursue the matter <e> <s> i still believe that it would have been better to have ensured that that power and obligation was placed upon the country councils and the jncc but i clearly have not succeeded with that argument <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may inadvertently have said what she did not mean <e> <s> there is no dispute between the noble and gallant lord and us <e> <s> the dispute is between the noble and gallant lord us and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i have seldom heard a short answer which contained so many misconceptions about not only the purpose but the nature and wording of the amendments which are before the house <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and gallant lord lord carver for pointing out the modest nature of my amendments nos <e> <s> and and for saying that in his view they could well have gone further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to intervene but surely the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord norrie is about establishing criteria and giving advice <e> <s> they are not executive functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i like what the noble lord said about adjacent land as i am sure did the <e> <s> noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> however being of a congenitally suspicious turn of mind i like much less the removal of the term national interest <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords much as i respect the noble earl that does not justify it <e> <s> the government should have a reason for doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the governments response to this amendment has confirmed our worst fears <e> <s> i gave a figure of million initially and million a year as being the department of the environments original estimates that were available to us <e> <s> we are now told that the initial cost will be million and the ongoing cost million per year <e> <s> if the departments estimates can vary so wildly and in the wrong direction what evidence is there that it has been working the figures out correctly in the first place <e> <s> i rather doubt that it has <e>", "<cs> my lords even if that is the case and the figures i gave did not include scotland which i did not appreciate and i am grateful for that information it still does not explain a doubling of the cost of setting up the registers and a tripling of the cost of maintaining them on an ongoing basis <e> <s> scotland has after all only per cent <e> <s> of the population of the country although it has a rather higher proportion of the land area <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord jenkin of roding for his suggestion which is entirely sensible and in line with what i was about to say <e> <s> thanks to the noble lord we have made some progress <e> <s> we now learn that the study will not simply be a paper study but will also include provision for investigation <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord that we would not want to investigate physically every single site of contaminated land <e> <s> a s the noble lord said the cost would be grossly excessive <e> <s> in many cases the contamination will be straightforward <e> <s> however we have to provide for a significant amount of more detailed study <e> <s> if that is the direction the government are moving in i am pleased to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting point of view which may not find universal acceptance in the property industry <e> <s> it certainly is not the view which the government took as i understood the ministers reply <e> <s> in all other cases local authority searches after payment of a fee have been undertaken by local authorities <e> <s> i am interested in the noble lords suggestion but it is not reflected in other parts of planning law or local authority duties and responsibilities <e> <s> we have heard an interesting range of replies in response to this amendment <e> <s> i must go away and think about them but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware and the association is aware that it could apply for continued funding under the special grants programme <e> <s> indeed i believe that it is already preparing its application <e> <s> it will of course be disappointed in the answer that has been given but i am sure that in preparing its application for further funding it will be able to use the noble lords reply to make it clear that there is no other way than the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that during the passage of the poll tax bill last year the governments official estimate was that the cost of collection would be roughly twice that of the rating system <e> <s> will she tell us what the up-to-date figures are <e> <s> does she agree that the cost of collection is a major criterion for deciding whether the system is working <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not an answer to my question <e> <s> the question was what is now the official estimate of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intrude upon my noble friends question <e> <s> is not the department putting forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble baroness for the very comprehensive way in which she has responded not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not deny that the noble baroness talks to more individuals in scotland than i do <e> <s> that does not justify her claim to speak for the people of scotland as a whole which is what she did last week and has done again today <e> <s> the fact is that however many people she may have spoken to individually and however conscientious she may be in doing so the bodies concerned with nature conservation in scotland have been almost unanimously opposed to these measures <e> <s> to me that is more convincing evidence than that produced by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to this amendment which bears my name as well as that of the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my support to the amendment to which i have been pleased to put my name <e> <s> perhaps i may make it clear that in this matter as in so many others we are concerned that all landlords should behave responsibly to their tenants <e> <s> that includes both public and private sector landlords <e> <s> if frequently in this house i represent the views of local authorities and local authority associations let it not be thought that i support the views of those local authorities which fall down on their responsibilities to provide decent conditions in public sector housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intervene in the debate on report and those who remember the length of the debate on the amendment will understand why <e> <s> i merely intervene now to say that at school i was taught prcis and comprehension <e> <s> it seems to me that my noble friends amendment is a prime example of the virtues of prcis in order to achieve comprehensibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that in that response the minister has pursued government obduracy almost to a theological point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear what the minister has just said in her closing remarks although i am bound to say that i do not find it consistent with the governments insistence that the register of contaminated land should be dealt with purely by what i believe are called desk sources rather than by providing a facility for investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin with the courtesies which have been so ably expressed by the minister already <e> <s> to start with her she has had the extraordinarily difficult task of taking over a complex bill at report and third reading stages although she was fully occupied on government business when the bill was in committee <e> <s> she could hardly have been expected to take an active part or active interest in it <e> <s> however she has done brilliantly i must tell the house <e> <s> not only has she mastered her brief but she has shown the house that she cares about the issues <e> <s> she has demonstrated great flexibility in listening to and understanding the points made by noble lords from all sides of the house even if she has sometimes gone back to the department and found there was nothing she could justifiably do <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately acknowledge that the commons disagreed to the amendments giving their reason as public expenditure <e> <s> it is therefore entirely inappropriate for us to seek to overturn the view that the other place took <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene when the noble and learned lord clearly feels very strongly on the matter <e> <s> i shall not in any way go over the ground of the argument except to say that i think his anecdote goes against his own case <e> <s> i say that because if the dog had been registered the owner could have been found and the problem would have been solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the noble and learned lord examines the impact of what he is saying he will find that he is puzzling <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me if i do not respond to the particular points that he has been making about transport and instead revert to the subjects for debate this afternoon as they appear on the order paper <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill will be responding on the transport side at the conclusion of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be more cynical than the noble lord but i rather think that the reverse is the case <e> <s> i think that they are there to hold their corner and to make sure that they are not outnumbered or outranked in any cabinet committee <e> <s> i could be wrong and it might be that with different people there could be different results <e> <s> but i do not think so <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that the compliance complaints about tower <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there are matters which will go before an election court and the truth or otherwise of the noble lords observations will be seen in court <e> <s> neither he nor i will have any influence upon them <e> <s> that is perhaps the best conclusion of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that because i do not believe it <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend will be back <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has told the house that the increase in the uniform business rate will be in line with inflation <e> <s> can she now tell us why the figure for inflation for the ubr is so much higher than the figure for inflation allowed in local authority expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but that answer is still not clear <e> <s> is the minister saying that the standard spending assessments for local authorities are being increased by per cent <e> <s> in line with the inflationary increase in the unified business rate <e> <s> if not what is the figure <e> <s> if the figure is different why is there a difference <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be wise to listen to what people have to say to consider it and to contemplate what might be done <e> <s> does she agree that we have to continue to do our utmost to make the community charge fairer and more acceptable in the eyes of those who have to pay it <e> <s> does she agree with the statement i have made it quite clear that there will be a fundamental review <e> <s> finally would she care to go for the jackpot and tell the house which of those statements was made by which of the men in grey suits <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for the lucid way in which she expounded the major provisions of the bill <e> <s> it has been widely greeted as an uncontroversial bill <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that it is as remarkable for what it does not include as for what it does <e> <s> that which it does not include takes two forms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> however before she moves to her peroration i appreciate that she has been very fair in dealing with as many points as she can a number of noble lords including myself raised the issue of unilateral undertakings as opposed to section agreements <e> <s> it would be helpful if she could give the governments response to those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not recall that when the poll tax legislation was going through parliament the government undertook that social security benefits would be uprated to cover the per cent <e> <s> of poll tax which disabled and other people on benefits have to pay <e> <s> is it not now the case that a single person has to pay extra a year and a couple extra a year amounts not covered by uprating in social security benefits <e> <s> does that not apply with even greater force to those who are disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for her exposition of these two regulations <e> <s> they are not enormously complicated <e> <s> the issue behind them is still considerably controversial <e> <s> it is no secret that when fees for planning applications were first introduced in we on these benches were not in favour of them <e> <s> however a great many things have changed since then notably the squeeze on local authority expenditure and the introduction of the poll tax <e> <s> in the light of the experience of government control of local authority finances because that is the word we must use over the past eight or nine years our opposition to fees has diminished to the point of being eliminated <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that is a bit rich <e> <s> one of the reasons why there will be fewer applications for planning permission is that the total costs of construction are greater <e> <s> those costs include even though to a small extent the costs of planning applications <e> <s> the minister cannot get away with a policy of divide and rule concerning the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am marginally puzzled by this matter <e> <s> the increase proposed in scotland is less than that proposed in <e>"]
