["<cs> my lords i crave your indulgence and your lordships patience this evening on this the first occasion that i have had the opportunity to address this house <e> <s> i say patience because i suspect that some of your lordships may have reached that position of political development so well described by the late lord boothby when he said that he had reached the point in his political career in which the only speeches to which he could listen were his own <e> <s> i ask your lordships to be patient while i listen to myself <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble earl lord bessborough in this debate but i hope that he will forgive me if i do not discuss libraries of which i am singularly ignorant <e> <s> i agree with almost every word spoken by my noble friend lord hutchinson in his measured attack on the governments policy toward the arts which fills me with incomprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first declare an interest <e> <s> since july i have been chairman of an independent production company the national video corporation which produces television and videogrammes of opera and ballet <e> <s> secondly i must join with others in thanking the noble lord lord annan for giving us an opportunity to debate the peacock report <e> <s> it is a document which deserves the serious consideration which it has received by members of this house today and should not be dismissed in the rather cavalier way shown in some quarters on publication <e> <s> it provides a most interesting agenda for consideration and one from which we can and should benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord looks at this historically he will find that different director-generals took different attitudes to the role of the board of management <e> <s> haley saw it as a cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all join in thanking the noble and learned lord lord scarman for giving us the opportunity today to discuss problems of our inner city areas <e> <s> i join him in congratulating the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury on the magisterial report which his commission produced <e> <s> i hope that all of us will not merely read but also act upon it in so far as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord greatly but i thought that the implication was nonetheless that in some sense this was related to the problems of our inner cities <e> <s> i can only say that if that was the case it seems to be misguided <e> <s> the shanty towns in france must be seen to be believed and the inner city problems of naples are unspeakable just to mention one or two places <e> <s> it was curious that in talking about the consequences of local authority ownership of housing and of central government and local government planning the noble lord did not refer to the united states of america <e> <s> there is singularly little federal or state planning in the major cities of america <e> <s> as far as i know there is a tiny percentage of public housing <e> <s> the inner city problems of chicago and new york are the model which we hope to avoid imitating <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads paragraphs and of the occasional paper of the audit commission he will that find that while it recommends that the better management of local authorities is a matter of great importance capital expenditure by government central expenditure is essential if the problems of local authorities with homelessness and other housing problems are to be solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships including the noble lord lord young will forgive me for my discourtesy if i leave at for a commitment which i undertook some time ago <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i hope that he will forgive me if i do not follow him closely because i want to concentrate on a much narrower point in the ration of time at my disposal <e> <s> i am always bewitched by the noble lords eloquence <e> <s> i particularly enjoyed that moment in his speech when he almost convinced me of his belief that no government could be capable of fiddling anything at any time <e> <s> experience in recent months of westland and of the wright case makes one doubt that proposition slightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i do not follow the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really suggesting that the citizens of this country who happen to have ancestors born in the caribbean or in india are not equal citizens with the rest of us <e> <s> if so i must say that i profoundly disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage i think that your patience must be nearly at an end <e> <s> to listen to another speech is asking a great deal of your lordships <e> <s> nonetheless i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord home of the hirsel for initiating this debate <e> <s> i congratulate him on the exquisite timing which i understand is due to the parliamentary skills of his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i should also like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble and gallant lord lord bramall on his extremely interesting and impressive first contribution in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the answer which the noble baroness has given us and in the light of the competition for resources which she mentioned does she recognise that the most important matters are human resources and human abilities <e> <s> those are the worrying matters <e> <s> although she cannot give the figures it is alleged in the united states of america that the greatest haemorrhage of scientific workers of the first order leaving europe and particularly this country for america since the nazis were in power in germany has occurred in the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness denying that there has been a haemorrhage of leading scientists from this country to the united states of america in the last two years <e> <s> if she is really saying that the government are living in cloud-cuckoo-land <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord before he sits down that i have been profoundly impressed by the strong case he has made of the detriment to the public and to its members which the closed shop brings <e> <s> would he agree that the same principles which he urged on the unions might perhaps be applied for benefit to members of the english bar <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recognise that we are not talking about the confidence of the noble lords lord diamond and lord cledwyn in the integrity of the director of the security services <e> <s> the events of the past few months and years have led to a grave lack of confidence in the security services felt by <e> <s> the public at large <e> <s> does he recognise that the old saw about justice not only being done but being seen to be done applies in this case and can he tell us as he repeated in the statement that there are no grounds for lack of confidence in the competence of the security services <e> <s> if so how was it possible that they employed mr wright <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall not keep your lordships very long <e> <s> there are one or two things that must be said about the report of the select committee under the chairmanship of the noble viscount lord torrington a name which rings a chord in my memory and for which i am grateful <e> <s> i am also grateful for the labours that they undertook and that the noble viscount has taken this opportunity this evening to give us a further opportunity to discuss the report <e>", "<cs> i do not want to intervene at any length but i am prompted to do so by the words spoken by the noble viscount lord tonypandy in regard to the tradition of this country in welcoming refugees and providing asylum <e> <s> i briefly remind the minister that in the last century there was a famous diplomatic incident when a bomb was thrown at napoleon iii <e> <s> it was found that it had made in birmingham on it <e> <s> it was believed to have been thrown by a follower of mazzini <e> <s> a grave diplomatic incident arose <e> <s> lord palmerston who was not easily frightened decided to introduce legislation which limited to a very slight degree the right of asylum in this country <e> <s> his government fell on that principle <e> <s> it was replaced by the government of lord derby and that for the time being was the end of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his statement on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he really believes it is in the interests of this country that news international which at present has per cent <e> <s> of the national daily sales should acquire control of yet another paper <e> <s> news international is controlled not by a british citizen but by an american citizen <e> <s> does the minister think that is in the interests of this country in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for the answers he has given to the questions that i and others have put to him <e> <s> i am particularly interested in his last answer to the noble lord lord peston because in reply to my question the noble lord said that the deadline of oclock today was a matter of no importance <e> <s> he is now saying that the threat of closing the newspaper was a factor that led him to his conclusion <e> <s> i want to put a rather wider question to him <e> <s> in the case of other newspapers which have been referred to the monopolies and mergers commission it has insisted in the public interest that an independent board be appointed to maintain that newspapers independence <e> <s> we may or may not believe that those independent boards have been effective but in this case does not the noble lord think that he has a duty to protect the public interest and to see that the newspapers independence is preserved under its new ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> it is a pretty sorry story <e> <s> it is best summed up in the leader in the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me if i interrupt him <e> <s> i may be very simple but i cannot understand how a business can be said to be not a going concern if someone is prepared to pay million for it <e> <s> how can that be <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the noble lords answer to that question and his unfortunate absence from the debate last night is he prepared to comment on the sale of <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all thank the noble lord lord dean of beswick for introducing this subject which is one of the utmost importance and one which we should pick up from time to time in this house <e> <s> as he said we last discussed it on nd february in a debate initiated by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> it was to me an extremely important and useful debate <e> <s> i should like to add that i wholly agree with the noble lord lord dean in his reference to the fact that we are not talking about inner cities only <e> <s> many of the outer cities suffer from the same problems as the inner cities but this is now a term of art and when we talk about inner cities we mean also other areas suffering from deprivation <e> <s> i should also like to say how glad i am to see the noble lord lord young in his place today to answer this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he be so good as to answer a specific question which i put to him in the course of my speech <e> <s> my question concerns contract compliance <e> <s> is the interpretation of the new local government bill by the secretary of state for the environment correct or is that which is alleged to have been put by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster correct <e> <s> in other words in connection with contract compliance will the bill allow a local authority offering a contract to insist on the employment of local people or even more will it allow them to carry out their duties under the race relations act of promoting equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different groups <e> <s> that is the whole point of contract compliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the debate with great pleasure and i should like to join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord harris of greenwich for having initiated the debate <e> <s> i have listened with great interest not least to the speech of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who probably knows more about the police than the rest of us put together <e> <s> i have listened with pleasure to the noble lord lord renton whom i follow and to his exposition of the constitutional position of the home secretary and the fact that he cannot park wherever he wishes <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me when last a home secretary was clamped or fined for speeding <e> <s> the answer to the second question is very rarely not because home secretaries do not generally speed but because they are driven by policemen <e> <s> i knew a home secretary who ought to have been arrested for speeding almost every day of the week and still should be although he is no longer home secretary <e> <s> he remains amazingly immune <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl saying that a brisk regime is a euphemism for short sharp shock <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak <e> <s> i speak as a layman and i had not intended to speak <e> <s> but the arguments i have heard in committee and this afternoon from the benches opposite have so astonished me that they have i was going to say rendered me speechless but that would be an inaccurate description of what i am doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords accurate repetition of the words he used which i remember less accurately than he did <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord elibank i should like to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing this debate tonight <e> <s> it is a highly necessary debate although it seems to me rather sad that we should have to have it <e> <s> one of the troubles with this debate is that all the arguments in favour of behaving more generously towards overseas students seem to be self-evident <e> <s> therefore to repeat them seems to be redundant <e> <s> these arguments are admirably set forth in the excellent report by the overseas students trust <e> <s> we should thank that trust <e> <s> it deserves our unqualified congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how much money the dti not industry is paying out from its budget <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord help me with a simple question <e> <s> what is meant by the identity of the author <e> <s> supposing someone writes a hook under a <e>", "<cs> may i give the noble lord an example of what i think we are talking about <e> <s> publishers often have dust jackets on their books <e> <s> they are created by artists <e> <s> the publisher uses them merely to display the book <e> <s> who owns the original <e> <s> the original may well be a considerable work of art <e> <s> as i understand it under the bill the original would belong to the publisher <e> <s> i see no reason for the publisher to own the original <e> <s> it should revert to the artist <e> <s> the publisher has had his whack from using it as his dust jacket <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord ardwick <e> <s> i hope that the maiden speakers will forgive me if i do not mention each of them by name <e> <s> i will be following instructions recently issued to the house that we should not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords you will notice that i am not my noble friend lord gladwyn <e> <s> the reason that i am on my feet is that the noble lord very kindly agreed to change places with me on the speakers list because i want to address myself to a rather narrow point in this wide-ranging debate which has been so interesting and so informative <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i omit some of those tributes to earlier speeches by noble lords which courtesy prompts which eloquence deserves but which time forbids <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that gilbert and sullivan being out of copyright it would be within the law to tape it <e> <s> a production of gilbert and sullivan say in modern dress with specific cuts and alterations to the text surely is in copyright <e> <s> therefore my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge will be back in prison for another long term despite the efforts that he has made to make it more comfortable <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships long but i should like to thank all noble lords who have participated in this debate and i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord st john of fawsley on his maiden speech which was as enjoyable and eloquent as i had foreseen <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for the part he played in this debate and for the authority that he brought to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great pleasure for me today to have the opportunity to follow the right reverend prelate and to be able to congratulate him on a most notable maiden speech <e> <s> it was a speech which not only told us of the constructive work which the church is performing in the very important area we are discussing today but it was a speech which was uttered with great sincerity and conviction and it leads me and i am sure many other noble lords to look forward greatly to more speeches from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for giving us an opportunity to discuss the security services <e> <s> i also have great pleasure in following the noble lord lord campbell of croy with whose conclusions i find myself in general agreement <e> <s> i think the subject is an interesting and important one because it strikes at the very heart of democratic politics <e> <s> it raises in an acute form the doctrine of accountability as has already been said and it also raises in an acute form the rule of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to speak in support of this amendment <e> <s> in doing so i revert to the position which i held on second reading <e> <s> in committee my noble friends voted against this amendment for precisely the reason which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has set forth that is that they were informed by the noble earl lord caithness that this amendment was incompatible with two ec directives one on public works and one on public supplies <e> <s> he set that forth quite categorically as can be found in col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he tell us which rule in the ec regulations makes this unlawful <e>", "<cs> my lords the response of the noble earl lord caithness to my amendments is hardly surprising although naturally disappointing <e> <s> of course it was my intention to extend the arm of the race relations act to a rather wider field <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead in that i do not see that this is something dreadful <e> <s> after all these are matters to which all of us are committed on both sides of the house and in all parties <e> <s> by making this simple change in the bill we could make the battle for securing equality of opportunity irrespective of race more effective <e> <s> i regret that we received that rather negative reply <e> <s> i am sorry but not surprised <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> bearing in mind that this report has been on his right honourable friends desk for some two months can he let us know when it will be published <e> <s> it is after all a matter of considerable public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble earl and the noble lord lord mishcon in saying how much i look forward to the speech of the noble lord lord jakobovits <e> <s> i congratulate him on choosing such an appropriate occasion on which to make his maiden speech but in my view he will have difficulty in making a maiden speech on this topic which is not controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there are some letters waiting to be dealt with at lunar house <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure to follow the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who has explained the nature of the amendment <e> <s> i support it <e> <s> clause repeals section of the act which has been found to be sexually discriminatory <e> <s> that is why an amendment to the act is thought to be necessary <e> <s> i argue that the only amendment required is the very simple one that the noble and learned lord has proposed <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the proposal that i support is written into the amendment to which my name is committed <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will permit me to intervene <e> <s> i am not sure that i quite follow his argument <e> <s> is he saying that if we pass this clause as amended there will be sexual discrimination <e> <s> we have never argued that there will be no discrimination if this amendment is passed <e> <s> all we have said is that if the amendment is passed the sexual discrimination to which the court objected would be eliminated <e> <s> is he saying that that is incorrect <e>", "<cs> there are two points which the noble earl lord ferrers made which will arise again and again unless we deal with the matter at this moment <e> <s> he speaks as though the worst thing in a bill of this kind is an anomaly and that an anomaly is something which must be abolished at the first opportunity <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee can allow that serious speech by the noble lord lord renton to pass without comment <e> <s> there is a high-and-mighty attitude that polygamy is awful and that we in this country have made it unlawful <e> <s> on the other hand multiple marriages are common and increasing cohabitation between unmarrieds is increasing and common one-parent families are increasing in number and are common <e> <s> if we are to pretend that we are so superior to the people a year who may come here the noble lord admits they are a diminishing number for economic as well as religious reasons i believe we are carrying the popular idea of english hypocrisy rather too far <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> to remove a right of appeal is a serious step <e> <s> the situation described by the noble lord lord renton is not quite as idyllic as he would have us believe <e> <s> the people to whom the delays mainly occur are in bangladesh <e> <s> a few years ago the delay before getting a first interview was months <e> <s> the delay is now about eight months although dna may change that <e> <s> after the first interview there are further delays <e> <s> during the second reading debate i asked the noble earl lord ferrers whether it was the case that letters were unopened at lunar house <e> <s> i have since discovered that there are letters <e> <s> when i last inquired no letter that arrived in december had been opened <e> <s> the beauty of our administration therefore is something which is difficult for others to comprehend <e> <s> people have come here after a decision taken earlier because that is the best way in which they can overcome the delays <e>", "<cs> i made no estimate of the number of people who were in bangladesh waiting to come in <e> <s> i think i am right in saying it has been said by some people that the figure is <e> <s> i do not know where that figure came from <e> <s> i did not mention <e> <s> i do not know where the noble lord found that figure <e>", "<cs> i was informed that there were letters in the home office <e> <s> subsequently i was informed that the figure was <e> <s> they are not all applicants <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mishcon they may have had to write five or times and have never received an answer <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment which was moved by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i have listened as usual with great interest to what the noble lord lord renton has said <e> <s> he is in a particularly fanciful and imaginative mood tonight <e> <s> i listened to one speech after another in which he produced successive rabbits out of a hat <e> <s> of course one can produce cases in which deportation is justified <e> <s> as i understand the amendment i shall be corrected if i have misunderstood it it does not state that there are no circumstances under which someone should be deported <e> <s> it states that people should be allowed to appeal against deportation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few very brief words to the powerful plea of my noble friend lord mcnair on this extremely important issue <e> <s> i think that the committee should be reminded of how long the tradition of asylum has existed in this country and how fiercely it has been maintained <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers and his colleagues on the opposite benches therefore have a duty to uphold that tradition as one which is of very long standing <e> <s> i should like to remind the committee that in a bomb which had written on it made in birmingham was thrown at napoleon iii <e> <s> that attack was believed to have been part of a conspiracy by a follower of mazzini called orsini who was resident in this country <e> <s> there were demands that he should be extradited and the foreign office was genuinely alarmed that there might be conflict between this country and france if something was not done <e> <s> lord palmerston was then in office and he tried to do something about it but his government were defeated and lord derby succeeded him <e> <s> that gives some indication of how attached people were to the tradition of asylum and their behaviour shows how the conservative party actually benefited from a breach of it <e>", "<cs> it may conceivably be perfectly logical as the noble earl lord onslow has said to take a different view to that expressed by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> i am not quite so convinced of the logic which he claims to have expressed <e> <s> i argue from a practical point of view <e> <s> anyone who neglects the advice of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead it is advice i fully endorse of the crucial importance of relations between the police and ethnic minorities may claim to be logical <e> <s> but he is also being extremely unwise <e> <s> this is the most critical area of race relations in this country <e> <s> anyone who has worked in that field is fully aware that relations between the police and the ethnic minorities are critical <e>", "<cs> it is very difficult not to support the noble lord lord mishcon on this point <e> <s> on second reading i raised the question of an american publisher here who was told that his visa had run out <e> <s> he went to the home office to have it renewed <e> <s> he had to wait eight hours at lunar house <e> <s> at an interview he was told that he could have a visitors visa in due course but that delays in issuing the working visa he had previously were such that he could not be given the visa immediately <e> <s> that person has not yet received his visitors visa and he is probably overstaying <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the noble earls answer and to the various comments made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i remind the noble lord lord renton not for the first time that we have net emigration from this country and not net immigration <e> <s> therefore the idea of immigrants pouring into this country and overcrowding it is a figment of his imagination <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful that the noble earl should give way <e> <s> i am not discussing immigration policy <e> <s> all i am suggesting is a measure which concerns the families of british citizens <e> <s> it does not concern immigration policy generally <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there should be an open door with free movement of labour within the whole world such as there is within the european community <e> <s> i suggest only that as regards uniting families british citizens should have the same rights as have ec citizens in this country <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his answer to my and other peoples questions arising out of the amendment <e> <s> but he says that it muddles things up <e> <s> it muddles them up because these two matters meet in the bill <e> <s> the bill has a clause which deals with the rights of members of the european community <e> <s> i am not muddling this up it is here facing us in this clause <e> <s> what i am talking about is the fact that it produces as i have said two or three times an anomalous position for british citizens <e>", "<cs> if i understand the noble lords answer aright the home secretary will be able to exempt certain classes of people rather than individuals and these will appear in the regulations <e>", "<cs> i would defend exactly what i said <e> <s> this is just one of many measures taken in this bill which far from facilitating unification of families makes it more difficult <e> <s> in this case it makes it more expensive <e> <s> i do not think that is to be denied <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make an apology to your lordships house <e> <s> i regret to say that i have an engagement at oclock and i must leave at <e> <s> therefore i shall be away for an hour or two but i hope to return afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my evidence from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord ardwick whom i follow with as usual great pleasure and agreement in congratulating the noble lord lord bethell on the bill which he has brought before your lordships house thereby rendering a public service <e> <s> i am not quite clear as to his intentions but i take it that he wants the bill to receive a second reading <e> <s> certainly that is my view <e> <s> i believe that the government will benefit greatly from a discussion on the proposals of the bill in committee <e> <s> i hope that we shall have that opportunity <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give one reason why we should be confident that the government will take our advice <e> <s> they have not told us anything at all <e> <s> not one reason has been given saying why they object to this bill <e> <s> nor have they given one indication of the way their mind is moving <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to add a few words at this late stage of what has been a long and detailed debate on this melancholy little bill <e> <s> i shall not take much time in pronouncing its obsequies nor have i a great deal to add to the moderate and measured words of condemnation uttered by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will permit me to intervene <e> <s> the quotation which i was making was from a lecture on the development of immigration law <e> <s> mr macdonald president of ilpa the immigration law practitioners association said in a survey of the development of immigration law <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i follow the noble lord lord donoughue <e> <s> i listened to the indictment of the noble lord lord chalfont with great care <e> <s> of course he is right <e> <s> as anyone who has read the charter of the bbc knows it provides the government with all the powers that even the greek dictators would have wanted to hold over a broadcasting organisation <e> <s> it can veto programmes it can insist on programmes it appoints the board of governors it has all the power to control the bbc which it cares to use <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions of the charter are absolutely clear <e> <s> no one denies that <e> <s> the question is whether those provisions should be deployed on account of one programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i only assumed that the noble lord was referring to it when he said that he had systematic evidence to back up his statement <e> <s> if it was not that it would be interesting to know what the evidence is <e> <s> perhaps he will let me have it <e> <s> i apologise if the media monitoring unit was not the source of the information on which he was basing his argument <e> <s> however i do not expect to convince him by any argument that i can deploy that his fears are exaggerated <e>", "<cs> the grouping of the amendments is such that it is difficult to follow a straight line <e> <s> perhaps i may say a word about the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord pitt which i heartily support <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble baroness lady blackstone has spoken to amendment no <e> <s> zb standing in my name <e> <s> i should like to say how profoundly i support that amendment for the reasons which the noble baroness has given <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unaware that the bbc treated the falklands in any way differently from the way in which it treated other conflicts in which this country has taken part <e> <s> i beg to move my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell me what is the precise position of professor griffiths and sir jeffrey sterling in connection with the cabinet committee or sub-committee which is considering this matter and why the home office appears to be playing such a small part in the preliminary discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for too long after the lengthy debate we have had <e> <s> however i should like to take the opportunity to thank the noble earl lord ferrers for his answer and the words he has spoken and also to thank all other noble lords who have participated <e> <s> the debate has been both useful and timely <e> <s> i am absolutely convinced of the sincerity of the defence of the present arrangements as described by the noble earl lord ferrers but i am sure that he will welcome constant vigilance on the part of your lordships house to maintain the position which he has expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord gibson i must apologise for intervening in this debate because my name is not down on the list <e> <s> unlike the noble lord i did not ring up the whips office and unlike him i have already spoken once today and therefore this is more of an apology than he has to make <e> <s> i must also apologise because i was not present at the start of this debate and therefore missed the speech of the noble earl lord haig and that of the noble marquess lord aberdeen and temair <e>", "<cs> my lords that was before i came in <e> <s> it is ludicrous that the people who are chosen to run an opera house a ballet company the whitechapel arts gallery and so on should be chosen partly with that criterion in view <e> <s> it is not a question of whether they are good at running a ballet company whether they are good at running an opera house or an art gallery but whether they are good at raising money from mega-rich philistines <e> <s> that is a third reason why i believe that the limitations of sponsorship on which the government are so keen should be considered in a wary way and should be seen simply as a top-up to existing funding from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords

reasonably <e> <s> is that a law which the noble earl proposes that the chamber should accept as the truth <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene at this point because i would not like to spoil the very strong case which the noble lord lord carr of hadley has made for the amendment he has moved nor do i want to enter into a philosophical debate about the way in which we support the arts in this country <e> <s> i would only say that what he said made it abundantly clear that sponsorship which has a role to play has only a marginal role and i am glad that it is only a marginal role in supporting the arts in this country because sponsorship carries with it very grave policy implications for the administration of the arts about which i have reservations which i have already expressed on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i was asking a slightly different question from that which he has answered <e> <s> i was asking whether the government had received further advice from the advisory committee or from its working party and if so what their response to it had been <e> <s> do i take it from what the minister has said that the government have not received any advice since the publication of the report from the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to some surprise at that answer as both the committee and its working party have met since the report was published <e> <s> in view of the urgency of the matter and the need for public education will the minister consider asking the committee whether it has any advice <e> <s> if it gives advice will the government publish it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to being a little disappointed by the reply to my last question <e> <s> i asked the noble earl as i am sure he will recollect whether the government would publish the advice of the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that public education is extremely important in this whole area <e> <s> further can he give me one good reason why a report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for setting forth the governments case for extending the northern ireland act <e> <s> like the noble lord lord prys-davies we on these benches although sadly find ourselves in the position of having to approve what is in fact inescapable <e> <s> we see no alternative other than to support and say that we approve <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for presenting the order that we are discussing today in such detail and so thoroughly <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships very long on this matter <e> <s> i wish to concentrate upon one aspect of the employment position in northern ireland <e> <s> the stark fact is that northern ireland has and always has had massively higher unemployment than great britain <e> <s> as the minister said though the situation has improved in the past year it is still horrendous <e> <s> the latest figures i have are up to april and they show that unemployment in northern ireland is <e> <s> the terrible fact as regards that figure is that per cent <e> <s> relates to people under the age of and per cent <e> <s> of those people have been unemployed for over a year <e> <s> taking the figures a little further unemployment is two and a half times as high among the catholic population as it is among the protestant population <e> <s> it is this matter at which i wish to look briefly particularly in relation to the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the noble lords answer to the noble lord lord buxton of alsa to which he referred on many occasions can he explain the role of sir jeffrey sterling and professor griffiths who have been holding a series of meetings with senior figures in the television industry <e> <s> can he further explain why no representative of the home office has been present at those meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the increase in staff was largely in order to take up the backlog of unopened letters at lunar house and elsewhere which caused a certain amount of trouble <e> <s> can he tell us how many unopened letters now remain at lunar house <e>", "<cs> my lords before i say anything else i have been asked by my noble friend lord hooson to make his apologies which he failed to do <e> <s> he had to leave the debate early because of a long-standing commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may well doubt it but he does not know and i do not know <e> <s> i have no view on the matter <e> <s> the fact that both ex-prime ministers are still alive does not mean that they are capable of knowing whether there was a conspiracy to destabilise their governments <e> <s> they are perhaps the last people to be likely to know <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that a long-established relationship is a singularly weak ground for supplying arms to an extremely disagreeable regime <e> <s> will she agree that we would have been unwise to supply arms to italy and germany with whom we had a very long established relationship before the war <e> <s> therefore to fall back on a long-established relationship as justification for supplying arms to a dictatorial regime which shows few signs of improving its daily practice is surely something of which the minister cannot approve <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble baroness lady turner for putting this question to the minister about the proposed privatisation of short brothers <e> <s> it provides the government with an opportunity to clarify their intentions in connection with the privatisation of short brothers which of course cannot be kept separate in the minds of any of us from the privatisation of harland and wolff and the privatisation of northern ireland electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to thank the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the statement which has been made in another place on the very important and complex matter of the new changes which are to be introduced into broadcasting television and radio <e> <s> this is an extremely complicated subject <e> <s> the statement which we have heard covers a very wide variety of matters <e> <s> we have not had the opportunity yet to read the white paper therefore any considered judgment and our views of this must wait until we have that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have the opportunity to follow the noble lord who has just spoken to us for some time <e> <s> i learned an interesting fact from his speech <e> <s> in the light of his response to the intervention of my noble friend i gather that we must regard that speech as in favour of the ec <e> <s> i gather that we must take that speech as being a testament of faith by the labour party in the european community <e> <s> i also learned that government money was taxpayers money <e> <s> it would be serious if government money was something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not regard the european community to be like cancer <e> <s> i do not object to the noble lord saying that he would like to reform the common agricultural policy <e> <s> what i object to is the tenor of totally negative criticism of the ec and all its works <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the germane point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was looking interested my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was envisaging that the single european act would be followed by further extensions in the powers of the european parliament <e> <s> i see no reason whatsoever why that should not occur <e> <s> i was also envisaging that the activities of the council of ministers should be public and not private <e> <s> that seems to me an essential element in the democratisation of the ec <e> <s> but the present proposals which m delors has floated seem to me to be entirely in accordance with the original purposes of m monnet that is of creating a community and not a federation as is sometimes said by functional means <e> <s> that is to say it would be achieved by developing economic and financial cooperation which in turn will then be matched by political development <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often happens when i follow the noble lord lord ardwick i find myself in close agreement with the general tenor of his argument <e> <s> in particular i agree that we cannot construct a new response to the new conditions in which we live without a hard-nosed analysis of the russian policy <e> <s> we cannot fail to recognise that the effect of gorbachevs <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is probably in everyones interest in present circumstances that any disputes or differences between the soviet union and say estonia <e> <s> lithuania and latvia are settled peacefully and satisfactorily and that the best we can do to assist is to say as little as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister seriously believe that by refusing mr arafat a visa the united states administration have increased the force of moderation within the plo <e> <s> does he agree that that should be the object of our policy <e> <s> does he further agree that by abstaining we appear to have aligned ourselves with the negative and unconstructive attitude which the united states administration have adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble baroness lady birk in her forthright and convincing condemnation of the notice issued by the home secretary on th october banning the broadcasting of terrorist and proscribed organisations on radio or television <e> <s> i have little doubt that the notice was issued with this thought at the back of the mind of the government that under the circumstances which faced them something had to be done <e> <s> that something proved to be the ban which i have no doubt had been considered on many occasions over many years in the home office and rejected on each occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand from what the noble lord said that he believes that censorship should be extended to the press <e> <s> if he thinks that it should be extended to the press should it not be extended further than the press and to the spoken word <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that if only more people speaking of people in this country had read <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk and i have been over this ground before quite recently and i should like to take the opportunity of associating myself with the very persuasive criticisms she has made of this complicated and important white paper we are discussing today <e> <s> she has marshalled substantial and extremely convincing arguments calling into question some of the proposals which would auction franchises to the highest bidder which would rest quality control on a series of sanctions that are unlikely to be effective which do not define the regional responsibilities and obligations with sufficient rigour which leave the financial structure of channel uncertain to say the least and which seem to be running down some of the aspects of the bbc to which i shall return later <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the words of the noble lord lord thomas with great interest and i shall return to them in a moment <e> <s> a number of your lordships have expressed in the course of their speeches some mystification as to the precise meaning of the motion of my noble friend lord jenkins of hillhead which is before the house <e> <s> however that does not seem to have prevented many of them saying a great many things and in consequence the debate has ranged extremely widely over a large number of topics <e> <s> i must say that the noble lord lord glenarthur has my deepest sympathy in having to wind up <e> <s> i notice that he shakes his head in complete confidence but how he could foresee all the points which were going to be raised and answer all the questions which have been shot at him will interest me very much when i listen to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable and learned friend in another place <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with everything which has been said by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> in addition i

from the ayatollah and iran <e> <s> i regard the government as having been wholly right in not being precipitate in their response as was urged upon them in some quarters <e> <s> they were right to proceed with what is called all deliberate speed but no more <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether the same principle of political and ideological impartiality applies to appointments outside the national health service or whether for example on those principles the vice-chairman of the iba was recently appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will note

provisions <e> <s> but nonetheless from these benches we feel bound to support their renewal <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to congratulate the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford on raising this

undertakings given by the chinese government and in <e>", "<cs> we have tried on earlier amendments to persuade the government to improve the bill and in this amendment we have endeavoured to prevent the government from becoming a laughing stock <e> <s> all we seek to do with this amendment is to apply the arguments which are accepted by the government where there is a harm test to those offences

not previously seen it <e> <s> he accepts that repetition which takes place under certain circumstances and brings information to people who previously did not have it falls within the bill <e> <s> he also accepts that where information is widely available repetition cannot possibly be damaging <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> we are not saying that it is conclusive but that

moved <e> <s> i believe that he rather exaggerated the extent and the difficulty of providing guidance to officials as regards how they should and should not behave <e> <s> that is common practice and

capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that to move the centre to gosport is to move it a very long way from the place where most of the immigrants arrive <e> <s> is he further aware

a measure which i think most of us in this chamber feel is of the utmost importance in the light of history <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to ask one question <e> <s> i find the argument fascinating in its complexity and in its obscurity <e> <s> however i cannot fully understand why the government do not use the same formula as that used in the race relations and the sex discrimination legislation <e> <s> this is a deliberate act because when this matter was raised in another place the answer was that it was not considered appropriate <e> <s> the word appropriate covers a multitude of sins and i do not understand why it is not appropriate <e>", "<cs> i believe that the government are making matters unnecessarily difficult for themselves <e> <s> the idea behind the training schemes is to bring people who are under-qualified up to a level at which they can compete <e> <s> the classic example in the race relations field is that of asians who cannot speak english <e> <s> it was clear that until they spoke english they could not compete on equal terms for a job <e> <s> it was totally asian-directed therefore and asian-specific but it was not regarded as discriminatory because discrimination in training did not apply <e> <s> where the discrimination applied was in the allocation of jobs <e> <s> once that asian boy applied for a job in competition with a white boy then it had to be on the merit of the person in question <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee long on this penultimate amendment in such a long day <e> <s> the objects at which both amendments are directed are the same <e> <s> it is simply my contention that the amendment in my name and that of the noble lord lord prys-davies is better than the one tabled by the government <e> <s> this is for a simple reason <e> <s> as i understand it and read it the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord lyell covers only indirect discrimination <e> <s> the point of the amendment which i and the noble lord lord prys-davies have tabled is that it covers both direct and indirect discrimination <e> <s> it is for that reason that i prefer our amendment to that of the government <e>", "<cs> if the minister can give me and the noble lord lord prys-davies an assurance that direct discrimination is covered i shall be happy not to move my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord seriously suggest that mr gorbachev by abandoning the brezhnev plan has done nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to intervene at this stage but i wish to make one or two comments to your lordships about the way in which this bill has proceeded <e> <s> it is an extremely complex bill of considerable importance with clauses <e> <s> the government and the opposition tabled amendments at committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is really the logical extension of one moved in committee whereby the president of the commission was appointed by the lord chancellor rather than by the department of economic development <e> <s> the reason put forward by those of us who supported that amendment was our belief that the commission required the highest esteem possible <e> <s> it needed to be independent of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not repeat the arguments which have been so clearly put by the noble lord and which i am sure will convince noble lords of the need for the amendment <e> <s> however there is nothing more important in making this kind of legislation effective than for the government to set an example <e> <s> if the government set an example they can bring pressure to bear on others either industries in which they have an influence or unions with whom they have daily dealings to bring them into line <e> <s> if the government fail to set an example one can hardly expect other people to do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords the last argument deployed by the noble lord for this amendment is the clinching one <e> <s> a commission like this must be seen as we have said before on several occasions to be free-standing and independent <e> <s> it must be able to <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> they may prefer it <e> <s> however the question is whether they are right to prefer it <e> <s> that is what is at issue <e> <s> it seems to be very odd that we should lay down a regulation or in this case a law which says that a body is allowed to ask for information <e> <s> if it receives totally inadequate information from the source of that information it has to wait six months before the information is corrected <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot imagine that this is efficient that it encourages people to provide information or that there are precedents where this kind of delay has proved useful constructive or helpful to the inquirer or to those on whose behalf one is inquiring <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord prys-davies has said there are industries in which large numbers of part-time workers are employed and a very high proportion of those workers are women <e> <s> therefore the exclusion of a substantial number of women from the scope of monitoring has been described not only as a classical example of the invisibility of part-time women which it undoubtedly is as though they did not exist in the employment field at all and needed no protection but in addition it will also lead to returns from the monitoring which are extremely misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to me in many respects the most difficult and the most important clause that we have discussed <e> <s> what has happened in the past is that although we have had a law in existence since it has been shown to be largely ineffective in changing the balance of opportunity between the two communities <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly agree with what the noble lord lord prys-davies said about the obscure phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of this amendment <e> <s> not only is it causing concern in northern ireland but it seems quite unacceptable in any part of this country that the secretary of state should have the power to issue a certificate which is then conclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question before he sits down <e> <s> i am not disappointed <e> <s> i am totally bewildered <e> <s> i cannot understand what we are being asked to accept <e> <s> what happens if there is not an agreed procedure <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> why should there be an agreed procedure <e> <s> to take the first in last out as an example why should the unions abandon that principle <e> <s> if they do not abandon it what then happens <e> <s> that is what i should like to know <e> <s> that is what i cannot as yet understand <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the words of the noble lord lord lyell in reply to the amendment which i and the noble lord lord prys-davies tabled <e> <s> i am disappointed that in point of fact he did not move from the arguments that we heard at second <e>", "<cs> my lords i associate myself with the words spoken by the noble lord lord prys-davies about the bill and its passage through the house <e> <s> in particular i concur with his view that the usual channels misjudged the size of the task which confronted this house in dealing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he agree that with his undoubted gift for paradox he should commend the government even more on their extraordinary financial and business competence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however does he not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> while i am sure he will agree that poland needs more than symbols of support in its present circumstances does he not agree that to poland above almost all countries symbols are of the utmost importance <e> <s> the return of general sikorskis remains to his own country would be a symbolic gesture of the greatest importance which would carry implications of the fullest possible support that the government could give to the reforms political and economic taking place at this momentous time in poland and in eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the statement made by the prime minister in another place <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with much of what has been said by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that not only the escalators are out of order in the london underground but the lifts as well and not only the lifts are out of order but the signal <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be so good as to inform the house whether her majestys government have made a direct appeal to the commonwealth to the european community and to the united states to take in in the worst possible case the inhabitants of hong kong <e> <s> if the government have made that appeal will he tell us what the response has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise and explain that owing to a long-standing commitment i shall have to leave before the end of the debate but i hope very much to return before it is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the criticisms which are often levelled at the commission for being unduly bureaucratic are best dealt with by giving the european parliament greater powers and by seeing that the procedures by which it is elected are based on a common threshold <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister help me in this matter <e> <s> while agreeing with the noble lord lord cledwyn and suggesting that if this country took a rather more forward position the response of other countries might be more generous i should like to put three questions to the minister <e>", "<cs> all right two <e> <s> if the minister were to answer two questions it would be a great relief because we do not generally get an answer at all from the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my question <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the urgency of the situation will the minister inform noble lords how much of the food aid that this country has promised has arrived in poland by now <e> <s> getting through the coming winter as the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how much of the food aid from this country has arrived in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the british government do not believe what the vietnamese government say <e> <s> the vietnamese government have stated have they not <e> <s> that they will not accept forcibly repatriated refugees from hong kong <e> <s> have the government any contingency plans should the vietnamese government live up to their word <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister go a little further than he did in answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> do not these mysterious standard procedures involve the use of force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will all be grateful to the noble baroness for raising this matter today so eloquently and comprehensively <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with everything she has said and above all with the spirit in which she said it <e> <s> i also associate myself with the basic criticism which she makes of our governments approach to this problem namely that it is too narrow too unimaginative and unworthy of the challenge which confronts us <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for making the statement sad though that statement is and regrettable though the circumstances are in which this country forcibly repatriates people children women and the remainder men against their will to a country which they left voluntarily <e> <s> i associate myself with two points that the noble lord lord cledwyn made <e> <s> first have the government considered because it is urgently necessary restoring aid to vietnam so that it can improve economic conditions to prevent those who leave from leaving for economic reasons and to provide those who are forced to return with circumstances in which they can earn a reasonable living <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join the noble lords lord cockfield and lord williams of elvel in thanking the noble lord lord kearton and his collegues for producing this admirable clear and wise report <e> <s> it could scarcely have been done at a better time <e> <s> i am sure that we are all grateful for its guidance <e> <s> as always i listened with the greatest interest to what the noble lord lord cockfield had to say on this topic <e> <s> i feel very much persuaded by his preference for a sequential procedure from monetary to economic union rather than for the parallel route suggested in the delors report <e>", "<cs> my lords might i as a member of the committee say that the noble lord has every right to say what he likes about the proceedings of the committee <e> <s> but this hardly seems to be the moment when we are discussing the report of another committee <e> <s> an opportunty will arise when we discuss the social charter <e> <s> i hope at that time that the noble lord will make any objections that he has but not on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the noble lord lord wyatt omitted to praise my colleagues on these benches <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that there is a substantial though not very large indian population in hong kong <e> <s> is he also aware that they were almost all brought over either themselves or their parents as servants of the government as policemen or clerks and that they will not be given chinese nationality <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the minister for the statement that he has made <e> <s> i entirely agree with him and the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs that general noriega is probably one of the least pleasant of all the heads of state in the world and that is saying a good deal <e> <s> i do not know who is worse general noriega or president ceausescu <e> <s> i have no doubt that the people of panama will be delighted if he is overthrown <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join with the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the minister for repeating the extremely important statement on hong kong which we have just heard <e> <s> for once i find myself in sharp disagreement with what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> i genuinely believe that in the circumstances we are facing today some insurance policy has to be provided to the people of hong kong <e> <s> that is the way in which we must deal with our responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for long but i should like to thank the minister for introducing the bill <e> <s> i also wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister for introducing this order so clearly and for pre-empting many of the questions which some of us wanted to raise <e> <s> i wish to say a few words about the ethnic question number <e> <s> i am delighted to see it <e> <s> it is an absolutely essential matter and seems to have been reasonably drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> this matter poses a sophisticated problem <e> <s> i should not like to give an absolute answer <e> <s> however i think that peoples self-perceptions are significant of something <e> <s> that something as it changes is in itself significant <e> <s> the black issue for example is a highly political one <e> <s> the slogan black is beautiful of the s took on a highly political connotation within ethnic groups <e> <s> it has in particular had reverberations in the relations between the asian and the west indian communities in this country <e> <s> i am glad to see in the order the categories indian pakistani and bangladeshi because often there were moves to persuade all asians to call themselves black <e> <s> if they did not they were made to feel they were not showing solidarity with other minorities <e> <s> that always caused dispute and disarray and took the focus off the real questions which should have been addressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join with the noble lord lord dacre in thanking the noble lord lord callaghan for giving us the opportunity to discuss this extremely important and topical subject today <e> <s> it reflects on the flexibility of our procedures that when a man of the eminence of the noble lord lord callaghan introduces a topic of this importance and when of your lordships wish to speak to that topic it is impossible to extend the time <e> <s> the only device for dealing with the situation is to limit each speaker to five minutes apiece <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to associate myself with the noble lord lord cledwyn in thanking the minister for repeating the statement of his right honourable friend made in another place concerning hong kong and the vietnamese refugees <e> <s> i too propose to speak only very briefly on this occasion in the light of the debate that we are having next week on the situation <e> <s> then we shall have more time to discuss the subject and i hope that we shall also have more information <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships long following a constructive debate which broadly speaking has revealed a like-minded approach among your lordships to the problems confronting hong kong <e> <s> i wish to thank all those noble lords who have participated in the debate <e> <s> i wish to say in particular how much i enjoyed and how much i learnt from the speech of the noble lord lord ennals based on his experience in vietnam <e> <s> i found it a great pleasure for once in a while to be speaking in agreement with the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford <e> <s> that is an event which does not occur every day of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister disagree with the former united states secretary of state for defence who said that the military balance in europe has been radically altered <e> <s> should we not respond to that alteration rather than sitting pat <e> <s> does he not also agree with the former secretary of state mr schlesinger that high ceilings of defence in western europe legitimise a soviet presence instead of encouraging soviet withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the answer to the private notice question in another place <e> <s> we too on these benches would like to welcome sincerely wholeheartedly and with unqualified relief the release after years of nelson mandela one of the most charismatic courageous and extraordinary people of our epoch <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl therefore agree that in the view of the british government the behaviour of president bush and president gorbachev is unwise foolish and dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was a member of sub-committee c which produced this report under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> he skilfully guided us to a unanimous conclusion which has so far received the unanimous support of all speakers in the debate today <e> <s> moreover i suspect that it will receive the support of all those who have yet to speak with the exception of one speaker the noble lord lord strathclyde who will be in exactly the same position in which this government find themselves again and again in their negotiations with our european colleagues <e> <s> it is not a comfortable situation and it is not a noble situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really must withdraw that <e> <s> the conservative party fought election after election on the basis that if we joined europe it would be the ruin i remember one slogan of farmers farm workers and farming throughout the land <e> <s> for the noble lord to say that the conservative party has been the leader in this field is a travesty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to reform the law on elections to the european parliament to base the electoral system for such elections on proportional representation to unify the electoral systems of northern ireland and great britain for the purposes of such elections and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl must be unique and alone in thinking that the soviet threat has in no way diminished since last year <e> <s> but does he agree that the negotiations for naval disarmament have not gone ahead because the united states has refused to engage in them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for long on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked some pertinent questions to which we all look forward to answers <e> <s> i should like to reinforce his main point which concerned the sale of electoral registers <e> <s> when i give my name voluntarily in order to supply information i for one act on the assumption that my name will be used for the purpose for which it was given and not for some other purpose <e> <s> if it is used for some other purpose particularly if that purpose is a commercial one i regard it as a breach of my privacy <e> <s> like the noble lord i thought that the purpose of the data protection act was to protect individual citizens precisely from this invasion of their privacy and the exploitation of their name for purposes other than those for which it is given <e>", "<cs> my lords would this not be helpful information <e> <s> it is helpful for me not to receive piles of junk mail <e> <s> not being in an ordinary household indeed i think i must come from an extraordinary household i receive five junk-mail letters a day <e> <s> why should it not be posible for people to mark on the electoral register the fact that they do not want to receive junk mail <e> <s> the mailing preference service could then act upon the information <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount will give way i should be most grateful to him <e> <s> this is very mysterious <e> <s> is he saying that information derived from the computer data is outside the act because the form in which that information is presented is printed but not printed by a computer <e> <s> is he saying that information derived from computer records falls outside the act if it is printed not by a computer but by some other means <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that these were autobiographical programmes and in accordance with the view of the noble lord lord orr-ewing the last one was an account of a royal tour <e> <s> does he not agree therefore that the bbc were deeply culpable not to show a tour by a republican to balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for introducing the appropriation order with his account of various crucial items of government expenditure presenting us with as he rightly described it a whole range of figures <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord prys-davies for his characteristically meticulous analysis of the issues about which he wished to hear more from the minister <e> <s> like him i should like to hear in the noble lords reply a slightly more broad-ranging account of his expectations of the performance of the economy in the coming year <e> <s> it is upon this that so much will depend <e> <s> it will be interesting to know whether he expects the gap between promise and achievement to which the noble lord lord prys-davies drew attention to be closed or whether it is to remain in much the same rather disappointing order that it stands today <e>", "<cs> my lords i too like other noble lords should like to say how grateful we are to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel for initiating this debate <e> <s> i find myself in some difficulty in following the noble baroness in her speech as i last read bryces <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords after this longish debate i hope that noble lords will not expect me to reply in detail to the arguments put forward by either the noble lord lord underhill or the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> however i should like to thank <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to repeat the very relevant questions put by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> as he indicated it is yet another example of total inactivity on the part of the department of utter passivity which is what the dti has now become <e> <s> whether it is the fayeds or iraq unless someone else tells the department to do something it apparently assumes that all is

into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> or a scottish assembly <e>", "<cs> i understood that the labour party is committed to a scottish assembly and that the executive decided that it should be elected by a system of proportional representation <e>", "<cs> it has been an exceedingly interesting debate so far and i should like to thank all noble lords who have participated in it <e> <s> i should like to avoid various booby-traps which lie in my path such as getting involved in an internal labour party dispute in which i feel i would be ill-equipped to engage <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon who made a most admirable second reading speech in opposition to the bill that the bill discusses the future <e> <s> if he thinks that we should not be discussing the future he should not in a sense be discussing the bill <e>", "<cs> i remind them that we exist and that we shall continue to put forward policies in which we believe <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to keep noble lords very long with what i have to say <e> <s> we are not using the northern ireland precedent as a justification we are simply saying that it is a mechanism which has worked well and that it is a simple way of introducing proportional representation into the rest of great britain <e> <s> as i said it is not a justification it is an example and one which we suggest should be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that her majestys government should associate themselves with the initiatives taken by mr mitterrand and mr kohl in which they suggested that negotiations were the right way out of this particularly difficult problem <e> <s> does he also agree that in the case of independent movements within the ussr to which president gorbachev has given his assent structured independence by means of negotiation is the right way forward rather than unilateral declarations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend the prime minister in the house of commons <e> <s> the statement is one of extreme significance and importance <e> <s> it is ludicrous to suppose that we can discuss or examine it properly in the time available at this moment <e> <s> i very much hope that the official channels will provide us with an opportunity to have an extended debate to discuss the implications of the decisions and proposals made at the dublin summit which are of great importance to the future of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune to follow the noble marquess lord exeter in his maiden speech and to be the first to have the opportunity of congratulating him on the eloquence with which he handled three themes which are close to the heart of our debate today and for which we must thank the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what charge other countries such as france or west germany make for visas <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief concluding contribution to this long debate and i shall try to exercise as much brevity as i can in the

the present government <e> <s> that is my argument <e> <s> the noble lord may not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to try to sum up the whole range of opinions expressed in this debate <e>

bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the implication of mr ridleys speech is that the government should repeal the european communities act which committed us to economic and monetary union <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble ministers absence from the meeting entirely consistent with the views he expressed regarding the european community in his bruges speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord to whom i referred was the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl lord ferrers sits down i should like to say how deeply impressed i am by his extraordinary mastery of chemistry and the legalities of this abstruse subject <e> <s> it has added to the reputation he has in this house of being the master of every subject

and we shall do so <e> <s> a great deal should be discussed in committee particularly as regards the points system <e> <s> undoubtedly it is complicated both to devise and administer and it may be possible to improve it <e> <s> however we would delude ourselves if we supposed that by entrenching democracy in hong kong desirable though that may be we could give any guarantee whatever to the people of hong kong that that democracy would continue after <e> <s> not only would we be deluding ourselves but if we told that to the people of hong kong we would be guilty of deluding them too <e>

lordships whether any steps have been taken to monitor the know how fund aid that we are giving and the aid that goes through the european community to discover which type of aid is most effective and

noble lord recognise that the situation changed radically in <e> <s> the policies pursued by the chinese government since then have been severe verging on genocide <e>", "<cs> i find the noble lords argument rather difficult to follow <e> <s> he started by saying that he thought that advisory committees might or might not be useful but that their appointment should be left to the discretion of the itc <e> <s> he went on to say that he felt that the committees were positively un-useful <e> <s> he said that they were like sleeping dogs lying about the place and out of touch with events <e>

noble lord lord houghton of sowerby tells us to move on quickly <e> <s> i would only say that i will move on as quickly as i can but i think this amendment is more than semantics <e> <s> it is very easy for the minister to accept <e> <s> we do not believe that any television company will always achieve high quality but we believe that they should always aim to do so <e>", "<cs> at the risk of annoying the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby may i say that i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i shall read his reply carefully <e> <s> i am astonished that he apparently thinks the market produces high-quality newspapers <e> <s> there is some evidence in some parts of the newspaper world that this is hardly the case <e> <s> however in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the minister said in relation to the changes that we are to see in the bill <e> <s> i want only to draw attention to the fact that

at the way other people are teaching languages <e> <s> is it impossible for the government to introduce crash courses for teacher training in foreign languages so that this dreadful time lag of years

incomprehension the minuet being conducted by the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> i too received a letter from the noble earl which spoken in plain english said that

right as we can <e> <s> that is the objective of all members of the committee speaking in and attending this debate <e>", "<cs> the noble earl must recognise that omitting the public service phrase

are absolutely at one <e> <s> the case that he has made for this amendment is overwhelming <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will pay attention to it <e>", "<cs> no one who had listened to the debate

convinced that there is a future for hong kong <e> <s> i hope that the bill will have made a contribution to reinforcing that future by providing an element of confidence <e> <s> that is what is most required and on it we the noble earl and the government are at one <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment on the must-carry obligations <e> <s> as the noble baroness rightly said this position has been brought about by the repeal of the provisions of the cable and broadcasting act which obliged companies to carry the public service broadcasting channels on cable <e> <s> bearing in mind the

define exceptional quality why cannot the radio authority define quality <e>", "<cs> i shall try again <e> <s> if the itc can define exceptional quality why is it impossible for the radio authority to define quality <e>", "<cs> i wish to clear up a small matter <e> <s> the noble earl said that amendment no <e> <s> was grouped with this amendment and so it is according to the grouping list <e> <s> that seems to be an error because it deals with a different issue to the present amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is concerned with clause which we shall come to tomorrow <e> <s> it deals with the purpose for which the authority will grant licences <e> <s> that is a different kind of criterion from that with which my noble friend has been dealing <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble earl for the care that he has shown in misunderstanding the motives that underlie my amendment <e> <s> i am interested in decriminalising people <e> <s> that is an important occupation in which we

of the law <e> <s> they have been punished <e> <s> they should not be punished again <e> <s> the provision has consequences which the minister rather brushes aside <e>", "<cs> this is a serious amendment <e> <s> are we saying that if there is a personal view programme labelled as such which is about republicanism the next programme has to be by a monarchist <e> <s> or am i misunderstanding the whole nature of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for agreeing to treat this amendment separately from the subsequent amendment <e> <s> that makes sense <e> <s> i am grateful that he has said that although coverage will not be any higher than is suggested on day one and i agree with the noble earl that you cannot expect to have per cent <e> <s> coverage on day one it is hoped that in the course of time it will be the aim of the so-called national services to achieve national percentages which are higher than per cent <e> <s> i imagine that with the advances in technology that will be made easier and cheaper <e> <s> however it is important that that should not be left entirely to the commercial judgment of the radio authority and that that objective of maximum coverage should be made clear to those bidding as the objective for which they should aim <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment which touches on an important problem <e> <s> the other day we discussed the position of london as a centre of live musical performance <e> <s> these radio stations are living off the skills and the work of musicians <e> <s> in my view they are gaining a short-term advantage if they do not consider that it is in their interests to employ the musicians in live performances <e> <s> it is not a question of killing but rather of starving the goose that lays golden eggs for them in the shape of the substantial profits which the music stations make <e> <s> given the fact that the levy system which operated in the past has produced such admirable bodies as the wren orchestra i consider it was an experiment that proved itself to be valuable and added to the cultural life of the nation <e> <s> i hope therefore that the government will look favourably upon the amendment <e>", "<cs> one cannot help but support the noble lord on this matter <e> <s> the noble earl said that he is adding to consumer choice by local radio stations not broadcasting something <e> <s> it is a very odd way of adding to consumer choice by not doing something <e> <s> one cannot choose what is not available <e>", "<cs> one would not be adding anything <e>", "<cs> that is a very unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> perhaps i may make a suggestion to the noble earl <e> <s> would it be within the capacity of the licensing authority to explain the reasons it gave the licence to the successful applicant <e> <s> that would not be a severe burden <e> <s> if one has considered a lot of applications and come to the conclusion that one should be successful there must be a reason for that decision <e> <s> it is not a severe burden simply to put those reasons in writing and communicate them to anyone who requests them <e> <s> that would go a considerable way to providing a kind of guide to the way in which the act was being administered and some way towards mollifying those who had failed if they knew why someone else had succeeded <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for agreeing to think about the matter and i look forward to seeing the results <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his response to my amendment <e> <s> in the light of what he said i am happy to withdraw it and i look forward to his thoughts at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to members of the committee for having arrived a little late thereby missing the beginning of the debate <e> <s> however i arrived in time to hear the admirable words of my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth and also one of the most effective speeches of the noble baroness lady birk to which i have ever listened <e> <s> in my view she made a devastating case <e> <s> to pretend that it was purely as described by the noble earl lord ferrers seems to me a travesty it was in fact an expression of opinion that many of us share <e>", "<cs> if i were a minister i would say i shall write to the noble lord about that <e> <s> the number of complaints that i have known the bbc to accept and to apologise for is substantial <e> <s> the noble lord is simply repeating the tittle-tattle of the campaign against the bbc which we know has been mounted over the past five years by a number of people who could be said to be interested in the result <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted to see an ex-statutory liberal <e> <s> is he ex-statutory or ex-liberal <e> <s> in any case i find the idea that those people will reflect public opinion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not appear to have read the councils annual report <e> <s> i happen to have read it <e> <s> it tells me exactly how it tests public opinion with people monitors and expeditions all over the country asking people questions which were vividly described to us by the right reverend prelate the bishop of st albans who is on the council <e> <s> we know how it does that <e> <s> on the whole i am sceptical that may be a mistake of its ability to reflect public opinion <e>",

<s> i happen to know as i published neville cardus for many years <e>", "<cs> we on these benches wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord colwyn who spoke with great clarity <e>", "<cs> we on these benches welcome the provisions for gaelic in scotland <e> <s> we see no reason why similar provisions should not be offered in accordance with the amendment moved by the noble lord lord blease <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble earl is saying that the government regard the public service obligations of the bbcs governors as in some sense needing a further kind of oversight than that which they have had in the past <e> <s> the governors of the bbc have always been responsible for ensuring that the bbc acted in the public interest <e> <s> there was no question of anybody other than the home secretary and parliament ensuring that they performed that function <e>", "<cs> my lords as we near the end of this long and extremely interesting debate it is difficult to try to pay tribute to the many interesting speeches which have been made in an extremely constructive fashion <e> <s> however looking at the debate overall it seems to me that there have been three themes which have run through the discussions in which we have engaged <e> <s> they can be named as the importance in this very difficult and complex situation of legality unity and patience <e> <s> i believe that it is on the basis of those three themes all of which support each other that there is a possibility that the conflict in which we are engaged may be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to associate these benches with this amendment that has been moved by the noble baroness lady birk in connection with the regional arrangements made by the itc <e> <s> she has set forth the case so clearly that i shall not take up much of your lordships time adding to the arguments that she has already deployed <e> <s> this amendment is one of a number which draw attention to the extraordinary contribution which the regional companies have made to british television <e> <s> we wish to preserve that at all costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the trend of the bill and the trend which has arisen as a result of the encouragement given recently to production by independent companies is to make the television companies move towards a situation in which they are as the noble baroness has said more like publishers and less like programme producers <e> <s> the amendment relates closely to the earlier amendment to which i spoke <e> <s> that trend presents a threat to the regions because per cent <e> <s> of the independent television companies are based in london and the south east <e> <s> the more the television companies commission the independents the more likely it is that those productions will be made in london and the south east at the expense of the regions <e> <s> a recent survey in of independent commissions from regionally based itv companies and the four regionally based bbc companies showed that per cent <e> <s> of the commissions went to the south east and per cent <e> <s> went to regionally based independent companies <e> <s> so the situation is now that over a third of commissions from regionally based franchises go back to the south east <e> <s> this trend is increased when we take into account that an overwhelming proportion of commissions by london-based companies are also from london and the south east <e>", "<cs> my lords are we taking these amendments separately or as a group <e> <s> i am not clear as to the position <e> <s> clearly they are different amendments and to take them as a group would be extremely bewildering <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to intervene very briefly on this amendment <e> <s> i propose to speak mainly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i would like to say something about mr birts position which was somewhat misrepresented by the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> mr birt has never said that impartiality should not play any part whatsoever in the law or the charter which governs the bbc <e> <s> on the contrary he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the correction made by the noble lord <e> <s> does he suggest that a parallel person should be appointed to the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords so i was not so far off the mark in my supposition <e> <s> it is an interesting proposition if it applies to the bbc because it would be going back on what existed originally <e> <s> when i first became associated with the bbc in it had its own complaints body to which people addressed themselves <e> <s> that body was replaced on the grounds that the complaints body of the bbc was bound to be biased <e> <s> the replacement body covered both the bbc and itv <e> <s> as a result of the present governments actions we now have a new array of organisations and regulations covering the broadcasting organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the amendment can be compared with the purpose expressed by the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford when he was talking about his amendment <e> <s> we have in mind that pressure should be brought to bear on those who run channel to give it a distinctive character <e> <s> whether or not it has a regional character is a matter for them <e> <s> some of us thought that channel should represent the regions and thereby differ from the national characteristic which would be the role of channel <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an exceedingly disappointing reply <e> <s> the noble earl appears to be unable to make up his mind between whether he wants the company to be almost in control or in control <e> <s> in mitigation of his position he says it is almost certain that it will be in control <e> <s> if he regards that as being good why not let it be in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships long in supporting the amendment so admirably moved by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i only say

supported the amendment <e> <s> i should just like to say and i am sure that your lordships will agree with me that as a result of his sad and untimely death we shall miss his presence not only in these proceedings but also in future debates on other legislation <e>", "<cs> the effect of the bill has been to shift radically the focus of british broadcasting <e> <s> it has shifted it from a system of broadcasting which was dedicated to the service of the public interest to one which is dedicated to delivering audiences to advertisers <e> <s> the object of all the amendments which have been moved from this side of the house has been to claw back some of those changes which we feel are detrimental to the public interest <e> <s> in my view this amendment is an extremely good example
