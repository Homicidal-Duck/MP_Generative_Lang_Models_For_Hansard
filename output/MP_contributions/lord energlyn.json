["<cs> my lords i do not think that we can extend too strong praise to the noble baroness for bringing this subject into your lordships house at a time when the country is being bewildered by political warfare and also smothered by the blankets which we have heard so vividly described by the noble lord lord spens for example the paperwork invented by the bureaucrats <e> <s> it is in this kind of arena as i see it that from an embryonic condition the small businesses have to try to emerge and come to life <e>", "<cs> my lords in expressing my thanks to the noble lord <e> <s> lord spens for bringing this subject before your lordships this afternoon i should like to say that i came with a prepared speech which i have now abandoned because of what i have heard from various members of your lordships house <e> <s> what rings so clearly in my mind was graphically expressed by the noble baroness in her splendid maiden speech these peoople who live on an island half the size of wales

of looking at conservation <e> <s> we in this country have become too ready to discard industrial processes because the cost of energy appears to render them unprofitable <e> <s> governments have listened too readily and i repeat too readily to economists in arriving at the decisions to close down industry on energy evaluation <e> <s> they have not given the technologists a chance to look at the industries in peril and to offer alternative methods of utilising energy to make those industries profitable again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will look into the delays in national health authorities payments to pharmacists <e> <s> these are very often excessive <e> <s> pharmacists have to carry complicated stores of drugs with a very limited shelf life and many of

rather superiorly i should like to extend my thanks to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for giving us the benefit of his incomparable knowledge of this interesting aspect of british life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to follow the noble lord lord wynne-jones <e> <s> he is a distinguished chemist who has devoted his life to the study of fuels <e> <s> following his theme and with great deference i should like to present to her majestys government the suggestion that without being supercritical they should get into their minds clear modules of what the noble lord has just been trying to describe the difference between fuel and energy <e> <s> energy is taken out of fuels but first we must understand the fuels with which we are dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls on that point <e> <s> if i may say so i resented the ministers correlation of my energy board with a quango <e> <s> as he knows i am very anti-quango so i should like to clear that point for the record <e> <s> after all the people whom i am suggesting as members of the board are paid-up officials the chairmen of our nationalised industries <e> <s> we do not

speech <e> <s> i rather timidly rise to extend my thanks also to the noble lord lord scanlon because i am one of those academics who has been educated beyond my intelligence <e> <s> but i have sufficient intelligence to appreciate that the subject he has brought into your lordships house is of enormous i repeat enormous importance to this country at the present time <e> <s> however i am sorry to say that although this subject affects the real workers of this country the interest in this subject by his fellow peers in the labour party does not seem to be very evident as there are only five of them on the benches behind him <e> <s> i must make this comment because this party professes to look after the labour force of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were in a scoring match i think that the cross-benches would win <e> <s> but let us leave that sort of thing out of the debate <e> <s> let me make a more serious approach to this as an academic <e> <s> during the middle thirties franklin d roosevelt was faced with the same kind of unemployment problem and he encountered an academic geologist who described to him the events which had taken place when an ice barrier crossed the columbia river and its tributaries and dammed back flood waters which coursed across the basalt country and eroded it into deep canyons <e> <s> then the ice melted the water disappeared and the whole area became a desert called the coulees <e> <s> with great imagination roosevelt instituted a concrete barrier to take the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble earl on the way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> he has given your lordships a very vivid picture of the backcloth to what lies hidden beneath the waves that cover the largest part of

suchlike marine nodules became of international significance and made necessary bills of this kind only when the far-sighted people of the world realised that we are moving into a period in which there are certain substances of great strategic importance and manganese cobalt and nickel are three good examples <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask permission to make one comment <e> <s> listening to the debate i am haunted by the situation that faces us at the present time regarding the action of the coal miners <e> <s> as the noble earl knows this industry is very close to my heart and i would remind him that there is a lesson to be learned from the last <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise to your lordships for speaking out of context <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also extend to the minister our thanks and express relief at the statement he has made <e> <s> may i also thank him for the clarity and sympathy in the answers that he has given to the many questions <e> <s> one point that i should like to enlarge upon at some distant date is the characteristics of british coal <e> <s> in britain we have been endowed with every variety of coal known to man <e> <s> we have lost our home-based markets to a substantial extent <e> <s> i hope that this will have removed the blinkers away from the national coal board and we shall look upon our coal as an export <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches extend our praise and congratulations to the noble lord lord noel buxton on a remarkable maiden speech <e> <s> he gave me a lot of interesting side thoughts especially concerning the names of companies <e> <s> this was one of two items regarding the bill that i wished to comment upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so pleased that the noble lord lord mcalpine of moffat referred to the invisible earnings of our professionals <e> <s> we do not know the exact figure but i gather that there is a minimum of million of foreign currency coming into this country <e> <s> one might naively say that as a result of this expertise being sold on a contractual basis british industry should have a spin-off into the hardware involved in the contracts <e> <s> but it does not work like that <e> <s> the reason why our consultancy practices are among the foremost in the world is because we are british <e> <s> it is the integrity honesty and clarity of the advice that is given to a client which has caused this vast and important income for britain <e> <s> but it is left to the client to buy the goods <e> <s> if british industry is not producing the right goods then it cannot expect to break into the markets created by our consultancy practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> as he knows i sometimes get carried away <e> <s> what i really meant to say was the company he referred to in such an effective way <e> <s> these people have produced plastic nets with great bearing capacity <e> <s> i think the noble earl would agree with that <e> <s> they can carry phenomenal weights of material <e> <s> you can see these lowered into a ship into a clean hold that you are going to empty when you get to the other side <e> <s> so imagine a ship like that leaving england <e>", "<cs> may i join in this appeal to the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> if we remove this phrase it does seem to me it would discolour the bill <e> <s> as one who has been active in this field i appeal to him <e> <s> if you delete this phrase it means that you are casting an almost jocular attack upon the work of pure scientists <e> <s> it is in the study of the behaviour of animals as my noble friend has just said that we can make some very fundamental advances <e> <s> if you carry this to the logical conclusion that even bacteria are animals then it would seem to me clear we are really talking a lot of nonsense <e> <s> it would seem to me to be somewhat carping to remove this phrase and i would strongly appeal to the noble lord to leave the clause as it is <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will not withdraw his amendment because in context with the previous amendment we ought to be clear about what we mean by substances and products <e> <s> the noble earl has given one definition but perhaps an anecdote here may not come amiss <e> <s> when we were trying to discover what was the fundamental chemical reaction that caused lung tissues to be transmuted from cellular tissue into fibre we had to take the decision that the substance that we were dealing with <e>", "<cs> i join the noble earl lord halsbury in asking the noble lord lord beaumont to reconsider the amendment and to ask whether it is really practicable <e> <s> if you go into a laboratory concerned with say the study of the chemotherapy of carcinoma you have a variety of techniques which you must use and one of them is not anaesthesia as lord beaumont seems to visualise it <e> <s> to illustrate the point if you try to give a rat a chemotherapeutic substance which you are hopefully expecting to have an ameliorative effect on a cancerous growth it is extremely difficult to give it to the rat orally because of the dimensions of the throat <e> <s> indeed we spent ages trying to find a method of getting a compound which i had produced into a rat <e> <s> if we had had to operate under this amendment we should not even have been able to begin that experiment without seeking the permission of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak as a hydrologist <e> <s> i welcome this order because it strips an organisation which confessedly i have heard in your lordships house has been structured as a quango <e> <s> as such it has been dominated by amateurs in the world of hydrology <e> <s> i am pleased with the order because it tells us strictly that we are now going to have a hoard which is composed at least of some real experts <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may rise to <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that remark <e> <s> what i meant was that i interpret the necessity for this water as meaning that the board has not been as successful as the government would like it to be <e> <s> that is really what i am saying <e>", "<cs> my lords we are again indebted to the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> she has posed a question to her majestys government with care and forethought and has raised an issue which some of us have grappled with for many years <e> <s> as she has clearly stated it is time for making decisions <e> <s> i therefore hope that those of us who support her attitude towards this subject will impress upon her majestys government the need to listen to her words of wisdom concerning the tidal energy of the bristol channel <e>", "<cs> my lords permit me to follow the suggestion made by the noble lord lord paget of northampton that we should attach a tax to the provision of spectacles and use that tax to give adequate and proper fees to the practising optician <e> <s> that brings me to a point that has not been brought out namely who are the opticians who could qualify for that tax <e> <s> when you look at the bill it is perfectly obvious that too little care was given to the qualifications of the people who can be regarded as opticians servicing the national health service <e> <s> i would draw your lordships attention to the register in which you will see that there are two groups <e> <s> there is the group which the noble lord lord paget supports and which is also supported by the noble lord lord winstanley and others the optician who is an ophthalmologist or pharmacist who is well trained well versed and holds responsibility for diagnosing complaints in the eye <e> <s> why is it that it requires nine different diplomas to cover that subject <e> <s> because in nine different ways these gentlemen or ladies can become qualified to receive payment from the national health service <e> <s> when you look at their qualifications you find that at least three of them come under the worshipful company of spectacle makers <e> <s> that clearly has nothing to do with a malformation of the eye or other clinical problems <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords while expressing great admiration for the trade counsellors in the various embassies i have had contact with throughout the world and while supporting the question asked by the noble lord lord shinwell that we have here potentially the greatest sales organisation available to us may i ask the minister whether he is prepared to consider the suggestion that a review committee might be set up <e> <s> there is nothing invidious about this suggestion because the trade counsellors themselves would like their status to be clarified <e> <s> they themselves do not know quite how far to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with a certain degree of bewilderment to the noble lord lord scanlon <e> <s> he unconsciously i feel underrates the <e>", "<cs> my lords i had a general feeling from the noble lords speech that these young people need to be intensively trained <e> <s> that is right is it not <e> <s> there is a need for intensive training <e>", "<cs> but with respect my lords the noble lord generalised <e> <s> what these people are capable of doing is within one week learning a particular skill which the technologists require <e> <s> but the point is that in the technology of today and tomorrow we shall employ fewer and fewer people <e> <s> that is the picture of technology <e> <s> technology creates unemployment <e> <s> it is designed to replace the human being in carrying out tedious forms of labour <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness lady david sits down i wonder whether she will be so kind as to clarify in my mind and i am sure in the minds of others her concept of education <e> <s> if i may say so the noble baroness put forward a number of contradictory beliefs <e> <s> at the end of her speech she said that she wanted these young people to have the broadest possible education of life <e> <s> at the other end of the spectrum she said that above all else they must learn how to use a computer <e> <s> the picture one gets is of freedom on the one hand and of computerisation on the other <e> <s> i submit that this is not education but a form of teaching and a very dangerous form of teaching because the end product of that form of teaching will be intellectual guinea-pigs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl as i have just returned from dounreay whether he is conscious of the fact that the research and development there have reached a point where they need to be told that there is something in the future <e> <s> should they not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with my noble friends kind words of thanks to the noble earl lord halsbury for bringing this very important and crucial subject into your lordships house <e> <s> i should also like as it were to re-emphasise the comments of the noble viscount lord thurso initiated by lord sherfield regarding the reaction of people in and around dounreay <e>", "<cs> my lords it is appropriate that the noble lord lord glenarthur is presenting these regulations this afternoon <e> <s> among his many talents and interests are geology and mineralogy and pneumoconiosis is a mineralogical disease <e> <s> touching on the points made by the noble lord lord davies of leek it is not the cloud of dust that you see that is dangerous it is those particles in the dust which are invisible which are the treacherous elements which lead to pneumoconiosis in all its varieties <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to stay as close as i can to the subject of this debate by selecting a lesson which is not referred to not surprisingly in the white paper <e> <s> the lesson is not to underestimate or undervalue the back-up information and services which have been provided in war and in peace by our famous and learned institutions <e> <s> there are many of them but relevant to this subject i select the naval hydrographer the ordnance survey the geological survey and of course the falkland islands dependency survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for giving me this opportunity to speak as a geologist who has spent far more years dealing with the intricacies of mineralogy and microbiology of soils than i care to remember <e> <s> i have therefore had a great deal to do with farmers and it has always struck me that agriculture is really man bending nature to his will <e>", "<cs> my lords aware as i am of the petrochemistry involved may i ask a brief question <e> <s> how dangerous is the rate of deterioration and is it analogous with shall we say <e> <s> dry rot in timber <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for being absent a moment ago <e> <s> i rise to speak really with a certain degree of modesty and confidence as being the person who introduced into this country the first degree course in photogrammetry at nottingham university in the early s <e> <s> i say that to underline my dedication to the preservation of the centuries of work carried out by the ordnance survey <e> <s> in the debate on the lessons we learned in the falkland islands campaign i made a source or topic of my speech the back up which the ordnance survey gave to that valuable important and successful operation <e>", "<cs> my lords to emphasise the urgency of the noble earls question i should like to ask the minister whether he is aware that there are about small firms that have been stifled by the lack of decision in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to my noble friend lord kings norton and in particular i wish to express my admiration of his work and that of his splendid committee because it has added another chapter to the study of this subject strategic minerals <e> <s> in that sense too i should like to express my congratulations to the noble viscount because his maiden speech also will add a very important chapter to the studies that people such as myself make of this wide-ranging subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord kirkhill for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i do so because i feel very strongly in support of lord nathans question <e> <s> i endorse everything that the noble baroness has said in referring to the noble lord lord flowers <e> <s> his remarks enforce in my mind the fact that i would prefer to see this subject dealt with by a commission if only for continuity rather than by some kind of select committee <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the amendment is somewhat unnecessary and to some extent rather nave <e> <s> the noble lord lord davies made a pertinent point when he said that many of these parts of britain are above the foot contour <e> <s> they are the very ones the noble lord lord melchett wants to preserve <e> <s> those areas will be producing reservoirs at high levels <e> <s> they will provide water not only for the farms but also for the hydro-electric power for those farms <e> <s> many of those proposals have been held up by admittedly well-meaning objections to the formation of the reservoirs which ostensibly are claimed to disfigure or alter the wildlife of the area <e> <s> there is a nave suggestion contained in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think any of us could fail to admire my noble friend lord rugby for his persistence in trying to put right something which he firmly believes is wrong and which many people likewise believe is wrong <e> <s> in listening to the various <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite correct and it rather pinpoints the fact that these opticians are apparently entitled to their million by virtue of section <e> <s> the question before us is is section an admissible monopolistic section <e> <s> i challenge that really because if you read section carefully and i do this as a scientist how can you get away from the simple language ambiguous though it is of subsection which says <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord seebohm i should like to approach this motion just like the noble lord lord mottistone in its practical and urgent aspects <e> <s> i was recently in finland and they have a well-known furnace for smelting copper <e> <s> they devised a scheme whereby finnish engineers assembled these furnaces in different parts of the world <e> <s> finnish engineers commissioned them and finnish engineers are circulating round the world keeping them in good condition <e> <s> this is a task force bringing the employment of engineers into finland <e> <s> this is the kind of thing which is in my mind in approaching this very important point that the noble lord lord seebohm makes which is that we should set up practical package deals to meet the needs of a particular country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble viscount in the clear distinction he has made between straw and straw stubble <e> <s> the scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that to plough raw stubble into the soil is not a beneficial process but rather almost a detrimental one <e> <s> so the practical approach which is centuries old of burning stubble is a sensible thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords this will unquestionably be an historic debate recorded in <e>", "<cs> they can do that by law but the turkish cypriots have no reciprocal muscle to respond <e>", "<cs> but my lords they do not imprison ships captains who happen to come to famagusta <e> <s> so it seems to me trying to be as impartial as i can that the greeks have irritated if that is not too harsh a word the whole livelihood of the turks in this manner because they happen to have the status of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i take lord kennets point but we are not talking about two different countries we are talking about two communities <e> <s> it is the imposition of the legal muscle of one community upon the other that i am talking about not two countries <e> <s> does the noble lord concede the point <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it for me to enter into a contest between kinsmen <e> <s> but i should like to compliment the noble earl lord cranbrook and his colleagues on their patience in dealing with this tiresome intrusion into the age-old practices which have been carried out so successfully in britain for decades <e> <s> we know more about the processing of town sewage than any other country with the exception perhaps of america <e>", "<cs> my lords on the night when the luftwaffe practically destroyed the headquarters of the ordnance survey it was thought that we had suffered an irretrievable blow <e> <s> but that was not so because quietly we had been developing the science of photogrammetry <e> <s> this applied aerial mathematics related to air photographs <e> <s> consequently we were immediately able to convert photographs of all kinds into maps and plans <e> <s> but during that disastrous raid there was a piece of equipment which was quite important to our work it was called the multiplex and it was destroyed in the raid <e> <s> this had been made by zeiss at their works in jena <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been talking about conventional methods of producing electrical energy by means of converting water into steam <e> <s> no matter whether we use solid fuel liquid fuel or nuclear fuel we are still converting water into steam <e> <s> even though the noble earl <e> <s> lord halsbury has proved quite conclusively the merits of using nuclear fuel in terms of units of electricity costs the output of electricity from all these generators is determined by the steam turbine <e> <s> the steam turbine is only about half as efficient as a water turbine <e> <s> therefore in looking to the future i am so pleased that the noble lord lord mcalpine is present because his firm has indeed been responsible for very large developments in the creation of hydro-electricity and i venture to add that it will be equally great in the provision of electrical energy from the noble lords rather lovely windmills <e>", "<cs> my lords the pioneers of air transport are now seeing their visions come true <e> <s> they had the vision to see that as britain was once the ruler of the waves she has now become one of the major rulers in the skies and this island has now become the focal point of air transport for the world <e> <s> that it seems to me is the signpost to the future <e>", "<cs> my lords what i find rather unacceptable in this amendment is the correlation between a medical practitioner or registered optician or a person who has reached a proper standard of competence <e> <s> i suggest that we are really talking about ophthalmologists who are the people competent to diagnose any defect in the eye and not a person who has been trained to select lenses in some parametric apparatus <e> <s> i would not vote for this amendment on those grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords you will recall the old saying where there is muck there is brass <e> <s> i would add to that that where there is money there is also an opportunity for creating employment <e> <s> i think therefore that the question that has been raised by the noble lord lord irving of dartford is a very serious and a very constructive one <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him on the very profound and really remarkable survey of the aspects of the question that he has in mind i also join with the noble lord lord ezra in focusing attention for the need for co-operation on the part of the government in their thinking regarding activities such as the noble baroness has just referred to <e> <s> at the moment as the noble lord lord ezra has implied there is a bewildering number of people who are giving thought to this problem but effectively doing very little about it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him as chairman of the society who <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> can he tell us more precisely what he means by more fluoride <e> <s> is it in excess of one part per million <e>", "<cs> how much more <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is only right to declare that i established the first laboratory in the world to study biogeochemistry <e> <s> this is the subject about which we are talking tonight the function of mineral matter in the body cells of animals and plants <e> <s> the noble lord lord rea will agree with that <e> <s> if we look at this process what is the magical effect of this element fluorine upon the formation or destruction of bone tissue in the bodies of animals and plants <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister surely <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment but before i say why may i refer to the second reading speech of the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> i say this <e> <s> we are dealing with a form of chemotherapy and in chemotherapy you have to make two decisions about a substance you are going to use <e> <s> the first is is it harmless <e> <s> the second is is it useful <e> <s> against that you have to ask if the substance is harmless is it also useless <e>", "<cs> perhaps <e>", "<cs> i think that we are losing sight of the amendment <e> <s> the amendment is intended to add a safeguard to this whole area of chemotherapy <e> <s> it is simply an amendment to suggest that under no circumstances should fluorine be added to the water to any concentration beyond one part per million <e> <s> that was the importance of the amendment <e> <s> in the world of chemotherapy which as i have said earlier is what we are talking about one uses this yardstick of one part per million quite regularly because there are very few substances that you cannot control inasmuch as their pathogenic effects might be in concentrations less than one part per million <e> <s> whether you can exceed that is <e>", "<cs> it does not contain a fluorosalicic acid it is a sort of tannin <e> <s> so it has a tannic acid and fluoric acid content and those two compounds are moved through the urinary system with complete facility <e> <s> therefore it does not do any harm and so you are told quite clearly by your doctor drink some tea and you are a very busy boy <e>", "<cs> you can make a very good story out of fish that the more fish you eat the more alert you are and so it is a jolly good thing to have a dose of fluorine <e> <s> but what i am trying to maintain is this <e> <s> this amendment is really giving the bill just an additional area of protection <e> <s> it cannot be emphasised too often that you should not deliberately put more than one part per million of fluorine into the water if you can avoid it <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i aks him whether he has ever looked at the statistical picture in the west midlands which is the one area in britain from which one can draw conclusions <e> <s> it is the one area of britain which is served by a water supply which comes mainly from wales and which is of fairly uniform characteristics <e> <s> therefore if you look at the statistics of the west midlands which have been operating fluoridation since about it is fair to draw conclusions <e> <s> the noble earl says that i have no evidence to suggest that the introduction of fluorine into the stomach which is where the enzymes are has no effect upon the enzymes <e> <s> then how does he talk his way out of these two figures that the average intake of patients into hospitals in this country suffering from endocrine nutritional and metabolic diseases is but for the west midlands it is <e> <s> how does the noble earl talk his way out of those statistics if the enzymes are not affected by the water supply <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have ever said that i have attempted to prove anything <e> <s> what i am saying is that in all medical statistics you look at the picture <e> <s> in the field of chemotherapy which is what i pretend to be working in you look for a compound which is harmless but will do something useful <e> <s> the harmless nature of the compound decides on the concentration of the compound <e> <s> what this amendment is suggesting is that we should be extremely careful not to exceed if we can possibly avoid it one part per million of fluoride <e> <s> that is all i am saying <e>", "<cs> i would as it were half-heartedly support this amendment but i think it is a good amendment in the sense that it puts on record the dangers of using liquids of this kind <e> <s> one must not think in terms of vivid concentrations when you are dealing with salicic and hydrofluoric acids and so on <e> <s> we analysts have a vast experience of the use of hydrofluoric acid and we know it is even more <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down is he aware that bottled water has to carry with it a complete analysis <e> <s> this is what my noble friend lord rugby means <e> <s> is not the consumer in this country entitled to an analysis of the water <e> <s> this is not a simple matter because when you look at the analysis that has to be provided by the bottled water people you find that it contains a full scale account of the major and trace elements of the water including the fluorine <e>", "<cs> this will drive us to bottled water <e> <s> but sticking to my point if the noble earl buys a bottle of perrier or vichy water he will find a complete analysis on each bottle <e>", "<cs> i think that this may be straying a little from my amendment but my noble friend likened fluoridation to the natural presence of all the other elements that are already in water <e> <s> it really is crucially important to understand that what we are talking about is mass medication or the addition of something which has nothing to do with making the water pure but has to do with health <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend considers this later on he will take on board the point that it is not good enough to say in a reply that if the water authority has a duty to give information on this it will have a duty to give information on the other different substances that are in the water <e> <s> that is not really a very sound answer <e>", "<cs> earlier on the noble earl asked for a monitoring instrument or a method of extracting fluorine <e> <s> one of the simplest elements in water to determine in terms of concentration is fluorine <e> <s> one has only to put it in a fluorimeter and in one second one knows exactly how much fluorine there is in the water <e>", "<cs> if i may follow the noble lord as members may recall i said earlier that in the field of chemical treatment of disease chemotherapy one looks for a harmless compound and finds out its effect <e> <s> i would suggest that perhaps a better way of phrasing this would be to refer to the effect on teeth the effect on health and the effect on plant and aquatic life <e> <s> that would really meet the noble lords point <e> <s> i quite agree with him that we ought not to concentrate on the pathogenic or disease aspects of this element fluorine <e>", "<cs> i gathered that lord jaunceys judgment was that it was illegal to convert water into a medicine <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i misinterpreted the story <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be tiresome but i am grateful to the noble earl for bringing to our attention the various examples of the corrosive effects of fluorine in water <e> <s> the really important aspect i humbly suggest is that the bill prescribes the use of fluorosilicates <e> <s> i keep repeating this <e> <s> you are putting two corrosive acids into water <e> <s> we chemists know that we cannot use any metal other than platinum when we are dealing with silicic acid and hydrofluoric acid <e> <s> it is the only metal that will resist corrosion <e> <s> when we come to steel as this enzymatic experiment has proved the fluorosilicates will add to the iron and form an iron fluorosilicate <e> <s> this is an extremely brittle substance and it will readily form scale <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect the noble lord has got it backwards <e> <s> we are talking about a halogen when talking about fluorine and about chlorine <e> <s> equally you can talk about bromine as another halogen <e> <s> you can talk about iodine as another halogen <e> <s> what is a halogen <e> <s> as the name tells you it is a salt-forming substance <e> <s> the difference between the behaviour of hydrochloric acid in relation to biological material is this <e> <s> the chlorine goes into the biological material that is tissue and readily joins up with the sodium the potassium and the phosphorous <e> <s> but the fluorine will not do that <e> <s> so if you want to extract fossils from a rock you dissolve the rock in hydrofluoric acid and because the fossils are composed of organic matter they are untouched by the fluoric acid <e> <s> therefore you are dealing with a different halogen from chlorine <e> <s> that is the answer <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support to this amendment <e> <s> if only it improves the communication of new and constructive knowledge to water undertakers and the national health authorities it will be a good thing <e> <s> perhaps i may give an example <e> <s> it is only we academics really who have the time and the patience to follow some of the more erudite pieces of work on what is after all the most important substance on earth water <e>", "<cs> in france it is a statutory requirement to have the analysis on the bottle label <e> <s> if the noble lord would kindly look at his bottle he will find that it is sparkling water <e> <s> does it tell him where the water was bottled <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> this raises a rather interesting question but it is not the time and place to discuss it now <e> <s> this will raise an interesting question in this house which we might be talking about on monday <e>", "<cs> i am rather pleased about that but i should point out the elemental danger in this clause <e> <s> i refer your lordships back to the two compounds which this bill prescribes as being safe <e> <s> if it is proved that neither of these compounds is safe the government are caught over a barrel <e>", "<cs> my lords engraved on my mind is the second speech i made in your lordships house when the noble lord lord shackleton with his usual courtesy but nevertheless crystalline clarity showed me the distinction that one has to make between geopolitics and geology <e> <s> i shall therefore make my position clear <e> <s> it is as a geologist that i speak at the moment <e> <s> when the noble lords father was on his way to the south pole he called in to see his old friend the man who became sir edgworth david the son of the bishop of llandaff who at the age of was declared an incurable tubercular and who was advised to take up geology as an out-of-door occupation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nathan has led a brilliant investigation into this very controversial and complex subject <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him and his committee on producing a brilliant report which in fact goes beyond a report really <e> <s> it will become a kind of textbook to which people such as myself will refer for important and ongoing information <e> <s> it also seems as though i am to be in the honourable position of having a running duet with the noble lord lord nugent as we are going to move very smoothly from hydrocarbons now to water <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent is unquestionably the outstanding authority on the conservation and administration of our water supplies <e> <s> it is therefore i think very fine of him to present this question in your lordships house <e> <s> surely the government will heed what he has said in the past minutes <e> <s> it was a brilliant survey of the situation <e> <s> as he says if one looks at the document it is full of questions but rather thin on answers <e> <s> the one question that it does not ask is what is good about this present system <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him how he would picture the privatisation of the sewage stations <e> <s> these are the most incredible institutions in this country <e> <s> if i may make one statement it is said that what mogden of the thames water authority does today the world will do tomorrow <e> <s> they are quite fantastic <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may be permitted to take his discussion a little further <e> <s> it is so dismal to listen to the talk from all sides of the house about an industry which apparently has no hope or future and the suggestions that what we are doing is providing money for a decent burial <e> <s> from where are the imaginative ideas for the future of coal coming <e> <s> where should they come from <e> <s> they should come from the national coal board <e> <s> they did come from the national coal board until about when the national coal <e>"]
