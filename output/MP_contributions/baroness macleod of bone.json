["<cs> my lords i am also deeply grateful to the noble baroness lady trumping-ton for initiating this debate this afternoon <e> <s> like the noble baroness i am also very sorry to have missed the prime minister but since the noble baroness asked me to take part in this debate i have foregone that particular pleasure <e> <s> i am also glad to follow such a brilliant economist as the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> i cannot emulate him for the noble lord has a brilliant brain but i shall try to be practical <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who has just spoken referred to coloured people <e> <s> surely the statistics will depend on the area in which one lives and whether in that area there is a preponderance of coloured people <e> <s> one cannot say for instance that in hillingdon or any area such as that there will be more coloured people stopped and searched than anywhere else <e> <s> perhaps it is to do with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too supported the noble baroness lady faithful at the committee stage <e> <s> i should like to do so again for the reasons given by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he quoted my noble friend the minister when he said that specifically trained prosecution people might be thin on the ground but from my fairly lengthy experience i believe that those juveniles who have committed crimes may also be thin on the ground <e> <s> thus i do not believe that that holds water <e> <s> i support the amendment though not the wording because like my noble friend i stuck on the two words reluctant and specific otherwise i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am making a comment as i may on report i am sure that he would not wish the house to think that the noble lord lord moran <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to thank the noble baroness and my noble friend lord swinfen for so ably putting forward this amendment <e> <s> i believe that few people who are able-bodied have any idea of the problems of those who are physically disabled <e> <s> not only is it very expensive to be physically disabled but when it comes to not being allowed by parliament and by law to buy your own house you feel as many people have said to me in letters that you are an outcast the noble baroness also said this <e> <s> you feel that you are a nuisance not only to the local authority sometimes you feel that you are a nuisance to your friends and relatives <e> <s> at the same time such people are being disfranchised and made to feel second-class citizens <e> <s> i do not believe that this situation can continue <e> <s> i am therefore very grateful to the noble baroness and to my noble friend lord swinfen for what they have said on behalf of disabled people <e>"]
