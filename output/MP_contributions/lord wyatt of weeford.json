["<cs> my lords it is nearly years since i made a maiden speech in this chamber <e> <s> your lordships had kindly lent it to another place after their chamber had been wrecked by hitler <e> <s> i was nervous then <e> <s> after listening for several weeks to the terrifyingly high quality of the speeches in your lordships house i am much more nervous today <e> <s> so i crave your indulgence <e> <s> during my first maiden speech the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor as he now is was unconventionally moved to interrupt me <e> <s> it was the only lively moment during a dull speech <e> <s> today i have been warned not to provoke anyone <e> <s> i shall attempt to avoid that by trying to stick to generally agreed facts <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of the tote and a director of satellite information services <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is by no means a monopoly situation in that we do not have an exclusive contract with the racecourse association and extel or anyone else is at liberty to apply for the contract if they wish to do so <e> <s> secondly the big four bookmakers do not dominate the sis <e> <s> first of all the tote has a per cent <e> <s> vote and they have less than per cent <e> <s> of the total shareholding <e> <s> the other shares are widely dispersed <e> <s> is the minister aware that the whole of the horse racing industry is delighted with the arrangements that are being made because they are going to get a bonanza out of it <e> <s> is he also aware that as far as concerns the office of fair trading it is a small technical matter and the reason that we have not yet had an answer is that we are told that the officer dealing with it is ill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord basnett on his splendidly delivered speech <e> <s> i have met him several times in the past and i am glad to say that we have had occasional agreements <e> <s> i know that he will he giving us many wise and well-informed speeches in the future and i shall look forward to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to permit the admission of persons by the payment of money or by tickets sold for money to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords of such a religious kind i should have thought so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank all noble lords who took part in the debate or attended the proceedings <e> <s> it has been a very interesting and constructive debate i have learnt a great deal from it <e> <s> i wish particularly to congratulate the noble lord lord fairhaven who is a senior steward of the jockey club on his extremely well informed speech for the manner in which he delivered it and for the convincing arguments he offered <e> <s> i say they were convincing because of course i agree with them entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it would not be a harmless little bill if as the noble lord lord graham would like we spawned from it a vast host of new licensing authorities <e> <s> i cannot imagine anything worse than the spattering blare of lots of little committees and <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has not understood the full implication of his amendment <e> <s> if it were the case that no sporting event where admission was charged should take place before pm it would make utterly impossible such events as one-day cricket at lords because they have to begin well before pm otherwise they do not get a result <e> <s> likewise any sport which requires a great deal of daylight like motor racing or motorcycle racing has to begin before oclock and must be able to do so <e> <s> on the other hand if you only begin racing at pm in the winter it will be dark before the last race <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite wrong <e> <s> i live close to lords and i am frequently woken up early on a sunday by people queuing at am for a start at am or am <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to give the jockey club rather unusual powers <e> <s> it would enable the jockey club to decide on which other sports grounds betting might take place through the jockey club having horseracing on a sunday <e> <s> as the bill stands at the moment it would be quite possible for ladbrokes to open a tent on sunday at lords for betting and for betting to take place at show jumping and golf tournaments <e> <s> that is quite customary on a weekday <e> <s> one cannot tie this to the number of days on which by whim or necessity the jockey club decides to have horseracing on a sunday because other sports where betting is quite customary take place on a sunday too <e>", "<cs> if i might deal with the point which the noble lord lord airedale has just raised there are establishments licensed to sell drink on a sunday and they do so <e> <s> they would be very much missed if they did not <e> <s> there are only betting shops altogether in the country and obviously they would not all be open on a sunday because many of them are in areas like city centres where there would be nobody to come to bet <e> <s> i do not think therefore that the danger is very great <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene since i said that an amendment has been proposed that the number of days on which betting shops may be open off the course shall be limited to the number of days on which horseracing takes place <e> <s> i am happy to accept that amendment <e> <s> there is no danger of betting shops off the course being open on days when no horseracing take place <e>", "<cs> i said not content <e> <s> i heard about five people around me saying not content <e>", "<cs> i object to this amendment because it is one which singles out sport specifically and does not deal with all the other activities that go on on sundays <e> <s> if we are to have laws protecting peoples rights on sundays they should be applicable to all people who are called upon to work or want to work or have to work on a sunday such as coal miners railway workers bus drivers catering staff the police the people who provide our electricity telephone service and gas <e> <s> it seems nonsensical to say that sport ought to be treated in some curiously different way from all the other activities that go on on a sunday <e> <s> there is seven-day working in certain mills and manufacturing industries <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his intervention but i am still a little mystified <e> <s> is he saying that if you join after this bill becomes law you are not protected against working on sunday <e>", "<cs> and that you are only protected if you join before <e>", "<cs> if that is the case it is not a very adequate distinction <e> <s> surely newcomers should have the same privileges as those who are there already because those who are there already will die and nobody will be protected by this manoeuvre <e>", "<cs> it is because we have already covered the same situation in an earlier amendment <e> <s> originally all sports grounds and suchlike were described as tracks <e> <s> even a ping-pong room or a snooker hall came under the heading of tracks <e> <s> therefore it seemed wiser simpler and clearer to leave the amendment that was passed earlier as it stands and alter subsection to match it <e>", "<cs> it does not have to because that point has already been covered by the earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out that in a moment i shall be moving another amendment which alters the title <e> <s> that will clear up the mystery for the noble lord lord elton <e>", "<cs> if we are left with the old title that in a way would suit me quite well <e> <s> the original title was <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaverbrook has said that he does not think any harm has come from the -year limit being so short <e> <s> the harm comes to the heirs of the owner of the copyright and often the copyright is the only property that the author has been able to create <e> <s> i do not think that members of the committee would be happy with the notion that years after their death all their property would become public property which is what we are providing for here <e> <s> if other countries have a scheme by which the limit is years i cannot see why we should not conform <e> <s> the whole idea of stating that a man cannot leave his copyright to his heirs and successors beyond years after his death is an extraordinary restriction on property rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel rather as the noble lord lord kimball must often have felt when he was a master of foxhounds and accosted by a hunt saboteur <e> <s> i think that he must have learned something from such tactics <e>", "<cs> my lords i am half welsh <e> <s> i therefore half understand my noble friend lord tonypandy <e> <s> the half i understand is his delicious lyrical idealism <e> <s> the half that i do not understand is his logic <e> <s> he is a very keen moralist and i appreciate that <e> <s> i know it well <e> <s> but i cannot see the morality of having racing on sunday with betting allowed only on the course <e> <s> those who are not willing to risk having credit accounts and to waste their substance in that way would have to go to illegal bookmakers <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly they would <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham disagrees <e> <s> if we are to allow racing on a sunday and betting on the course and that applies also to wimbledon or lords or motor racing and so on but do not allow betting shops to open one is driving the ordinary person to bet illegally <e> <s> he may not have a telephone and may not wish to have a credit account <e> <s> he does not wish to risk his substance by betting or by credit as some mugs do <e> <s> that is a social evil in my view i am not very keen on that <e> <s> i am the chairman of the tote and we do not have such large punters <e> <s> the essence of resisting this amendment is to say to ordinary people who are interested in racing and betting that it is not a reasonable occupation and a harmless amusement <e> <s> they may bet a week <e> <s> statistically they cannot lose more than a week because they always get back per cent <e> <s> of their money <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the noble lord does not understand human nature <e> <s> it is ludicrous to suppose that people will go in on a friday to place bets for a sunday <e>", "<cs> or on a saturday even <e> <s> my lords as regards evening racing there may be some illegal betting <e> <s> i do not know how much <e> <s> shops may remain open until pm <e> <s> the first or second race will have already taken place by then <e> <s> in any case people will have had a full afternoons programme of betting and so they would not necessarily be interested in a programme of evening racing <e> <s> we are talking about ordinary sunday racing of a standard that they expect during the week and during a weekday afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be in one sense viable if it took place without betting off the course but it would create illegal betting <e> <s> that is the danger <e> <s> what is being said will drive people without much money and without telephones into illegal betting <e> <s> one could certainly run race meetings on a sunday and have betting on the course <e> <s> that would be a viable thing to do but it would be an elitest thing to do <e> <s> it would be anti-working class and would not be democratic <e>", "<cs> my lords following the answer given by the noble earl would be care to define what an acute case is <e> <s> he may be aware that recently the consultant surgeon at charing cross hospital mr grant william resigned because sex change operations were being given precedence over acute cancer surgery cases <e>", "<cs> my lords would not a reduction in the number of ashtrays lead to another fire such as that which occured in <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the best trade union reform bill so far but it is still short of ensuring complete democracy for trade union members <e> <s> despite what the noble baroness lady turner said union members very much like the amount of democracy which they have and they would like some more <e> <s> the noble baroness probably thinks that a majority of trade union members still obediently vote labour on the instructions of their union officials but those days have long gone <e> <s> they have left the old reactionaries of the trade union movement miles apart and far adrift from their union members and i am afraid that the noble baroness is even out of touch with her own members <e>", "<cs> my lords i am alleging that there was fraud in the recent election for the presidency of the num on nd january <e> <s> perhaps noble lords would care to read todays <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought from what she was saying that the noble baroness had made some attempt to read the bill <e> <s> the relevance is clear <e> <s> the union to which i have just referred has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> i thought that perhaps the noble baroness had read my articles in the <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord heard of the union of democratic mineworkers <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the photographer as described a moment or two ago surely is that when he is working in his employers time taking photographs at a local wedding the copyright must belong to the employer <e> <s> however if he ceases his official work for his employer and takes other photographs in his spare time as requested by the various guests at the wedding that is another matter entirely <e> <s> i do not believe that that situation would be interfered with an any way by amendment no <e> <s> proposed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have for once to disagree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but i feel that the government will be making a bad mistake if they do not accept the amendment moved by the noble lord lord rochester and supported by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> we are now moving into an area which strikes at the very heart of what trade unions are all about collective action <e> <s> so far the government have done very well in their legislation <e> <s> they have proceeded carefully to make the unions thoroughly democratic in the election of officers and in the right to have a ballot before a strike <e> <s> that is fine <e> <s> i am all in favour of that but once one starts saying that when a majority in a properly conducted ballot has voted for a strike but nevertheless the minority can take no notice of it one begins to make that union ineffective in any sensible way whatsoever <e>", "<cs> despite my reservations as regards an earlier part of the clause i believe that it is preferable to have the whole clause even with one defect than not to have it at all <e>", "<cs> i am not relying on headlines in the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is demonstrating clearly that there is a good deal of dispute about the election of the num which took place on nd january <e>", "<cs> not only was it made out clearly in the survey by the <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e> <s> i did not know that the noble baroness was quite so gullible <e> <s> the electoral reform society was only satisfied that it had counted what it had received <e> <s> the electoral reform society did not send out the ballot papers in the first place and had no idea how many had been printed or how many had been duplicated substituted or added <e> <s> all it did was to count those that came back <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not understand the noble lords point at all <e> <s> as is well known the executive is rather afraid of mr scargill <e> <s> i do not expect much progress from that quarter <e> <s> as for boring the committee some members of the committee seem to be quite interested <e>", "<cs> as it happens i believe statements from members of unions when they carry absolute verisimilitude <e>", "<cs> it is very touching to hear how members opposite desperately go on trying to defend the extraordinary activities of the tgwu <e>", "<cs> we have heard of ballots that have been re-run <e> <s> they were all a shambles <e> <s> they are workplace ballots which notoriously are rigged <e> <s> yet in a nice old-fashioned romantic way some members of the labour benches go on desperately trying to pretend that ballots are always conducted like a sunday school party <e> <s> well they are not <e>", "<cs> for example there was a ludicrously high number of votes cast in ireland- per cent <e> <s> of the people voted <e> <s> has one ever heard of such a thing <e> <s> well one hears of it only in ireland <e> <s> however there are numerous complaints made about false voting and i understand that at least three complaints will be coming from members of the tgwu to the certification officer <e> <s> that should clear <e>", "<cs> i thought that this was the house of lords <e> <s> i did not know it was a newspaper <e> <s> the certification officer will deal with the complaints in a proper manner when he receives them and no doubt he will have lots of help from interested parties <e> <s> my point is that if these amendments are accepted probably the certification officer will not have to act at all because the election will have to be re-run as soon as this bill is enacted <e>", "<cs> one is in a very difficult position when the leading spokesman of the opposition agrees with the spokesman for the government and they are both wrong <e> <s> however i feel helpless in the matter because clearly if we have a division it will go against us <e> <s> however i should like the government to have another look at this amendment <e> <s> it is not directed simply at mr scargill as i carefully pointed out <e> <s> it is directed towards a great many other executives which have been elected under somewhat dubious methods such as the tgwu which regularly elects its executive under very doubtful methods <e>", "<cs> on that understanding rather a weak one i shall withdraw the amendment and return to another charge on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the government may then be more receptive having had further time to reflect <e>", "<cs> i think that my amendment no <e> <s> is included for discussion in this group of amendments <e> <s> i welcome the governments amendment <e> <s> it will save me a great deal of time because i have to answer many letters from readers of the <e>", "<cs> oh yes <e> <s> this used to be done by a show of hands where the landlords as it were being the union bosses made sure that people voted the right way <e> <s> then it progressed further to block votes for the branches and that was manipulated too <e> <s> in some cases it was advanced a little towards workplaces but every time the union rulers were asked to advance and extend the suffrage of their members they resisted <e> <s> they have gone on resisting it <e> <s> it is so absurd because they must know by now that it is what their members want <e> <s> it is the history of mankind that those who have power are very reluctant to give it up <e>", "<cs> do i understand from the minister that the government will seriously work out a practical scheme for implementing my amendment <e> <s> if that is the case i am sure that my noble friends who have been supporting this amendment would be willing for it to be withdrawn <e> <s> i should like a double assurance to make assurance doubly sure before we take the dramatic step of not dividing the committee <e> <s> perhaps we may hear once more from the minister <e>", "<cs> in view of that assurance which can be followed up if it does not materialise at report stage i happily withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister a question <e> <s> does he realise that it is not the union officially which may necessarily victimise the person concerned but rather activists and enthusiastic fanatics who take the matter into their own hands <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why people are frightened to come forward and be out of line with their union <e> <s> it is not necessarily the union officials who are concerned <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try to explain to the minister what i mean <e> <s> i am not asking <e>", "<cs> no not at all <e> <s> well i suppose that i shall have to ask leave to withdrawn it but i think that it has not been given sufficient consideration <e> <s> however it is much too late at night and everybody wants to go home which i understand completely <e>", "<cs> but this is not the correct way to deal with something that is so important and fundamental to the legislation <e> <s> it ought to be given serious thought <e> <s> i hoped that it could have been postponed to another day instead of our trying to deal with it when only about members of the committee are present <e>", "<cs> i suppose it might be interpreted as that <e>", "<cs> my lords unless the minister gives a more definite assurance that the matter will be looked at again and that a definition will be found for national industrial dispute i shall have to ask the house to divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we have said to the trade union movement that we shall all be democrats that we shall provide elaborate machinery to make sure that ballots are conducted properly that the people the members intend to elect are elected and that the decisions taken are the genuine decisions of the members <e> <s> then we say to them that this will operate for all issues other than a ballot for a strike so that if the minority do not like the majority verdict they can act accordingly <e> <s> this goes to the root of what a trade union is about <e> <s> if it cannot have collective association it is nothing <e> <s> if it cannot depend on the loyalty of members when they have arrived at a collective decision it can make no headway with employers or even with its own members <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i prefer the wording of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would have placed the obligation for the production and distribution of the ballot papers more squarely on the independent scrutineer <e> <s> however i am grateful to the government for having considered the point carefully <e> <s> a greater power has now been given to the independent scrutineer <e> <s> combined with his duty under subsection e and subsection b of clause to make a report confirming that everything has been printed counted and distributed properly that ought to make it fairly watertight <e> <s> i cannot imagine any professional person making a report to the union that in some way was false <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments amendment no <e> <s> because it provides for just about all the requirements set down in the amendment tabled by the noble baroness lady blatch and myself <e> <s> it will be a great encouragement to many people who might be afraid of victimisation if they are exposed as having complained against their union and they may well be justified in that worry <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the point just made by the noble lord lord mccarthy it is not true that the unions have always complied with the certification officers declaration <e> <s> in two cases at least nalgo and the tass union which has now merged with astms refused to comply with the certification officers declaration <e> <s> nobody could be found brave enough to go on his own account to the court to have that declaration implemented <e> <s> although nalgo has now put itself in order in these matters tass did not have time to do so before it was merged <e> <s> i hope it will be a better behaved union in future in its new guise <e> <s> nevertheless it is not true that all declarations made by the certification officer are carried out by the unions concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary it had ample time it was two years ago <e> <s> it has run out of time because it does not exist any more <e> <s> if i had been a member of tass run by communists who had never stood for any sort of election under a vote-free ballot i myself should have been frightened to go to court <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i did not quite hear what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the action of tass or the failure of tass to hold proper elections under the act was challenged by a member of tass or more than one <e> <s> the certification officer issued a declaration that tass had not complied with the act and should do so <e> <s> thereafter there was nobody brave enough to go to the court to get that declaration implemented <e> <s> i can understand why in the circumstances of that particular union <e> <s> however i hope that in its new life under the wings of the noble baroness who has just spoken it will be a reformed character <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see fit to do as the minister suggests <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy thinks that the amendment has something to do with unofficial strikes <e> <s> it has nothing to do with them <e> <s> unofficial strikes are by their very nature unofficial and cannot be controlled neatly by law <e> <s> it is clear from the amendment that i am talking about a member of a trade union who claims that the union has without the support of a ballot authorised or endorsed any industrial action in which members of that union take part in an industrial dispute <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it must be read in relation to clause <e> <s> where there is to be such a ballot in the case of those which are not proposed or intended to be organised by the executive of a union there must be a postal ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the threat of the tuc to expel the engineers and electricians if they agree to single union working is something that ought to or could be referred as a restrictive practice to the mmc <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chelwood said that the bill has no friends <e> <s> i believe that he is already finding that the bill has friends in this house <e> <s> whatever may have been the moral victor in the argument in another place it certainly will not be the victor here <e> <s> indeed i do not believe that it was a victor in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly is <e> <s> the opposition to it is mainly anecdotal <e> <s> examples are given where some people will be adversely affected <e> <s> the majority who will be favourably affected are never mentioned nor is the desirability of trying to make local democracy work <e>", "<cs> the case for the speedy abolition of ilea is overwhelming and i do not want to dwell on it

secretary of state will be tied <e> <s> he can do nothing about making new arrangements until he knows what the panel is proposing to him <e> <s> even then he has to decide whether or not he agrees

futures <e> <s> it will just be a collection of experts advising and telling other experts what to do and they would never agree in any case <e>", "<cs> at least we have agreement on that <e> <s> members of the other place were elected we were not <e> <s> in making alterations to central parts of legislation passed by a majority in another place we run the risk of serious danger <e> <s> we may say that we pass a major amendment only to give the government and the other place the opportunity to reconsider the matter but in practice we are holding up significant legislation which has been passed in the other place <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to say a word i should like to point out that my daughter attended st pauls school and it did not cost anything like <e>", "<cs> it was more recent than that two years <e>", "<cs> this amendment really deals with inability to pay or what is perceived to be inability to pay <e> <s> that has already been dealt with very

whole thing is to be destroyed <e> <s> i am glad that noble lords opposite have given us some evidence of their real intention which is not to support what they have described as a mild amendment to

getting out <e> <s> therefore the chinese government will take care to behave properly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that hong kong citizens had exactly the same rights as portuguese overseas nationals until as regards having a british passport <e> <s> after that date we took it away <e> <s> is it not dishonourable to allow falklanders and gibraltarians to keep their british passports while depriving hong kong citizens of theirs when they are in exactly the same position <e> <s> none of those lands wanted to be independent we have forced independence upon hong kong <e>", "<cs> if these amendments are passed the whole of this important bill which has been passed in all its stages by the elected chamber will be destroyed <e> <s> the amendments would create a totally different bill and make it mean something quite different from what it means now <e> <s> to take such a grave step in passing these amendments might be justified if the issue was fundamental to the future of the country but it is not <e> <s> it might be justified if the constitution itself was threatened but it is not <e>", "<cs> the commission certainly did in fact it took several months to do so <e> <s> moreover the commission knows what it is talking about <e> <s> the bill fulfils the requirements of the report <e> <s> there is nothing in the statutory water company <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to see that some noble lords laugh at the simple pleasures of ordinary people <e> <s> i prefer not to do so <e> <s> the whole <e>", "<cs> yes they are i think that i am beginning to educate the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> when you get a larger and more reliable firm in the business then of course you will get a much more reliable service <e> <s> that in turn will encourage the other privatised plumbers to smarten up and become more efficient <e> <s> that is so obviously a part of competition that i should have thought even the noble lord on the opposition front bench would have understood it <e>", "<cs> i think that the objectives which the noble lord lord mcintosh has in mind are highly desirable <e> <s> his amendments would strengthen the possibility that such objectives could be achieved <e> <s> therefore i should like to express my support for them <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a word in favour of the much-maligned conifer forest <e> <s> these trees are extremely attractive evergreens <e> <s> they look very agreeable in the winter when they illuminate and make more pleasurable the landscape <e> <s> i do not believe it is true that they are busy killing fish life and wildlife <e> <s> after all they grow in profusion in many parts of the world and people are fishing like mad for salmon and god knows what else in the lakes and rivers below them <e> <s> i hope that the government will not listen to all this obscurantist prejudice against the charming conifer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble lord for his welcome indication that there will now be greater flexibility in granting passports with the right of abode to hong kong citizens <e> <s> however will he bear in mind that it is quite absurd to suppose that million people would come here <e> <s> they want those passports with the right of abode as an insurance against the chinese turning nasty <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the possession of those passports will be a great bar to the chinese turning nasty and that they may never be used at all <e> <s> they are only an insurance policy <e> <s> it is not an opening of the flood gates to mass immigration here <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the announcement of increased flexibility for issuing passports to hong kong subjects will the government bear in mind that it is not sufficient merely to give them to top civil servants but also to those who are the top of commerce and industry in the territory <e> <s> if that is not done the whole of hong kong will collapse long before <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister warn his right honourable and learned friend that the situation in hong kong the low morale and the brain drain is deteriorating far faster than is understood in whitehall <e> <s> unless the foreign secretary goes with something really positive to say he may well be in danger of being lynched <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that that shows that our overseas financial position is still in a healthy state and that much of the worry about our alleged balance of payments deficit is totally unnecessary particularly as billion worth of deficit recorded in the balance of payments last year was due to wrong accounting and never occurred at all <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord deny that in the labour government had borrowed an enormous sum from the imf and elsewhere abroad which the next government had to pay back and did so <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that all these balance of payments figures are quite ridiculous <e> <s> last year the imf calculated that the world was in deficit with itself by billion dollars which is obviously an impossibility <e> <s> these figures are all nonsense because the accounts are not kept properly <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say how many pedestrians under the influence of drink are killed by motor cars because they are walking about drunk <e> <s> should not the government give a warning to people at christmas-time that they should not wander around drunk and be a hazard to drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ask the government to request the chinese government in peking to stop their corrupt officials on the mainland from provisioning and fuelling the immigrants boats as they voyage from port to port on the mainland <e> <s> those officials do that in return for bribes <e> <s> they also allow immigrants to travel in buses to the coast from where they can take boats to hong kong <e> <s> last week i was told by senior police officials in hong kong that the people who travelled by such a route constituted per cent <e> <s> of the problem <e> <s> they considered that if the chinese prevented those illegal immigrants from leaving their coast it would result in only per cent <e> <s> of the present number of refugees arriving <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell the government at least to treble the number they first thought of in this context <e> <s> otherwise with so many people wishing to leave hong kong and requiring residential qualifications elsewhere for passports there will be a breakdown in hong kong before <e> <s> will he ask the government to ignore the rough element in the tory party who seem to have forgotten the tradition that their party once had of care for the subjects of the british empire <e> <s> will he also tell the government to ignore the envious element of the labour party who cannot bear the thought of a few industrious hong kongers coming here who would not be on social security and who would not vote labour <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that if the workers in the highly inefficient ambulance service want more pay they should propose higher productivity and savings in that service to pay for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the liberal democrats have been very helpful in putting down this motion <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that it is important to keep developing events in hong kong under frequent review <e> <s> the noble lord lord bonham-carter made a wide-ranging and interesting speech <e> <s> i agreed with quite a lot of that speech <e> <s> i congratulate the government on making some movement on passports <e> <s> it is not enough but it is a start <e> <s> i am sure that if the chinese are looking really nasty as approaches the warmhearted british public will be willing for the numbers with right of abode to be increased <e> <s> however we now have something which we can show to other countries to encourage them to give similar help to hong kongers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the labour-controlled council of wigan made a very attractive show of developing its area so much so that the tote of which i am chairman moved the whole of its credit headquarters to that region because of the inducements offered <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be far better if the ancient and obsolete laws of blasphemy were removed altogether <e> <s> every religion should be allowed to take criticism like every other organisation <e> <s> if it is strong enough to exist as a religion then it has nothing whatever to worry about <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the customs and excise will not impound my winnings if i get them from a west germany lottery in which i take part <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the cost of rerunning the election will be to be borne either by the taxpayer or as many union members think by the union members themselves <e> <s> is he further aware that the independent scrutineer who was appointed failed to keep charge of the distribution of the votes and allowed about to be held at the headquarters of the transport and general workers union where they were targeted on nine marginal seats in an election which he did not even know was being conducted <e> <s> is the minister also aware that it is laid <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a feeling of numbness in hong kong and that morale in the police force and the civil service is at rock bottom <e> <s> can he assure the house that the government will do their utmost to try to improve the amount of democracy in hong kong before we leave so that the people in that unhappy place will have some kind of protection whether or not the peking government continue their hard line <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords while i support the noble and gallant lord lord bramall on the question of the community charge perhaps i may ask whether the government will also consider dropping their foolish intention to reduce the number of gurkhas and consider deploying them to northern ireland where they would put the fear of god into the terrorists whether so-called loyalists or ira <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that contrary to what was said the new national curriculum has found widespread support among the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this morning in red square thousands of demonstrators demanded the immediate return of independence to lithuania and the baltic states and the ending of the illegal blockage and booed mr gorbachev off the may day platform <e> <s> also can we not send some encouragement to lithuania and the baltic states and stop urging them to give in to whatever mr gorbachev wants in the way that we told czechoslovakia to give in to hitler <e> <s> can we not at least send some humanitarian supplies to lithuania to lift the blockade because lithuania is still a sovereign nation and we have never said that it is anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government of the soviet union have at last admitted to lying when they said that the nazis massacred the polish officers at katyn can we not persuade them to admit that they are lying when they say that the rape of the baltic states by agreement with hitler did not end the sovereignty of those nations which at the time were members of the league of nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be brief i have to apologise for not being able to be here later <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord ardwick had the kind of body about which i am talking he would have been able to have some redress <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it was because of the appalling oppression by the chinese in tibet that the people of hong kong began to get extremely worried about our agreement to hand over hong kong to china <e> <s> therefore it is of the utmost importance to bear down upon peking in the knowledge that the worse the chinese behave in tibet the worse their relations with hong kong will be <e>", "<cs> i support the general burden of what the noble earl has just said and should like to add a few points of my own <e> <s> i have been amazed by these amendments <e> <s> they are the brainchild of bsb the embittered soured disappointed and unsuccessful rival of sky <e> <s> they bear the hallmark of that bitterness and disappointment <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble baroness did not understand what she was saying <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i apologise for being rude <e> <s> i shall be as polite as i can <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble baroness to say that an objection to mr murdoch having more than per cent <e> <s> of sky television was that in the <e>", "<cs> the only purpose that the noble baroness could have had in saying that was to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may proceed with my speech after those massive interruptions <e> <s> the basic point is that the movers of the amendment want mr murdochs television station destroyed as soon as it makes a profit for it to lose its investment and leave the way clear for bsb <e> <s> that is quite unnecessary because there are already about channels with plenty of variety available <e> <s> as i have already said sky is willing to be subjected to all the impartiality rules that apply to others <e>", "<cs> i clearly stated my interests during the second reading debate <e> <s> if i am required to state my interests every time i speak i shall take much longer <e>", "<cs> i declare my interest therefore <e> <s> i write for the murdoch newspapers <e> <s> i do not appear on sky but i have appeared on bsb <e>", "<cs> might it be convenient to the committee if i moved amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> perhaps it will be convenient to the committee if i now speak to amendment no <e> <s> and those amendments grouped with it <e> <s> if that is the case i shall proceed to do so <e> <s> i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to and which stand in my name and those of other noble lords <e>", "<cs> mr roger bolton is itvs controller of factual programmes <e> <s> he produced the questionable documentary death on the rock <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl would like me to answer his question <e> <s> no i certainly would not <e> <s> that is why amendments nos <e> <s> and include a provision to add to the remit of the broadcasting standards council which already supervises the bbc on matters of taste decency violence and sexual conduct the drawing up of a code of practice on due impartiality with an appeals procedure for complaints of alleged failure to observe it <e> <s> that is all i ask <e>", "<cs> i am much encouraged by much of what the noble earl said particularly with regard to having a form of code of practice on due impartiality partly on the face of the bill <e> <s> however when the government publish this code will it be published openly well before report stage so that we may examine it and see whether we are satisfied that the objective has been achieved <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble earl to say concerning the amendments to clause that it was the governments intention to put on the face of the bill a code or guidelines as to what due impartiality meant <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl has said in going some way to meet the substance of our amendment we await with interest the product of the governments labours <e> <s> in the meantime we shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it was always my understanding that the government intended to watch the situation carefully <e> <s> i understood that if he situation with regard to peking deteriorated considerably the government would consider taking a number greater than <e> <s> it is better to have the amendment on the face of the bill because it will give latitude to the governor and enable him to answer circumstances that might change for the worse <e> <s> on the other hand circumstances may change for the better and the provision will never be activated <e> <s> however if it were on the face of the bill a great deal of unnecessary discussion would be saved should an emergency arise <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider publishing the details of all the other countries instead of one at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment to which my name should have been attached but for some slip in the public bill office <e> <s> the amendment does not risk large numbers being added to the already due to come to britain <e> <s> if the situation deteriorates under this amendment the government would decide the numbers <e> <s> the decision would have to be approved by both houses <e> <s> the amendment is necessary because a nasty situation could blow up between now and <e> <s> there might be an emergency which did not leave enough time for some new act of parliament to be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust the noble earl will forgive my intervention but can he tell the house just who the figure was negotiated with <e> <s> it was not negotiated with the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not so much that the house is shocked at the late arrival of these amendments but that they seem to be surprised that there has always been a requirement in the law for due impartiality on matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current public policy as the noble earl lord ferrers pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> that illustrates my point <e> <s> by some strange upside down logic the governments amendment is described as censorship <e> <s> however it is the exact opposite <e> <s> the amendment is designed to make sure that on major matters of political controversy there is an adequate opportunity for an opposite view or views to those expressed in the original programme to be aired <e> <s> it is those who wish to suppress the dissenting views who are the censors <e> <s> it is those who are denying the right of reply in some form to a controversial programme that happens very often who are the real censors <e> <s> supporters of the governments amendment do not mind how many biased programmes are broadcast i certainly do not mind provided an adequate opportunity for reply is allowed <e> <s> we do not wish to censor any programme <e> <s> under this amendment no programme would ever be censored <e> <s> no programme would have been censored in the past under the terms of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain what is the matter with his own guideline code on impartiality in the bbc <e> <s> i find it very satisfactory <e> <s> if such guidelines can be worked out what is his complaint <e> <s> the only trouble is that he is not enforcing them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the amendment does not propose that an ombudsman should be placed in the bbc but in each licensed service of the itc the new commission <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i should like that very much <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> does not the broadcasting standards council have authority over the bbc and as at present in the bill already override the royal charter <e> <s> so what is the matter with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said i am happy to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that every effort will be made to persuade the bbc to conform and comply with the code of instructions contained in clause when it is finalised <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already been round this course a number of times before and i have not heard anything new <e> <s> nor i believe have your lordships <e> <s> as the noble lord lord goodman pointed out there has always been a requirement in the legislation for due impartiality <e> <s> that is why the iba drew up a code explaining how that should be carried out the bbc has a code in a similar vein <e> <s> otherwise they would not have done that <e>", "<cs> my lords there never has been a provision such as the noble lord has described <e> <s> the matter has always been covered by the interviewer asking the intelligent questions that an opponent might have asked <e> <s> just because one has mrs thatcher being asked questions on the news one does not also have to have mr kinnock being asked questions <e> <s> it is the interviewers job to create balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it extremely odd that at the last minute we are offered this amendment which aims to particularise certain programmes which must be made and which says that some of the programmes must be shown at peak viewing time and others must be shown at other times <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady david said they are all to be enumerated <e>"]
