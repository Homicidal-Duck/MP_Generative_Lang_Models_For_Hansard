["<cs> my lords i have enjoyed every minute of the noble lords speech but i hope he will remember who it was who destroyed the grammar schools that have produced some of the greatest labour and national leaders this country has ever had <e> <s> i also hope he will remember that even under a labour government there was still a unit in the british army where it was necessary to teach people to read and write <e> <s> that was going on under a labour government i am not sure whether it is still going on <e> <s> so it is not all black and white <e> <s> surely grammar schools and comprehensives can go on together <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that there were some very good athletes who would have won medals in the and olympic games but who are dead and buried and would he further agree that that was in part caused by some of us who were stupid enough to go to watch the games and by some who took part in them <e>", "<cs> may i add my support to the last speaker and say how much i disagree with my noble friend lord eccles <e> <s> i work for two separate weeks each year with the handicapped and i know how their parents feel <e> <s> this is an occasion when we should take no notice of government spokesmen or experts <e> <s> this is an occasion when we should vote with our hearts and for our conscience and for no other reason <e> <s> i hope your lordships will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> in rising to speak i shall be brief and to the point <e> <s> the only justification that i have for speaking is that i am here elected by some higher body than the other place and because in the history of this place it has always been the hereditary peers who are more in touch with the feeling in the country than those in the other chamber <e> <s> those of us in this position are absolutely clear about the feeling of the vast majority of the people of this country and it is against this clause <e> <s> i come from kent and all these letters and telegrams that i am holding are from kent <e> <s> kent the worst county of all in this respect plans to charge for each secondary school child <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak purely personally on behalf of nobody and no one other than myself <e> <s> as many of you know i spend a considerable time at the bottom or half way down trenches in the earth excavating iron age and romano-british items which i am lucky to have on my own land <e> <s> i therefore welcome this bill enormously <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord abinger for having introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that whether we be christians jews or moslems we have nothing but shame to carry for what has happened in the lebanon and that anything that can be done should be done to help that situation now <e>", "<cs> my lords as the most junior officer so far to speak i would first remind your lordships that the services were the first nationalised industry that they are the one that has never gone on strike and has never wanted to do so and that they go on doing their duty <e> <s> most of this paper some of which is good has become known to us only by leaks <e> <s> this is a complaint i have had against the present government and other governments that there are too many official leaks and as a result there are many unofficial leaks <e> <s> if that is not bad for the morale of those concerned i do not know what is <e> <s> there have been leaks on this very question <e>", "<cs> the speeches i have heard so far seem to apply only to very rich farmers <e> <s> the account book would not allow the idea of small farmers like me buying in and storing extra fertilisers because they might get banned <e> <s> the noble lord who sits on this side of the committee said that we should not spray on sundays or at oclock <e> <s> again a small farm you spray when you can when the land is dry not when it is wet in the morning or wet again in the evening dew <e> <s> i think we should be practical on this matter and look at the ordinary small farmers point of view <e>", "<cs> once more your lordships are considering and thinking of rich large farmers and once more you are ignoring the small <e>", "<cs> my lords i too object to being asked to get up so late at night and there are more unfortunate people to speak after me <e> <s> it is bad management and it is easier to say so from these benches rather than from any others i suppose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about fluorine <e>", "<cs> my lords as an englishman i have always assumed that scottish water was highly dangerous unless mixed with the local whisky <e> <s> what those of us who feel against this bill but accept it reluctantly at this stage and therefore support this amendment is that it may be good for children from nought to two <e> <s> what we do not know is the long-term effect of continued use and how it can be safely done <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe it <e> <s> therefore i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> although i have little interest in churches built after ad apart from those that were built on sites used before ad i should like to say as a roman catholic that i am sure catholics in this country welcome what has been said by the minister and are grateful to him <e> <s> if i may keep my speech shorter still thank you <e>", "<cs> i thought that everyone was now in favour of freedom of the press and freedom of information being pushed as widely as possible <e> <s> now we understand that that is not so <e> <s> why should people pay per cent <e> <s> more for recording something they like at home <e> <s> why should an unemployed man have to pay per cent <e> <s> more for recording a football match <e> <s> if we want wider freedom let us have it here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us are becoming more and more worried about donors and parts of the body which may or may not be given <e> <s> perhaps like the government we are awaiting some words of wisdom from the churches and indeed other religions in this country on what is right and what is wrong <e> <s> if ones own wife or child is suffering from something which can be cured by the use of an organ from an aborted foetus one will selfishly want that to be done <e> <s> however is that right <e> <s> many of us are becoming more and more worried and we should be grateful for some advice <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not agree that censorship is a two-way matter <e> <s> does he agree with the censorship of that play which happens to support britain in the falklands <e> <s> does he agree with the censorship of my eldest son cut off in midstream on television about to tell the truth of the man behind the gibraltar programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene <e> <s> i put down my name but it was omitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try again <e> <s> i have looked at my list of speakers and the noble lord lord mishcon is not on it <e> <s> i do not believe that your lordships realise what the public really feel <e> <s> they are becoming fed up <e> <s> they see these ghastly things happening and they want action to be taken <e> <s> the government are now proposing that action and please god let it take place <e> <s> reasonably quickly after lunch i shall stop to buy petrol on the way home <e> <s> i shall take in my credit card and in one second exactly what i have spent will have been recorded and i cannot see much difficulty in that <e>"]
