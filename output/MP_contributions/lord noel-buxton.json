["<cs> my lords i rise to address your lordships for the first time and in adhering to the traditions of the house i would crave your lordships indulgence <e> <s> i understand that when making your maiden speech you should not in fact speak on something which is too close to your heart <e> <s> although i am in fact a solicitor in private practice dealing largely with company and commercial matters i cannot say that company law is that close to my heart <e> <s> it is something that i must as it were live with and know something about in order to advise clients <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i understand that it is easy for british telecom to find the particulars of a subscriber merely from a telephone number <e> <s> that is how british telecom works when it goes about billing the use of a telephone <e> <s> the vast majority of businessmen put their telephone number on their written business material in any case <e> <s> an obligation so to do should place no extra burden or only a minimal extra burden on businesses <e> <s> having required unincorporated businesses to publish their telephone number there automatically arises an easy means of identifying the businessman <e> <s> so far so good <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to my noble friend for that explanation and in the circumstances i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support my noble friend lord selkirk <e> <s> at second reading i described section of the companies act as the dreaded section <e> <s> i had hoped that the government against the background of their proposals to give power to a company to purchase its own shares would put down their own amendment <e> <s> i do not see <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to my noble and learned friend for that very full response to my series of amendments <e> <s> i am particularly obliged to him for making the points on lawful dividends which i had not fully appreciated and of course for the remarks of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> in recognition of the desirability of keeping the basis of the governments discussions with interested parties consistent and of course in view of what my noble and learned friend has said i have no hesitation in begging leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this bill and to suggest some further amendments which could usefully be made to the trade marks act at this stage <e> <s> i might possibly differ very slightly from the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in this respect but i think he may agree with me that my proposed amendments are of a minor nature and could not and will not overload this bill <e>", "<cs> i wholeheartedly agree with my noble friends who have just spoken <e> <s> my difficulty is something of a procedural one too <e> <s> i have yet another alternative to clause which is really its deletion and an amended clause <e> <s> but i suppose strictly speaking that i should only speak on whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i do not really want to oppose that though i do not want the clause to stand part if my noble friend lord lucas would assure me that the government will satisfy what i understand to be the feeling of the committee which is that clause as drafted will not do <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend the minister for that response <e> <s> of course i cannot take in everything that he has said this afternoon but it sounds good to me <e> <s> the major point that he assured me upon was what i was seeking that a parent company is not made liable for its insolvent subsidiarys debts by virtue only that the subsidiary directors are used to take the direction of the parent board <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i now beg to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my aim is exactly the same as that of my noble friend not to confuse the reader <e> <s> therefore it is probably better if i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for that assurance and on that basis i have no hesitation in begging leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all most grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for the statement he made <e> <s> indeed that gratitude will extend beyond this committee <e> <s> i am also most grateful to my noble friend for the generosity with which he invited this debate <e> <s> needless to say i have absolutely no hesitation in withdrawing this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to record my thanks to the government and to my noble friend lord lucas for what they have done with regard to clauses and <e> <s> i am particularly pleased because the proposals seem to reflect what i would have proposed by virtue of my amendments to clause which i put down on the last occasion and then in the circumstances withdrew <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to my noble friend for what he has just said <e> <s> i must admit that what the noble lord lord meston said did rather hit home <e> <s> i am sure that there is very little between my noble friend the minister and myself as regards what we are trying to do <e> <s> i fear that we are rather dropping into semantics <e> <s> let us leave the matter at that for the moment <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the minister for his assurances on the two subsidiary points that i made <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words on amendments nos <e> <s> and although the noble lord lord benson in fact moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not actually agree with that amendment but i very much agree with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it is unreasonable to expect of any person in any circumstances that he takes every step without qualification <e> <s> so unreasonable is such a concept that i suspect the court would surely qualify it and may no doubt use the very words used in this amendment <e> <s> be that as it may let us put the matter beyond all doubt and insert the words reasonable and open to him as suggested by amendments nos <e> <s> and which i support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to record my thanks to the government and to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for these amendments to schedule which have fulfilled the assurances that were given in response to the amendments moved by me in committee <e> <s> of course i should like the period of months to be reduced to six months as i said in committee but i take my noble and learned friends point that it is for those who seek to change the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment as well as as i did last time my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> the amendment is in substance the same as one which i put down at committee stage <e> <s> i spoke to it then and again on report and i do not propose to repeat today what i said on those two other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment moved by my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this amendment moved by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> my noble friend lord erroll of hale and myself moved in committee similar amendments which i hope we fully explained at that time and which accord entirely with what my noble friend lord mottistone proposes today <e>"]
