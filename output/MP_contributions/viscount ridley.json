["<cs> may i too support this amendment <e> <s> i believe it would have the general support of educational authorities in the country <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the point raised by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i should have thought that a governor appointed by the education authority was just as likely as anybody if not more so to pass these hostile resolutions she spoke of <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will reject this amendment <e> <s> i speak with experience of one who has been on the governing body of a school situated very close to a boundary <e> <s> i can think of nothing in this amendment which would not lead to considerable friction between the two authorities and i am sure that it would be wrong to make it part of law <e> <s> obviously there will be consultations and i have tabled a later amendment dealing with this <e> <s> however to have a compulsory requirement under the bill would be wrong <e>", "<cs> i think we would all have a great deal of sympathy with the objects of the amendment <e> <s> i certainly do having been responsible for the appointment of such bodies and anybody who can should try to get these people of experience in local industry involved <e> <s> may <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will leave this provision in the bill <e> <s> i think the link between a primary school and the parish council where there is a parish council has proved extremely valuable and i think it would cause a great deal of unhappiness in the rural community if this link were to be compulsorily discontinued <e> <s> there are of course other arguments to be advanced when we are talking about a district council which may or may not be a very large authority and it is not necessarily a minor one either <e> <s> but where we have a parish council and we do over most of england and wales or england anyway then i think we should try to keep this link between the primary school and the parish council if it is at all possible <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me almost meaningless <e> <s> people who are representative of local communities arc the parish and district councillors whom we are already agreed should be on this body <e>", "<cs> as i very nearly put down an amendment in identical <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady david invoked my aid in support of this amendment and tried to <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether we are ever unanimous <e> <s> it was the strongly held opinion of the education committee of that association <e>", "<cs> that comes in a later clause in the bill <e> <s> i do not have the reference with mebut recoupment is dealt with later in the bill <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances and subject to whether we ever get to clause i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady david has again provoked me i think deliberately and i am delighted to respond <e> <s> i think she is correct in saying that the acc do not like schedule they would prefer to see such matters left to reasonable regulations to be published by the secretary of state after consultation <e> <s> on the other hand we do not always trust secretaries of state but as your lordships house is filled with ex-secretaries of state i had better be careful <e> <s> so we are in a dilemma and i have an amendment to schedule which may be helpful <e> <s> the problem of schedule is one which we have not yet reached so i prefer to sit on the fence a little longer <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord belstead said that the relevant committees were not committees of the county council or of the education authority <e> <s> however my noble friend lady young said they were <e> <s> this point is important because these committees will be referred to the ombudsman <e>

support <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness lady david in wishing to remove this schedule <e> <s> i have already said that the acc dislike it <e> <s> it is bureaucratic and the more i look at it the more i dislike it <e> <s> it will be most expensive and by the time we have obeyed all this we shall find that some minor regulation has been broken by one or other of the members of the appeal committee and we shall be back to square one <e> <s> the whole thing is slower <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness lady david will press this point and i shall support it not that it will make the slightest difference to the result of course <e>", "<cs> may i say in the interests of brevity that my own amendment no <e> <s> is very much on the same point that the noble baroness has made <e> <s> that particular clause is frightening to local authorities because it is askingabout almost any matter relating to education which may be required <e> <s> examination results are very much in the minds of local authoritiesso in speaking in support i hope i can save the committee some time <e> <s> this matter should not be too open-ended <e>", "<cs> i am
