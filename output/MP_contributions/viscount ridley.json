employ direct labour in the highways departments and so forth are not affected and are not as i have said opposing the spirit of this part of the bill <e> <s> all the same they will be very deeply

question <e> <s> i understand that discussions on the details involved are likely to follow when the bill becomes an act <e> <s> one thing that will be considered is that the population of an

falling and central government expenditure is rising and the wrong target is being aimed at <e> <s> the only statistic i would add is that i think it is true to say that the cost of local government is going up a great deal less quickly than the cost of the newspapers which are habitually criticising local government at every possible opportunity <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord evans because i did not hear the beginning of his speech but i was interested in the suggestions which he has put forward which as other noble lords have said are constructive <e> <s> what is suggested is somewhat similar to the scottish system and i wondered whether he had taken some of it from our friends north of the border <e> <s> noble lords may remember that i raised this on second reading but i still have not had an answer from the minister about the scottish system <e> <s> if it is not wasting any time i wonder whether the noble lord can say whether it applies to scotland and

association of county councils and all its members <e> <s> nothing that has happened in the last two months has made me change my mind one detail i wish that the alternatives that were put forward to

i have some experience of derelict land above ground which the noble lord lord evans has mentioned and i want to support him very strongly <e> <s> northumberland the county of which i was chairman for many years has an unrivalled record for clearing away the scars of the mining industry and i think what the noble lord has just said will be regarded as a very serious blow to the very intensive programme which is nearly completed in the north-east at least if not in the north-west <e> <s> i hope he can think again because the per cent <e> <s> grant has made it possible to do a tremendous amount of work on one of the few things that can be done for the depressed areas of this country <e> <s> it was thanks to the government through the noble lord lord sandford when he was a minister on this very bench that we got so much done and it would be a pity if this government were to bring all this to a stop <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken on this subject when we debated part viii of the bill <e> <s> it is an absolute coincidence that i have managed to get halfway between the two figures selected by the noble lord and equally i should be happy to settle for any of those figures <e>

finished <e> <s> i support any of these amendments <e>", "<cs> we have heard a good deal about my noble friend wrestling with this subject when he was a councillor in leeds <e> <s> i am still a councillor and i am still wrestling with it <e> <s> i may be the only councillor in this chamber at the moment <e> <s> so i know what i am talking about too <e> <s> the noble lord said that the government cannot react to long-term decisions on expenditure but do it from year to year or one might say from hand to mouth <e> <s> at the moment if one gets approval under the present system for a large project say a school or a by-pass which is likely to take three or four years to construct if loan sanction for the whole project is given regardless of how long it takes to complete that would spread over several financial years <e> <s> that means forward planning <e> <s> the authority knows it can finish the school or the by-pass once it has approval to go ahead <e> <s> surely we are asking not even so much as that <e> <s> i do hope the noble lord will take this away and look at it sympathetically <e>", "<cs> i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i still think that the spirit of the agreement to use capital receipts is watered down by this clause but i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> my own amendment no <e> <s> is almost exactly similar <e> <s> in some extraordinary way we seem to follow each other in a ping-pong game across the chamber <e> <s> we in the acc feel that modest relaxation of this kind would be of tremendous help

affairs of the association of county councils who i am afraid i have to say do not really like this bill <e> <s> although they would not feel that it is of major importance it makes the assumption

amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word on lord melchetts amendment <e> <s> it seems to me he was speaking purely from the experience of an east anglian farmer on light land which they have in

interfering too much in the functions of local authorities <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support to the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i think this is something that the association of county

remain so <e> <s> to introduce the secretary of state is bound to create not only delay but extra expense <e> <s> i hope that the government will resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> can this be included in the guidance to local authorities <e> <s> i think it would be better done that way than by way of an amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to join in the nuclear bombardment or

by the payment of realistic bounties which have done a great deal and which i think have been largely responsible for the increase in soldiers over the last two years and i hope the government will allow the bounties to keep pace with inflation because we must find ways to prevent soldiers leaving too soon <e> <s> the current rate of wastage at per cent <e> <s> is much too high <e>", "<cs> my lords i probably know a great deal less about this subject than any noble lord who has already spoken <e> <s> my only personal experience came as chairman of my planning committee when i was referred to the ombudsman over an application to deal with hazardous waste <e> <s> during the very courteous but inquisitorial methods of the ombudsman i learned a great deal about him but not very much more

withdraw this amendment with a view to getting some kind of compromise at report stage <e> <s> but i must say quite clearly that if we cannot get any agreement i am quite prepared to put the matter to the test at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> j <e>", "<cs> if i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> h which was moved a very long time ago my noble friend did say that he had consulted or would consult the local authority associations on this matter <e> <s> if he had consulted the association of county councils he would have found them totally and unanimously opposed to this new clause particularly as i have already said because it duplicates clause to which we have already reluctantly agreed <e> <s> my noble friend may say that they are totally separate processes and are not in any way related but from the point of view of a local authority about to be subjected to these processes they will look to be very much the same <e> <s> it does not matter whether one is looking down the barrel of a -bore shotgun or a -bore shotgun the effect is much the same at short range <e> <s> i suggest that is the case here <e>", "<cs> i am grateful again to the noble baroness <e> <s> she raised one specific point about whether the resignations should be to the chief executive or the chairman of the commission <e> <s> i feel the point is neither here nor there but she is probably right in what she says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for clearly establishing the fact that the fees paid to any future member of the audit commission will come out of local government or partly out of ratepayers pockets <e> <s> having established that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has just eaten some excellent scrambled eggs <e> <s> i watched her doing it <e>", "<cs> i did <e> <s> may i ask just one more question <e> <s> i can see that the government are not going to give way on this but will they make appropriate arrangements under the rate support grant for the estimated expenses of this commission to be taken into account in the annual negotiations <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we seem to be incapable of discussing clause without getting into a procedural muddle <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord evans led us into the lobby on what was probably the wrong amendment this is the one on which i would gladly have followed him <e> <s> however my purpose is simple on the matter <e> <s> it is an extremely complicated and awkward subject and at this hour it does not deserve to take our time <e> <s> but i wish to place squarely on the record that the association of county councils are opposed strongly and firmly to any amendment of any kind to clause <e> <s> they believe for better or worse that a respectable and reasonable compromise on this difficult subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would be expected on behalf of the county councils to oppose quite strongly this amendment but i cannot do so because there is a great deal of merit in the equity as the noble lord lord hill has said and it is difficult to argue against principles <e> <s> but i think it is a pity that this amendment has been brought forward very late in the day <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk has given many of the objections to it and i would endorse what she has said <e> <s> secondly i think there could have been much more consultation on the detail <e> <s> finally i would say that it only serves to highlight what we have pointed out so often the totally unsatisfactory nature of the precepting system <e> <s> i hope that this will be the last occasion w hen we have to <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he would answer one question <e> <s> would he speak differently if the amendment were so worded that it did not come into effect until say st april <e> <s> by this means the promises that were made in the current and last financial years can be honoured because i accept his argument in that respect <e> <s> i was talking about the future not the past <e> <s> i wonder if he would accept a third reading amendment dealing with the future only <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one crumb of comfort <e> <s> it would be wrong to divide the house but i may well return to this on third reading <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment because i think that i spoke at some considerable length on this matter in committee <e> <s> like the noble lord lord bruce i believe that everything has been said and probably we are banging our heads against some sort of brick wall <e> <s> even so i still think that it is an important issue <e> <s> i feel strongly enough to hope that the government at this very late hour may have a change of mind because i think that this is important <e> <s> however as the arguments have all been made and it is late i shall not repeat them but just support what the noble lord lord bruce has said and wish him well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> we did not divide on amendment no <e> <s> last time that is why i put it down again <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again with the leave of the house i am sorry that my noble friend lord bellwin has not seen fit to meet me on this one <e>

too far and have no intention of pressing it but i believe that with this clause in the bill the audit commission will be seen as a creature of government <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e>

amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend in the department of the environment when he sees the plight of some county councils when faced with an expanding bill for services which are getting more and more uneconomic will be sympathetic in dealing with the transport with the transport supplementary grant <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with friends like these who needs enemies <e> <s> as i said earlier i must apologise to the house that this amendment has not been before your lordships as long as it should have been <e> <s> that is entirely due to another nationalised industry the post office but never mind that <e> <s> it has not been on the marshalled list long enough for me to feel it would be right to force it <e> <s> however i do grasp at the straw that my noble friend has given about looking at it before third reading because by now he must be well aware that there is a serious point here and that it is a serious worry that the bus company could act before and the word i would emphasise is before exercising their powers and not afterwards <e> <s> i have had experience of negotiating with subsidiaries of the bus company and they are very apt to tell you what they have done and not what they will do <e> <s> so this is a serious point <e> <s> although i realise that my noble friend can give no such assurance i am sure that the benign sunshine of leeds will put him in such a rewarding frame of mind after the recess that he will accept a <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my case would be far stronger if i produced examples of what i fear may happen if bus stations could be sold and a large element of taxpayers money never recovered <e> <s> it is difficult for me to do that here and now in view of the fact that i have not been able to put this amendment down for very long <e> <s> i may come back at third reading or possibly not and i should like to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords my purpose in speaking tonight as has been the case with some other noble lords is warmly to welcome the governments moves to increase capital spending in the public sector as was mentioned by the prime minister in another place in the debates on the gracious speech <e> <s> i do not go so far as the liberal party and regard that as a sudden conversion to the keynesian theory of economics <e> <s> i do not see us on the road to damascus <e> <s> but i believe it is absolutely right to stimulate economic activity in this field and i am quite certain that most local authorities would be only too glad to do so and to spend more of their money not i should add the governments money in the process <e> <s> but and this is the purpose of my speech i must say that there will be difficulties in achieving the million which the government wish <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord avon for his ecnouraging answer and for saying that he will look at the matter <e> <s> i hope he has taken the points which i made <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wonder whether i could add a word in support of the amendment partly because i am about to move an amendment on a very tedious matter of local government <e> <s> two of its most important functions are <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kennet said exactly what i wanted to say <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend lord avon has hit any of my arguments on the head at all <e> <s> if we are to write tourism into this part of the bill why not write in local government <e> <s> if we are to write in archaeology why not write in something else <e> <s> if we are to define the experience of members of this commission we have to do it much more carefully than has been done <e> <s> we have taken just a few examples at random <e> <s> i very much hope that bearing in mind the amendments which the noble baroness lady birk withdrew my amendments can also be considered <e> <s> if not i shall certainly be prepared to come back to this in a much more savage frame of mind on report <e> <s> i cannot speak for my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> i hope that he will withdraw the amendment but not for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems odd to me that a conservative government seem to be quite unable to resist the temptation to legislate on matters to do with water <e> <s> it seems particularly odd to me that we should in this bill seek to nationalise this industry today <e> <s> i have no doubt that the next labour government will find it much easier to complete the process and include the private water companies to as a result of what we are proposing to do today <e> <s> but i do think it is very odd and i never thought that i should live to see the day when a conservative government were sitting here proposing -type nationalisation opposed by noble lords on the benches opposite some of our predecessors would wonder what is happening to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not disapprove of the system <e> <s> i just did not think that it was working in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a welcome amendment and it seems to me at first sight that it will enable the new commission to move beyond the position which pertains at the moment at many of the ancient monument sites where the only books and literature available are those either relating to the site itself or other properties in the direct care of the department <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will not withdraw her amendment because as she has said we are also debating amendment no <e> <s> in my name and others <e> <s> if i may refer to that amendment at the same time that may assist the committee <e> <s> the whole purpose of this amendment and a great many other amendments before us this afternoon is really to try to make these new water authorities more accountable to <e>", "<cs> i take all the points <e> <s> i am rather sorry that my noble friend the minister continually refers to the gas industry <e> <s> i do not think that that was the precedent that we were looking for i thought that we were trying to get away from the worst forms of nationalised industry <e>", "<cs> as the amendment is in my name i want to be quite sure like lady fisher that the government are serious about this <e> <s> they must have got the message from this house and had my noble friend not agreed to look at it again there might have been a quite serious vote against the government and in that spirit i think we all withdrew from voting on the basis that he will put down a suitable compromise amendment which suits everybody <e>", "<cs> as my name is on this amendment i too should like to record my very great thanks to the government for this marvellous change of mind <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone seems to me to have missed the essential point <e> <s> it has nothing to do with a commercial company <e> <s> we are all compulsory consumers of water and compulsory payers for water <e> <s> this is not a commercial operation at all <e> <s> it is a statutory one <e> <s> if local authorities can and have made this act which my noble friend lady elliot produced so skilfully work then so can the water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord taylor on his magnificent speech and also say how delighted i was to listen to the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> in view of the statement that we had earlier this afternoon i hope your lordships will all agree that in securing the services here of a former chairman of the coal board we are very lucky not to have had to pay million to lazard frres or anybody else although the noble lord is worth all of that even if he is for the moment sitting on the wrong side of the house <e> <s> it has been most interesting to hear him <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the whole local authority world will be delighted to see the end of this amendment whether at this stage or any other stage <e> <s> it means an enormous increase in bureacracy and is bound to result in a great deal of diminution of freedom of local government <e> <s> i hope that the government will resist it <e> <s> the amendment has not been explained by the noble lord lord harris and i hope that it will not be <e> <s> i do not think it will get him very far <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the whole house it is a real privilege to be the first to congratulate such an excellent maiden speaker as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that he was very right in not wasting too much time i think only one day between his appearance here and his fluent and excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it is all the better for me because i agree with a great deal of what the noble lord said <e> <s> however just before he rose to his feet he may have felt that for one awful moment he was back in another place <e> <s> i hope he will realise that that is not his fate and that we very much hope that his long experience in local government will be of great value to this house for many years to come <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend the minister will not dismiss this amendment too quickly as it has a very important part to play in the conservation field <e> <s> at the moment the agricultural industry is under considerable pressure for its failure to comply with certain parts of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> anything that this committee can do to write into the bill safeguards for that act must be a good thing <e> <s> i believe that it requires a special amendment as was put forward in the name of my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will look carefully at this matter and be prepared to be open-minded when it comes back to us at report stage <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is he must know when he accepts such a tenancy agreement that termination is likely to occur <e> <s> he must therefore be prepared if he takes the chance of entering farming to find himself alternative accommodation <e> <s> i accept it may be necessary to write in further safeguards but the principle i seek to establish is that there should be such things as starter tenancies and that people who succeed should be able to move on and those who do not should be asked to make way for others who want to have a go <e>", "<cs> i shall not waste time i shall reply briefly <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield will recall that what he published was not quite in accordance with the evidence of smallholding authorities <e> <s> nor can i accept the theory of the noble lord lord walston that a good farmer can be thrown out on his ear

lord belstead promised to look at is welcome <e> <s> i shall not read out a lot of letters from his predecessor <e> <s> there is room for improvement <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in years of moving amendments late at night i have never had such support before <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will agree that it is a gratifying experience <e> <s> i think we have made the case <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord belstead remains to be convinced that it is necessary but i hope that those of your lordships who understand the law will be able to convince him before lunch tomorrow that it is necessary that something of this kind be done <e> <s> i hope that if he is not convinced he will allow me to move an amendment at the report stage which to some extent meets the objections made <e>", "<cs> it is because i think it will not take that long to get it over <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could say whether this is a retrospective amendment <e> <s> if not i think that it is worthy of the greatest support and i hope that it will be agreed to <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord give those of us who are members of the rics some guidance <e> <s> can we vote or not on this issue <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will resist this amendment with the success it has so far shown this afternoon <e> <s> i think i am justified on what my noble friend lord swinton said on second reading that he will do this and that it is government policy not to accept this proposal <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will not be surprised when you hear me say that local authorities will regard this as a totally unjustified attack on their powers of decision <e> <s> quite a lot of powers of local government have been removed by this government since they came into office <e> <s> they came into office pledged to a bonfire of controls the fire went out rather too soon <e> <s> however this is a control that i think should not be brought back at any price <e> <s> if a local authority wants to sell land which it owns surely that is a decision which it should be entitled to take <e> <s> if the minister is tempted to intervene then i think the government should be bound by their own logic and buy the land themselves from that local authority <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he acknowledge that i made a long speech in favour of statutory county council smallholdings on a previous day and i do not recall his supporting what said at that time <e>", "<cs> speaking as a landlord on this committee stage the noble earl lord caithness said that the patient was terminally ill <e> <s> i would go further and say that this amendment would put the last nail in the coffin of the landlord and tenant system <e> <s> i could not conceivably think of a system whereby a tenancy could be sold and a total stranger appear on the farm the whole relationship would be finished <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will be speedily withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> did i understand him to say that he would bring forward an amendment at the next stage to cover the technical point i have made <e>", "<cs> if that is the case i am delighted to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister when replying be able to tell the house what percentage of the million overspend that he is talking about is due to the actions of the glc and the other metropolitan counties which are due to be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to answer the question which i asked him <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to apologise to the house as i may not be able to stay until the end of this debate owing to another appointment and in particular i should like to apologise to my noble friend lord swinton whose introduction of this bill was so lucid and so clear to all of us and who set an example of brevity which i hope i can follow <e>", "<cs> my lords may i inform the noble lord <e> <s> the chancellor of the exchequer took it out of the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be able to ask the government to resist this amendment <e> <s> i spoke on this matter at some length at committee stage and i should not wish to repeat what i said then <e> <s> but i believe that the noble lord lord prys-davies did not put a totally fair picture <e> <s> he spoke about the wise committee which recommended a certain number of smallholdings and that this number be reduced <e> <s> but the wise committee recommended also that the size of smallholdings should be increased so that they were a viable economic unit <e> <s> that is why the number has been reduced because the acreage has been increased <e> <s> one surely cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment and i should like on behalf of the association of the county councils to support everything that the noble baroness lady david has said <e> <s> they feel strongly on these matters <e> <s> i said all that i have to say on second reading <e> <s> i spoke then about the thin end of the wedge but we have now seen a thicker end of the wedge in the white paper called <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very much stongly to support the bill so ably moved by my noble friend lord alport and i hope that i can keep to the brevity which so far has been established in this debate so that there is no need to burn the midnight oil <e> <s> i speak tonight as an arable farmer from the north of england who last year harvested over acres of corn by no means all of which was needed and in fact we burned only about per cent <e> <s> i believe that the agricultural industry must realise that it must urgently tackle the problems of straw and stubble burning and farmers should know that it is in their own interests to move as fast as possible towards a situation where this practice must cease altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl remind the house where he farms <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e> <s> as we are on to rape which is a subject dear to your lordships hearts i should like to say that rape straw is much the easiest of any crop in the country to incorporate <e> <s> it chops up much finer than any other straw and is much the simplest and quickest to do <e> <s> also because it comes to harvest a great deal earlier as your lordships will know it has much more time to do it so the argument about rape straw holds no water <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend again but i must say that there have been two quite distinctly savage burning harvests when a great deal of britain has caught tire <e> <s> that is what has changed my mind <e>", "<cs> might i ask my noble friend on the front bench whether he would not agree that the bylaws admittedly we have not had very long to study them would make the burning of stubble or straw so prohibitively expensive that the objects of this bill will be achieved by the by-laws alone <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my duty to give the house this afternoon the views of the association of county councils as its president for a little while yet <e> <s> although i hope that many noble lords will have found time to read the notes sent round by the acc among all the other documents being circulated that may not have been possible so i should like to pick out <e>", "<cs> i put my name to the amendment and i support the principle of it <e> <s> i do so because i have often said in your lordships chamber that successive governments have failed to grasp the nettle of properly reforming local government finance <e> <s> the failure to undertake such a reform has resulted in the present increasingly complex system of local government finance which is in itself undermining local account-ability <e> <s> the result of this bill will be to add to that complexity and further erode local accountability <e> <s> i do not think anyone has denied that <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness does that has she considered the fact that if she tests the feeling of the committee and loses the government will be unable to do anything about looking at this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have supported me <e> <s> i am interested in the silence opposite but never mind that they will have their turn later <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord evans i would say that it is of course an incomplete answer to the problem and i do not pretend that it is the right solution <e> <s> it is the half a loaf argument which i think has caused a good debate <e> <s> we shall i hope come to more effective safeguards against the power of the executive as we move through this part of the bill <e> <s> i am deeply grateful that my noble friend lord bellwin will think hard and i hope that he will think very hard whatever the difference may be <e>", "<cs> i am sure my noble friend always thinks very hard <e> <s> may i just remind him that the grea was he said a safeguard because a council would not be clobbered unless it was substantially above the grea <e> <s> as i said on second reading the grea is very movable in this context and therefore it is not so much of a safeguard as he might have us believe <e> <s> at this stage of our committee proceedings it would be quite wrong to press the amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says they are not necessary <e> <s> i should like to give him very briefly one example to illustrate why i think they are necessary and why i support them <e> <s> it refers to the county of cleveland which was mentioned by my noble friend lord gisborough at second reading <e> <s> cleveland has a peculiar fire risk through the petro-chemical industry <e> <s> i think it has a class a fire risk for almost the whole county <e> <s> it therefore has a special need to have a highly expensive fire brigade <e> <s> they inform me and i believe they may have informed my noble friend also that for all the arguments which they have put forward over the years the grea takes no adequate account of this particular peculiar fire risk which is almost unique in the country <e> <s> therefore they fear that rate capping would descend upon cleveland because the same arguments which have not been listened to or at least have not been effective in the grea situation would not be effective under clause of this bill <e> <s> it is for that reason that i think it would do no harm if this very modest amendment could be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment <e> <s> it is more important than it looks at first sight <e> <s> as was mentioned very often at second reading it is a question of parliament making the decisions as to which authority is going to get caught and not with great respect leaving it to the civil servants or to the minister <e> <s> this is a method whereby each authority in danger of being capped has an opportunity to have its case debated in parliament <e> <s> i think it is very important <e> <s> i do not think that it is the same thing as a rate support grant debate to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> that is taken late at night and deals with the level of grants which the government propose <e> <s> that is entirely within the governments discretion <e> <s> this is much more serious and as the noble baroness lady birk has very wisely said is totally unknown territory <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> which is in my name is similar to amendment no <e> <s> it might be helpful if i speak to my amendment now and i promise to be very brief <e>", "<cs> parish councils <e>", "<cs> did not my noble friend put forward the best argument yet much better than i did last week for capping only authorities <e> <s> he seemed to put the case rather well <e>", "<cs> i think we must all sympathise very deeply with the aims of the noble baroness lady faithfull in trying to create what might be called a herd of sacred cows in the field of social services <e> <s> we are all deeply involved in this one way or another and we all support what she is trying to do <e> <s> i think it could be very counter-productive to go ahead with this line <e> <s> it means they will be exempt <e> <s> that means the pressure of rate capping when it may come will fall on all the other services and there will be resentment in other parts of the community <e> <s> even my noble friend lord broxbournes suggestion that the mentally and physically handicapped should be exempt whereas all the rest in the list should not be exempt could create a possible dissention between the various persons affected and could be counter-productive to the aims <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those who have spoken in this brief debate <e> <s> i wish personally to emphasise what has been said by my noble friend lord onslow and by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> whatever we do let us not move any closer than we must to the national police force <e> <s> that really is a thing that we all wish to avoid <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down would he not agree that there are in fact eight welsh counties all of them education authorities and all of them not exempt under clause <e> <s> all spend more than million not million as the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> as i have put my name to this amendment i should like to support it but i hope that it will not go too far at this time <e> <s> my noble friend said that this specific scheme must be seen to have failed before he will consider introducing or asking parliament to introduce the general scheme <e> <s> can my noble friend give us any indication of what criteria he would use to say that the specific scheme had failed <e> <s> how long would he consider to be a respectable period in which he could consider that he had evidence that it was necessary to invoke this draconian ultimate deterrent of the general powers <e>", "<cs> as my name was on the original marshalled list and then withdrawn to make way for that of my noble friend lord chelwood may i say how delighted i am that i took such action because my noble friend made a powerful and important speech which shows that my decision must have been right <e> <s> i wish to make clear however beyond any doubt whatever that as i have said before and as your lordships are well aware the acc of which i am president remains united in total opposition to part ii of the bill <e> <s> in no way must the withdrawal of my name be seen to imply any change in its attitude <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to welcome this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the government have made a very important concession and i do not agree with lady birks tiresome <e> <s> but i do not think it is quite fair for my noble friend to say as he did just now that this was warmly welcomed in another place because this never saw the light of day in another place <e> <s> that may have been the intention of the members themselves but the amendment has only just appeared before us <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord pennock replies to the unanswerable arguments of my noble friend lord avon would he not agree that half the trouble is that not enough people from business enter local government <e> <s> i have said this before and i have personal experience of people saying that they are far too busy to stand for election <e> <s> they leave the way open for the sort of extremists which have caused this bill to be brought before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment to which i have added my name on behalf of the association of county councils <e> <s> my noble kinsman lord kilmarnock has said everything that needs to be said and indeed it was brought up at committee stage before your lordships <e> <s> but i should like to crave your lordships indulgence by referring briefly to the debate which we had on clause at committee stage because this is the first opportunity to do so at this stage of the bill <e> <s> during the debate on clause stand part my noble friend lord chelwood who unfortunately owing to family problems is not able to be here tonight referred in his speech to many things in opposing the bill <e> <s> when he was answered by my noble friend lord bellwin the impression was given that the association of county councils had refused offers of consultation on certain aspects of the bill before it came before this house <e> <s> i should have intervened at that stage to deny this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of pushing this amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that the government cannot see the logic of my argument that it is better to have part ii defined than not defined <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady birk said with great eloquence the government have refused all efforts to define matters when they were bringing in part ii <e> <s> i have said before and i say again that i think they will live to regret that attitude but i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i certainly shall not push the amendments <e> <s> however i should like by leave to make two points <e> <s> i should have said of course that four years is the life of a council <e> <s> if you have to be good boys for four years someone else will reap the reward of your good behaviour or otherwise because there will <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i say what enormous pleasure it gives me to agree with him for once in the arguments which he has just advanced <e> <s> i referred a few minutes ago to part ii as a nuclear deterrent <e> <s> i cannot see that district councils can claim exemption from nuclear deterrents it is like the glc calling itself a nuclear-free zone such a thing does not exist <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will not proceed any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will give serious consideration to the suggestion that has just been made <e> <s> i am sure that this is a compromise which could well find considerable acceptance in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that there is a further danger in accepting this proposal in that if the title were to be changed every ratepayer in the land would think that his rates would be protected <e> <s> ratepayers would think that it was about rate capping and therefore if the rates were to go up at all they would blame the government for allowing them to do so and for not capping them and the bill would not work <e> <s> we are told that only between and authorities are affected <e> <s> what would happen to the other who are not affected if it were to be called the protection of ratepayers bill <e> <s> they would think that their rates would not be protected by the governments own admission <e> <s> therefore i think it would be very unwise for the government to accept this proposal <e> <s> however desirable it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume to intervene among all this noble and gallant top brass for only one purpose which is to draw attention to the position of the volunteer reserves and cadet forces under this proposed reorganisation <e> <s> for brevity i should like to refer mainly to the territorial army or the ta which is of course the largest component of the volunteer reserves at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me why a statement which is being made in another place on the reorganisation of the ministry of defence is not being repeated in this house today <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to declare an interest not as a member of a board but in the ownership of a stretch of scottish river which has suffered a drastic decline in the past years <e> <s> i am not of course blaming the board for that catastrophe but i hope that this bill in encouraging further boards may go some way towards an understanding of the situation which is now in existence in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to confine my remarks to the reserve forces which are mentioned briefly in chapter of the white paper <e> <s> i do so as president of the council of the territorial army and volunteer reserve association which covers the whole country and also includes the reserve forces in the royal navy the royal marines and the royal auxiliary air force but to avoid using that mouthful of a title i intend to refer to the ta throughout <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may well be aware that this has been under discussion with the ministry of defence for very nearly four years and we hope that it will not take more than a few months for sense to prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i too congratulate the government in bringing forward this legislation on this very important matter <e> <s> i also declare an interest as a person who enjoys fishing for salmon and has a small stretch of river in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mention the north-east drift net <e> <s> i am probably the only member of the house not to have done so <e>", "<cs> these amendments deal with the principle of stopping net catches in times of drought or low water and i move amendment no <e> <s> with the spirit of amendment no <e> <s> behind me in the interests of conservation of salmon stocks <e> <s> the problem of this matter of reducing catches in times of drought or low water was mentioned by several of your lordships in the second reading debate and i believe it was said that it was something which was desirable <e>", "<cs> i did not say cease <e>", "<cs> i did not say that it should cease <e> <s> i said exactly what my noble friend lord home suggests <e> <s> the tweed is an example where the nets are all fixed fly only and a very good rule that is <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his considered reply <e> <s> i should just like to take my noble friend lord kimball to task <e>", "<cs> i shall not press amendment no <e> <s> in view of what has been said but i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in what has been a most valuable debate <e> <s> from the many speeches <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive me i thought that we had dealt with amendment no <e> <s> on the matter of drought <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but i do not think that amendments nos <e> <s> and have anything to do with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i accept that amendment no <e> <s> has been dealt with and i was not going to move it <e> <s> however amendment no <e> <s> deals with a quite different point on which i have a long speech to make and amendment no <e> <s> is also different and has to do with amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend the duke of atholl and indeed with my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am very sorry if i am wrong but i believe that amendment no <e> <s> stands on its own according to the list of groupings that i was given <e> <s> having moved amendment no <e> <s> i shall be very happy to withdraw it to save time but i do not believe that amendment no <e> <s> is related to the other amendments <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak against amendment no <e> <s> because my amendment no <e> <s> would go a good deal further than the amendment of my noble friend the duke of atholl but would have much the same effect <e> <s> the drafting that we have makes it almost impossible for the board to take the action that it might think necessary <e> <s> this clause gives the hoard lots of powers but then we restrict it by the criterion of four-fifths of the total value of fisheries <e> <s> the possibility of four-fifths of the people ever getting together and agreeing on something like this including for instance the purchase of a cottage for a bailiff or of a small piece of land for a hatchery or anything of that kind would be so drastically to restrict the boards activities as to make a nonsense of it <e> <s> i therefore believe that my noble friend the duke of atholl is absolutely right and that the board should be allowed to go ahead and acquire property unless one-fifth of the proprietors object <e> <s> the board cannot do its job without acquiring a certain amount of property <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble viscount lord thurso whether amendment no <e> <s> is swept up in this <e> <s> the list of groupings that we received on arrival today has omitted amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is either a compliment or an insult to me <e> <s> i am not sure which <e>", "<cs> if so i should like speaking to amendment no <e> <s> to endorse a point made by the noble viscount lord thurso that co-opted representatives or appointed representatives as the case may be of netsmen should be equal in number <e> <s> it is crucial to the working of the bill that there should not be a majority of one interest or another <e> <s> if you appoint two or three there should be two or three different interests <e> <s> that is the only point that i want to make <e> <s> i hope that i shall save time by making it now <e>", "<cs> now i know why the noble dukes ancestor built a fishing lodge on the inver at that very point <e> <s> of course i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i add my support to the theory behind these amendments <e> <s> as i said at second reading i think it is a nonsense if we have licensed dealers in scotland but not in england <e> <s> i would bring forward an argument not so far deployed <e> <s> that is i <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord belstead replies i wonder whether he would consider whether it is possible in the consultations which are most welcome to include discussions with the district councils <e> <s> they issue licences for game and i should have thought that they would not be against helping in this matter <e> <s> it might be better that they should be involved rather than water authorities <e> <s> i put it forward because i believe it to be helpful and i hope that my noble friend will not ignore it <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend lord lansdowne whose speech we all admired whether he can tell us what is the weekly close time on the river tay and now does it compare with the drift netting fishery that we have been discussing <e>", "<cs> the point is that the weekly close time in the sea is hours and not <e>", "<cs> as i spoke at length on tuesday night on this matter i will not say any more except to congratulate my noble friend lord trenchard on not being defeated and returning to the charge <e> <s> it is an important issue <e> <s> it must apply to the whole kingdom and i hope and believe that at the next stage of this bill we shall be able to produce an amendment which enables the government to take time to think how they can get round this and achieve some kind of legislative position which enables the authorities in each river area to do something about low water flows <e> <s> i believe this house has demonstrated beyond any further need for proof that something must be done in this respect <e> <s> i beg to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he inform us whether these fish farms pay rates either to the local authority or to the fishery board <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support <e> <s> it would be of enormous good to the salmon industry <e> <s> if there is suspicion of the boards activities this would go <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for giving way so gracefully to an amendment which was strongly supported at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am allowed to speak for a second time but if so i shall not detain your lordships for more than a minute <e> <s> i am disappointed with the reply but understand that the door has not been finally shut <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will realise how difficult it is to obtain hard evidence and i trust that those who are in a position to do so will immediately set about obtaining it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that it was rather short notice to talk about a national salmon policy <e> <s> this matter was raised by several members of your lordships house repeatedly at earlier stages <e> <s> we cannot allow my noble friend to go entirely unchallenged on that matter <e> <s> i am sure that it <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he inform us where the river ugie is in subsection <e> <s> does it mean that it covers the whole of the east coast of scotland and the north-east coast of england or is there a gap somewhere <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the noble lord wants after listening to him for minutes with great patience unless it be to torpedo the bill which i suspect he has effectively done <e> <s> if that is his aim i congratulate him but i do not think that it is the desire of the committee that we should stray so far from the point <e> <s> as i am the first to speak on the amendment let me say that i think that the conditions laid down in the bill are correct <e> <s> it should not be too easy to become a plc <e> <s> it should be difficult and it will be very difficult to get per cent <e> <s> of those eligible to vote <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will resist the amendment and try as hard as they can to get the bill through <e>", "<cs> would not per cent <e> <s> or even per cent <e> <s> meet the objections of everybody <e>", "<cs> before we take that motion may i ask my noble friend whether the failure to complete the committee stage of this bill tonight means that the bill will probably not receive royal assent before the summer recess <e> <s> i think that building societies will desperately want to know what the situation is <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer to part v of the bill which deals with opencast coal and states that the bill will repeal sections to of the opencast coal act <e> <s> the repeal of section ends the special provisions giving british coal power to apply direct to the secretary of state for energy for authorisation to work land for coal thus bringing coal into line with all other minerals <e> <s> that must be correct <e> <s> it is a very desirable end and it is much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness for being incommunicado or not available but i supported the original amendments without knowing that they were defective <e> <s> i am sorry for that <e> <s> it was not my fault <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendments moved by my noble friend particularly in relation to the right of an owner to be notified <e> <s> as i said on second reading this can cause conspicuous embarrassment and i hope that we shall look at this most seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that some territorial army volunteers living on unemployment benefit can be financially penalised if they attend training other than annual camp <e> <s> will he agree that this injustice is a deterrent to recruiting in certain parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords after the very long bills that your lordships suffered in the previous session it is a pleasure to see one that is constrained to one piece of paper <e> <s> i hope my speech can be commendably brief on the same occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a great privilege to serve under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> i have formed a great admiration over the last few months for his knowledge of these somewhat unsavoury matters <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on the way he has introduced the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is an agricultural debate i hope the house will agree that we should offer our congratulations to sir henry plumb on being elected president of the european parliament <e> <s> he is not only the first british president but is also a distinguished agriculturalist <e> <s> i am sure that under his presidency we shall see some solutions advanced to the dramatic problems which the noble lord lord john-mackie has so well described <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend lord belstead because i may not be able to stay to the end of the debate owing to another engagement in connection wth the dockyards <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to add my congratulations to the noble duke whose maiden speech we all so much enjoyed <e> <s> having seen something of his woodlands some years ago i can assure your lordships that he speaks from great expertise and knowledge and i hope that we shall hear him often <e>", "<cs> like the noble earl lord cranbrook i regret that i was unable to welcome the bill at second reading which i would happily have <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord sandford needs some support since he is not here himself <e> <s> despite all that has been said i really do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i did so at committee and i shall not now take up too much time on this <e> <s> what is new on the scene since we spoke at committee is the publication as my noble friend has said of the consultation document which i believe is an important start in coping with the massive problems of overproduction in europe <e> <s> it is a great start and should be welcomed as such for it goes a long way towards meeting the amendment of my noble friend lord cranbrook especially where it talks about beef farming <e> <s> in fact it goes as far as one might expect on that aspect of farming <e> <s> the acceptance of the amendment which is only an enabling one would surely be a sensible further step for the government to take <e>", "<cs> the late lord goddard when he was lord chief justice used to tell a story of how he had before him in court a man accused of sexual relations with a dog <e> <s> when in due course the chap was found guilty by the jury the lord chief justice <e>", "<cs> my lords the report which we are debating is a most impressive document as were all its predecessors <e> <s> the range of subjects which it covers is enormous <e> <s> i am an enthusiastic amateur naturalist as i suspect is everyone else on the list of speakers <e> <s> i have read the report with the greatest possible interest <e> <s> the council deserves high praise for the energy and skill which it has devoted to nature in britain <e> <s> the report covers everything from the walrus to something which is called the stinking goosefoot <e> <s> the restoration of the sea eagle and the large blue butterfly are outstanding successes <e> <s> i suggest that the council is our most effective and active quango <e>", "<cs> my lords it will probably be no surprise to your lordships if i refer to the reserve forces yet again as i have in the past <e> <s> however i hope to be brief tonight partly because in april we had a debate on this subject alone and secondly because i volunteered to be tail end charlie in the debate and i understand from the royal air force that tail end charlie did not last very long <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to declare an interest in that for years i have been a director of tyne-tees television <e> <s> therefore i speak with the benefits of both considerable experience and prejudice <e> <s> i believe that we all give a general welcome to the way in which the white paper has grasped the nettles of the future and look forward to what may happen <e> <s> at this stage i should like to give an even warmer welcome to the very wise appointment of mr george russell as chairman of the iba and itc <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the scheme suggested by the noble and gallant lord lord bramall would be extremely cost-effective and will he examine it yet faster than he has so far <e>", "<cs> i must say coming from the north of england how nice it is to hear special pleading from the south-east for a change <e> <s> that turns things on their head <e> <s> the reason for the pleading is the higher cost of living in the south-east <e> <s> however it is also true to say that students are coming to north of england universities in increasing numbers not only because housing is cheaper but also because i venture to hope education is just as good there if not better <e> <s> i wish to say how strongly i support everything said by the noble baroness lady young and by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on the two matters of the access funds and social security <e> <s> that seems to me to be the nub of the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for missing the beginning of this debate which i deeply regret but i shall read it most carefully <e> <s> like other noble lords i wish briefly to refer to part vii <e> <s> my only interest is a lifelong and amateur interest in anything concerning the natural history of these islands from which i derive great pleasure and knowledge <e> <s> i have nothing else to declare in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords there is common agreement that we face the most fundamental <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the projected increase in the number of students at universities and polytechnics is most welcome and the government deserve the highest congratulations for that policy which we all want to see succeed <e> <s> but i should like to take a few moments to consider one aspect of that expansion which needs more attention than it has so far received that is where the extra students are to live when they arrive <e>"]
