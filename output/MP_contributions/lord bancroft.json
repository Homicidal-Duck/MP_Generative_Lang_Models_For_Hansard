["<cs> my lords we have just heard an eloquent and informed contribution from the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> alas <e> <s> i am not equipped to follow him and my brief and prosaic remarks will be confined strictly to the report on the commissions farm price proposals which really will not do <e> <s> i think that pretty well everyone is agreed on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> our non-alignment lies perhaps in the direction of passion rather than intellectual analysis <e> <s> again i follow the noble lord lord plowden in believing that this applies particularly to cereals first because of the malign ripple effect of artificially high cereal prices right across the agriculture and food sectors and secondly because of the equally powerful benign effect of a price reduction <e> <s> the commissions own cereal figures forecast a production excess of at least per cent <e> <s> over community demand by and per cent <e> <s> represents million tonnes <e> <s> what has recently been proposed for milk is most welcome <e> <s> i hope that that welcome will itself be welcomed amidst the uproarious calm on the government benches <e> <s> but it is a short and hesitant step as yet in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise in advance for being a bit repetitious but i shall be brief <e> <s> as has been pointed out for reasons which most of us understand and sympathise with this is a centralising bill but there is a limit to what the centre can efficiently and responsibly bear <e> <s> a lot has already been said about accountability or answerability <e> <s> i rather like the latter word <e> <s> it seems to me a real worry under the bill as it is now drafted <e>"]
