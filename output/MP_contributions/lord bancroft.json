["<cs> my lords i hope that i am audible if i am not perhaps the noble lord will tell me <e> <s> i am indeed extremely grateful to the noble lord for giving us the opportunity to discuss this highly unglamorous but highly important subject which is so often as he pointed out neglected by the legislature <e> <s> it is a great privilege to follow the former lord chancellor and although flattery never does anyone any good i do not intend to flatter anyone but to tell the truth and truth occasionally does one some good <e> <s> i never dreamt that i would be making my maiden speech in this house with this glittering though not very long galaxy of fellow speakers <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that i shall be extremely brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i too ought to declare a very minor personal potential interest <e> <s> i use the word potential because i have just been appointed as a member of the advisory council of which the noble and learned lord was such a distinguished chairman for so many years and of which the noble lord lord teviot was a member <e> <s> but there has been no meeting since my appointment so i can speak my mind unfettered by the previous deliberations of the advisory council <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with the noble earl in his warm congratulations to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on his felicitous debut his maiden speech before this house <e> <s> i think we shall all be very greatly indebted to his expertise and the fluency with which he has put his views with which as it happens i disagree <e> <s> it will be a relief to your lordships that many of my foxes have been shot in the course of this short debate <e> <s> i was going to expatiate in a few ill-chosen words on the folly of constant change in the machinery of government when one can see no actual benefit accruing but the noble lord lord foot has anticipated me <e> <s> the short point is dont muck <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would apply that argument to the whole of government-voted expenditure <e> <s> i see no reason why he should not <e> <s> if he did however what would that mean to parliamentary control <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble baroness for the very full reply she gave <e> <s> did she or did any other member of your lordships house attend any of the meetings of the tribunal which it will be recalled were public in response to parliamentary pressure <e> <s> i ask that question because on the one occasion when i went there there was no one from the public or the press <e> <s> is she aware as i am sure she is that four years were taken out of the lives of the three eminent members of the tribunal and that a number of barristers careers were severely damaged by the amount of time they had to give up to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to oblige the noble baroness in the sense that i shall be striking a discordant note <e> <s> i shall be striking a note which will not be in entire agreement with some of the remarks made by noble friends on the cross-benches <e> <s> that i think is a happy privilege of being a cross-bencher <e> <s> we are indebted to my noble friend lord marsh for introducing the debate with enormous expertise experience great wit great eloquence and considerable extravagance <e> <s> i agree with some of what he said but by no means all <e>", "<cs> my lords under the guidance of the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury the sub-committee chose its words with consummate care <e> <s> the recommendation for early though not necessarily immediate entry into full membership has a resonance about it which will live <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three brief and unoriginal points <e> <s> first i am not equipped to make a judgment on the precise objectives which the government had in mind in taking this action with gchq <e> <s> to the extent that they were to safeguard our national security they must have all our sympathy and support <e> <s> it is the handling that is my concern <e> <s> to the extent that this was insensitive and ill-thought through it attracts and deserves criticism certainly on management grounds and conceivably on wider grounds <e> <s> but that is not my area of concern tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just heard an eloquent and informed contribution from the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> alas <e> <s> i am not equipped to follow him and my brief and prosaic remarks will be confined strictly to the report on the commissions farm price proposals which really will not do <e> <s> i think that pretty well everyone is agreed on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> our non-alignment lies perhaps in the direction of passion rather than intellectual analysis <e> <s> again i follow the noble lord lord plowden in believing that this applies particularly to cereals first because of the malign ripple effect of artificially high cereal prices right across the agriculture and food sectors and secondly because of the equally powerful benign effect of a price reduction <e> <s> the commissions own cereal figures forecast a production excess of at least per cent <e> <s> over community demand by and per cent <e> <s> represents million tonnes <e> <s> what has recently been proposed for milk is most welcome <e> <s> i hope that that welcome will itself be welcomed amidst the uproarious calm on the government benches <e> <s> but it is a short and hesitant step as yet in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise in advance for being a bit repetitious but i shall be brief <e> <s> as has been pointed out for reasons which most of us understand and sympathise with this is a centralising bill but there is a limit to what the centre can efficiently and responsibly bear <e> <s> a lot has already been said about accountability or answerability <e> <s> i rather like the latter word <e> <s> it seems to me a real worry under the bill as it is now drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord cast his mind back to the terms of his original answer and confirm that it constitutes an acceptance of the proposition that the sequence of decision publication and debate of planning inquiry reports is governed by convention and not by statute and that that sequence can be varied according to the dictates of fairness and common sense <e> <s> secondly will the noble lord cast his mind forward and confirm that the government have intimated that the report of the sizewell inquiry will be debated before a government decision is reached <e> <s> thirdly will he cast his mind back to the late s and confirm that the then secretary of state for the environment took steps to ensure that there was a debate on the windscale issue before a government decision was reached <e> <s> finally <e>", "<cs> finally would he agree that a matter of national importance is a subjective issue <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what i wanted to say has already been said by the noble lord lord obrien with lapidary precision <e> <s> he guided the subcommittee with the same deftness during our deliberations <e> <s> during his remarks he defined the policy which the erdf is there to serve <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow in detail the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i should like to start by echoing the gratitude which other noble lords have expressed to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for his measured and constructive introduction to this debate <e> <s> i have already apologised to him and to the noble earl for the fact that i shall have to leave the house before the debate ends <e> <s> i now apologise to your lordships in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the gratitude which has been expressed to my noble friend lord henderson for giving us the opportunity to have this debate <e> <s> i approach the issue from a slightly different route from that which my noble friend took but i reach the same conclusion <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by confiding to your lordships that i spent many years in whitehall stirring the pot of organisational and structural change <e> <s> i have to confess that with hindsight many of those years were mis-spent because organisational change is often a poor substitute for hard policy decisions it enables them to be ducked <e> <s> innovation is not necessarily reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak briefly and diffidently following so many experts <e> <s> i have sat at the feet of my noble friend lord plowden for nearly years so he needs no bush from me <e> <s> i recall that the sub-committee which undertook this inquiry was regarded in some quarters as a posse of gullible peers being bamboozled by knowing fishermen <e> <s> innocent i have no doubt we are <e> <s> knowing the fishermen certainly are because that is after all the guts of their trade <e> <s> but although we are innocent i do not think we are gullible <e> <s> i think that of the members of that subcommittee i am perhaps the one that that epithet touches most nearly and a quarter of a century in the treasury taught even me a certain rude scepticism <e>", "<cs> it is a disconcerting experience to follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the noble lord lord soper and the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> they are all brilliant debaters and i most certainly am not <e> <s> in the case of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter there are two further reasons for its being disconcerting <e> <s> the first is that i have to confide to the committee that he has been an object of strictly non-political veneration to me for years <e> <s> the second is that he and i and the right reverend prelate were all at the same college <e> <s> he also speaks with authority on the subject of authority given his past experiences <e>", "<cs> i assure the minister that i would not dream of thinking that i had disposed of that point <e> <s> i was adding a gloss to it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> his remarks enable me to conclude my remarks on a note of total agreement in the sense that i regard the amendment of the noble lord lord hayter as totally non-political <e> <s> i shall vote for it because i have put my name to it <e> <s> i believe that it has wide support both here and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to return for a moment to the amendments <e> <s> i have been immensely instructed by the debate about political philosophy which has taken place across the floor of the house but i should like to get back to the amendments <e> <s> i should like to begin by saying how greatly i admire and respect the dialectical abilities of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> my respect for them has increased tenfold this afternoon <e> <s> he made much as who in his place would not of the drafting effects and the drafting defects of the amendments <e> <s> he unlike us has the deft hands of his department and of parliamentary counsel to set them right quite easily if he so wishes <e> <s> but some of the other demons he conjured up with such skill were i think a little overdone <e> <s> i listened with enormous interest though alas with less comprehension to what he had to say about the london boroughs associations propoals <e> <s> i am not clear to what extent they deal with my central point which is the intertwining of planning and transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence and a heavy cold <e> <s> my diffidence is because of my whitehall past and i shall be brief because my audibility is in question <e> <s> i want to make three points <e> <s> let me preface them by saying that i am in no way a beneficiary of the review bodys report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i voice my own unbounded admiration for the right reverend prelates maiden speech its eloquence its conviction and its substance <e> <s> like the other noble lords who have spoken i too look forward to his contributing frequently to our future deliberations <e> <s> indeed it is singularly fortunate for us that he chose this debate in which to make his first speech <e> <s> it is a very important debate if not apparently a very popular one <e> <s> i give a wholehearted welcome to the aim of the noble lord lord alport namely to promote the industrial regeneration and social progress of the northern counties of england <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all of us when i say how deeply grateful we are to him for initiating this debate and for his graphic indeed moving opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords with the demise of telephone bingo i rise not for the first time in the presence of a shot fox but the existence of the corpse in no way invalidates the single point that i want to make nor the very important points and questions which have been raised by the two noble lords who have spoken before me <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot match their eloquence but like the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls i must declare a modest interest <e> <s> among other activities i am a director of the bass group of companies and also a director of two of their wholly-owned subsidiaries one of which coral social clubs is a leading operator of bingo clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise following two notable speeches <e> <s> the one of the noble lord lord hooson delivered with great lucidity force and elegance and with which i almost but not totally disagreed and lord shackletons speech with which i almost but not totally agreed <e> <s> i therefore stake out my position to begin with <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson implied that the system is beginning to break down that a new constitutional settlement might be necessary that the triangular pact is in danger of erosion if not collapse <e> <s> now i would be a rich man if every time someone had said to me the system is breaking down or things will never be the same again they had given me a fiver <e> <s> i should have been a very rich man indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer in relation to the guidelines which are given to officials appearing before select committees <e> <s> the original draft of course was done by civil servants in my day and it was then approved by ministers <e> <s> the same i have no doubt is true of the memorandum which sir robert armstrong issued last year <e> <s> i think that to ask me to be drawn into who drafts the guidelines for ministers would be asking me to go too far and years too early <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with three points <e> <s> first i offer a humble apology since i may have to leave shortly before the end of the debate <e> <s> secondly i wish to pay a tribute to my noble friend lord benson for his extremely cogent introduction to the debate following his admirable royal commission report <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief though not quite as brief as the noble lord who preceded me <e> <s> i rise to support this amendment in the context of the connected amendments which the noble and learned lord lord silkin mentioned when he introduced the debate <e> <s> it has always struck me as something of a whimsical irony that this should be one of the most centralising administrations of all in my experience <e> <s> the gap between the rhetoric and the practice can be greeted by shocked horror as it frequently is which i think is entirely inappropriate or by a degree of courteous derision <e> <s> temperamentally i find the latter more acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am immensely grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this extremely interesting debate <e> <s> as the noble lord lord belstead recognised we are dealing here with major issues of national development policy designed to last for at least another generation or so <e>"]
