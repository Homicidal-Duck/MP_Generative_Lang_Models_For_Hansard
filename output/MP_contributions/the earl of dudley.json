["<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations on the maiden speech of the noble lord lord constantine of stanmore which was delivered with such charm and confidence <e> <s> i do so with a special relish as at least one of the points which he made on public sector prices reinforces a point which i hope to make to your lordships on the public sector in the course of the next few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness if she will let me pursue my argument will in the course of the next few minutes get an answer to her question <e> <s> if not may she please ask me again before i sit down <e> <s> if the chancellor rejects extra public sector spending as a means to stimulate demand then he should see to it that he responds with help for the private sector of industry <e> <s> if he will not i feel that he ought to be reminded by noble lords on this side of the house of his own past undertakings <e> <s> for i read that of all the conflicting claims upon the exchequer there is only one thing that industry asks of the chancellor passed as a resolution at eastbourne to be referred to the chancellor by the cbis president and that is to cut business costs even at the expense of an increase in the psbr <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for perhaps reinforcing my argument <e> <s> i agree with all those who say that the best hope for the unemployed lies in the long-term recovery of british industry <e> <s> but that is not enough in the short term <e> <s> though we do not debate tax in this house i hope i may be allowed to express the hope that the chancellor to help the unemployed at worst will not increase the overall level of taxation next year and at best might manage a reduction <e> <s> any expectation that this might be in his mind could help to moderate next years wage round this winter and keep industrial costs down <e> <s> perhaps i could remind noble lords that in the same speech which i have already quoted the chancellor said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> however before i ask the question because of its nature i should like briefly to say that as a father of three half-argentine children with an argentine mother including my son and heir i naturally deplore the loss of life on both sides <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to ask the minister whether he would seriously consider that if the argentine air capability does pose a more serious threat to our task force than his earlier reply appeared to indicate if it does pose a serious threat to our servicemen and to possible loss of life which i believe it does will he undertake that this capability will be reduced by all possible means even if that means taking some risks with public opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords the point was that whatever action should be taken it should be taken without regard to public opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for giving a reply which i must confess i did to some extent expect may i further ask him taking into account that unanimity in the eec may no longer be axiomatic or automatic whether he does not think it likely that the possession of a weapon such as exocet may have encouraged general galtieri in his rash adventure <e> <s> would it not be in the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord if he is aware that there are articles in the treaty of rome such as perhaps and whereby common policy on trade in arms and military equipment could be made applicable under the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that informative reply <e> <s> i should like further to ask him whether in the absence of united states participation her majestys government would regard as acceptable involvement by commonwealth countries in the defence and future administration of the falkland islands perhaps by some form of commonwealth trusteeship <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to the noble baroness on the success of her enterprise and on the introduction of this bill and i should also like to congratulate the government and the minister on their response to it <e> <s> i think it is fair comment that in respect of the falkland islands the characteristic of the governments policy has been to respond to events rather than to initiate them <e> <s> last summer they responded vigorously and successfully <e> <s> they have responded sensibly to the noble baroness and in respect of the vote in the general assembly they have responded wisely in having taken the decision not to respond at all <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say one word because i feel so strongly on the subject <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones referred to the young <e> <s> i have a number of young children <e> <s> we have in our midst a terrible affliction which threatens our young every day and that is drugs <e> <s> i can visualise circumstances in which it might be necessary for the fight against drugs to be undertaken by a policeman in plain clothes <e> <s> it might be necessary for policemen in plain clothes to stop and search people for drugs <e> <s> this seems to me to be so important that i cannot visualise that it would be right to remove this option from our police <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention in this debate results from an approach made to me at the end of last week by the metropolitan borough in the midlands whose name i bear <e> <s> i admit that my experience in these matters is minimal as a user only <e> <s> my problem in the next few minutes will be to try to keep my feet firmly on the ground <e> <s> when i looked at the question and briefed myself over the weekend it seemed to me that the matters raised by my friends in dudley were such as were appropriate to bring up in this second reading debate <e> <s> they raised questions of principle one or two questions of interest and one matter of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble lord <e> <s> however i still think that a shareholder if he exercises his option can have a greater degree of control over the activities of the company in which he has shares than a taxpayer over the affairs of a nationalised company <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i repeat the question that i asked during the course of my remarks to which i think he has not replied <e> <s> the question was whether the secretary of state has powers or is seeking powers either to service or to extinguish part or all of the regional authority airports debts through the national loans fund <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble earl if i have failed to cut a gordian knot through the complexities of clause <e> <s> i must explain that this wording has given some concern to the district councils who have foreknowledge of what i am speaking about today <e> <s> it has caused them concern and has caused concern to their advisers <e> <s> they feel as i said that they are in a catch- situation <e> <s> it may be that they are wrong and that the scenario i painted is incorrect but i should be grateful if the noble earl would have another look at this matter <e> <s> if he feels it would be in the general interest and improve the drafting of this particular section i would be grateful to leave matters as they stand and to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> because of the late hour it has clearly been found convenient to take lord tordoffs amendment in conjunction with mine <e> <s> there is a fundamental difference between the amendments in that lord tordoffs amendment places an inalienable obligation on councils to transfer all liabilities together with assets to the airports company <e> <s> my amendment differs from that of the noble lord in giving the councils power to decide how much of the debt shall be transferred to the company <e>", "<cs> may i take this opportunity to correct one point which i believe my noble friend made <e> <s> he said that the councils carried to some extent the responsibility for the existing situation <e> <s> i should remind the minister that in the case of the midlands district councils they have had responsibility for only the past few weeks <e> <s> before that the airport was in the hands of the west midlands county council and before that it belonged to birmingham city <e> <s> i think it is wrong to attribute any fault to the existing councils who jointly own the airport <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up one point that the noble earl made <e> <s> i am a little puzzled at his claim that if the debt were left with the local authority it would be short-term <e> <s> i cannot understand how he works that out <e> <s> if it was transferred to the airport company i could well understand that with possible growth in passenger terminal throughout and with other prospects of improved capacity which face the airports the debt might be recoverable <e> <s> but if it is left with the local authority it is there for ever and their chances of getting it back from the airport are as i see it very slender <e> <s> this is another reason why i think that to contemplate leaving a large part of the debt with a local authority is totally inequitable <e> <s> there is no chance of recovery <e> <s> dividends may be payable but this cannot be sure and it is not sure to what extent they will be payable or to what extent they would help <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make it clear enough for the noble lord lord carmichael to appreciate that of course the concession i was asking for in this amendment would apply to the cost of the powers given to councils under clause and in tact would relate to the future as well as to the past <e>", "<cs> in view of those assurances from the noble earl and i will ask him to follow them up because the matter is one of very great interest and concern to the councils who have encouraged me to speak to this amendment i feel that it is the wish of the committee that we should ask him to look again at this amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw it <e>"]
