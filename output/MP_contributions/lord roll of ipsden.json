["<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord lever of manchester for having initiated this debate <e> <s> it is right that your lordships house should devote some time to a subject which is at once vitally important and extremely difficult <e> <s> we could not have a better guide than the noble lord for as has already been said he combines a deep understanding of the subject with a rare experience of the practical workings of markets particularly of financial markets <e> <s> moreover i think i may say that despite his presence on the opposition benches he brings to this subject a balanced and essentially nonpartisan view <e> <s> this approach it seems to me is particularly welcome at this time when for reasons which i find it difficult to understand the subject tends all too often to arouse extreme fervour and to be discussed in public in terms which are more appropriate to mediaeval religious disputations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by joining with other speakers in congratulating the two maiden speakers the noble earl lord airlie and the noble viscount lord chandos <e> <s> i hope we shall hear them often in this house <e> <s> i have to declare an interest as did the noble earl lord airlie <e> <s> i too am chairman of a merchant bank which is a member of the accepting houses committee and as such is included in the list of companies which are exempted from the schedule provisions of the companies act and <e>", "<cs> my lords i will attempt to do so <e> <s> i quite explicitly tried to avoid going into the details <e> <s> i said the noble lord will recall that there are many questions of detail that will need to be discussed namely what should be the extent <e> <s> should it be applied to all financial institutions <e> <s> to what items in the balance sheet or in the profit and loss account should it apply <e> <s> i was concerned primarily with the principle and indeed only with the principle as applied to the accepting houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join previous speakers in congratulating the noble lord lord hardinge of penshurst and the noble earl lord arran on their maiden speeches both of which augur well for the many future contributions which we hope to have from them in this house <e> <s> like some previous speakers i must begin by declaring an interest but i hasten to add that it is not a pecuniary one <e> <s> i am not connected with any business involving books except account books but i am honorary chairman of the book development council which is the export arm of the publishers association and for some years i was chairman of the national book committee which brings together all organisations interested in the book from authors to publishers booksellers librarians and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by adding my tribute to the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham on his maiden speech on an occasion which is clearly far from free of contention <e> <s> he has managed very skilfully to preserve the tradition of an uncontroversial maiden speech but without loss of substance or eloquence <e> <s> i am sure we look forward to many more of his contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i also must begin by declaring an interest <e> <s> i am a merchant banker and so part of an industry which is to be regulated by this bill <e> <s> i also apologise to the house if i am unable to be here for the whole of the debate owing to an inescapable earlier commitment <e>", "<cs> let me briefly support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord elton and my noble friend lord obrien of lothbury <e> <s> i too speak as a merchant banker <e> <s> i know it has been said in certain quarters that this amendment reflects in some way a concern perhaps an unreasonable concern on the part of merchant banks to preserve their independence but even if this were so i do not think it necessarily invalidates the arguments in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i do not honestly think that we need to debate that point at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to my noble friend lord kearton for the manner in which he has introduced this important debate <e> <s> those of us who had the privilege of serving under him on the sub-committee that produced this report have had many occasions upon which to admire the masterly way in which he has steered us through this jungle of highly contentious and very perplexing issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by adding my congratulations to the noble viscount lord trenchard on an excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i do so all the more readily because in another incarnation i had the pleasure of having quite a lot to do with his distinguished father <e> <s> i am sure that the noble viscount will make some extremely valuable contributions to our deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord kearton for introducing this debate <e> <s> the report was prepared by a sub-committee which he chaired and in which i had the privilege to participate <e> <s> he has covered the ground of the report so well that i wish only to make some general comments on points <e>", "<cs> my lords we are once again indebted to my noble friend lord kearton for introducing this debate on a report prepared under his chairmanship <e> <s> it deals with a subject of tremendous importance <e> <s> i make so bold as to say that next to the question of the restructuring of the european security system to which it has some relevance this is a subject which will profoundly affect our lives and those of future generations <e> <s> i should like to say at once that i broadly agree with the conclusions of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say that at no time did i say that the events in eastern europe had no effect whatever <e> <s> i certainly do not believe that i described them as momentous <e> <s> the difference between my noble friend lord greenhill and myself is that whereas he believes that the events argue in favour of delaying the process of european integration in the community i believe the opposite that they argue in favour of accelerating it <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble earl lord de la warr on his maiden speech <e> <s> as a denizen of the city i naturally look forward to his future contributions particularly on financial matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the report we are debating today matches perfectly the importance of the issues with which it deals <e> <s> from a medium and long-term view there is none as vital for the future of our country <e> <s> the noble lord lord aldington and his committee deserve our congratulations and gratitude for a masterly document <e> <s> it is particularly noteworthy in that it presents very objectively and clearly all the various views that can be held on these complex issues and yet it is not a bland document <e> <s> it comes to quite clear-cut conclusions <e> <s> i say at once that i agree wholeheartedly with the committee at least on all crucial points <e> <s> the report comes at an opportune time just before the opening of the intergovernmental conferences on monetary and economic union and political union <e> <s> i propose to confine myself to the former <e>"]
