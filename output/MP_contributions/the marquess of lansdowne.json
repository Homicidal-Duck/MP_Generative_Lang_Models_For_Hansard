["<cs> my lords it is so long since i last had the honour of speaking in your lordships house that i have been unable to overcome extreme nervousness <e> <s> it is not through lack of respect or interest in the proceedings of your lordships house that i craved leave of absence but through circumstances beyond my control <e> <s> as a repentant backwoodsman i have no right to ask for the indulgence that your lordships customarily show to a maiden speaker <e> <s> however i hope that your lordships will make allowances if my delivery and the presentation of the remarks to which i am most anxious to draw your lordships attention fall below the high standard to which your lordships are accustomed <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for his intervention here <e> <s> one of the reasons for putting down this amendment at all was to draw arguments from your lordships <e> <s> of course i am entirely in favour of broadening the basis of representation on the river boards <e> <s> i said this in the second reading debate on the bill and i have no reason to alter my opinion now <e> <s> my only reservation and it is probably not a very strong one is that those who really are involved with rivers in the way that owners are have i use the expression deliberately a vested interest in their continued health which is perhaps slightly different from the point of view of the occasional angler using the river <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not be accused by the noble lord lord ross of being a thrawn gabbit if i criticise quite a lot of the bill <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord gray upon introducing a bill at all <e> <s> however in my opinion it is a very wee timorous beastie <e> <s> when we last discussed salmon i had the impression all the way through the speech of the noble lord lord gray of wait for it <e> <s> wait for it <e> <s> im going to do something rather big <e> <s> what have we got <e> <s> a little mouse <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support the amendment of the noble viscount lord thurso because i think that without it as he so clearly pointed out there will be quite a considerable degree of unfairness <e> <s> it does not apply in my own district of the tay area but i can see great difficulties elsewhere <e> <s> i hope very much that even if the noble lord who is in charge of the bill is not able to accept this amendment now he will give it very careful consideration <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble viscount to explain the word adequate <e>", "<cs> as a netsman myself i should like wholeheartedly to support the amendment of the noble viscount lord ridley <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i must re-emphasise that only part of my amendment has been read out but i take it that the <e>", "<cs> as the noble duke mentioned my name i can assure your lordships that this is an experience which i have often suffered <e> <s> therefore i hope that my noble friend lord gray will give it his very careful attention <e>", "<cs> if i may perhaps intervene i think that the noble lord lord ross may be a little confused here <e> <s> the question of finance was about finance lacking in those areas where there are no district boards <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> one of the difficulties as i saw it of co-opting was that the co-opted people would be the creatures of the elected members of the board <e> <s> this is a perpetuation of rotten boroughs <e> <s> those worked very well once upon a time but it would not be a good plan to have them again <e> <s> i hope very much that the suggestion of the noble viscount lord thurso will be accepted <e> <s> it is a little confusing <e> <s> the tenant netsmen and the anglers elect themselves <e> <s> they are then accepted by the board <e> <s> they become fully enfranchised <e> <s> this is a very important point which i mentioned at second reading <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord who is in charge of this bill has mentioned my name i must add my thanks to him <e> <s> this is an immensely helpful amendment and i am very glad that he has put it forward <e> <s> in saying that i wish to make it clear that i shall not be able to go on thanking the noble lord for the rest of the afternoon for what he suggests <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may i put one point to him <e> <s> he referred to monofilament nets <e> <s> i am very nervous about this expression because so far as i know monofilament nets have not been made for a long time <e> <s> the trade does not deal in monofilament nets <e> <s> it deals in multifilament fine-ply nets <e> <s> if we use the expression monofilament nets there is a very grave risk that what my noble friend is trying to achieve will be got round <e> <s> i should like the order to be changed to refer to monofilament and multifilament fine-ply nets <e> <s> i am advised that monofilament nets are hardly used and that nets are now multifilament <e>", "<cs> what happens when the multifilament nets are used <e>", "<cs> i must intervene here <e> <s> i am speaking now as a past prime warden of the fishmongers company <e> <s> as members of the committee know the fishmongers company has a fish meter operating in billingsgate market a superintendent of fishery <e> <s> he is a man of great experience and he inspects the boxes of fish <e> <s> he knows an enormous amount about fish and i can assure the noble lord that the statement he has made is very far from the truth <e> <s> i hope he will withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord haig <e> <s> what he has said about a poacher being able to get going immediately after having committed an offence is something of which i have experience as chairman of the tay river fishery board <e> <s> if a poachers gear is confiscated of course his wings are clipped but very often his gear is not confiscated so off he goes and commits another crime <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not quite clear how far we have got in the list of amendments <e> <s> i have amendments down no <e> <s> a and no <e> <s> c which is on the subject of drift netting <e> <s> are we taking all these together <e> <s> i understood from the noble lord lord campbell of croy that the suggestion was that we should do so <e> <s> with the leave of the committee perhaps i may speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> a and c both of which deal with the question of drift netting <e>", "<cs> i did not wish to give the impression that they had anything to do with scotland <e> <s> they are entirely to do with england because there is no drift netting in scotland <e> <s> this refers only to drift netting where it is legal off the north-east coast of england <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my amendment still stands <e> <s> i presume that it does <e> <s> i should like to make one or two observations about what my noble friend lord belstead has said <e> <s> of course i welcome the idea that the licensee is obliged to be on board when his net is working <e> <s> we have heard nothing about how the government propose to enforce this regulation <e> <s> it requires thinking about <e> <s> i wonder whether i can attract the attention of my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> it is a point to which he may wish to reply <e> <s> i was referring to the licensee being obliged to be on board while his net is working <e> <s> that has to be enforced <e> <s> is it going to be enforced by the other licensees <e>", "<cs> i think that i can answer that question because i wrote it down this morning <e> <s> the tay slaps at noon on saturday until am on monday <e> <s> in the case of my own company one boat crew fishes for hours per week one shift does eight hours a day <e> <s> that is what happens on my own river <e> <s> i think you will find that it will be possible for the drift netters to fish for very much longer hours i think that they will manager hours <e> <s> does that answer the noble viscounts question <e>", "<cs> i naturally take my noble friends advice and very reluctantly promising to come back to this later i shall not move this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i really put down this amendment in the hope of helping my noble friend lord gray <e> <s> i know he wants to help us over this difficulty <e> <s> my amendment really seeks exactly the same end <e> <s> therefore thank you but there is really no need for me to speak to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gray took so many things away to consider that i am not surprised that he perhaps overlooked what i think is a very important amendment <e> <s> now that the objectionable word adequate has been removed i hope that the noble lord lord gray will feel able to accept this amendment <e> <s> i think it is a really important one and i speak from personal experience <e> <s> i hope very much that the amendment of the noble viscount lord thurso will be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> to which i have added my name <e> <s> the particular difficulty with which it deals does not apply in my own area but i know that it may do so in others <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be unfair if one of two proprietors were not allowed to have his say and so i hope that the noble lord lord gray will feel able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very clear exposition by the noble lord lord gray <e> <s> i only moved the amendment because the existing wording seemed unnecessary and therefore rather confusing <e> <s> if that provision is absolutely essential as well as very confusing then of course i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> it is covered <e> <s> i shall not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay your lordships with an unnecessary speech but i should like to add a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> i am the chairman of a district river board and i have always felt that it would be much better if we were obliged to meet annually <e> <s> accountability is of course very important <e> <s> in addition it would give an opportunity for riparian owners and interested parties to say what they have to say to ones face as it were instead of as at the moment having to ask for a special meeting to discuss a subject <e> <s> i would not be inclined to refuse a special meeting because they are very good things to have but i think it would be sensible and wise if we were obliged to meet annually <e> <s> with those few words i support the amendment in the names of my noble friend lord burton and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we have often found this difficulty in my board <e> <s> the position should be tightened up <e> <s> quite a number of letters have to be written on certain occasions <e> <s> this wastes the clerks time and the boards money <e> <s> the matter should be tightened up and interest thereon added <e> <s> i hope sincerely that the noble lord will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word on this subject <e> <s> i spoke about it on a previous occasion and i used the expression second-class membership <e> <s> i am strongly against any suggestion of second-class membership <e> <s> i am equally strongly opposed to the idea of disenfranchised members <e>", "<cs> my lords i would just like to say a word about this <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael raised this question before and i fully appreciate what he is driving at <e> <s> the work of bailiffs is important and responsible but the members of the board who appoint the bailiffs are also responsible people <e> <s> the bailiffs are not appointed by the clerk though the clerk is a responsible person as well i can assure the noble lords that great pains are taken in the appointment of bailiffs <e> <s> of course mistakes can be made and sometimes they are made <e> <s> a man who is not satisfactory could be appointed <e> <s> but i think it is necessary and i am sure the noble lord lord carmichael will appreciate this not quite so much in my own district perhaps because we do not always have to operate in remote areas but in a remote area if the bailiff has to get a search warrant perhaps i have misunderstood but the way the bill is drafted it gives the bailiff the power of entry <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord on the liberal benches congratulated me on the way i supported him <e> <s> the object of my amendment is to put in what i call absolutely plain english the reverse onus of proof <e> <s> this was dealt with summarily and i accept completely what my noble friend lord gray said <e> <s> as regards the point made by my noble friend lord burton fortunately if i were likely to be arrested at home it would be by my own water bailiffs so i think i might get away with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps point out now that if this amendment amendment no <e> <s> were accepted there would be no object in my moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be convenient if i spoke now to my amendment no <e> <s> which deals with drift netting <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i think they have been doing very well lately <e> <s> one thing that is clear and i have said this before is that nobody in their senses would want to take the livelihood away from one group of people to give it to another even if by so doing the people to whom they were giving it were much more numerous than the people from whom they were taking it away <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have had personal experience of the need of it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask the noble lord to give serious consideration to whether this review should not cover the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> we cannot pay lip service to a national policy if we are not going to review the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i find this unsatisfactory and disappointing <e> <s> i hoped that her majestys government would try to look at the salmon fishing industry in the round <e> <s> this does not appear to be the intention of her majestys government <e> <s> at this late hour i do not think that i can subject your lordships to a division but i should like to put on record my grave disappointment and anxiety that her majestys government have not considered the fishery industry as a whole for the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> having said that reluctantly i withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like as a latecomer in agreeing to this amendment to say that i have done quite a bit of research into this matter since the amendment was first put down <e> <s> although my own experience on the tay is that the amendment would not really be so necessasry i can see that for other rivers where conditions are different it is vital that the amendment should be carried <e> <s> i therefore hope very much that the noble lord lord gray will give it very serious consideration <e> <s> if he is not able to accept the amendment tonight then i hope he will do something about it <e> <s> this matter is much more serious than i originally realised <e> <s> as a late recruit to that belief i am hopeful that my opinion will now add some weight to the important amendment moved by my noble friend lord ridley <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> i confess that this is a question of there being short notice <e> <s> yes one could call it short notice because the amendment which i put down only reached your lordships house by post yesterday morning <e>"]
