["<cs> my lords years ago i was sitting robed in counsels row in the inner london sessions one of the busiest criminal courts in london <e> <s> i had not then entered pupilage but i was doing so on the advice of my pupil master-to-be who thought that i should get used to the novelty of the wig and gown pending his return from vacation <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave your lordships indulgence <e> <s> it was only yesterday evening that someone thought fit to suggest that a lord of appeal in ordinary might take part in this debate <e> <s> as noble lords will know we have been somewhat unusually busy in the appellate committee over the past day or two including today <e>", "<cs> my lords i always noticed that he fixed his sessions immediately after i had held mine so that there was no work left for him to do and he could return to his highly lucrative practice <e> <s> even among the few cases with which he was prepared to deal i am sure he will accept that the sentences that he and i imposed in our capacity as recorders for burglary theft dishonesty and fraud were considerably higher than they are today <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular pleasure to commence my address by adding my congratulations to those of your lordships to my noble friend lord irvine of lairg <e> <s> i fell under the spell of his advocacy some seven and a half years ago <e> <s> i had just been elevated to the court of appeal and i was doing my three weeks compulsory pupillage sitting on the left of the master of the rolls lord denning with a large l around my neck visible certainly to the bar if to nobody else <e> <s> we assented to his propositions very speedily but apparently the magic was not strong enough for what we referred to as the voices of infallibility higher up the scale <e> <s> but then the noble lord lord denning used to say perhaps he still does that those were not vintage years in the upper house <e>", "<cs> my lords repetition is not the spice of debates although it is often unavoidably a common ingredient <e> <s> when i had the privilege of addressing your lordships house three months ago on this very subject i made two points <e> <s> i shall refer to them again with the minimum of repetition and i shall devote my comments to seeking to repel some of the criticisms that they have caused <e>", "<cs> i wish to start with what i believe is a relatively simple proposition <e> <s> a system of justice that makes no provision for correcting a manifest gross error is clearly a deficient system <e>", "<cs> the last occasion on which this matter was considered in parliament was in <e> <s> lord reid introduced an amendment in committee <e> <s> the amendment was defeated by votes to <e> <s> the lord chief justice lord parker <e> <s> although in favour voted against the amendment because the queens bench judges were split to <e> <s> lord denning who was in favour and gave evidence to that effect in the tucker committee was not then provided by our generous treasury with a car and as the division took place not long after i know from bitter experience that he might still have been sitting <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee will allow me to intervene again for a short moment <e> <s> it is some time since i have been a devil and i have overlooked some specific instructions that the chief justice asked me to bring to members attention <e> <s> there is a technical point involved under schedule <e> <s> it is provided that the single judge and that is not a reference to his marital status but merely denotes that he is acting on his own behalf should have power to exercise the decision under subsection a or b which is to set aside the order for retrial and direct the court of a trial to enter judgment and verdict <e> <s> my request from the chief justice was to say that this is a matter which is looked upon as being of such importance as to justify the full court of three judges and that it should not be dealt with by a single judge <e> <s> it is a nuts and bolts matter but i thought <e>", "<cs> just to assist my friend he may be happy to know that i appeared before the top salaries review body on their behalf last friday <e> <s> i confirm my prophetic voice <e>", "<cs> any debate which concerns altering trial by jury is bound to give rise to strong feelings <e> <s> i have no doubt that when some years ago we debated abolishing unanimity among jurors there was more rhetoric than we have heard this evening <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord devlin who is always quoted as being an authority on nearly everything wrote some years before that debate that it would be very wrong for a jurys unanimity to go <e> <s> my noble friend lord hutchinson in his anxiety to espouse the scottish system would not i believe accept the majority of eight to seven which they have in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the motion and i wish to bring up to date a few factors in so doing <e> <s> it was a long time ago that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was at the bar <e> <s> it was quite some time ago that i was at the bar but in when i became a qc the number of those at the bar was under <e> <s> the number now is over and there is not the slightest suggestion that the bar is not capable of providing the additional supply of judges and a great deal more as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the points raised by the noble viscount but the form of his question indicates that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether your lordships will allow me to say just a word on the subject of amendment no <e> <s> m and in particular on the subject of judicial review <e> <s> it is not a modern panacea to achieve a form of appeal it is a procedure to attack not the merits of the decision but the decision-making process <e> <s> it seems to me that there is confusion in thinking that without subsection m there would be a right of appeal on the merits of the decision <e> <s> subsection m takes away from the judicial review process one of its vital constituents that is the right to challenge an irrational decision a decision which no reasonable person would make <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it without subsection m one can attack the ministers decision on the ground that it is irrational <e> <s> under judicial review one cannot attack the merits of the decision as one would by way of appeal <e> <s> as i understand it judicial review is designed to see that the decision-making process has been conducted in accordance with the law not irrationally and in compliance with the rules of natural justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i raise one matter for clarification <e> <s> should there not be spelt out either in the amendment or elsewhere a specific obligation on the secretary of state to provide not only notice that he is contemplating making an order but the facts and the law relied on for the making of that order <e> <s> there has been removed by virtue of the previous amendments the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> if the words which are sought to be excised are left in they provide a quite unnecessary hostage to the ingenuity of counsel which although not unlimited is still i am happy to say extensive <e> <s> for that reason it would be very desirable to make the matter clear <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have a lot of sympathy with the amendment it raises only one small part of a very much larger problem <e> <s> the problem is being dealt with piecemeal whereas it needs to be dealt with in its entirety <e> <s> in saying that i refer to the offence of murder <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a unique pleasure hearing the noble lord lord mishcon reading out that which sounded so much more persuasive from him than from me <e> <s> perhaps i may make it perfectly clear where i and the noble lord lord hutchinson disagree <e> <s> what is rightly provided in the clearest of terms is the opportunity for who i refer to as the defendant to have the right to make representations <e> <s> it is obviously intended that he should have a proper right to make representations <e> <s> the obligation as it stands at the moment under subsection is merely an obligation to explain his entitlement under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor had the gift of immortality and permanence in the office which he adorns i would express none of the anxieties which i now express <e> <s> if contrary to reality i could have made those two happy assumptions my personal knowledge of his outstanding fairness and independence would have totally convinced me of his ability to withstand and not to be overborne by what my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell referred to as the juggernaut of the treasury <e>", "<cs> i apologise for arriving late and would not have spoken after the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor but for the fact that we have been sitting in the appeal committee <e> <s> but i am wondering in answer to his suggestion that he would consider a statement of purpose whether the committee has been reminded of this <e> <s> the governments response in command paper which contained the governments responses to the recommendation on legal services of the royal commission presided over by the noble lord lord benson had this phrase at page <e>", "<cs> having had the privilege and pleasure of hearing my noble and learned friend lord hailsham say in regard to amendment no <e> <s> that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was heavily accountable a comment he repeated more than once to parliament in the choice of the members of the board i too and for that reason support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment which i should have thought might have been welcomed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in order to test whether the legal aid advisory committee has anything of value to offer <e> <s> this would precisely achieve that because the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would then be able to see whether as a result of the board from time to time furnishing the committee with information there is a useful feedback from that committee which would justify its existence <e> <s> i do not want to arm the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with a reply to a later amendment which i have down and to which my noble friend lord irvine has referred <e> <s> however i should have thought that it would fortify his resistance to be able to say i want to keep the power to abolish the committee in the light of the utility or absence of utility which it demonstrates having regard to this amendment which obliges the committee to act with the information which it receives <e> <s> for those reasons i should have thought that this is a sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a short comment on this point <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor knows very often great costs are run up in appeals where if the case had been argued competently in the first instance no appeal would have been necessary <e> <s> if in this field one is concerned with public expenditure and it is probably only in this field that one is so concerned one should hear in mind that money well spent at an early stage can often prevent quite unnecessary expenditure at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to echo what my noble and learned friend lord denning has said <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will recall the appeal committee has recently drawn attention to the need to provide by regulation for what are very difficult cases <e> <s> the example which my noble and learned friend lord hailsham has given describes a simple situation which really happens <e> <s> the wife does not get a house <e> <s> what happens is that there is a dispute between the husband and wife in regard to a house on which there is a mortgage <e> <s> the order is that the house be sold and the wife take per cent <e> <s> the husband if he can retaining the other share either the proceeds or by raising a mortgage <e> <s> by the time the costs are taken out of the value of the remaining equity there is basically nothing left and the litigation has achieved an absence of accommodation for both husband and wife <e> <s> it is that situation which requires mitigation <e> <s> the need to improve the regulations has been the subject matter of the attention of the courts which have asked that something be done about it <e> <s> it has not been done yet <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> in fact i support it in a sweeping-up amendment which we shall reach later <e> <s> this is one of those parts of the act which in fact is conveniently covered by the existing legislation <e> <s> i refer to section which lists those regulations which shall not come into force until approved by a resolution of each house of parliament <e> <s> unless it can be suggested that that section has not worked appropriately i find it difficult to follow why this should be by a negative resolution <e>", "<cs> there are real problems in this field and i do not think they can be skated over in the way in which they have been <e> <s> may i refer to two of them <e> <s> if you have a large number of people involved in the same type of claim their damages will be different but the common issue will be can you establish liability <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment out of the sense that it may cause unfairness unless there is an assurance that what the noble lord fears will not take place <e> <s> i have an impression though i may be quite wrong that the white paper foreshadows that this is the type of order that might be made <e> <s> it could work unfairly in many respects <e> <s> let me suggest one or two <e> <s> a case may start with all proper expedition get into court then it is heard that there is judgment pending in the same type of action and therefore it had better be adjourned <e> <s> it is adjourned judgment is given and notice of appeal is immediately entered <e> <s> again it has to delayed <e> <s> it may even go to the house of lords <e> <s> such a delay is totally unattributable to the parties or their solicitors a delay which may involve <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene in my address to the committee i carefully avoided dealing with clause <e> <s> that is the subject matter of detailed amendments <e> <s> i had hoped that this could be dealt with in a self-contained statement otherwise there will be a constant repetition of the same points <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend invited interruption or i should not have intervened <e> <s> he is right that the phrase civil litigation includes matrimonial cases <e> <s> since drafting the amendment i understand that there has been a considerable move towards the standard fee in matrimonial work <e> <s> i understand that regulations are about to come into force to provide for the taxation of those fees in every case <e> <s> therefore they are not of the concern that i ventured to suggest or had in mind with regard to ordinary civil non-matrimonial matters <e>", "<cs> anyone who had joined the debate knowing nothing of the background and hearing references to unconstitutional suggestions and fixing the situation in a mould that was unsatisfactory would never have dreamed for one moment that the amendment being proposed was merely to put back that which has existed <e>", "<cs> with great respect i had invited the committees consent to my dealing with amendment no <e> <s> on its own and that is the amendment which i have asked leave to move <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor sits down could he confirm what i hoped he was going to confirm earlier in the day <e> <s> it was that the government stand by their response which i read out in relation to legal aid <e> <s> it was in these terms on page of the command paper <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady seear put her finger very perspicaciously on the point <e> <s> the suspicion which has widely existed that the reason for the exclusion of the statutory obligation was to avoid judicial review is simply this <e> <s> judicial review is the courts supervisory jurisdiction <e> <s> what are they to supervise <e> <s> as the act now stands quite clearly they are to supervise the statutory obligation of the lord chancellor to pay fair remuneration for work actually and reasonably done <e> <s> it is that which can be supervised <e> <s> once one starts an area of total discretion one has a great deal more difficulty <e> <s> as i understand it irrationality would have to be <e>", "<cs> that is not accurate with great respect to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> according to the statement of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on second reading as from this month it would be down to per cent <e> <s> and it would be totally removed once the legislation came into force <e>", "<cs> the last thing i wish to do is to embarrass this chamber <e> <s> the fact that this amendment is being debated at a late hour was not of my choosing <e> <s> if i had been told at dinner time that we were to continue consideration of this bill on thursday i should have ordered a decanter of wine instead of a bitter lemon and enjoyed the rest of the evening <e>", "<cs> in view of the two years of consistent harmony that i have enjoyed sitting alongside the noble and learned lord i have every confidence that he will do his best <e> <s> i hope that that confidence will be fully satisfied as i believe it will in due course <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would not suggest for one moment that in regard to pay agreed there would be an attempt to make deductions although the power would no doubt exist if the clause stands <e> <s> where pay should go up there would be no increase and the public purse would then recoup itself by a standstill so that the remuneration got less and less reasonable <e>", "<cs> i find myself in the situation to which my noble and learned friend lord griffiths referred on second reading seeking to negotiate when there is nothing with which to negotiate <e> <s> in that unhappy situation i have no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on the axiom of <e>", "<cs> i merely made the observation because yesterday evening when i was perfectly prepared to continue with the amendments which were down in my name the general view was that we should rise <e> <s> naturally i did nothing to take a contrary view <e> <s> i was wondering i am in your lordships hands why tuesday should be treated so differently from monday <e> <s> apparently however that is to be the case so i shall seek to address the committee <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that the response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is deeply disappointing <e> <s> members of the committee have tolerated with great kindness the expression of my views on a number of occasions this evening <e> <s> let me end not with my views but with a quotation from the debate and the views of the noble lord lord bancroft a former permanent secretary to the treasury who regretted his inability to be here <e>", "<cs> it has always been my custom to accept any advice given by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> of course i shall keep dry such powder as exists at the moment and shall follow his course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale has said unless subsection b is excised there is on the face of the bill an injustice and an inequity because it follows that the court is deprived of the power to do justice or to do equity unless a further condition severe financial hardship is established <e> <s> it cannot be mere financial hardship it must be severe financial hardship <e> <s> therefore a person who cannot prove that but perhaps can prove only financial hardship leaves with an injustice and an inequity forced upon him by the statute <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord denning gave your lordships an example of such a case during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is intended as a question then i can answer it <e> <s> i thought that i had <e> <s> i added the word reasonable because my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor had difficulty in understanding how it worked <e> <s> i added the word reasonable because it is used by taxing masters as the basis for assessing fair remuneration and i read out the terms of order <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has justified his action in regard to the judicial proceedings <e> <s> i do not want to turn the sword in the wound but he said that the case was settled on terms agreeable to him <e> <s> i wonder whether he will confirm that despite strong resistance an order was made by the divisional court for his department to pay the entire costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it perfectly clear that i am not adding a factor or seeking to add a factor by my amendment <e> <s> i am putting the horse where it should be by defining the obligation and after the obligation is defined then as is frequently the case one identifies some of the major relevant factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one inquiry to make <e> <s> by reference to what is it proposed to decide whether something is relevant <e> <s> is it by reference to fairness or to some other concept <e> <s> if so what <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved this amendment at committee stage <e> <s> obviously the lateness of the night gave me too great a sense of relief that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor was going to accept the concept <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i join my noble friend not in any way to suggest that i am in favour of any undivided profession divided profession is firmly my view but in order to make sure that both our weight was leant to what i should have thought was a simple amendment which should be granted <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house having regard to the paternity which is now conceded in regard to the amendment i should like to explain in a sentence or two how it was included in the lord chancellors departments list of relevant factors on th april <e> <s> the bar was saying as was said in the debate in june that people are no longer coming to the bar because they are put off <e> <s> unless they are high-fliers who can carry out privately funded commercial work they are not coming to the bar <e> <s> those who are now at the bar are doing their best to move away from the main publicly-funded criminal work and into civil work <e> <s> the anxiety was felt that although there are now enough people to carry out the work because they cannot all leave the profession and find other employment they will not enter from the universities because the professors and the profession will say that if one is thinking of coming to the bar to undertake criminal or matrimonial work all of which by and large is publicly-funded one should think again <e> <s> that is the point we are seeking to make and it is why the lord chancellors department has identified it as being one of the relevant factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that this amendment is being misunderstood <e> <s> the cost to public funds is clearly relevant in the administration of this service <e> <s> the cost to public funds must bear upon the entitlement to legal aid where you draw the limits what is the capital and what is the income <e> <s> the cost to public funds must determine whether there is legal aid before the social security commissioners a matter with which my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor had considerable sympathy <e> <s> however funds do not stretch that far <e> <s> they do not stretch far enough to cover proceedings before the industrial tribunals <e> <s> they do not stretch far enough to cover the coroners courts <e> <s> we all wish that they did <e>", "<cs> my lords i make two points in answer to the lord chancellor <e> <s> the first is that i do not understand that the removal of the per cent <e> <s> is any act of generosity <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is down in my name and i believed that i was entitled to close it <e> <s> however i bow to my noble and learned friend if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is down in our joint names <e> <s> may i have the permission of your lordships to continue uninterrupted <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to voice my difficulty in understanding this <e> <s> since my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has said he wishes to identify a simple and workable formula which the professions will be able easily to follow this does not seem to qualify <e>", "<cs> my lords recently i happened to come across a magazine issued by the bar which has two great advantages <e> <s> first it contains two excellent photographs one in colour and one in black and white which almost do justice to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> they caught my eye <e> <s> secondly the following phrase used by my noble and learned friend caught my eye i welcome advice <e> <s> that is the whole purpose and function of the amendment <e> <s> that it is advice only the committee would offer is made plain when one sees what the noble lord lord bancroft a one-time permanent secretary to the treasury said to which my noble friend lord benson has drawn our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully but sadly to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i shall have in due course to return to my room find my copy of <e>", "<cs> my lords being at heart an unrepentant optimist i thought i would return to the chamber because this is not an amendment to establish a new advisory committee but to retain an existing one <e> <s> i thought those impressive words i welcome advice might at least inure for the benefit of that which already exists <e> <s> in that happy frame of mind i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for removing that paragraph <e> <s> my noble friend lord benson did not expect the other amendments to be moved so fast <e> <s> as he was the mover of the amendments on report he intended to be here to express his gratitude <e> <s> however i shall do so now on behalf of us both <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise significantly as the thirteenth speaker before your lordships having come here mainly at the suggestion or the noble lord lord allen who thought that there might be some delicate hints during the course of the debate that a the judges were sending too many people to prison and b that they were not properly educated in the subject of sentencing <e> <s> i expected the delicacy from him <e> <s> i did not expect it from my old friend the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> however he committed himself on paper to <e>", "<cs> my lords my essential purpose in attending this debate was to try and absorb the words of wisdom of the distinguished and learned speakers who have spoken and those who are about to speak <e> <s> it was also to savour once again the swiss-watch precision of my old colleague and friend the noble and learned lord lord goff to whose judgments i so enjoyed listening in the court of appeal in those far off relaxed days when we were allowed to read our judgments rather than to hand them down <e> <s> i warmly congratulate him on his maiden speech and greatly look forward to many such future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords a recent announcement in an american newspaper was in the following terms <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had expressed myself very fully <e> <s> i quoted sir gordon borrie <e> <s> i quoted marrre <e> <s> since my noble friend gives me the opportunity i shall quote from a letter reference to which i had omitted received yesterday from the former chief justice of australia well known to your lordships sir harry gibbs <e> <s> i had sent him the green papers <e> <s> he says this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that recommendation <e> <s> i believe that my letter is a great deal more up to date <e> <s> it comes from a chief justice of enormous repute and vast experience but i am grateful for the intervention as i always will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene <e> <s> that is not the recommendation of the select committee <e> <s> the select committee with the support of members who have knowledge of scotland recommended that in england and in scotland there should be a discretionary sentence with the option to impose a life sentence wherever appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tribute to the relaxed efficiency of our chairman the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made it clear that the matter of the words of the noble and <e>", "<cs> relaxed and efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great privilege to address your lordships house <e> <s> my first occasion as a young barrister was over years ago <e> <s> my last occasion was last month on the debate on the report of the select committee of which i was member on murder and life imprisonment <e> <s> looking back over those many occasions including even those appearances before my learned and very distinguished predecessors who on occasions i thought were distinctly carnivorous it has been not only a privilege but a pleasure <e> <s> it will continue to be a great privilege to address your lordships house on this bill in all its succeeding stages <e> <s> but i am bound to say that it will be no pleasure <e>", "<cs> in view of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellors agreement to consider the proposal and also his statement in terms that he proposes to consult county court judges i await the report stage with enthusiasm and optimism <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not comment on the reference to blackmail which was an unworthy word for my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to use <e> <s> one can rely upon the lord chief justice to consult with his judges <e> <s> one can rely upon him to have in mind solely the interests of judges and to refuse his consent where necessary because that is appropriate <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the comment <e> <s> i do not comment further upon it <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson <e> <s> he and i were old sparring partners from the county court up to the high court and in libel actions in particular <e> <s> like many practitioners before me i came into the libel field merely as a result of there being a sudden fall-out of all the talent and i was the one who resulted from scraping the barrel <e> <s> mr justice faulks had become a judge mr justice milmo had become a judge mr beyeus qc had died and gerald gardiner qc had become lord chancellor i came in as a qc <e> <s> i then realised how incredibly complex specialised and technical was that field of law <e> <s> it is contemplated imposing upon county court judges very few of whom have ever been near a libel action a whole <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down he has addressed a good many of his observations to staffing problems <e> <s> i wish to inquire whether he is taking any steps to deal with the wholly unrealistic cash limits imposed upon the circuits which resulted in the examples which i gave <e> <s> judges or deputy judges were being told that their services could not be used because the subsistence could not be paid by the circuits although the daily rate could be paid by the lord chancellor <e> <s> buildings could not be cleaned as the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice pointed out on second reading because there was no cash <e> <s> clocks could not be put right after the winter and summer time changes because it costs money to get a clocksmith in from outside to do that <e> <s> building proposals have been scrapped and i have even been told that certain security requirements have been delayed because of the cash limits <e>", "<cs> as post-prandial amendments go this must be one of the least stimulating <e> <s> but it is right that attention should be drawn to it because as we are in many cases adopting what the civil justice review proposed we ought to know why this proposal has been rejected <e> <s> perhaps i may quickly refer to the salient points which are to be found at pages and of the report <e> <s> the report says that <e>", "<cs> i wish to associate myself with the general philosophy of the amendment <e> <s> however i have noticed that in schedule on page which deals with the advisory committee that committee will provide an annual report on the discharge of its functions <e> <s> the report will be laid before each house of parliament <e> <s> i would have hoped that what was sauce for the goose would be sauce for and this is <e>", "<cs> fellow feeling makes us wondrous wise and having arrived in my room at oclock this morning and sat in the appellate committee i am now conscious of what the junior hospital doctor must go through every day <e> <s> i say that by way of an anticipatory apology because i do not think that i follow the constant references to the fact that there can be no reduction of the high court jurisdiction under this act <e> <s> if one looks at page paragraph e states that the lord chancellor may by order specify <e>", "<cs> on the face of it there is a completely open discretion but decisions have shown the principles upon which that discretion should be exercised <e> <s> therefore to widen the apparent discretion by references as vague as this can only lead to confusion and confusion when one is trying to simplify matters in courts that are to receive a large impact of extra work cannot be an advantage <e>", "<cs> the best point of my noble friend lord prys-davies which he may have overlooked is that when we look at schedule all pages of it and see the extraordinary melange of people who in future may well be judges it is perhaps desirable to spell out everything <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in his opening speech on second reading at col of <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene <e> <s> clause reads <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down i wish to point out that he has mentioned whom among others he would certainly consult <e> <s> in those circumstances has he any objection to following the kind of phraseology used in clause provided that before making any order under this section the lord chancellor shall consult with the heads of division and the senior presiding judge <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has agreed to consider putting into the clause a reference at least to consulting some of the judiciary <e> <s> i selected the chief justice because i did not think it was necessary to consult the heads of divisions <e> <s> when one looks at <e>", "<cs> it should be recalled how much of the average county judges time is spent dealing with litigants in person <e> <s> in this ivory tower we tend to forget the great strain for a judge to cope day in day out with the litigant in person <e> <s> if he has to cope with the barrack-room lawyer in person it is a wholly excessive strain on his patience <e> <s> the word <e>", "<cs> i shall intervene only briefly because there is clearly a great degree of harmony on this matter <e> <s> i seek only to enhance it by reference to what my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said on second reading namely <e>",

assistance in order to ascertain to what extent the client is protected <e> <s> the client does not know the difference between what would result from taxation and what would result from an ordinary agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords to understand the amendment one has to look at it in its historical context <e> <s> i speak of course subject as always to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham but i understand the historical background is that before the beeching royal commission on assizes and quarter sessions between and there were certain quarter sessions which were entirely open to solicitors because of the remoteness of the areas in which those courts took place <e> <s> for instance on my circuit there was bodmin and there were other places in lincolnshire <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the regrets of my noble and learned friend lord hailsham that this amendment has had to surface but i entirely agree with the noble lord lord hutchinson that the bill has made it inevitable

lords i hope that my noble and learned friend will forgive me if i point out that i added to that phrase or words to the like effect so as to make quite sure that that comment could not validly be made <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a great privilege on occasions to support amendments moved by the noble lord lord mishcon and it has been an equally great pleasure on occasions to find that he has supported some of mine <e> <s> i regret that i do not support the amendment because i have understood it to be a theme of the bill that experience in advocacy is the criterion for appointment to the bench <e> <s> i do not mean by that that the outstanding advocate necessarily makes the best or even the appropriate judge but the experienced advocate is the person who i should have suggested with respect consistently requires the knowledge of court procedure and activity if he is to perform higher judicial functions appropriately <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend resumes contact with the woolsack perhaps he will answer the question which i specifically raised <e> <s> if this is such a good idea south of the border why does it make no appearance in the scottish bill <e> <s> it may be that suitably armoured my noble and learned friend will be able to persuade me that i should move an amendment to the scottish bill in due course <e> <s> however i have yet to learn why there should be this difference south of the border particularly in view of the fact that when dealing with contingency fees in committee my noble and learned friend said that it was really quite unpalatable to have those significant differences in jurisprudence north and south of the divide <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph of the green paper stated on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs>

find that i have managed to achieve for the lord chancellor a personal immunity which when the bill started he had not the opportunity to enjoy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the very phraseology makes the clause unworkable <e> <s> if a person fails to comply with a recommendation he doubtless has his own reasons which he thinks are satisfactory <e> <s> however he does not have the

make a few comments <e> <s> the reference to trouble in england is a media creation <e> <s> there is a desire by the solicitors to increase their rights of audience merely because they are to lose

recommendations years ago and which this government have successively approved <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble and learned friend will bear in mind the fact that the present situation carries with it a rather unattractive innuendo <e> <s> south of the border the layman who has achieved rights of advocacy is apparently fit to obtain judicial office for an unexplained reason <e> <s> a similar layman north of the border having achieved rights of advocacy is not fit <e> <s> there must be some explanation for that <e>", "<cs> it is in clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble and learned friend the lord advocate whether he is aware that the director general of fair trading said in a long written memorandum to all ministers some two years ago that to advance partnerships between
