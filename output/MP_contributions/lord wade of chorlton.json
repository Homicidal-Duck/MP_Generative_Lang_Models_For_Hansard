["<cs> my lords as a very new member of your lordships house i beg noble lords indulgence in this debate which was so ably proposed by my noble friend lord caldecote <e> <s> i want first to say that i feel enormously privileged to be among such very distinguished people <e> <s> i have already realised the great intellect experience and caring concern which is represented here in this house <e> <s> i should explain that i am but a humble farmer from cheshire although i have been involved in various industrial activities connected with the food and cheese industry <e> <s> cheshire is a county which is known for the quality of its dairy products the determination of its people and the beauty of its countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the minister of state spent a considerable amount of time visiting the regions and promoting efficient energy use particularly in smaller companies <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the valleys initiative has done a great deal to broaden the base of industry throughout the whole of wales and particularly in the valleys and has provided greater opportunities for growth in wales than we have seen for a long time <e>", "<cs> as i understand it we are dealing with a practical situation where as a result of unofficial advice an unofficial strike takes place in a company <e> <s> no work is done <e> <s> everything is brought to a halt because of unofficial action which the union plans to repudiate <e> <s> is it not in the interests of the union and everyone else for the matter to be put right as soon as possible <e> <s> that will benefit those who are not obtaining service the company that has come to a halt and those whose jobs are affected <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the figure he has given of the expenditure now planned is far in excess of what the noble lord lord young declared would be the expenditure at this stage when he explained the scheme to the house some years ago <e> <s> will the minister kindly explain how that fits in with the number of education authorities that are now being offered the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the nuclear power industry has now been with us for some years the first nuclear power station was built in or and has been the responsibility of successive governments <e> <s> it is only under this government that truer information has come to light which has enabled a more efficient operation to be put into place <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may draw the attention of the committee to the fact that the bill does not say that an employer has to fire someone who takes illegal action it merely says that he should give warning to the employee that if he should consider and does in fact end up taking illegal action then the employer may consider dismissal <e> <s> i cannot see anything there which takes away anyones moral rights <e> <s> it is similar to the situation where we are all warned that if we drive at more than miles per hour on a motorway we are liable to be stopped and convicted <e> <s> therefore we have the sense to read the law and not to do so unless we decide that we are risky people and are prepared to take that risk <e> <s> the clause as i read it does no more than that <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to the noble lord i can tell him that that has happened to me on a number of occasions <e> <s> i can think of many occasions when i have had tremendous rows with employees but i have not fired them because on reflection i thought that they might have been right or more than likely i decided that it would not be in my interests to get rid of them <e> <s> i take a sensible management decision but the clause does not make me do anything different <e> <s> i do not see what it does <e> <s> all the clause does is to give someone notice that if they were to take some unofficial action a sensible manager might be liable to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that over the past two years the number of people employed in this country has increased by million and that now with million people employed there are more people employed than ever before <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that the government have an excellent record in developing employment opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first admit that my interest in this subject is not as somebody who is critical of everything that has gone before <e> <s> it is inevitable that the various countries of the world and the traders of the world have used their resources to create the wealth and opportunity that their people needed <e> <s> there is no doubt that people in this country have taken up our forests and farmed them that is what sustainable management is it is farming to create the money and wealth for people over the past thousands of years <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the merger of the two companies is most important and beneficial and that it was wrong that many shareholders funds were being lost through unnecessary competition <e> <s> does he further agree that what has happened is in the best interests of the public the investors and all those who wish to see good television <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that as far as the conservative party is concerned there has been a no more honourable organisation as regards the raising of funds <e> <s> surely any company that makes a donation to a political party makes quite clear in its accounts that it does so and such information is public <e> <s> does not my noble friend agree that when a private individual gives his own money to anyone that should be his own private business <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord middleton and the select committee for producing a most excellent report <e> <s> i very much support all the recommendations <e> <s> a similar report was made by the board of agriculture in <e> <s> it appointed two gentlemen mr marshall and mr wedge to travel the country and report on the state of agriculture <e> <s> they produced a report which was called <e>", "<cs> my lords it is something of a coincidence that i should speak after the noble baroness lady nicol who is a delightful person <e> <s> my emphasis in regard to the bill will be different from hers <e> <s> she has emphasised the need for the bill to protect the environment <e> <s> what i look for in a bill of this kind is the encouragement of investment and development <e>"]
