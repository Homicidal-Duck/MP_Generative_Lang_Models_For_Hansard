["<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the chairman of committees i beg to move the second motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords anything suggested by the noble lord will be borne in mind by any committee of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the chairman of committees i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the first report from the select committee be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to express my appreciation of all the speeches which have been made in this short debate from that by the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington to the one which we have just heard by the minister <e> <s> they were all most kind in their references to the work of the committee and they were all extremely solid and constructive contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps appropriate that my last appearance as chairman of the european select committee should be in a short debate on the report of the offices committee <e> <s> i have spoken on this subject in your lordships house on two occasions and more numerously on sub-committees <e> <s> i would hesitate to run the risk of tiring your lordships yet again by repeating arguments i have put in the past <e> <s> however i was yesterday instructed by the select committee without dissent to speak in this debate and to put their points of view <e> <s> when one recalls that the european committee and its sub-committees muster above all the support of over noble lords one realises that this is a body of opinion which must be taken into account when important matters are under consideration <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord shinwell i am an essentially reasonable and emollient character and i hope that i may be able to help him by ensuring this evening that there is not too much of a difference of opinion on this issue <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with the noble lord lord hylton and my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> however looking at it purely from the point of view of practicality and getting the largest measure of agreement i feel that it may be possible <e>", "<cs> may i say how strongly i support the noble lord lord monson in what he has said <e> <s> i think there would be wide support among noble lords for that point of view <e> <s> the point i wish to raise is <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is correct in his interpretation that the legal meaning of parent and child excludes foster-children then speaking as a foster-grandparent i must say that the bill contains a very serious deficiency <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will agree to look at this point before the report stage so as to be quite sure about it <e>", "<cs> i am sure it will be the wish of all who have been or are involved in the voluntary housing movement to join with the noble viscount lord gage in expressing to the minister our appreciation of the confidence he has shown in the voluntary housing movement <e> <s> that will be a tremendous fillip to those working in the movement and i am sure we all wish to express our thanks <e>", "<cs> having joined with the noble earl in tabling this amendment i should like to support it very warmly indeed <e> <s> the noble earl declared his interest as president of the building societies association <e> <s> i think it will be convenient if i complete my own declaration of interests at this time <e> <s> i have been declaring them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay the house for more than a couple of minutes but some of your lordships may recall that until i resigned at the end of last year i had been for two years chairman of the select committee on the european economic communities <e> <s> i now therefore do not take part in general in debates on the european economic communities but i was a member of the sub-committee whose report we are discussing this afternoon <e> <s> i should like very sincerely to join in the praise which has been given to the noble lord and his colleagues <e> <s> i hope that it will not seem immodest if i say that to have this sub-committee was my own idea and that i was in the seventh heaven when we persuaded the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to take the chair <e> <s> i have never worked under a better chairman from time to time i felt sorry for the witnesses whose agony was assuaged only by the invariable courtesy that the noble lord showed <e> <s> i agreed with everything he said in his speech this afternoon not least in his tribute to the staff of the select committee who really are incredibly talented unbelievably hardworking and serve your lordships house in a way which leaves nothing at all to be desired <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like briefly to add my appreciation both to the minister and to the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> he has given us splendid leadership on this subject all of us have been very proud to be associated with him <e> <s> he is a splendid president of the building societies association <e> <s> on this occasion i think that he has shown great clarity of judgment and considerable tactical skill <e> <s> i know that your lordships will be grateful to him and i hope that many thousands of servicemen and women will also share that appreciation <e>", "<cs> my lords for two reasons this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord could answer us my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact i did not refer to direct labour departments but spoke on behalf of a major organisation in the local government world <e> <s> i do not want them tomorrow to think that their views have been ignored and i think that also applies to the points raised by my noble friend lord irving of dartford who was expressing the views of the county councils association <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend was so kind as to refer to me and to the association of metropolitan authorities of which i am president perhaps i could assure your lordships without any hesitation whatsoever that there has been no agreement reached or sought to be reached between the association of metropolitan authorities and the government on the lines to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> but i think the point at issue is this and this is the point which the parliamentary secretary did not touch on in his comments <e> <s> it is not the propriety of having discussions but what would be the impropriety if the government had reached an agreement on how to conduct the committee stage of this bill in your lordships house without having discussed that proposal with the other local authority associations <e> <s> that i think is the danger and i very much hope that the noble lord will be able to give us assurances on this point <e> <s> one of the reasons why this issue has become so embittered has been the feeling of the local authorities both conservative and labour that the government have not taken their points of view sufficiently into consideration <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support the noble viscount and also the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> it is the view of the association of metropolitan authorities that the home office should be involved in the actual management of the police as little as is consistent with the proper discharge of their responsibilities <e> <s> that is clearly right <e> <s> i think it is disappointing that if i am correctly informed not one single control over local jurisdiction over the police is removed in the current bill <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that the helpful and constructive suggestion of my noble friend would have commended itself to your lordships because we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> i hope that the general confusion will provide me with an opportunity to apologise for misleading the committee at an earlier stage <e> <s> i said that the ama was opposed to this proposal <e> <s> i was wrong then they are wrong now but i apologise <e>", "<cs> i had the privilege of following in the noble lords footsteps in two great departments of state and i have the greatest admiration for what he has <e>", "<cs> when we are legislating with the intensity with which we are legislating this week in respect of the bill it is not easy to keep pace with the marshalled list <e> <s> nevertheless i reproach myself for not having been aware of this amendment until my noble friend lord ponsonby directed my attention to it this afternoon <e> <s> i find it to be a most extraordinary proposition that england and wales will be treated quite differently that london will be treated differently from other metropolitan districts and that parts of london will be treated differently from other parts of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what my noble friend has said and i am particularly grateful to her for the very constructive way in which she has expressed her point of view <e> <s> but i want to thank the noble lord lord digby for the signal favour that he has done the house by drawing our attention to these regulations tonight <e> <s> perhaps many of his colleagues in this noble house might have got off the mark more quickly than they did and i must plead guilty to that <e> <s> but the fact that he was there and anxious to take up the cudgels is i think greatly to his credit and something which puts the house in his debt <e>", "<cs> my lords like all noble lords i am indebted to the noble lord lord bethell for having introduced the debate <e> <s> i am also indebted to the secretary of state for his courtesy in spending part of an over-full day taking part in the discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a vice-president of the institute of burial and cremation administration but i think i should tell your lordships that i speak in a purely personal capacity today <e> <s> nevertheless i have no doubt that the institute itself would share the enthusiasm which i feel for the bill which the right revered prelate has introduced <e> <s> some years ago when i was still at the ministry of housing and local government this was a bill about which many discussions were taking place <e> <s> it has taken a long time for those discussions to bear fruit but i am delighted today that the house has with such acclamation received the proposal that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend in thanking the minister for the extent to which he has sought to implement the undertakings that he gave during the passing of the act <e> <s> this evening i feel very much like the signatories to the letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords in the teeth of very great difficulties my noble friend lady birk made what i thought was a splendidly robust and vigorous speech and once again my noble friend has placed the house in her debt <e> <s> i should also like to say how much i enjoyed the speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of truro <e> <s> i think that i agreed with most of what he said and i am hoping that the right reverend prelate induced in your lordships a frame of mind which makes it easier for me to crave the indulgence of the house if i leave it for about an hour soon after five oclock <e> <s> i have the responsibility of welcoming a number of your lordships at the annual reception of the ama <e> <s> i feel that that must have priority for at any rate part of today <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point of view of the noble baroness but i do not think that one can take a block of money there and a block of workers here and just bring them together <e> <s> this entirely depends on getting the house-building industry moving again so that money is made available by the government and the local authorities <e> <s> if we can put them back to work the state as a whole will save approximately that amount in a year <e>"]
