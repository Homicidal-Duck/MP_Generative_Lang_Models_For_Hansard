["<cs> my lords perhaps i may first crave your lordships indulgence as my comments today on certain aspects of the gracious speech dealing specifically with health and education issues will perforce be brief and somewhat superficial <e>", "<cs> my lords as i intimated in my maiden speech two weeks ago the issues addressed in the bill are of very great concern to many doctors scientists and informed laymen <e> <s> the decisions reached in this house and in another place will have untold implications for women with various forms of infertility and for individuals afflicted by a variety of devastating inherited diseases and their families <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the debate on this issue having heard the very well-argued speech of the noble baroness lady elles and the comments made by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor about the prospect of this amendment being modified on report <e> <s> however there are one or two points that i should like to draw to the committees attention <e> <s> they relate to the definition <e> <s> i do not believe that one can define an embryo until the genetic material from the gamete of the male that is the sperm and the genetic material in the ovum of the female have fused <e>", "<cs> i support the view expressed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> however clause provides that one of the functions of the authority would be to keep under review information about embryos and their subsequent development and the provision of treatment services <e> <s> i understand why the amendment has been proposed but the term treatment services is extremely broad <e> <s> it embraces a wide range of medical surgical or obstetric services provided for the purpose of assisting women to carry children <e> <s> that explanatory phrase does not refer to a form of treatment used for the benefit of a particular woman <e> <s> it is a broad inclusive term relating to services available to women in general <e>", "<cs> this technique of lavage is one which is of great relevance to research in relation to pre-implantation diagnosis <e> <s> if this amendment were to be agreed it would pre-empt a substantial part of the discussion that we may be having on clause of the bill on thursday <e> <s> the point of relevance is that if research is to be approved under this bill when clause is debated there will be two techniques that may be possible for studying pre-implantation diagnosis of genetic disease <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the amendment proposed by the noble earl and to offer an alternative amendment amendment no <e> <s> which i have tabled as i believe that the issue has been clouded by considerable misunderstanding and by a number of serious misconceptions <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for speaking again but the purpose of this amendment which i warmly support tabled by my noble friend lord halsbury is to ensure that the technique called gamete intra-fallopian transfer or gift is not exempted from the requirement to be licensed <e> <s> gift does not at present require such a licence from the interim licensing authority and the number of centres offering the treatment is increasing <e> <s> the most recent figures available reveal that there are centres in the uk offering gift alone and offering gift and in vitro fertilisation ivf <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed by this response because of the concerns that i expressed which i know are shared by the chairman of the interim licensing authority and because of the belief that unless some kind of statutory control is imposed on the development and extension of this gift technique in the growing private sector there is a serious risk that even with the kind of clinical judgments which are issues being considered by members of my profession to which the noble baroness has referred there may be significant problems arising in the future <e>", "<cs> i hope that it can be reconsidered at report stage <e>", "<cs> in opposing the amendment tabled by the noble duke and the noble lord lord rawlinson of ewell and in explaining why i feel it right to table an alternative amendment in order to make it possible under the bill for research on the human conceptus up to the -day deadline to continue i do not propose to rehearse in detail all of the arguments which i put before your lordships in the debate at second reading <e> <s> however i believe that it would be right for me to try to correct some misunderstandings and misconceptions relating to the current position and future prospects which make the continuation and <e>", "<cs> i believe that scientific progress has developed even since the warnock report was published <e> <s> the amendment is concerned not so much with the development of new drugs for contraception but more with the possibility of developing a vaccine for male contraception in which this test the embryo research but also the issue of the hamster test is very much involved <e> <s> it is a technique that brings considerable hope of developing new and effective male contraception methods which may have world-wide application <e> <s> for that reason i believe that it is an important issue to be retained in the bill <e>", "<cs> i simply wish to add that if amendments nos <e> <s> and as tabled were accepted by this committee it would have the effect of frustrating at least two of the major objectives of the research upon the embryo which is the matter upon which the committee divided earlier this evening <e> <s> for that reason in my view it would be quite unacceptable to overturn that earlier decision by accepting these two amendments <e>", "<cs> as a registered medical practitioner under the act just referred to and having had the privilege for seven years of presiding over the council which confers such registration i naturally have some sympathy with the amendment proposed by the noble duke <e> <s> however i think that is is important for the committee to recall that licences under the act provided and conferred by the proposed licensing authority will deal not just with treatment but also with storage and research <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the reasons why the noble lord lord jakobovits and his three supporters have proposed the amendment tabled in their names i was deeply moved by the sincerity with which their case for the amendment was presented <e> <s> i recognise that their proposals and arguments are likely at first sight to be attractice and persuasive to many of your lordships <e> <s> it sounds superficially attractive to agree that research should be conducted only on those embryos which have been created by fertilising the eggs of an individual woman with let us assume her husbands sperm but which prove to be surplus to requirements when the time comes to insert some three of them into her uterus in the hope that one or at the most two will implant and develop <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the comments made by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i shall be happy to do so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when commenting on the problems which continually beset the national health service members of my <e>", "<cs> i support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i was of course concerned to hear the arguments which have just been expressed but i support the amendment because i wish to invite the government to think again seriously about what many of us in the academic world see as major deficiencies in the governments proposals in relation to the bill <e>", "<cs> my reasons for supporting the amendment are that while i wholly accept the need for some form of loan scheme for the reasons i have already given i ask her majestys government to think again and to give serious consideration to the alternative proposals from the committee of vice-chancellors and principals about the possibility of repayment through some form of graduate tax <e> <s> my whole purpose in supporting the amendment is to invite the government to take time to reconsider the details of the bill and to postpone it therefore for months so that they can do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his careful consideration of this and the linking amendment <e> <s> essentially the only difference between the noble earl lord perth and myself is that he wishes to make it clear in the amendment that if an animal other than a hamster were to be used for the test by direction of the proposed licensing authority that would have to be reported to parliament rather than being reported one year late in the report of the licensing authority <e> <s> i am grateful for the noble and learned lords suggestion that it would be possible so to modify my amendment in order to make that a feasible possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords with that assurance from the noble and learned lord i beg to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his very full and detailed consideration of this problem <e> <s> in agreeing with the noble lord lord meston that i would draw this matter to the attention of your lordships house i told him that in my view it raised very considerable complex legal and moral issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish in any way to prolong what has already been an exceptionally lengthy debate <e> <s> i had no intention of speaking at third reading today but i wish to make one or two points <e> <s> the first relates to the article to which my noble friend lord halsbury has referred written by my friend cardinal hume <e> <s> i share with him the honour of being an honorary freeman of the city of newcastle upon tyne a city from which we both come and i also share the honour of being a lifelong supporter of newcastle united <e> <s> i have to say however that i disagree most profoundly with his views as promulgated in the article to which reference has been made <e> <s> he is fully aware of that because we have discussed it on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be few bills coming before your lordships house which have generated so much frenzied debate elsewhere as this one <e> <s> i much regret the aura of confrontation which has clouded many of the consultations between representatives of the medical profession on the one hand and government ministers on the other <e> <s> let us hope that the debate will now proceed in an atmosphere of constructive collaboration exploration trial and assessment <e> <s> then those proposals of demonstrable benefit to patient care can go forward expeditiously while those shown by experience to be potentially detrimental can be modified or even perhaps abandoned according to the needs of the service <e>", "<cs> the intention is simply to write into the bill the necessity of making it open for individuals who may have served on health authorities in the past to be available to be appointed to health authorities in the future <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord jenkin that there is nothing in the bill to preclude the appointment to health authorities of those who have served on such authorities in the past <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment was to fulfil a probing function <e> <s> in the light of the clear and unequivocal assurances that we have received from the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much support and welcome the amendments <e> <s> i agree very much with the comments that have been made by the noble baroness lady young and the noble lord lord dainton <e> <s> as they have said the universities have a vital and unique role in relation to the health of this nation <e> <s> not only do they train all of the doctors and dentists who serve in our national health service but they and their associated hospitals play a crucial role in the research which leads to advances in medical treatment and improvements in the quality of care which patients receive <e>", "<cs> i take note of the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i should like to express my grateful thanks to the minister for the careful consideration she has given to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> the argument put forward by the noble baroness in relation to the family health service authorities is persuasive <e> <s> i accept the point that she made <e> <s> however i still cannot see why it is not possible to have the director of public health prescribed in the bill as a member of the regional and district health authorities when <e>", "<cs> in the light of the eloquence and force with which the amendment has been proposed by the noble lords lord dainton and lord hunter of newington little remains for me to say except to the effect that i warmly support this important and crucial amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to detain the committee on this issue <e> <s> at second reading i said how much i deplored the aura of confrontation which had all too often in recent months clouded the discussions between members of my profession on the one hand and representatives <e>", "<cs> in supporting the principles underlying this amendment may i say that this group of amendments is related to quality assurance within the national health service <e> <s> it is somewhat paradoxical that whereas there are well-eslablished professional regulatory bodies that seek to ensure a proper standard of professional behaviour on the part of professionals employed within the health service as yet we have no specific mechanism for inspecting the quality of services and care provided by hospitals in the nhs <e>", "<cs> in the light of the clear and unequivocal reassurances given by the noble baroness perhaps i may make two points <e> <s> we accept the governments commitment to the funding of postgraduate teaching continuing education and research for all professional staff in the health service <e> <s> however i was concerned as was my noble friend lord butterfield that health authorities have tended to reduce the funds available for that purpose quite disproportionately in many circumstances <e> <s> i was very pleased therefore to hear the noble <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness responds i wish to take up a point that was raised by the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> these amendments are very carefully phrased and they do not seek to have a representative of the health care professions on the group of non-executive directors <e> <s> they simply propose that the present provision in the bill which excludes them from membership should be removed <e>", "<cs> in the light of the assurances given by the noble baroness and in particular in the light of her comment to the effect that the executive directors shall include by regulation a specified number of health care professionals i am delighted to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to support very warmly this group of amendments proposed by the noble lord lord dainton <e> <s> the present position is that hospitals which do not opt for trust status have a duty to provide the necessary resources and support for medical and dental teaching of high quality under the national health service act of <e> <s> however there is no such requirement in this bill where nhs trusts are concerned <e> <s> all that is provided is a reserve power for the secretary of state under schedule paragraph which can be summoned up in the event of a failure of the discretionary powers contained in schedule <e>", "<cs> the point that i made was that under the national health service act there was a duty to provide the facilities for teaching and research within nhs hospitals <e> <s> it is not prescribed in the bill as a duty upon nhs trusts <e> <s> the secretary of state simply has powers to take action if the trusts do not fulfil that function which is binding on hospitals which will not be self-governing trusts <e>", "<cs> in the light of the assurance given by the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on many occasions in the course of our debates in committee in relation to this bill i have been greatly reassured by the answers which we have received from the minister <e> <s> however i regret to say that on this occasion i cannot feel reassured <e> <s> it is difficult to underestimate the strength of feeling in the medical nursing and allied professions over the single issue of nationally agreed salary scales for staff in the nhs whether or not they serve in hospitals under district health authorities or in self-governing trusts in the future <e>", "<cs> speaking as a former dean of a medical school i can assure the noble baroness that per cent <e> <s> of medical students in the united kingdom are now women <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that the medical card is being redesigned to make it more user friendly <e> <s> i cannot think of a document less exciting than the earlier medical card <e> <s> at a time when the medical profession has moved a very long way in response to public concern and demand in trying to publicise its own facilities through the practice leaflets which it provides it is somewhat paradoxical that there is no obligation on the family practitioner committees or the family health services authorities to provide a similar range of information about what they do and what they are to the public at large <e>", "<cs> i support the principle underlying the amendment <e> <s> it is an exceptionally sensitive and difficult issue <e> <s> it has exercised those <e>", "<cs> my purpose in adding my name to this amendment so eloquently moved by the noble lord lord carter is to probe the <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will forgive me for speaking again before the noble lord lord carter closes on the amendment <e> <s> i have two or three points to make <e> <s> first there are substantial differences in character between on the one hand multiple myeloma and leukaemia and on the other hand the various forms of solid cancer which are listed in the proposed new schedule <e> <s> secondly i was much reassured to hear the minister say that widows and dependants of those who were involved in the test programme and who died from leukaemia or myeloma may in retrospect apply for pensions <e> <s> that was a reassuring comment <e> <s> i trust there is no time-limit upon that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords while i support the points made by the noble lord lord dainton perhaps i may say that i sympathise with <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene by raising one small point <e> <s> in this connection i classify universities which do not have medical or dental schools in exactly the same way as the polytechnics and other institutions of higher education <e> <s> it is because the universities with medical and dental schools bring money facilities and premises to the table that i took the view that i did <e> <s> i hope that that point is clarified <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i believe i can take it from his response that for the reasons he gave the existing established advisory machinery is not likely in all cases to be appropriate for the advising of nhs trusts in future <e> <s> it will nevertheless be the governments intention to see that such nhs trusts establish a formal professional advisory machinery to advise them in the pursuit of the functions under the bill <e> <s> in receiving that assurance and i see the minister nodding his head i believe it appropriate at this hour to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to delay the house for more than a moment at this late hour of the night <e> <s> however i should like to say that one of the things which concerns the medical profession most is the problem that will arise in relation to the employment of university clinical staff in nhs trusts <e> <s> they are employed by the university they have complete parity of their salary scales with those in the nhs and as they are paid by the university and not therefore employed by the trust a very serious situation could arise if there is a differential between the salaries of those paid by the nhs and those paid by the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak very briefly in support of the amendment which also stands in my name <e> <s> let me assure your lordships that it is not another attempt to try to require the government to impose nationally agreed salary scales for all grades of staff within self-governing hospital trusts <e> <s> that is a matter to which my <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to comment on this amendment not from my present experience but from my experience until february of last year as president of the general medical council <e> <s> during my presidency we relaxed the advice given to the medical profession about the dissemination of factual information to the public by agreeing that it was proper and appropriate that general practices should prepare informative leaflets giving information about the range and nature of the services that they provided <e> <s> we agreed that these leaflets could be placed in centres of public information such as public libraries and other similar places <e>", "<cs> my lords no responsible doctor could ever believe that the sky is the limit so far as concerns prescribing <e> <s> we must recognise that there must be constraints upon all forms of expenditure within a national health service <e> <s> that includes expenditure on drugs and particularly on very new and extremely expensive drugs which inevitably must be rationed to some extent on the basis of some assessment of priority as happens with all new and expensive developments in medical care whether surgical medical or otherwise <e> <s> i believe that that is a principle that the medical profession in general accepts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the principles underlying the amendment which has been proposed by the famous five <e> <s> having said that i am concerned lest the issue of clinical care on the one hand be confused with the issue of management control and quality assurance on the other <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant duty on behalf of the whole house warmly to congratulate the noble baroness on her thoughtful perspicacious and enjoyable maiden speech which was so charmingly and splendidly expressed and so lucid in every moment <e> <s> she has had a most distinguished career in the national health service as chairman of the brighton health authority now as chairman of the south-west thames regional health authority and as a past chairman of the national association of health authorities <e> <s> but she is someone of many parts having contributed not only to the health service to which her contributions are beyond praise but also to local affairs in her own county <e> <s> indeed if i were to recite or to attempt to recite the many offices which she has held the many important distinctions that have been conferred upon her i would be in danger of detaining your lordships for far too long <e> <s> we know that she will contribute outstandingly to future debates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that two years ago after the most earnest consideration of the problem and after having taken legal advice the general medical council promulgated advice to the medical profession <e> <s> it was to the effect that to carry out the test without the patients explicit consent would not be an ethical procedure <e> <s> therefore the council advised the profession that while accepting all the anxieties expressed it is necessary that the patients consent is obtained in advance of the performance of such a test <e> <s> is the minister further aware that the issue is still under consideration and that to the best of my knowledge no patient has yet refused to give permission for the test when specifically invited to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first apologise to the house for the fact that i may not be able to remain throughout the debate since in just over an hour and a half from now i am due to deliver the harveian oration at the royal college of physicians in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that paragraph d of the amendment might make it impossible for a severely malformed infant to be aborted <e>"]
