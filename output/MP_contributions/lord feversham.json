["<cs> my lords while i recognise from the reply that has just been made that it is not intended to merge the bath academy of art with a technical college i should like to ask the government and i speak as someone who served on the initial governing body of leeds polytechnic when it was formed into which the leeds college of art of long-standing and excellent repute was merged whether they would not agree that the policy which has been followed over the past few years for merging art colleges and polytechnics has been on the whole detrimental to the quality of the teaching of art <e> <s> while i recognise that that is not perhaps exactly what is intended as regards the bath academy i should like to reiterate the points that have been made by other questioners with regard to special circumstances which clearly militate against moving the academy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might just link a question in with those last remarks <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can give us some idea of his thinking with regard to how the general public is to be warned about the seriousness of this matter <e> <s> we have heard from a number of people about the strictures which will be placed upon farmers farm workers and farmers wives in the communities in which an outbreak of foot and mouth takes place <e> <s> while agreeing with all the points which have been made and the congratulations that have been expressed to the ministry of agriculture on the speed with which it has tackled this new outbreak and i hope very much that its efforts will contain the outbreak i would say this <e> <s> if the outbreak is not to spread then i think that it is absolutely essential that the general public who now have greater access to the countryside than perhaps ever before and who use that access to a greater extent and i am thinking of the easter holiday and the spring bank holiday which are coming up when a lot of people from the cities will go to the countryside should know how serious the situation is <e>", "<cs> it seems to me as the noble earl has himself said that what we want to try to do is to get motorists even though they have been parked on a meter for a certain length of time off that meter once they have overstayed their time so that somebody else can use it <e> <s> i would not have thought that putting a wheel clamp on his wheel was a way of speeding up that process <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord howie of troon will forgive me if i do not follow him into the intricacies of the act and as to whether or not the act is necessary <e> <s> at this late hour and following a very long debate which has already covered all the main concerns of this bill i believe that the house will thank me if i keep my remarks as brief as possible <e> <s> i should like to begin by supporting all that has been said in favour of the two maiden speeches which have been made during the course of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords she lived to a very great age indeed <e> <s> i am afraid she is no longer with us but she lived until she was well into her s <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with what the noble lord lord winstanley has said <e> <s> i am extremely worried about the danger of a gap arising <e> <s> i should have thought that somewhere in our legislation it must be set out in black and white who is responsible for gardens <e> <s> when we are talking about our national heritage surely the part of it that is closer than almost anything else to the general public is that concerned with gardening <e> <s> we are a nation of gardeners and there can be no question that our great gardens are part of the national heritage <e> <s> the late christopher hussey that revered expert and historian of our national heritage in the foreword to his book on eighteenth century landscape gardens in britain stated that the dozen or so gardens covered by the book represented collectively unquestionably one of britains greatest contributions to western artistic culture <e> <s> we are told by the government that it is the job of the countryside commission to look after gardens and by the noble lord lord winstanley that it may become more <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always hard to intervene at such a late stage in a debate <e> <s> i shall confine my remarks mainly to the arts rather than to the second part of the motion of the noble lord lord jenkins concerned with finance for broadcasting other than perhaps to endorse the point raised i believe by the noble lord lord hutchinson who rightly said that there is not much point in finding finance for broadcasting if you do not have something to broadcast <e> <s> of course if you are to have something to broadcast you have to depend very much on having a healthy arts scene and particularly a healthy scene with regard to the performing arts <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl lord cranbrook will forgive me if i do not follow him in the quite technical specific points that he has raised with regard to the scientific aspects of the local government bill <e> <s> i doubt very much whether there is anything that i could add even if i wanted to do so <e> <s> of course his contribution to the debate as always has been extraordinarily useful not least at this more or less mid-point in the debate in introducing a new slant <e> <s> i think that to a certain extent all the possible arguments that can be promoted either for or against the governments intentions in the local government bill by now have been aired <e> <s> so although i do not think that there is any topic on which it is easier to make a really long speech than the subject of local government i do not consider that i should do that this evening <e> <s> i shall confine myself to a very short speech <e> <s> after all as the noble earl lord perth pointed out the opportunity for more detailed discussions will come during the later stages of the passage of this bill through the house <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the issue but i must rise to support the noble lord lord carr <e> <s> i do so if only as a voice from the cross-benches and to reinforce his distinguished supporters from other parts of the committee <e> <s> i believe that all members wish to make sure that the government understand that they are almost completely surrounded in respect of this issue <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put in a brief word of support for the amendments which are concerned specifically with the loss of business rate or non-domestic rate to parish councils under the proposals in the bill <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness has dealt sufficiently with the technicalities <e> <s> i shall not reiterate them or detain the committee <e> <s> however i should like to add some general observations in support of the amendments and with regard to local councils <e>", "<cs> in support of those last comments and in opposition to the speech made before it surely this is an important and by now quite traditional freedom of local authorities <e> <s> it is enshrined in section of the local government act <e> <s> it seems a great pity that this new bill on local government finance should not deal adequately with this important freedom <e> <s> although as president of the national association of local councils i very much support the probing amendment of the noble baroness lady stedman i am somewhat moved by the discussions which have taken place this afternoon to go further in support of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it would be very good if at some point in this bill we could have this important freedom noticed and enshrined in some form of words whether or not they are the words of the noble lord lord mcintosh i do not believe is so important <e> <s> however i feel that this important freedom should again be enshrined in the bill and i hope that the government will try to work towards that <e>"]
