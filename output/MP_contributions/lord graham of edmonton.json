["<cs> my lords i feel that i shall have the sympathy of the whole house in this my first speech in your lordships house <e> <s> i know that your lordships have a reputation for generosity and understanding in these matters <e> <s> i am most grateful for the kind personal references already made both in this debate and elsewhere in the house <e> <s> i have been made to feel very welcome indeed <e>", "<cs> could we be told a little more clearly what i understood the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to say that in effect there is a better way of saying and a better place in which to say it that which appears in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the sense of amendment no <e> <s> is to be taken into account when amendment no <e> <s> is moved that seems to be a reasonable thing to do <e> <s> the co-operative wholesale society which is the largest farmer in the land certainly welcomes amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i would imagine that provided the words used later have the same effect as the words in amendment no <e> <s> although perhaps in a tidier way that would also meet their wishes <e>", "<cs> may i be quite clear as to the purport of the words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> in asking the committee to accept his amendment no <e> <s> he is advising us that perhaps on second reflection possibly at report stage he will come back with a revision of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that will provide the noble and learned lord with an opportunity for reflection and it will also provide those outside the house with an opportunity of looking at the words which will now stand part of the bill <e> <s> in that case i am perfectly satisfied with the lord chancellors intention <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister assure the house that he will condemn any inefficiences in privatised services in the same robust way that he has always criticised inefficiences in council public services <e> <s> will he hear in mind that most public services evolved out of a public need which was badly met from private sources <e> <s> will the minister urge on councils the need to scrutinise council efficiency and very often that will mean that town clerks and borough engineers are made redundant before dustmen and tea ladies <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs begin at once by declaring that i am no specialist or expert on the national health service <e> <s> nevertheless i am very grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate <e> <s> i want to begin as many members on all sides of the house have begun by warmly congratulating my noble friend lord molloy not only upon having been lucky enough to get the debate but also for the vigorous and compassionate way in which he put forward his arguments <e> <s> he enhanced in my eyes the reputation he has always had of a caring compassionate man dedicated to trying to improve the lot of his fellow men <e> <s> we are very grateful indeed for the tone that he set <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has sought to absolve himself of the main responsibility not the only responsibility <e> <s> if the regional health authority and the district were not preyed upon by the minister and his colleagues to make cuts agonised though they might have been before doing so they would not of themselves have said we want to close this hospital <e> <s> i do not deny for a moment that the noble lord the minister has given great thought and attention to the various moves which have been made <e> <s> i simply say that the minister and his colleagues ought to accept responsibility for what they are doing <e> <s> when the prince of wales hospital closes it means that their beds for the elderly will no longer be there <e> <s> already in the district of haringey there is a shortage of beds for the elderly so there will be something like or beds for the elderly which will not be available and which are needed in that district <e> <s> many elderly people are being cared for at home by other elderly relatives and by others when they ought in fact to be in hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> my lords without having asked the question i was going to ask i am grateful to the minister for the answer he has just given <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by acknowledging with appreciation the remarks of welcome made by the noble lord to me for the post that i now hold for the opposition <e> <s> it is an honourable post and one that i am proud to hold <e> <s> i very much look forward to taking part in debates on matters which relate to the environment <e> <s> i am almost tempted to say that i have been here before <e> <s> i have not been at this particular spot before but i have certainly been here before with regard to the issues which we are now debating because i served as a member of the standing committee of another place on the local government planning and land bill and i also raised this particular point on the floor of the house of commons when the matter arose in and <e> <s> of course i have had the opportunity of reading the exchanges in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that the informal approach is an excellent idea <e> <s> but the financial consequence and the costs of the council in providing officers for the informal consultation are a different thing <e> <s> if a person is hesitant about whether he is going to need planning application or not or even more insidiously he may want to avoid having to apply at all then of course an hour of the council officers time will satisfy him that he should or should not apply <e> <s> at the end of the day if he decides that he is not going to apply there is no statistic <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the picture he more complete if the noble lord advised the house that central government expenditure over the same period has increased by per cent <e> <s> while the rpi has gone up by per cent <e> <s> bearing in mind that over the same period the glc and other london boroughs have suffered a net grant loss of more than million and bearing in mind that when they and the other metropolitan authorities were elected in they were elected on a programme of increased expenditure and the rates that went with them why do not the government trust the people and have elections for the glc and the other metropolitan boroughs in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not acknowledge that one of the best ways of persuading the authorities to bring the world cup to this country is to do what the labour government did in which was to make funds available which were then used for the improvement of grounds <e> <s> is the minister not prepared even though there may be the kind of technical problems to which he referred to recognise the glorious opportunity which having the world cup here would be <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gainford said there would be spin-offs which would benefit not only industry but the millions of people who look forward to repeating not merely the experience of but i hope the victory of as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge that the recommendations of the nab to wipe out the three degree courses were received with astonishment anger and dismay not merely by the college and its students but throughout the west midlands <e> <s> does the minister appreciate that when the courses were conceived as a vocationally relevant package for the s they were approved not only by the authority but by hmis and the department of education and science <e> <s> will the government recognise and take fully on board the potential knock-on consequences of the action <e> <s> will they recognise that not only should these relevant courses of quality he maintained but the future of the college in this difficult area of the country also ought to be secured <e> <s> will the minister use his best endeavours to make sure that the case that i am attempting to make is borne heavily in mind when the future of the college is being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the frank and forthright statement by the parliamentary under-secretary on the radio programme the world this weekend yesterday that the government are dissatisfied with the safety standards at sellafield while alarming in itself is welcomed as a manifest of the governments unease <e> <s> when the parliamentary under-secretary said in that programme that he was not satisfied that bnfl was meeting the high standards which now exist does he appreciate that this must fill the whole country with alarm and i venture to suggest with anger as well and that all actions he intends to take to make bnfl management act efficiently and responsibly will receive the backing of all sides of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say what i ought to have said earlier <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for having repeated the statement here that was being made by his honourable friend in another place <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister take it from me and i am sure from many others that we welcome the declaration that he has made that in no way are the government to be party to secrecy or hushing up <e> <s> there is obviously a borderline to be drawn in the kind of information which properly falls into one category <e> <s> however we are talking about a public unease and unrest that in our view can be quickly allayed and that is by the determination of the government to make sure that the company fulfils the responsibilities laid upon it <e> <s> the weekend press reports may not be wholly accurate but if the assertion is made that something which is two and half times above the legal limit is tolerable then we on this side of the house are saying that that assertion should in no way be tolerable <e> <s> but we are grateful for what the minister has indicated and that is deep concern and continuing determination to make sure that safety is maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge that in this context the co-operative idea is a valuable one and deserves every encouragement <e> <s> to the extent that it is within his power will the minister take steps to see that the crucial early stages of the transition take place without any punitive financial considerations or burdens being imposed on the growers co-operative <e> <s> in order to iron out any difficulties will the minister agree to see the chairman of the growers co-operative as early as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords they are both badly treated by way of being looked after and cared for by the resources that the government give to the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall that when this matter was raised in the house in march last year he indicated to the house that these matters had been drawn to the attention of the district auditor and that the district auditor was considering any action that he might take <e> <s> in view of that can the minister tell the house what action the district auditor did take either then or later <e> <s> would the minister also bear in mind that under the local government planning and land act it was his <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am very grateful indeed first of all to the minister for the care that he has taken and the courtesy which he has shown to the house <e> <s> perhaps having listened to the case opened and closed in another place and trying to hear most of it the great difference is that at least the noble lord has had the opportunity in this house of making the case as he wanted to and it has been listened to i certainly think with great attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor confirm that answers to previous parliamentary questions relating to the state of the art defence are still government policy <e> <s> will that topic still remain on the agenda of the committee of permanent representatives <e> <s> while the government wait for harmonisation of the eec directive can the house be told what steps are being taken to discuss with commerce and industry the undoubtedly heavy costs which will eventually flow from strict liability <e>", "<cs> and losing them by narrow margins <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but my lords does not the minister appreciate that his proposals to scatter the trading standards service would be looked upon as an act of supreme folly <e> <s> when one looks at the white paper and bears in mind that a recommendation in it calls for the need to ensure consistent standards of enforcement why does the minister believe that creating more authorities rather than less will lead to a consistent enforcement of standards <e> <s> does the minister recall that in when reorganisation took place there were weights and measures authorities and the total was reduced to and does he agree that in the intervening period those who advocated larger organisations providing a comprehensive range of services have been fully vindicated <e>", "<cs> my lords as an antithesis to the hypothesis will the minister take very careful note of a very respectable body the institute of trading standards administration <e> <s> has the minister seen the recent report by the institute which points out the following comparison among three different categories of authorities which provide trading standards service <e> <s> for instance the cost of service per <e>", "<cs> well my lords this is the upper set <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to be exceedingly brief but i want to say a few words although not as an expert with special experience <e> <s> i have listened to and been moved by as i am certain have all members in your lordships house the contributions we have had from those who have had personal experience of disability and those who have served with pride and achievement on associations responsible for those with disabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the response from the minister simply confirm that what passes for housing policy from the present government is a scandal and a disgrace <e> <s> instead of creating a special class of citizen a privileged class and that is the council tenant who wants to buy his house how about giving some time to the lot of the council tenant who does not want to buy his house and to the homeless <e> <s> do the minister and his colleagues intend to eliminate the public sector in housing regardless of the consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can we assume that the government and the noble lord welcome the observations of these distinguished academic individuals <e> <s> on the very day on which the rate capping proposals of the government are to be published has the attention of the minister been drawn to the conclusions in the report in respect of rate capping which indicate that there will be a significant increase of central control over local government <e> <s> lastly in respect of the proposals to abolish the glc and the metropolitan counties has the noble lord noticed that so far as the case in the white paper is concerned the report says that it is totally unconvincing ill-prepared and wholly unjustified <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful and satisfied with the reply that has been given <e> <s> however will the noble lord understand that there are many who like myself fully supported the zoo licensing act and the dangerous wild animals act and are still concerned that some people are careless of their responsibilities both to animals and to the public <e> <s> now that section of the dangerous wild animals act is to disappear and bearing in mind that the schedule to the act included the new world monkeys but excluded the old world monkeys will the minister undertake to monitor very carefully the situation whereby zoo animals are released from zoos temporarily into private hands which can happen particularly with the squirrel monkeys which are favoured by street photographers so that the care and concern of the public is borne very much in mind <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords it was lord salisbury who once said that the purpose and function of local government is to diminish the power and influence of central government <e> <s> that could certainly be said again in the light of the present intentions of the government <e> <s> the main charge that i wish to make against the government is that in this measure as in many others they continue as they will in the coming parliamentary session to diminish the power responsibility and influence of local democracy <e>", "<cs> she would would she not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are debating tonight one of those intriguing and curious aspects of our planning legislation <e> <s> those of us who have some experience at what i would call the sharp end within local authorities i served for a number of years as chairman of a planning committee have always been impressed by the care and attention paid by parliament in constantly revising in the light of latent defects the framework of planning legislation <e> <s> since i came into this house and certainly after being in another place that impression has been reinforced <e> <s> there are few spheres of national life in which parliament pays more attention to trying to get it right first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am intrigued when he refers to the status of the shell company coming to light subsequently <e> <s> if i get him right the actual interest of shell in what was going on was not fully revealed until after the public inquiry <e> <s> surely procedures at the ministry must have revealed by direct question or by other intelligence precisely the status of the shell company before the public inquiry and during the public inquiry <e> <s> if that status had been revealed prior to rather than subsequent to the inquiry what i believe we are saying is that there might not have been any need for the inquiry because it would have been invalid <e>", "<cs> my lords from what the minister has said i gather that there is the possibility that the present practice may be changed <e> <s> will the minister accept that the general public in particular the young people involved cannot grasp the subtleties of the demarcation between courses of education in schools and those in further education colleges for those aged between and <e> <s> surely we ought to be maximising the number of young people who are prepared to take advantage of the benefits of education <e> <s> if there is a preference for attending further education colleges because it appears to young people to be more grown up to attend further education colleges than school ought we not to encourage this by every means possible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister acknowledge that those people who live in houses in multiple occupation are among the most vulnerable in our society not merely because of the conditions but also because of the danger <e> <s> will the minister also acknowledge that one of the prime and great benefits of the new legislation which had support in all parts of this house and in another place was to change the basis from a discretionary one to a statutory one <e> <s> no matter how quickly the consultation is taking place it must be speeded up and no matter how much local authorities are willing to implement the legislation what are needed are powers of enforcement <e> <s> what we do not want to see are dreadful cases of fires in houses in multiple occupation such as we have seen in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin at once by saying to my good friend the noble lord lord broxbourne welcome echoing the word which has been used more than once from all parts of the house <e> <s> i learned of his eminence in the field of planning long before i entered the other place <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that what he said today gives us a good guide to the value of the contributions that he will be making on many occasions in the future <e> <s> i look forward to hearing him many times <e>", "<cs> my lords they have been chopped <e>", "<cs> my lords he is not <e>", "<cs> ah <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall return <e>", "<cs> perhaps ten past eight <e>", "<cs> i begin by thanking the noble lord the minister for the care which clearly has been taken and the notice that has been taken by the minister and those who advise him of what has been said outside this committee and the other place <e> <s> i would not cavil with some of the words he used that ministers and his advisers felt that the purport was clear and that one could understand what was meant <e> <s> however i am sure the minister understands that when we come to retrospection and clarity and although i tried to elicit from the minister the number of cases that might be involved where people might be worried and for whom this is an absolute cover that is a proper word we are uncertain <e> <s> what we are about to do is to ease the minds of people who through no fault of their own have been given advice or have been acting upon advice and as a result find there is a doubt as to whether their position is as it were legal and valid <e> <s> it is therefore right that the minister should begin what i think will be a short exchange by clarifying the situation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> every crumb of comfort is welcome <e> <s> let me say at <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the minister and of course to his ministerial colleagues who indicated at second reading and during the committee stage that they were mindful of the need to take this action <e> <s> i would simply say that when reading the second reading speeches i noticed that this point was made by members from all parties with an interest in these matters <e> <s> in fact it was an attempt to be fair to people who out of ignorance and certainly not out of maliciousness are parting with the land to make sure so far as possible that their interests are protected and that the procedures are available <e> <s> we on this side of the committee are very grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the whole house in both welcoming and congratulating my very good friend and comrade lord mulley who comes to this house with a fine record of service not only to his party but to the people whom he represented in another place <e> <s> from what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points if i may intervene <e> <s> would the minister confirm that the authorities with housing unlet are disparate they include councils of all political views <e> <s> therefore it is not a political initiative which is required but a management initiative <e> <s> secondly when councils are urged to maximise their use of housing receipts that is the monies they get from the sale of council houses does the noble lord not appreciate that that is a wasting asset that it is getting less and less <e> <s> how do the government square the fact that they want councils to use their resources to the best advantage while forcing them to sell some of their stock in order to maintain their housing programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that if the revocation which cost ratepayers was intended to inhibit development in this area of outstanding natural beauty it was a complete waste of public money <e> <s> does the minister not think it curious that the local planning authority three times in two years turned down the particular planning application the last time in june last year in the light of the report from the inspector <e> <s> how does the minister square the decision of the council with the statement made by the inspector that the policy of the council which was to inhibit development of a caravan and chalet site was one that had to be supported in order to protect this particular area of outstanding natural beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not appreciate that this is not just a question of planning but that the protection of our natural heritage is at stake <e> <s> what action is open to the minister and to his colleagues when planning permissions are granted which are directly contrary to the structure plan of the county a structure plan which the minister himself has approved <e> <s> the county planning officer for cornwall is on record as saying in that this development was directly and materially opposite to policy <e> <s> what action therefore is open to the minister <e> <s> if the minister says that no powers are open to him except revocation i would ask him to consider very carefully taking that action <e> <s> but even if the minister is not prepared to take that course of action would he not be prepared to hold an inquiry so that the people in the area can be satisfied that a matter of vital concern not only to them but also to many other people has received the closest possible ministerial scrutiny <e>", "<cs> may i introduce and move the amendment in this group that stands in my name and that of my noble friend lord taylor of blackburn that is on page line to leave out <e>", "<cs> not having moved the amendment i now wish to speak to it <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lady lockwood made it quite clear that it is acceptable to the committee that we are debating a number of related topics <e> <s> we are arguing about and certainly i want to argue about the premise upon which this particular part of the bill is built <e> <s> that premise is that having lost the per cent <e> <s> of the rate support grant element which is given for education authorities if they are lucky or successful will get hack a proportion of the costs of their bid <e> <s> i am in the business of trying to minimise costs to the local authorities <e> <s> it is wrapped up in these arguments in the percentage that is going to go towards the project but at the end of the day a london borough like enfield and it is not the worst though certainly not the best endowed it may be typical i just do not know but it has its problems certainly cannot afford to lose a penny of the monies that it gets either from the ratepayer or from the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> i beg to unmoved <e>", "<cs> i am even more disturbed by the remarks of the minister <e> <s> if in practice can mean which is what the minister said it could be between and and if by asking for one assumes that it could be then one has the following situation <e> <s> if in the illustration that i gave expenditure on a project in enfield was and having gainsaid in grant and obtained per cent <e> <s> towards it which is they have to pay plus the which they lost they are paying towards a project that cost which is per cent <e>", "<cs> i can give the minister the assurance that i intend to withdraw my amendment and not press it but it is rather sad that the last argument was that this does not appear in other legislation <e> <s> i understood that the government were attempting to break some new ground in this particular matter and in were prepared to listen afresh to people who may have a contribution to make <e> <s> the last thing i want to do is to diminish the stature of local education authorities in this matter <e> <s> they are supreme it is their funds that we are talking about <e> <s> it is rather sad that the minister is not prepared to provide non-public educational bodies with at least the feeling that they have a part to play in helping the nation to better expand its initiatives in education <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the opposition i arise with alacrity to express our appreciation of the terms of the new clause and of the spirit in which the minister in another place <e> <s> mr neil macfarlane was quick to recognise the point that was made to him by the member for chipping barnet mr sydney chapman <e> <s> mr sydney chapman to my knowledge has always been very diligent fair robust and independent in his point of view <e> <s> he is certainly a very knowledgeable member of another place on these matters <e> <s> he made his point not merely because he is knowledgeable about town and country planning matters but because he has assumed the responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in order that i may be quite clear as to the timescale suppose a crown owning authority decides to dispose of land in a way which enables it to seek from the local planning authority the kind of planning permission that that local authority would give on the basis that at the present time the land is hospital land and the intention is to maximise the value of the land to the public as opposed to the private developer speculator owner nothing derogatory is intended and in order to make sure that the land changes hands not at or pounds an acre but at or an acre if it is for housing in order to protect some of the trees one needs to give to the local authority the discretion not to make a blanket order <e> <s> if we are talking in terms of the land changing ownership shall we say <e> <s> on st july am i right in thinking that the minister is saying that the tree preservation order shall be applied for and shall come into effect on st july but shall be in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister address himself to the problem which is faced by many people in local authorities <e> <s> when the minister says that the money will be made available what the councils are worried about is that the management of their funds particularly the rate support grant is wholly in the hands of the government <e> <s> can the minister give a categorical assurance that when these powers are devolved away from the metropolitan areas they can look forward to a continuation of the kind of monies which have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin as indeed others have by congratulating my noble friend lord wallace of coslany not only on the opportunity that he has today his good fortune but also on his dedication to this particular subject over many years <e> <s> those of us who have not had the benefit of being in your lordships house a long time and i am one of the privileged newcomers read up in preparation for the debate and of course we looked at the debate which has great significance <e> <s> one begins to sec that today perhaps is a red letter day in my noble friends legislation and parliamentary career <e> <s> whatever happens to the bill after today and we can be hopeful from what has been said up to now to actually get to this stage is an achievement <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a predictable response <e> <s> he wants to speed up in any way and in every way that he can the disposal of public assets which are represented in publicly owned <e>", "<cs> the reason is that we believe that the bill as at present drafted does not need alteration <e> <s> we are not in the business of altering the three to any figure at all but if the minister wants to alter the three to two we are in the business of putting the three back <e> <s> if the noble baroness wants to extend the period and cares to move something on report we would probably support it <e> <s> however with this amendment we are only concerned with keeping the bill as it stands that is with the three years and not the reduction to two years as the bill has come to us from another place <e>", "<cs> as i understood the position this was not the place in the committee for this point to be raised but the minister fairly takes it on because it was raised from another quarter <e> <s> we are now told that million is the estimate <e> <s> the minister has discounted the other estimates and adopted his own <e> <s> if his estimate is wildly out as is possible in effect this will be a proscription on the number of applications <e> <s> if we find that it is an underestimate will other sums be required <e>", "<cs> but you have <e>", "<cs> not for the first time the minister has taken the opportunity of putting up a very stout robust vigorous and i am sure pleasurable defence of the principles of the right to buy <e> <s> when we try to keep to the amendment precisely the minister is tempted to stray and if he does so we shall expect the same rights <e> <s> we have a very heavily weighted agenda with proper opportunities and each side should recognise that there will be full debate <e> <s> we were not looking at least on this occasion to go into the whole philosophy <e>", "<cs> i shall go so far as to say that i will want to study carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i am certainly pleased in general to know that the minister shares our abhorrence of any retrospective element in legislation <e> <s> it requires to be looked at carefully <e> <s> the minister has made a contribution of reasonable length <e> <s> i shall want to study it and perhaps come back on report <e> <s> however in view of the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do appreciate the manner in which the minister has responded <e> <s> i certainly understand that he is unable to say more than he has done bearing in mind the complex situation <e> <s> it is a matter which could either he resolved by the courts or by a housing department if in actual fact there were no other constraints <e> <s> if there were ease of supply of housing and one was able simply to make two unhappy people less unhappy by providing an alternative i am sure there would not be a problem <e> <s> but the noble lord the minister and the noble lord <e> <s> lord simon of glaisdale i think touched upon another aspect that very often it is the innocent person the secure tenant <e> <s> but if the innocent person is the subject of violence and they have children they literally cannot stop and insist upon their rights to their secure tenancy they have got to get out of the place because the man or woman whoever is the agressor makes it physically impossible within the constraints of not getting himself or herself into too much trouble and drives the other person out <e> <s> that person has then made himself either homeless or has given up his rights <e>", "<cs> so far as we are concerned on this side of the committee we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i from the labour front bench support the principles and the philosophy behind this new clause <e> <s> those of us who have had experience in local government are well aware of the syndrome of the estate which at one time was a matter of pride to the people who lived there <e> <s> i am thinking of pre-war council estates which were given little attention because of a shortage of money which the council finds from some source primarily central government <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn may we look forward to those conversations taking place before report stage <e> <s> if there is need at report stage to take further action then we shall of course feel free to take such action <e>", "<cs> we on these benches fully support the sense of every word which appears in the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> we are grateful that this initiative is before us and for the opportunity of debating it this evening <e>", "<cs> i rise from the labour front bench to support the amendment <e> <s> i am sure that this comes as no surprise in particular since those noble lords astute enough to read further ahead on the marshalled list will have seen amendment no <e> <s> a which relates to the provision of a manual <e> <s> i would hope that the minister finds unexceptionable most of the amendment that we are now debating that is the part of the amendment which relates to the file on construction financing or repair <e> <s> by and large those points would be covered by our amendment no <e> <s> a in which we talk in terms of the purchaser or the tenant of a house having the right to a manual which from the very beginning will reveal precisely how the building was built whether there were any structural problems what one can anticipate what one can be fearful of and so on <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can help the committee by indicating the precise stage the consultations which i believe he referred to as taking place have reached and the extent of the detail <e> <s> i appreciate the problem of the noble lord the minister in being able to respond straightaway <e> <s> the fact is that i do not believe that the noble lord lord evans of claughton is anxious to press matters to a vote if he is able to make progress on the principle <e> <s> we recognise that we are not going to change legislation overnight <e> <s> what we want is satisfaction from the noble lord the minister that there is a process going on and quite clearly not only property owners that is landlords but local authorities and there may be other bodies can <e>", "<cs> may i first apologise for the absence of my noble friend lady birk who has to be elsewhere <e> <s> if she had been here i believe my noble friend would have shared in the views of the minister when he said that this had been a fine debate <e> <s> but i do not believe the minister would be sensing the mood aright if he were to say that there was certainty and complete unanimity even on his own side over this issue <e> <s> what in fact emerged even from the remarks of his noble friends was perhaps grudging acknowl <e>", "<cs> i certainly bow to any noble lord in this committee who clearly has longer service than i have and that includes almost everyone <e> <s> however i have been an assiduous watcher of procedure in this place since coming here and i would say to the noble lord lord mottistone that my observation is different to his recollection of how these things proceed <e> <s> i get the sense of the committee that i am doing nothing wrong even though there will be some dubiety about what i am going to say <e>", "<cs> i do appreciate and want to respond helpfully <e> <s> it is a fact that the understanding in the industry is that the first part of the insurance proposals which relate substantially to what i would call the national housebuilders council insurance building type is likely to be the one that will get off the ground and the other one will not not least because of the difficulty of matching up to providing the cover <e> <s> one of our concerns which we will express later is that clearly because the national housebuilders council already in existence has been favoured and this is not denied by the government as a proper body in fact is likely be the only body that is going to be not just interested but benefit from and grow and expand as a result of these proposals <e> <s> i am not arguing against their system <e> <s> it is in writing there is experience one can look at it <e> <s> i have seen cases of distress and grievance but this happens in all occupations <e> <s> what i am saying is that we are likely to go through the whole trauma of creating a system when in effect the government ought to have done their homework even if that took years and years <e> <s> our charge is that in order to get something on the statute book that looks good the privatisation of building control they are falling over themselves to try to make arrangements which will not work <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond by saying that i am grateful to the minister and to his advisers for clearly anticipating the importance of this debate and for preparing themselves quite fully to respond to the very predictable points which have been around for a long time and which i suspect will be around for a great deal longer <e> <s> i take from the minister the point that has been made by myself and the noble lord lord broxbourne that there is already something upon which can be grafted the governments ambitions and that is the operations of the nhbc <e> <s> i am prepared to believe that provided it works and provided it is supported that particular kind of construction is likely to be taken care of <e>", "<cs> redundancies <e>", "<cs> of course i can have it both ways because either circumstance is possible <e> <s> we just do not know <e> <s> the local authority the chief officer and the committee are charged with trying to manage their affairs in the best way they can <e> <s> if in or months time things begin to get off the ground then they will need to tailor the number of building inspectors they will need <e> <s> what concerns me is that all that i have heard from people in the business is that the approved inspector system is not likely to make very much progress if any progress at all <e> <s> but people just do not know <e> <s> i am not prepared to weary the committee any more at this time <e> <s> there is some more business to be pursued <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has great experience and many contacts in this matter and i can well imagine that that is true <e> <s> it is the uncertainty that has been created that worries me <e> <s> i believe that that will continue for a very long time <e> <s> i am grateful for the opportunity that we have had to air the fears and worries of people outside this place who are looking to us to produce a satisfactory system <e> <s> we intend to return with other opportunities at other stages of the bill but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> despite the possibility of incurring the wrath of the noble baroness lady trumpington i have the temerity to believe that i ought to ask some questions even at this time of night <e>", "<cs> i did get it wrong but one is left with this intriguing point in order to be an approved inspector if one is an architect the fee might be because that is perhaps what the riba decides to charge its members <e> <s> but if one is a structural engineer that professions designated body might be charging its members or <e> <s> in effect to be an approved inspector one may be paying different rates according to ones profession <e> <s> will that not lead at least to the comment that in order to be an approved inspector one looks at how much it costs <e> <s> one is then beginning to see a different scale and grade of the value and quality of the approved inspectors themselves <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful indeed for the comments of the noble and learned lord on the cross-benches which were quite unprompted <e> <s> i appreciate that he has followed the proceedings on the bill at all stages and quite clearly he has a point to make <e> <s> i believe that noble lords on the back-benches opposite would have wished to participate in the debate on insurance for instance which we did not have full opportunity to consider on tuesday and to which we shall need to turn on report <e> <s> the noble lord lord broxbourne who is always in his place for these matters i am sure has a great many valuable comments to make on a range of matters relating to planning building control and so on <e> <s> so i hope that outside of the chamber we shall have his support in ensuring that we shall have proper <e>", "<cs> may i rise to say that i do not wish in any way to test the ability of the minister on this or any other matter because i appreciate <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with that reply because the genesis of the amendment was the campaign for traditional housing and that campaign for traditional housing comprises a number of bodies which are involved in housing <e> <s> the consumers association also supports this view <e> <s> last year the riba issued a joint report <e>", "<cs> the minister will make his points as to why in certain circumstances the government intend to rule with a rod of iron and leave no opportunity where we are saying that in the interests of the consumer we are anxious that the consumer is best served <e>", "<cs> the minister must take fully on board one of the great aggravations which have emerged particularly regarding the present building inspectors and on councils in the precise situation which my noble friend lady nicol has outlined <e> <s> that is where in some circumstance whatever the reason the local authority has to continue and take over the inspection function <e> <s> we are not reading more into this than is possible we are simply saying that it is possible <e> <s> invariably when that happens there has been an unfortunate circumstance <e> <s> otherwise the local authority would not have reverted to the responsibility <e> <s> let us suppose that the approved inspector who is responsible for the whole of the job or a specialist has died or has left or there has been an argument or he has emigrated <e> <s> or he has retired and the developer then says i am now going to go through the procedures and the work is going to revert to the council <e> <s> that is not the developers fault perhaps <e> <s> it is certainly not the councils fault <e> <s> but in the circumstances we are talking about how the local council building inspector who then has the responsibility of carrying out inspection satisfies himself that the earlier work for which he has not been responsible nevertheless has been carried out properly <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the care which the minister has taken with his response <e> <s> but what he is saying is that there is no need for a public body to alter in the future any of its procedures which it has operated in the past <e> <s> the current situation is that a public body exercises its discretion its supervision its appointment it carries its risks and makes sure that only competent people are used <e> <s> the great puzzle for members outside this place about this whole part of the bill is why the government are determined to change what the minister has very fairly and effectively described as a good working system <e> <s> it is worked at the moment not only by public bodies in regard to their own buildings but also by the public inspection system in regard to other buildings <e> <s> yet the government have decided that this needs to be changed <e>", "<cs> the minister has given an assurance on clause but we are moving to another clause <e> <s> clause and a new amendment <e> <s> the minister forces me to weary the committee by again reading out the provision in new subsection b <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord mind doing that please <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer is perfectly acceptable <e> <s> what we feared but it was obviously born out of if not ignorance not being fully apprised was that we did not wish to see other bodies that are involved in the whole process of designation and approval for instance of approved inspectors or the professional bodies <e>", "<cs> again we may have got it wrong we got it wrong the last time when we were talking about prescribed fees but are we looking at a situation where different bodies will prescribe different levels of fees for the same kind of service <e> <s> part of amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> we are dealing of course with building control <e> <s> if we cannot exercise some control of our own affairs what chance has the building industry <e> <s> however in respect of the point made will the minister take what i have to say in the right spirit <e> <s> what the noble lord says will be understood by those who are fully aware of all the facets and who are able to quote every section of the act but i wish to be satisfied of the postulation i made that the possibility of some shopping around element does not exist <e> <s> the minister said that the person seeking approval would be the person paying the fee <e> <s> of course the person seeking approval would pay the fee <e> <s> i wanted to know to whom he would pay the fee for what he would be paying and whether there would be a range of options <e> <s> otherwise why leave the words <e>", "<cs> may i rise briefly to say that we on these benches support what is being requested <e> <s> this is a probing amendment <e> <s> there are a range of bodies outside this house who are anxious to test what they understand from their own experience will be the effect of insurance matters and they are asking legitimate questions <e> <s> the minister can fairly tell us consultations are going on papers are being issued comments are being received and they are being refined <e> <s> this is against the background of the uncertainty as to whether this particular route will ever be followed because of the inability of the insurance companies to be satisfied that a market can be created in this specific field of insurance <e> <s> we shall certainly be interested in the response of the minister and be guided by the noble lord lord auckland as to his intentions in respect of the amendment at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> may i take this opportunity to express the appreciation of my colleagues on this side of the chamber for the many instances where it was quite clear that the minister and his advisers anticipated the range of matters over which we were going to work in order to try to elicit information <e> <s> certainly we can see some great merit in reading the reports of the committee stage in preparation for the report stage <e> <s> it is one of those exercises where one learns something new all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that fire is the prime cause of fatalities in houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> is he further aware that the greatest number of such houses lie in greater london and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> would the minister care to tell us what special steps he and his colleagues in the government are taking to ensure that when those authorities are abolished not only will their responsibilities be passed to the appropriate local councils but those councils will have sufficient resources and the will to carry out the additional responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister had time to evaluate fully the coopers and lybrand report <e> <s> will he now admit that it completely demolishes his case that the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan county councils will save ratepayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his noble friend has told the london and middlesex archaeological society that he hopes and i stress that word that the needs of archaeology will be taken into account by london boroughs when they consider how to work more closely together in the future <e> <s> in view of the poor record of london boroughs working together is it not a fact that london and indeed the nation should expect that their historic sites and artefacts should rest on more than the hopes of a minister or pious ministerial statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make a contribution to this important debate and to declare an interest in that i have long had an association with the prison officers association <e> <s> a debate on the prison service will of course range far and wide <e> <s> as my noble friend lord longford says and i congratulate him on providing this opportunity for a debate we are here to consider changes in our prisons that could benefit the prisoners be of value to society and at the same time to highlight the crucial role to be played by the prison service in bringing this about <e> <s> from my conversations with members of the prison officers association i can say that they certainly subscribe to the view that the time has now arrived when a more positive and a wider and more constructive role should be perceived for those who serve society as prison officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that because there are so many amendments in one group i appreciate the question as to whether there should be two groups the minister will in fact take extraordinary care to deal with all the amendments not too briefly but not too lengthily while at the same time giving us a good explanation <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the spirit in which the minister has sought to respond and be helpful to the house <e> <s> i certainly acknowledge that there are amendments and most of them will have been presented to him <e> <s> i am also conscious of the convention at report stage that one in fact only speaks once <e> <s> i have not yet spoken on these amendments <e> <s> of course with a grouping of amendments one is unfair to the minister because if everyone speaks early to make sure that they make their point by the time the minister replies he has a very long list of answers to make <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i wish to make is comparable to the point that has just been made <e> <s> clearly we are in a situation where the same council or different councils are in possession of the fact that the person to whom they are going to give the tenancy of a house has previously been the occupant of a council house and the records show that he has bought it and sold it <e> <s> this query has in fact already been raised <e> <s> how often can he do it <e> <s> in my view it can only happen once but the minister will clearly come back to this point and help the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sure the minister will appreciate that the house is interested in pursuing and exhausting this point <e> <s> we are not quibbling about the cause or the purpose behind this clause but the indications around the house are that let is preferable to the words which appear in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether at some stage the house is going to adjourn <e> <s> we are only seeking guidance it is not that we want to run away from any battle <e> <s> but there are other people here who i think are even more anxious than we are to know where they stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept fully the intention of the government <e> <s> if however at the end of the proceedings in another place we are disappointed because the government do not say what we hope they will say and consequently there is conflict between us we shall then have to reconsider the matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord molson has indicated that we should be prepared to wait <e> <s> we are prepared to wait <e> <s> however when it comes to controlling what will happen we are in a different situation <e> <s> therefore the dilemma with which we are faced is the irreconcilability of leaving clause in the bill until we know precisely what the government intend to do <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can help us on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does not need to ask for rejection of this amendment because i intend to withdraw it <e> <s> i am disappointed <e> <s> i appreciate that this is not the first time round the course for this proposal <e> <s> i am interested in the ministers statement that this would be the unanimous view of the landlord authorities <e> <s> i should need to find out whether that is the case <e> <s> there will be other opportunities to raise the issue <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful each time the minister gives more information on the progress of overcoming the problems involved so that those outside may feel satisfied that the best is being made of a very bad job <e> <s> the minister must be aware that those outside have the greatest unease about the insurance aspect of this part of the bill as opposed to many others <e> <s> there is violent disagreement about certain other matters but there is unease and fear that there could be some if i were to use emotive words perhaps i might be out of order possibility that something dreadful might happen because the insurance side has not been got right <e> <s> this causes great unease outside the house <e> <s> the government have decided that this is the way they want to do it so theirs is the responsibility <e> <s> but the unease does exist and the minister will know that i am not carrying tales because he will understand that the great unease felt outside needs to be drawn constantly to the attention of the minister and his advisers to remind them that the quicker they are able to satisfy the interests outside that is everybody not just the party or association but the insurance industry as well then the better will be their lot in implementing the legislation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> at committee stage the minister was kind enough to invite the noble viscount lord hanworth and me to discuss the matter with him <e> <s> we had a very productive hour in his office during which we went over the ground <e> <s> although we were unable to persuade him and although he was unable to persuade us this does not alter the fact that there is understanding about the point we are making <e> <s> we are trying to find a form of words that will meet a situation which may not arise very often but of which we need to take account <e> <s> this is because of the size of and the wide range of attitudes in the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> this is a good idea whose time has not yet come <e> <s> it is quite clear from what was said by my good friend lord broxbourne and others that there is understanding as to what is sought to be achieved but that it is not necessary in the present circumstances <e> <s> i am aware of a meeting in december at the ministry when all the options were canvassed and there were some very strong views from a limited number of bodies which just said they would not participate they would not take part in a joint board arrangement they wanted to control their own affairs <e> <s> those voices were very powerful inside the ministry and they prevailed <e> <s> but as far as we are concerned on this side of the house we are satisfied that this matter will be kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful but i hope that the minister does not treat lightly the seriousness that the inter-departmental committee is a proper forum in which this matter could be discussed <e> <s> there is a host of problems and i do not wish him to get to his feet again but i hope he and his colleagues will in actual fact simply draw the attention of the inter-departmental committee to the debate on these matters in this house and another house and ask that they be seriously considered <e> <s> they are considered important by a lot of people outside this house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is to be moved by the noble lord lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this series of amendments is to take very careful account of the disparity which would exist between the estimates of the cost of the new system compared with the cost of the old system <e> <s> the minister and his advisers are well aware that attempts by a range of bodies with experience to calculate the cost in future have produced estimates ranging from twice to three times or four times the cost of the present service <e> <s> so let us make no mistake about it the ministry and those who are concerned are very sensitive about the fact that the new system will cost more and the government have sought to diminish that charge by increasing the cost of the public service <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> what the government are about is avoiding too much embarrassment in the future while at the same time moving towards a concept which i say to the minister i accept they indicated some time previously in which these are the kind of services which eventually will have to pay their way <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrases that the minister has used are again very revealing <e> <s> the noble lord says that time will be given to local authorities to adjust their resources <e> <s> what he really means is to increase their charges <e> <s> according to the government a time will come on a date not announced when they will bring forward this proposal <e> <s> if that fact is noted and charges are increased accordingly they say this will be all to the good <e> <s> the noble lord also indicated that all he was doing was to give local authorities freedom to fix their own charges <e> <s> but the house and others know what that freedom has meant in respect of school meals transport and other issues <e> <s> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> with the leave of the house so far as i am concerned the response of the minister has been quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord lord broxbourne has fairly raised the possibility that cross-subsidisation could be exercised by one authority to help to keep down the costs <e> <s> this is always possible <e> <s> in our view the amendment is a deliberate attempt to try to reduce what we consider will be alarm in the future when the disparity between local authority costs and the new system the amount will be punitive because of the need for the inspector to take out insurance is revealed as far too high <e> <s> in view of that i shall be pressing amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e>", "<cs> i should like again to support the good sense of those outside the committee who clearly have assisted my noble friend lord wallace in seeking to improve the bill at all stages <e> <s> of course there will be other stages after tonight and who knows <e> <s> when a wider audience looks at what we have done tonight there may be even more improvements on the way <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the intention of the clause <e> <s> it is quite clear that sometimes one does not get the words right <e> <s> but i am sure that the minister understands very well the agitation if not the anger of many people who want to maintain the existing acreage of allotments but who are aware of the fact that in this day and age when there is severe pressure from the government on authorities to find money from their own resources there will be authorities who will look with covetous eyes upon the possibility that by one means or another they will be able to produce a situation in which it can be said that there is no longer any need or demand for allotments and the land will be sold and the monies will be used to keep down general rating needs <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the value of this amendment <e> <s> i can understand the minister making noises that the department has enough on its hands <e> <s> reference was made during the second reading debate to the value of the thorpe report <e> <s> but again there is uncertainty over the precise extent of allotmenteers in the country <e> <s> in the local government planning and land act the government and this was without our blessing laid a whole range of additional duties on local government to provide a wide diversity of statistics and information <e> <s> to the extent that the government will claim the credit for opening the books and the doors of local authority activities we are saying as we said in another place and i remember saying it myself on the floor of the house that the use to which statistics can be put let alone the basic need for providing statistics on something which i repeat is part of a community is very sound and can be very valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the prime minister was an early champion of open government when she successfully piloted legislation to open up council meetings to the press and the public <e> <s> what is the difference between a council meeting which is concerned with the expenditure of local monies and a water authority <e> <s> is it not a fact that consumers whether they are industrial or domestic are entitled to see how more than million is being spent or wasted <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the convention and i did not wish to rise at all <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will understand that <e> <s> will the minister not take on board the enormous significance of the translation from temporary to permanent in this instance and not only that but that once a permanent permission has been granted it immediately provides the opportunity for consolidation and then after consolidation for expansion <e> <s> a crucial aspect is the recommendation or the indication by the inspector that a permanent permission should be given and from that has flowed a great deal <e>", "<cs> just you wait <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down has the minister any answers to the questions i asked during the debate or is it his intention to reply to them <e> <s> the minister might recall that i gave him notice of those questions earlier i understand the problems but i should like to know whether i am going to get answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say from this side of the house that we are grateful to the noble baroness for giving us yet another opportunity of looking at the vital subject of tenants rights <e> <s> we are sympathetic to the new clause <e> <s> the minister may be able to tell us that there is no need for it because written in the small print in the various other bits of the enactment there are matters that can take care of it <e> <s> i do not think that the house can listen too often to the disparity between what as we would call him <e> <s> a good landlord does and what even a good landlord tries to do but fails to do and the net sufferers are the poor people the people who are defenceless in trying <e>", "<cs> coercion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the noble lords persistence <e> <s> i have looked carefully at the reasons why the previous amendment was not acceptable to the government <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord evans of claughton read with care the words of the noble lord lord skelmersdale who said that he agreed with the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> if we can get a little more than agreement with that principle we shall i believe make some progress <e> <s> the government have quite fairly pointed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow with real pleasure the words of the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln who showed real sensitivity and understanding regarding the aspirations behind the bill based upon what i detected to be a genuine understanding of some of the failings in our present democratic fabric <e> <s> this fabric has been fashioned to be responsive to the pressures of modern <e>", "<cs> my lords if for instance the london borough of enfield received a petition the procedures worked and a parish was created within the london borough of enfield then the costs of the procedures would be borne by the total ratepayers of the london borough of enfield <e> <s> to that extent one might get some parts of a borough saying one part of the borough has it so why not us <e> <s> the answer is that these things are experimental where a borough is courageous enough to respond to a petition from an area <e>", "<cs> my lords the house recognises i am sure the enormity of the issues and appreciates that the statistics are very important but i want to ask the minister to reassure the house that real care is taken in support of secretary of state shultzs assertion that what the west wants are militarily significant and verifiable agreements <e> <s> does the minister agree that the greatest danger we now face is the risk of war through misunderstanding or miscalculation <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to the following amendments <e>", "<cs> i certainly believe everything they say and i say that even when i hear the minister speaking from a sitting position <e> <s> the situation is that in the london borough of enfield as in many others there is serious concern at the impact of this bill on local authorities who are genuinely trying to find their way through this morass <e> <s> the minister knows that the local government planning and land act introduced the block grant <e> <s> i recall that all three associations were unanimous in condemning the mechanisms the triggers the tapers the various penalties and so on and what was said has come to pass <e> <s> the working of that act is detested <e> <s> the effect may very well be to the ministers satisfaction but the working of it is detested by local government whether labour controlled or others <e>", "<cs> i can give the minister the date of the letter that i received <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had the same letter as i did and he responded to the leader then the leader has yet to report the noble lords observations back to the council <e>", "<cs> i take it that it is amendment no <e> <s> which is being withdrawn <e>", "<cs> at this stage i am not withdrawing amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> may i speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we will not save time <e>", "<cs> it is still the same leader <e>", "<cs> could i be helpful to the noble baroness lady gardner <e> <s> i simply read what the town clerk had sent to me which is what his councillors had instructed him to send <e> <s> this is what i read <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady birk will speak more fully on a certain point but may i ask the minister to help us <e> <s> what concerns members on this side of the committee is the time that parliament would give <e> <s> the minister points out that there is a comparable procedure with for instance the rate support grant orders <e> <s> these encompass everything and all boroughs all affected authorities are able to make representations and negotiations take place and not merely on whether the vote shall not take place at oclock <e>", "<cs> i want to press the minister <e> <s> i fully understand that the minister believes that given the opportunity and shall we say there are authorities designated they would first of all quite properly as he would hope come and argue their case <e> <s> there would be not as much time in the world but we are talking in terms of meetings which might take hours of explanation and refutation and so on <e> <s> but at the end of the day we are envisaging the possibility that each authority will not only feel that they have been aggrieved by the very nature of the action but that they have demonstrated to their ratepayers and others outside that they have done as much as they can publicly <e> <s> there are matters that take place at no <e> <s> marsham street and we respect confidence and also the ability to talk off the cuff <e> <s> but if i had anything to do with any authority i would be one of those who expect their mps regardless of party to use the opportunity <e> <s> there will be alliances not political alliances but geographical alliances which we want to argue <e>", "<cs> we must continue to have this debate <e> <s> in another response the minister said that the principles were not yet fully clarified or codified in the ministers mind <e> <s> but the objective was quite clear <e> <s> the objective is to curb the high spenders <e> <s> the principles upon which that will be done have to evolve <e> <s> the minister is telling the house that what parliament is being asked to do is to agree to an objective <e> <s> the method by which the objective will be carried into effect that is the basis is yet to be determined in the ministry <e> <s> when it is parliament will not have a chance of approving it but will be told at the same time that the hit list authorities are told that this is the reason they fall within it <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the case which has been made by the noble lord lord evans of claughton <e> <s> this debate runs on from our earlier debate <e> <s> the minister sought to give reassurances on two themes first that adequate time would be provided in whatever form in another place for the case to be made and secondly that the case would be capable of being made in this place <e> <s> to be fair to the minister he resisted having words put into his mouth <e> <s> he did not use precisely those words but he must know that that is what we are after <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> i think the minister has taken fairly seriously the importance of the principles that are going to be the base upon which the designation rests but at the end of the day what people want are the details <e> <s> what we are arguing here is that any authority which finds that it is rate-capped wants not merely to be told in the abstract which is what principles are but in practice <e> <s> we then come down to the very vexed question that clearly what they will be accused of is overspending <e>", "<cs> i think we are arguing about whether the minister should be satisfied or whether the minister should be satisfied <e> <s> the wording in the bill is <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to withdraw the amendment but the minister who always does his best to help the committee has quite clearly indicated the ease with which it is possible if not to be confused at least to be faced with a number of interpretations of what is meant by a phrase <e> <s> in describing principles he used the phrase general criteria and then he referred to the basis and so on <e> <s> clearly the legislation will lend itself to a number of cross periods as between councils and the government perhaps not on matters of substance but on matters of interpretation <e> <s> in withdrawing the amendment let me say that we certainly intend to come back to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has given us illustrations of other aspects upon which it might have been helpful to have a dialogue for instance with hackney and it is quite clear that as often as he gives them a refutation of them can be found whereupon the minister will bring others <e> <s> for instance he has referred not only today but at other times to how surprised he is that other than ministers of the crown can find it useful to have political advisers and researchers <e> <s> the minister in fact ought to move on <e> <s> he may be remembering his days as the leader of a large authority when advisers and researchers may <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> not any more <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the minister will agree with the committee that number is the lucky

fifth we had not exhausted the opportunities <e> <s> we have now reached the tenth amendment <e> <s> the minister has batted with a very straight bat <e> <s> not only is it the tenth amendment tonight it is also about the fortieth amendment since we started <e>", "<cs> the loyalty may not be so blind <e> <s> if we look at the merits of the argument we see that what the minister is inviting his colleagues behind him to do is first to give powers to the secretary of state and for the house to rubber-stamp the decisions of the minister on serious matters <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill in the previous amendment and the noble baroness lady stedman have carefully tried to point out what this committee will be allowing if it fails to approve the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are in fact making fresh legislation <e> <s> i am not competent to go back over every piece of legislation in which i had a part ornamental or otherwise <e> <s> so far as i am concerned there are very serious constitutional implications in this bill <e> <s> what i am saying to the committee is that in these circumstances what the committee is invited to do is either to leave this to the secretary of state

want to be quite clear that i understand what he has said <e> <s> he accepts the premise on which our case is made that there ought to be some time which it is understood is allowed for the authority to react to the determination the designation and to decide its next steps <e> <s> the minister has said clearly that three months is too long and has given us a global timescale <e> <s> if three months is too long perhaps the minister will specify either in the bill or otherwise a shorter period of four weeks six weeks or eight weeks <e> <s> on the basis that we will hear further from the minister on this matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> the minister used the phrase the authority had made insufficient efforts <e> <s> as i understand it what that means is reducing the expenditure levels in other words it has to produce savings which would satisfy the minister that it has done its best <e> <s> if that is the interpretation we are not arguing about the wider principles of the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way in the light of his comments about mondragn <e> <s> does he not agree with the idea of a co-operative development agency which i know he supported in another place as i did <e> <s> is it not rather sad that when the government have an opportunity to strengthen the development of co-operatives through the co-operative development agency and industrial development bill which will come before this house shortly that there is a great contrast between what the government say they want to do and what they actually do when it comes to legislation <e>", "<cs> i repeat lewisham in case the minister did not hear it <e> <s> he will hear more of it as the debates go on <e> <s> it is clearly an authority that has enormous problems and if it is to be affected at all it is more likely to be affected in the first part of the bill rather than in the second <e> <s>

level i think the minister would accept the fairness of their <e>", "<cs> i am interested in the timescale that the minister outlines <e> <s> i hesitate to accept his argument that in april there would be incomplete information as to the budgets of local authorities <e> <s> my understanding and experience is that well before april each rate precepting authority is fairly clear and precise and has gone through all the arguments publicly to provide statistics <e> <s> what the minister might be saying though not precisely is that there may be difficulty in the ministry in analysing commenting on and coming to conclusions upon the budgets <e> <s> i would understand that but the problems are not those of the ministry having the information the problems in that case are those of the ministry responding to information in the light of the imperatives which it has laid upon it <e>", "<cs> may i rise in support of the amendment <e> <s> the minister is quite right in pointing to present practice but he will be aware that in another place on th march his right honourable friend the secretary of state said <e>", "<cs> if we are referring to clause subsection relates to the <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> i consider that this has been a useful short debate <e> <s> may i repeat that we on this side of the house fully support the intention of clause that the industrial and commercial ratepayers be consulted i remind the committee that the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has said that our amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> in her experience clause is unnecessary because there is consultation taking place in enfield as i told the house and the noble baroness confirms with the local industrial and commercial community with the exception of the local co-operative society <e> <s> in the enfield area and i believe in many others the local co-operative society is the biggest single ratepayer <e> <s> i repeat the figure more than million is paid

electricity consumers who are covered by the local electricity board are now paying million more in than they would if there had been some adjustments to the situation <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw it but may i first say that i am grateful for the support by the noble baroness lady gardner of the principle and for her sympathy with what is behind the amendments <e> <s> i am also very grateful indeed for what i consider to be the constructive and sympathetic response of the minister to the problems of the leb <e> <s> he quite rightly pointed out that when one is making a change of this kind

acknowledge as the minister pointed out the various consulting fora which exist not least the electricity council <e> <s> i think i understood the minister to say that in a review which is taking place covering the year not simply on this but on other issues he is likely to come forward and at least to indicate that the consultations have taken place <e>", "<cs> maturity <e>", "<cs> my lords

the aggravations that exist almost constantly in respect of the quality of service provided by london transport <e> <s> not with just the present body but with any body there are bound to be a lot of aggravation and matters to raise <e> <s> if the minister intends to make the new relationship meaningful he must acknowledge that local councils as they are at present constituted will be able to make an input <e>", "<cs> would the minister care to say something about the division of responsibility and authority between the main board and the passengers consultative committee <e> <s> the minister has quite fairly said that the consultation needs to be meaningful and i wonder just how much power the passengers consultative committee will in fact have <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to growing disrepair <e> <s> can the minister tell the house what steps are taken by the government to ascertain and to monitor the effect on a councils ability to maintain its properties arising from the cut-backs in rate support grant and also the allocations to councils in the housing investment programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friends question reinforce the need for the government always to have in mind absolute equity between the private sector and the public sector in housing matters <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord indicated something there <e> <s> can he assure the house that when housing improvement programmes are made there is a built-in allowance to take into account matters like this which come up without prior warning during the current year <e>", "<cs> let me just complete not only the geographical but also the partisan unity <e> <s> that ought to encourage the minister to be less bleak in his response than he was at second reading <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how often there has been a revision of the application of vat on other items in <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister acknowledge that the improvements in the past two years come after five disastrous years that preceded them not only for the house purchaser but also for the construction industry <e> <s> is he not prepared to acknowledge

of concentrating on selling off the nations housing assets at knock-down prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by acknowledging what the minister has said today and at previous stages that there is ample opportunity for an aggrieved authority to make its case by bringing deputations to the minister or at the derogation stage by seeking to argue and thus convince the minister <e> <s> but in this amendment we are not concerned with seeking to convince the minister <e> <s> i am satisfied that if the minister has taken a stand and has listened very carefully to the leaders and the chief executives of councils who come to london to argue their case and if he still sticks to his brief which he is entitled to do a debate in the house will not change his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords may i merely explain that the amendment is not friendless <e> <s> it is brought to this house by the association of county councils the association of district councils and the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> to the extent that this house will pay respect to the consultation procedure those bodies have been consulted on what they would like to see happen <e> <s> if members on the other side reject the advice that they have been tendered that is up to them <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a useful exercise <e> <s> the minister persists in saying that we need to be quite clear as to what we mean by principle and what the principles are <e> <s> what we are saying is that there is no better way of being quite clear than by writing them into the face of the bill <e> <s> the minister persists in allowing himself the secretary of state alone to determine the principles <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am far from satisfied because the minister again pleads shortage of time <e> <s> the timetable is made by the minister <e> <s> he points out quite rightly that in the earlier part of the year there are certain deadlines to be met but frankly i believe that the timetable is not one that cannot be adapted <e> <s> the minister also makes great play about the time-honoured way in which the secretary of state has always had powers of this kind <e> <s> there have previously been no powers of this kind <e> <s> we are treading new ground in respect of the sovereignty of parliament over local government <e> <s> i am not arguing about the order or the hierarchy or

<e> <s> when the minister and the government are breaking new ground they should be prepared to consider a new device <e> <s> we are far from satisfied <e> <s> we shall consult others outside and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to withdraw this amendment but the minister tempts me to point out that the history of the government in attempting to refashion and redesign their legislation in the rates field over the past three to four years since the local government planning and land act is studded with new formulae which appeared to meet the case and then exceptions having been found amendments were made to it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house whether any estimate has been made of the rates which would be forgone by local authorities in the event of this amendment being implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful but when it is suggested to the house that this will be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister prepared to elaborate the definition of a swinging mooring <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the explanation but i do not think it is good enough simply to advise the house that this is in pursuance of an undertaking given in another place <e> <s> i think this house is entitled to have an explanation given to it as to the merits of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief although i appreciate that the debate has gone on for some time <e>", "<cs> i agree that there is plenty of time <e> <s> i simply want to make the point that it appears to me that many noble lords who have spoken against the amendment are really asking why should we bother <e> <s> why do we not just leave the present situation but watered down <e> <s> why should we not leave people to look after themselves <e> <s> the noble lord from the cross-benches simply said that even though that may be damaging to ones health and the nation it should he left like that <e>", "<cs> he has not changed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the initative of the noble and gallant lord lord cameron of balhousie <e> <s> his speech tonight has served us very well indeed in a number of ways <e> <s> i took particular note of one or two of the comments that he made <e> <s> he talked about responsibility without power he talked about power without responsibility and he named names to whom in his view that tag should be attached <e> <s> he talked about the denigration of the chiefs of staff and in a letter that he wrote to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down a number of questions were asked during the debate <e> <s> i appreciate the constraints of debate but all questions were asked seriously <e> <s> can we look forward to replies in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords today as yesterday your lordships house has been extremely well served by statements of weight and substance from the noble lord lord trefgarne and we are grateful not only for those statements but also for the fact

have spoken today <e> <s> all those indeed every speaker i heard today and i missed on or two would merit the approval of the noble lord lord mottistone as having made sensible speeches <e> <s> i will be asking many questions and i fully understand that some of them will need to receive a written reply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise some questions which have resource implications <e> <s> can the minister tell us what care has been taken to ensure that there are sufficient teachers with the adequate experience and training available for these courses <e> <s> can the minister say something about the status of the scheme and the resources which will be available to the authorities <e> <s> would the minister not also agree that this is going to place some great difficulty upon year-olds who may very well fall between the very many stools in deciding which course to take <e>", "<cs> my lords following the opening remarks of my noble friend lord mishcon with which i completely agree is it not a sad fact that the incidence of police shooting which is clear in this case follows a very dreadful murder which took place earlier this week not many miles away from this incident in hertford road enfield which i know very very well <e> <s> will the minister take a special note of the juxtaposition of both events <e> <s> this was a point made by the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> would he not agree that there is a real urgency for the government to think again of any way in which they can seek to diminish the use of firearms by both the criminals or the police <e>", "<cs> my noble friend can say that again <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the care that the minister has taken but no one here is imputing ulterior motives to the government <e> <s> i believe that the minister used a term which could have implied that we felt that something could be hidden <e> <s> what we are saying is publish and be dammed <e> <s> if the minister and his colleagues take a decision in the light of representations to reduce or increase the limitation what we are saying we are talking about not more than authorities or up to or is that there are literally hundreds of provisions on the statute hook which cause governments and departments to publish statements and notices <e> <s> although the minister is quite right all we are saying is that local people will be very interested in the story the editorial and the statement by the leader of the council and so on and that this will go some way to publishing the matter immediately to a wider audience than the council <e> <s> the minister will know about the shetlands <e> <s> very few people know the precise reason why the minister took his actions in the shetlands <e> <s> we know the action that he took to take them off the list but there has been very little publicity as to why <e> <s> that is what we are asking for <e> <s> but we can see that we shall make no progress so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to use flowery language or to use such words as smear or innuendo <e> <s> nor do i wish to pray in aid what has happened in any place that i have read

association <e> <s> i confess that i am not so activist a trade unionist as i should like to be but even my limited experience is probably greater than that of some of those who speak with great eloquence about what is wrong with our trade union movement <e> <s> i do not say that with disrespect <e>", "<cs> my lords at about oclock last night i rose in my place to address or members of the government benches of your <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl cannot refute the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords however the minister describes the bill it is part of a programme to flog off the assets of the nation <e> <s> the government have never hidden from the public their distaste of the public sector <e> <s> regardless of the needs of the nation and whether or not that segment of the public sector is profitable but especially if it is profitable and has a record which will appeal to the city and to investors it is a prime target for privatisation <e> <s> the crime of which the royal ordnance factories stand condemned in the eyes of this government a government which know the cost of everything and the value of nothing is that they have served the nation well that they are successful and profitable and that there is a market for their shares <e> <s> there must be something sick in the mind of a government when they jeopardise the security of a nation in the pursuit of such dogma <e>", "<cs> most of us who take an interest in these matters have sat here for more than three hours while this clause has been debated <e> <s> there have been amendments and that is a clear indication that clauses and are seen by many of us to be central to the philosophy and <e>", "<cs> did i understand the minister to say that he is taking amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> in that case it would be appropriate to indicate our views on amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble minister is speaking to a situation which has been radically changed by the decision of the first vote this evening <e> <s> i can well understand when a minister talks about confusion that the confusion is shared by all noble lords as to precisely the effect on clause <e> <s> we are satisfied and delighted that our amendment received the approbation of the committee <e> <s> an opposition needs to anticipate situations and the minister in saying that these amendments are not acceptable is speaking from the position that he first of all does not like our actions in respect of amendment no <e> <s> and as a consequence these follow <e>", "<cs> we accept the spirit of the words but the minister ought to note very carefully that these amendments have been needed in order to clarify <e> <s> the minister has said that there was no need to clarify and that what had been said by the government earlier was quite clear <e> <s> the fact that these amendments were not only required but actually have the approval of the minister clearly indicates the care with which all members of the house must look at not a confusing situation but a complicated one <e> <s> we must be prepared not merely to accept i say this with no disrespect what is said to us by ministers but to study with care what precisely are the implications <e>", "<cs> if in fact we are faced with the proposition that there is something not in the bill and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter sees no harm in putting it in with the prospect of taking it out why put it in in the first place <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce what clearly is a crucial point <e> <s> the minister recognises that in the light of the decision taken earlier tonight there is literally no certainty about the governments intentions <e> <s> we respect completely what has been said <e> <s> the government are looking afresh at the situation <e> <s> we do not know what the government are going to come up with next week in the light of the decision <e> <s> we do not know what will happen if any changes in the governments present intentions are tested in another place and a parliamentary majority in that place is successful quite properly and democratically and the matter comes back here <e> <s> in the light of the earlier decisions the whole situation up to and beyond the rate-fixing time in all local authorities is in a state of flux <e>", "<cs> the minister seeks to reassure us that in the circumstances that could well arise and in the circumstances for which this new clause is designed there is no need to do that <e> <s> that may very well be so <e> <s> i have listened with care to the references which the minister has made to the possibility that when the repeal orders are put forward it will be within the power of the secretary of state to take into account representations that he has received <e>", "<cs> the minister indicated the normal situation <e> <s> we are not in the normal situation <e> <s> normally we would know that elections would take place in may <e> <s> we do not know whether elections will or will not take place in <e> <s> we know that it is the governments intention that they shall not take place in may but we do not know the situation <e> <s> the minister takes us very carefully properly and sincerely backwards <e> <s> he points out that in the normal course of events the latest date for a by-election would be december of this year <e> <s> that is on the premise that the elections if they had been held <e> <s> would have been held in may of next year <e> <s> but we know from the situation both from the determination of the government and from the determination of those who oppose the government that there is no certainty as to when the elections if they are to be held will be held <e>", "<cs> that is most gracious of the minister and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i quickly say that i was echoing the words of former cabinet ministers of his own party in another place who used the word gerrymander <e> <s> as far as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am quite certain that they would disclaim the utterances of the noble lord in the same context <e> <s> the minister tempts me to say that i

of my party in certain circumstances and we would deny it as well <e> <s> my interpretation of the word gerrymander is that by a non-elective process the electoral control of an authority is changed <e> <s> if the minister is telling me that there is no intention that the collective government of london will have other than a labour majority after the provisions of the bill become law i shall be very surprised <e> <s> from all that we have seen and read it is intended that the present majority of four for labour will be changed to a minority for labour <e> <s> the minister is entitled to say that he has tried to do this in the fairest possible way it may well be the fairest possible way but in trying to do it in the fairest possible way one has to come up against the position that was mentioned by the noble lord lord evans of claughton and others <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the political reality is that where there is an alliance such as that in hammersmith and the council collectively is able to determine the situation although the minister might say it is one to labour and one to the rest and then he would spin a coin in fact you might very well consider giving one to the conservatives one to the liberals and one to labour <e> <s> that in fact would not be fair because there would not then be an equality of seats among the three parties <e> <s> all i am pointing out is that in trying to give effect to what the government intend to do one comes up against a situation of that kind <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i first

question of getting to grips with the need for a relevant course of training for small groups of people <e> <s> i gave an illustration not of a disaster but of a potential disaster perhaps arising out of inexpertness in understanding what is required <e> <s> i was talking about using the co-operative college but in other ways <e> <s> does the cda have a proper programme for widening the number of courses and the number of people who will be trained to be sound co-operators <e>", "<cs> the noble lord apparently rests his case on what he said at the beginning but i think he ought to take fully on board the unreality of much of what we are going to say as we proceed through the marshalled list today <e> <s> the minister must know that he is inviting the committee to take note of two circumstances <e> <s> we are at the committee stage of a bill the precise nature of which we shall not know until the government make a statement tomorrow <e> <s> in other words it is quite possible that we shall proceed today to discuss largely academically what our attitude would be if the bill was different from what it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> the minister talks in terms of the likelihood of something happening based upon assumptions which he has drawn from statements that have been made <e> <s> i want to face the committee with this further reality of the governments attitude <e> <s> this is a simple matter of a quorum at a council meeting or a council committee meeting <e> <s> the government feel constrained in a piece of legislation to deal with the quorum at a council committee meeting <e> <s> i know the minister is going to say that enormous consequences could flow from the absence of a quorum that is a larger quorum and it is a question of looking forward <e>", "<cs> i am finished <e>", "<cs> the noble lord invites the committee to pass this legislation on the ground that he would assume that councils would behave properly <e> <s> if they behave properly legislation

far from happy <e> <s> we are not prepared to let the matter rest but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> or cricket <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister is prepared to

not talking about anybody at all but primarily the trade unions <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the minister has said <e> <s> he has been very careful to use phrases like the last resort and only if necessary and after virtually the wilful refusal of authorities to act in accordance with the directions instructions influence and pleading of the staff commission <e> <s> i should like the minister to say a little more about the ultimate powers and to recall that he has advised us that this is all of a piece with the functions of previous staff commissions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord leaves me speechless from time to time too <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down does he appreciate also the additional dimension which is present this time around as opposed to and <e> <s> i am speaking of the fact that the governments policy in respect of rate capping and in respect of the control on local government expenditure will be bound to heighten the resistance of not just one council but of a group of councils taking one view or another <e> <s> it will not be a question of just one council standing out there will be a real hiatus in every metropolitan authority where the direction if it has to be given will have to be given to many and not just to one council <e>", "<cs> well i want the minister to listen with even more care because there may be some premise in my argument that may cause the minister and his advisers to look again at the necessity of including the officers in this particular point <e> <s> as the committee is aware clause and impose a duty not just on the councils but on the officers as well <e> <s> in a court of appeal decision in <e>", "<cs> if it helps the noble lord lord tordoff i would point out that what i said was that in section of the housing act there was a duty on officers to comply with a notice from the secretary of state to produce a document <e> <s> i am advised the minister is much closer to the detail of the legislation that that was repealed in the housing and building control act which was given royal assent last week <e> <s> am i talking about the same thing or is it possible to misinterpret it differently to suit ones purpose <e>", "<cs> that is fine <e> <s> we need clarification <e> <s> i do not intend to press the matter to a division <e> <s> i rest my case on the basis that this refers to all the information that the minister would want <e> <s> the minister was very careful not to specify the kind of information that could not be obtained from a council unless it was withheld wilfully that is a different matter <e> <s> if we are talking about a case where the officer has no information that is not in the possession of the council or where all information in the possession of the officer is the councils information that was the purport of the birmingham case which i quoted then what we are saying is that there is no new information or separate information <e> <s> we are talking about two sources of information one the council and the other the recipient of the councils information that is the officer <e>", "<cs> i know that when i move a freedom of information bill in the future it will be seconded by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> in other words there should be access by everyone to everything excluding the decision-making process the policy-making process <e> <s> as i say

main point which is that there is no need for clause if the government do not intend to be malicious in their actions in respect of not only the glc but also the metropolitan areas on this particular point <e> <s> the updating of the greater london development plan has been going on for two or three years and its timetable was agreed by the department of the environment <e> <s> my information is that it will be deposited with the department in july though in fact mid-august has been mentioned <e> <s> there will be a period of about two years until after april during which the matter can proceed <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot understand why the government think that it is better to have separate structure plans for the boroughs instead of one structure plan for the whole of

baroness <e> <s> of course i shall give way at an appropriate time unless the noble baroness wants to point out that the governments motive is political <e> <s> if the case is to be made that it is a political act and not a legislative or planning act then we would be moving a little closer to a real argument on the matter <e> <s> i am not raising this from the point of view of the political content of the structure plan i am simply arguing that clause is unnecessary <e> <s> of course i shall give way <e>", "<cs> i do not doubt for a moment that in the preparation and completion of a structure plan there will be differences even on party <e>", "<cs> if the existing structure plan is many years old and will not be altered for many years to come if londoners are satisfied that the overview of how greater london ought to be planned should be left in that way until the separate boroughs come to their separate ways of planning their separate bits and if that is what we mean by local democracy then that may satisfy the people but the result may be something which historians will look back on and consider a disgrace from a land-use planning point of view <e> <s> in view of the situation and the unsatisfactory nature of the government reply i give notice that at a more appropriate time we intend to come back and vigorously pursue these matters <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not for the first time the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has put her finger on the argument <e> <s> it is that the glc and other authorities are doing things which they ought not be to doing for instance they ought not to be helping to create jobs <e> <s> she would say that that is somebody elses job it is not the job of local government <e> <s> it ought not <e>", "<cs> she said that local government was spending money on things on which it ought not to be spending money <e>", "<cs> not at the moment <e> <s> i will give way when i am ready <e> <s> i did not understand <e>", "<cs> save jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister had the opportuntiy of looking at the survey carried out by the local government council <e> <s> its main conclusions are that the number of authorities examining privatisation has dwindled and that the vast majority of those examining it have rejected it <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister in the spirit of giving freedom to local councils like he did yesterday in reducing the quorum for councils and also giving directions on discretionary grants would give a direction to those councils which have gone private not only to publish their experience but to publish it against the promises that they accepted all too glibly from private contractors <e>", "<cs> my lords might i declare an interest in that more than years ago i was proud to march behind a royal marines band as a royal marine <e> <s> at that time the royal marines bands were looked upon with pride <e> <s> since then they have not only brought pride but great profit to this country not least in respect of the tourist attractions that they provide <e> <s> will the minister not listen very carefully to the powerful case that is being made by the noble baroness lady vickers recognise that she has allies all round the house and draw the proper conclusion and act accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to begin my contribution by joining in the thanks that we all have for the noble lord lord wells-pestell for giving us the opportunity this evening to take part in this debate and to congratulate him on the excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by echoing the words of the noble lord lord skelmersdale in saying that there will be no opposition or undue delay in putting this bill on the statute book <e> <s> however i was concerned by the latter part of the noble lords speech when he said that in the time available it might not be proper or possible to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am grateful <e> <s> he keeps saying that local authorities do not need new powers <e> <s> what they need is new money they need the resources <e> <s> is the minister acknowledging that the tenants in properties at present owned by councils are entitled to the same benefit that is better housing and security of mind <e> <s> the release for these people is that they can get out or have the house improved <e> <s> we are saying that the same right and relief should he given to council tenants <e> <s> i am sure that councils would want to do it <e> <s> the enormity of the global sums frightens anyone <e> <s> the minister should be a little bit more sympathetic to the inability of councils to do what he says they have got the opportunity of doing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i promise that this will be my last intervention <e> <s> i understand what he is saying <e> <s> suppose an authority is faced suddenly with the reality of having to solve the problem of the private owner plus what is laid upon it by law <e> <s> it may be that without that it would have been making a bid in a hip allocation of say million and perhaps getting million <e> <s> then along comes an obligation to find million or million more for this particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a preemption right <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the minister has introduced this continuation order in a serious and sober fashion not that we should expect this minister to introduce it in any other way <e> <s> he has reminded the house that in the context of how parliament exercises control over the armed forces this order is of some importance <e> <s> downgraded from a bill laid before parliament every year until there is no quibble about the present procedure of a quinquennial review and up-dating tonight still provides members of both houses with the right and the duty to scrutinise the disciplinary codes governing conduct in the armed forces <e> <s> we do this not only against the background of our own concepts our own attitudes our own intelligence and what is brought to our attention but also against the background of the report and recommendations of the select committee on defence to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> in another place my honourable friend mr denzil davies asked i believe with effect a number of questions some of which were answered some of which were not <e> <s> as the minister will have read other honourable friends of mine took part in the very lively debate which was held a week ago in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful and i accept what is said by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i remember that in the select committee the level was referred to as less than one in and some satisfaction was expressed <e> <s> phrases were used to the effect that at least we were better than most other national forces <e> <s> whether or not we are better by comparision with publicly declared known drug abuse in other forces we are primarily concerned with what is happening here <e> <s> i should like to be reassured by the noble lord the minister that within the constraints of finance everything possible is being done <e> <s> that is why <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made it quite clear that the purpose of the amendment is to negative any attempts by a council <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house can the minister be a little more specific about the circumstances in which these powers will operate <e> <s> for example if what we are now talking about becomes an act of parliament can the minister tell us by precisely how much a quorum will be reduced <e> <s> if the minister says that it depends or that we shall have to wait and see or that we shall have to anticipate are we to await upon the intention of a councillor or of many of them not to turn up at a council meeting in order to take a decision <e> <s> in other words can the minister tell us what will be the trigger <e>", "<cs> my lords more than once the minister has said that we have been over this ground before <e> <s> these questions have been asked at second reading <e> <s> the questions have been asked but no answers have been given <e> <s> the minister says that it is not possible to give answers to certain of the questions but i invite him to look forward to the situation when the alterations take place the dust dies down the figures are produced and the ratepayers are faced by a bill which is infinitely more costly than what is paid now <e> <s> the minister cannot tell us that it will not be so as he is unwilling to give us any figures <e> <s> i imagine that people will then say we dont like that <e> <s> lets go back to where we were before <e> <s> one of the premises upon which the abolition case has been built is that ratepayers money is being wasted in a range of ways <e> <s> never mind the way in which grants are given the whole bureaucracy is wasteful <e> <s> when the secretary of state announced his intentions in these matters he was not as coy as the minister is now on one of the main planks <e> <s> one of the main planks was that this would save money <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to withdraw the amendment but can the minister reiterate that which i believe he has implied and which his noble friend lord bellwin indicated during the last session <e> <s> if no consultation has taken place because it has not been requested and in view of the noises that were made that the minister will be happy to see that consultations take place with those who wish to take part will the minister confirm that it is his understanding that the staff commission outwith any obligation in the bill will be prepared to consult that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we stopped at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there was a reference to amendment no <e> <s> before we

mottistone makes a fair point in saying that one can look at this either way and either way there is likely to be chagrin on the part of one party or the other <e> <s> all we say is that we would prefer to run the risk of having to move fast if it took place in october <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone is <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to withdraw the amendments but there is a big difference in approach as to the next months <e> <s> the government are clearly working on the premise that they have taken for granted the outcome of parliamentary procedures <e> <s> they are assuming that their legislation will be approved and they are entitled to do that <e> <s> they have their majorities in both houses <e>", "<cs> i am speaking of as recently as i can remember and it hurts <e> <s> therefore they are fully entitled to work on the premise that that which they consider to be proper and good legislation will be carried <e> <s> equally we are entitled to work on the premise that until both houses have had the opportunity of examining the bill in detail and using all legitimate parliamentary procedures which are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the explanation <e> <s> i confess quite readily that part of the nexus of this argument is delay <e> <s> there is a punishment <e> <s> there is a detriment to the delay which the noble lord lord mottistone pointed out <e> <s> things can be done hurriedly and perhaps in an angrier frame of mind with less time <e> <s> we are attempting to delay in this context <e> <s> but the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has demonstrated the use of remembering what political opponents have said by reminding me of earlier arguments <e> <s> i have a little book full of quotes made by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes which from time to time i intend to use <e> <s> in these <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord evans of claughton certainly poses the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that promise though the noble lord has given nothing away i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my intention to press these amendments to a vote but i think that all that the minister has said is rather sad <e> <s> all that the glc is seeking to do is to keep in existence something which could very well be seen by its successors if indeed there are to be successors as appropriate <e> <s> the minister in fact gave the game away by seeking to point out two elements which are included in the plan the policy for women and community areas <e>", "<cs> my lords why not have an election <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall withdraw the amendment but in my view the minister all too blithely is making assumptions about the speed if not the ease with which the transfer will take place <e> <s> for instance may i draw his attention to the situation in west yorkshire <e> <s> an examination of the current size of the five districts in west yorkshire reveals that it may be necessary to redraw the district boundaries to reflect the enhanced functions envisaged after <e> <s> many options would be available <e> <s> should calderdale and bradford be combined and also leeds and wakefield to make more viable units with <e>", "<cs> in order to be helpful to the minister who i know wants to be helpful to the committee and to those who are concerned may i make an additional comment to augment those made by my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> what we are worried about in this clause and also in these amendments is quite frankly the dilemma which faces not only the government but particularly local authorities <e> <s> we made the general case at second reading that the designation places an unfair burden on local authorities <e> <s> we shall have arguments and perhaps more news about that later <e> <s> the dilemma for local authorities quite frankly is this <e> <s> while they are not looking for trouble when people are in trouble like the minister on this particular point they are anxious to try to meet the case <e>", "<cs> shortly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for repeating that more than once <e> <s> i promise i shall try to avoid the necessity for him to do it again <e> <s> it is interesting that the authorities we consult say that although when discussions take place their point of view is taken on board they are baffled when the allocations are made <e> <s> they are unable to identify within the global sums allocated to them a figure which takes account of any particular circumstance <e>", "<cs> we are not talking about a tenant we are talking about an owner-occupier <e> <s> if we are concerned about the interests of tenants then of course we are concerned about the local authority because the people we are concerned with in this bill are people who once were tenants <e> <s> they exercised their right to buy <e> <s> they did so in the knowledge of <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief and i do not expect the minister to reply <e> <s> i certainly take the point not that we are covering uncharted territory but that there will be circumstances which the minister and his colleagues anticipate and some which they do not anticipate <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the minister when he said that there may well be cases in respect of which matters will not work out as they intend <e> <s> i asked the minister for an illustration and he gave the illustration of the compulsory purchase order where the follow through was not the purpose for which the bill <e>", "<cs> like the noble viscount lord hanworth we consider this amendment helpful but i wonder whether we can pursue the possibilities <e> <s> i am very much concerned with the opportunity for a councils direct labour organisation to be involved in these matters <e> <s> can the minister and his advisers address themselves to the situation of a council which has a direct labour organisation which is carrying out work to one of its own properties which is next to a council house which comes within the provisions of this bill in other words which has been sold and which requires reinstatement work to be carried out <e> <s> can the minister deal with that situation <e>", "<cs> there is only one point i should like to raise <e> <s> will the minister recall the illustrations i gave of the southcote residents association in reading who have been in touch on a range of matters <e> <s> i am sure that they will have seen some relief in this bill <e> <s> i recalled as the minister was speaking that one of the points they raised dealt with the situation of a person who has to leave a property while it is being reinstated and the costs he faces through having to leave <e> <s> it may well be that the person would be housed in some other council accommodation but even if he were consequential costs could fall on him <e> <s> the minister is painting an attractive picture to the effect that if a person buys a house for and finds it is defective under the bill he is entitled to plead with the authority for either reinstatement or repurchase <e> <s> the minister is saying that in certain circumstances a person having lived in a reasonable house ought to be reasonably well looked after <e>", "<cs> the noble lord tempts me at this time of night <e> <s> but i have been round the tea rooms quietly and there are more of them than there are of us and there are very few of them <e> <s> it is an interesting proposition that many local authorities who genuinely accept the equity of the need to designate where the minister has not designated will be literally torn in their discussions as to their need to look after their local people and the additional burdens that will be borne upon them <e> <s> the minister rests on this on the premise that the houses that have the defects were taken on a narrow local basis and therefore the local people or years later as the general taxpayers in need of housing will have to pay more of the burden <e> <s> it is rather sad and it is one of the unhappy aspects because although the right to designate locally is provided for in the bill because of the need to look after other interests as well as the shortage of money i forecast that very few authorities will add that additional burden to the load they are already carrying <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i picked up very carefully that it is the governments firm intention and i understand that the noble lord is unable to accept the amendment because it changes the very nature of the commitment from being discretionary <e> <s> but in effect the minister has defined discretionary in such a way that i am sure those outside the committee will understand that there will be very rare exceptions if any at all under which an exception would be involved <e> <s> i am not putting words into the ministers mouth i am using those words myself <e> <s> i am very happy indeed to accept the reassurance that the noble lord gives that the fears which have been expressed to me may very well be groundless <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i want to say immediately that i fully share the satisfaction of the noble lord lord sandford with the manner in which the minister and his colleagues have sought to go a considerable way on this aspect of the bill <e> <s> i think it has been done genuinely on the basis of looking at the special inequity that would flow to authorities who through no fault of their own not having bought the houses and not having had any capital receipts are faced with what we consider to be some of the liabilities <e>", "<cs> with that assurance which i accept is very fair and clear i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i respond to what may very well have been a misunderstanding arising from my earlier remarks <e> <s> when the hip allocation is made the ministry which means the officials need to be satisfied what it is that the bid is designed to meet <e> <s> there may be a bid of million for instance <e> <s> they will need to ask what do you intend to spend the money on <e> <s> the council may reply that it has a problem with three big council estates which need completely rewiring and that together with work on two other estates million is needed for that <e> <s> the council may also have a need to take account of other repairs and to build certain houses <e> <s> in this instance the council may need to take account of the fact that it has so many houses which are defective <e> <s> the council may need million for those purposes <e> <s> in addition it may need to make allowance for improvement grants <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e> <s> when a local authority asks me where it is to get the money from <e> <s> i shall answer you have already had it <e> <s> if it was built into this years hip and it was possible to forecast the extent to which it was needed then in effect local authorities have already had in this years hip a notional figure based on a hypothesis <e> <s> let us hope it was right <e> <s> in that circumstance there is no need for this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> does the minister recall that it is less than two years since the then secretary of state was criticising councils for not planning ahead and spending on capital projects and was urging capital commitments which must be serviced and provided for <e> <s> will the minister acknowledge that overwhelmingly local government has conformed with government control of capital expenditure <e> <s> will the minister comment on and contrast the record of local government in keeping to its budget and targets and confirm that it has a far better record than central government especially this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has very properly been reminded that the language that he used in respect of no change was certainly sufficent to be effectively challenged by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord of what the prime minister wrote in a letter to the ama less than two years ago <e> <s> she wrote <e>", "<cs> first may i express appreciation for the support that the amendment has received from the other benches in your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord lord mayhew used the phrase what can the government be afraid of <e> <s> i had already asked what can be lost by having this <e> <s> the minister has indicated that what would be lost would be the ministers ability to proceed without as full a disclosure and as full a public comment by those who are interested in the nitty-gritty and the details as might be made in this matter <e> <s> the minister must know that one of the prime functions of parliament is to expose to the public gaze matters which might otherwise not be sufficiently made known to others outside this place <e> <s> the other noble lords who have spoken have said quite fairly that the principles upon which the bill received its second and third readings and passed from another place to here were that although they will be challenged the reality of parliamentary arithmetic quite clearly indicates that it will make progress <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply is wholly unsatisfactory and not acceptable because at the beginning he indicated quite rightly that the whole purport of the views on this side of the committee is that there is a unity not merely an <e>", "<cs> objection <e>", "<cs> i accept completely that the minister has sought to give assurances in the absence of these amendments <e> <s> first he has sought to assure the taxpayer and the public that there are mechanisms which will ensure that as far as they are concerned these assets which eventually are to be sold will be sold at a fair price <e> <s> secondly he has sought to assure those who purchase that the price at which the assets will be offered is a fair price <e> <s> however the minister will be well aware of the comparatively enormous sums of money which are made by other people who are involved in the business of the flotation of shares <e> <s> one can easily see valuations placed upon assets to be sold which take into account the costs which have to be borne by the money market and those who deal in it <e> <s> we have seen millions and millions of pounds paid and added to the asset value <e>", "<cs> if it will assist the committee in the light of what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would take on board the suggestion that there need not be a difference between us here <e> <s> we on this side of the committee want to see those words written into the bill because they are so clear <e> <s> i am not at all certain whether the minister could come up with different words which mean precisely the same thing but perhaps the minister would take this matter on board before the next stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond will do what he wishes and we are at one with him as regards the argument <e> <s> but if the minister says that there is no difference as to how it will work in practice and that professional valuers will be used even though they may be called something different then we would want to see the colour of the money we would want to see precisely what it is <e>", "<cs> before the matter is put to the vote perhaps i can simply say to the minister that there could be few amendments that have been tabled in your lordships committee that he could more safely accept even though he may not like to accept it in order to demonstrate that the government are willing to acknowledge from time to time that they have not got it absolutely right <e>", "<cs> with the agreement of the house i wonder if we could discuss amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is broadly similar in context <e> <s> the operative word is broadly <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister rises to reply i wonder whether i might raise two points <e> <s> i can see nothing wrong quite frankly with including the words of the amendment of the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i am also intrigued to hear from the noble lord the minister that the employees have been fully consulted <e> <s> i am certain that the ministers words will be read with care by the employers <e> <s> part of the consultation process

minister of state said <e>", "<cs> never <e>", "<cs> before i say that i do not wish to move amendment no <e> <s> i should like simply to give a clear indication that we will return to this at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said more than once that the plans of the government have been well-known for a considerable time i do not imagine that anyone including the government will have anticipated the decisions of your lordships house earlier today <e> <s> it is quite clear from what the minister said that the original plans were that the royal assent to this bill would have been achieved before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin as have all other speakers by thanking the minister most sincerely for the care he has taken in preparing for the debate and for the lucid manner in which he has explained a matter which frankly as one who is not as attached to the farming industry as are many other noble lords i found baffling when i read through the regulations <e> <s> judging from my contacts i believe that the minister has fairly described what he has presented to us as drastic action of a radical nature <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i believe that regrettably many outside this house will have to accept the logic of what the minister has said <e> <s> would the minister not also take on board that as a consequence not least of exhortations from ministers in all governments and we are talking about the recent past considerable sums of money have been invested <e> <s> what i am asking the minister to do not of course from the dispatch box today is to consider very carefully the idea that i put forward that <e> <s> where <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has indicated that there is no evidence

received from the greater london enterprise board and i am sure that the noble baroness has received the same information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the persons who hold those jobs consider them to be real <e> <s> the noble baroness of course introduces the pejorative interpretation which she wishes to place on the nature of the jobs and that is rather sad <e> <s> the jobs which have been saved were real jobs before gleb took an interest and saved them <e> <s> there has been much scurrilous talk without any foundation <e> <s> i am not saying that there is no foundation to such remarks but what are the facts <e> <s> when people cast aspersions on the integrity of councillors and on their political motivation we are entitled to some substantiation at least <e>", "<cs> my

grip as they possibly can on the control of ratepayers money <e> <s> what we are asking the government to consider is whether in their haste to enact these amendments to the bill they have got it

are both about is marrying imperatives <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie poses the problem and dilemma not only for the farmer but also for the community <e> <s> when the noble lord lord mackie of benshie asks me what the orkney farmer will do i have a shrewd idea that he knows better than i what the orkney farmer not only would like to do but what he wants to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend appreciates how valuable was his reference to the smith houses in leeds in the context of the current consideration by the government <e> <s> my honourable friend mr terry davis the member of parliament for hodge hill has been attempting to persuade the minister that as an additional system to be added to the designated the smith houses ought to be represented <e> <s> the minister is indicating that he is not too certain whether there is a national rather than a local aspect to this <e> <s> the reference by my noble friend lord dean of beswick that there are smith houses in leeds should considerably strengthen the case for including smith houses as an additional case for designation <e>", "<cs> my lords the argument of the minister in another place in hesitating about or not including smith houses was that he was not too sure that the smith house illustration in birmingham represented a national situation rather than a special local built-on-shale situation <e> <s> what my noble friend has been trying to do with some modest success is to demonstrate that smith houses were built on a national scale and the problem is national <e> <s> it was no more than that <e> <s> i just saw the opportunity of reminding the noble lord the minister and those who read the debate that the matter is still open <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just take this very brief opportunity to express the satisfaction of the opposition at least the labour opposition i am certain that if the noble viscount lord hanworth were in his place as he was on second reading and in committee he too would express his satisfaction with this outcome <e> <s> i want sincerely to thank the minister who has been in charge of this bill in this place because he has had the difficult job of reconciling competing claims which he has done to the satisfaction of members on the labour benches and i believe throughout the house <e>", "<cs> say it again <e>", "<cs> without in any way attempting to curtail the debate so far as other noble lords are concerned i should like to comment on two points the minister has raised <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> proposes that the current intention to limit the total amount to million should be increased <e> <s> the second amendment asks the minister to place the proper emphasis on education <e> <s> if we set aside the first amendment which really counters what the noble lord the minister said in respect of the total sum not being increased then the second amendment is not asking for more money <e> <s> in that amendment we ask the government to join with us in establishing the importance of education to the extent that we believe it ought not to be left as one of or objectives <e>", "<cs> i echo the last words of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> many people will be disappointed that when a minister has carefully explained precisely what the removal of the prohibition means it has not meant as much as that which it has been beefed up to appear to be <e> <s> the minister began by pointing out that the wording of the amendment could mean anything because in fact it says <e>", "<cs> to tidy up the debate i am sure that the minister has tried to be helpful and to the extent that he has been helpful in effect he has now said that it is commercial activity but not any commercial activity the very point that i latched upon <e> <s> to that extent my inclusion of the word any which was the peg which he used to criticise the amendment i think could be amended at report stage and that that would take care of one point <e> <s> as to the ministers abhorrence of seeking to give directions to the cda in these matters we shall have an interesting debate on the extent to which the minister having said that he abhors giving directions intends to take powers to give directions <e> <s> we shall come to that again at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has an opportunity to do a great service to the co-operative development agency and i shall tell him why <e> <s> we on this side of the committee are as politicians entitled to be suspicious but there are millions of people outside parliament certainly hundreds of thousands of people who genuinely are puzzled about why the minister has chosen to insert gratuitously into the bill after six successful years the power to dissolve literally at the drop of a hat the cda <e> <s> the minister has already fairly said that he cannot envisage such a circumstance arising during the next six years <e> <s> however when pressed the minister gave two reasons which if not spurious are so far-fetched as not to be worthy of being taken into account <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment at this stage of the bill but i think that it is rather sad that the government are not prepared to say even once that there is some merit in any of these amendments and that there is the possibility of coming not to a compromise but to a better drafting which seeks in part to meet the point that we are making <e> <s> our fear is this <e> <s> even after the liablilities have been met contingent or otherwise and one has fairly seen that all of the functions are exercised there may be for instance million available <e> <s> we are talking about that <e> <s> we are not talking about large sums of money <e> <s> million is a large sum of money but we are talking about it in the context of macro-economics <e> <s> what we are saying is that given that there are two choices of where that million should go one is into the consolidated fund where it would be swallowed up like that <e> <s> the other is looking for what was <e>", "<cs> i recall that in another place the minister in charge of the bill eased the minds of the co-operative movement greatly when he said that consultation would take place with representatives of the co-operative movement in the event of a dissolution the record will show that the minister nods his head at least at that statement nothing about the future <e> <s> it could very well be that what we would need to do is to explore the possibilities of full consultation with the minister at the appropriate stage in the event of a dissolution as to the precise ways in which such sums of money as are available are finally dispersed <e> <s> in which case if the minister has the discretion at that stage he may well be persuaded by powerful advocacy from the co-operative movement that there are proper homes other than the consolidated fund to which the monies could go and which would be in conformity with the functions of the agency <e> <s> we have had a good debate we may return to it later <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to join every member of this house who has so far spoken in acknowledging the indebtedness we owe to the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> not for the first time has he perceived a good opportunity for a debate even though i believe that the gloves must still remain on at this stage until one sees the air clear <e> <s> i believe that in every debate there is room for at least one who is not an expert and i claim that place in this debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e> <s> i know both gentlemen and i believe that they are prospective ministers <e> <s> i take the point that there are conventions and certainly i accept at once that i was confused as to the precise nature of what it was that i could say except of course that members more than once spoke in another place of the difficulty of reconciling the remit that was given to the noble lord lord king and to british airways and was accepted by their employees and in fact they have produced the goods <e> <s> one does not want to knock anyone else and that is the last of my intentions but they say we have been given a remit but ministers have said you have done a fine job and now we are going to reward you in a certain way <e>", "<cs> my lords could i try to be helpful to the minister as always <e> <s> i realise that these are opportunities when the minister can be helpful to the house <e> <s> may i just say that seeing for the first time the plethora of requirements which the cosmetics industry needs to comply with to me as a layman they look onerous <e> <s> the minister is going to tell me that it is a piece of cake and of course provided that the ingredients in the cake are satisfactory it will get its proper qualification <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i say that i am very grateful to him for having taken fully on board the purport of my remarks <e> <s> i am satisfied that the ministry is adopting the proper attitude towards this matter <e> <s> in other words one is achieving the maximum that it is possible to achieve within eec constraints and also the maximum that it is possible to enforce sensibly <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it would be for the convenience of the house to take amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time as the amendment moved by the noble lord because they are related <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and i anticipate that yet again the minister may say that the words are unnecessary <e> <s> if they are not contrary to the spirit of the bill we ask the minister to recognise the anxiety which exists in certain quarters and to add the words <e> <s> i can understand should the minister have an intellectual argument against their inclusion and no play upon words is intended <e> <s> if in the proposition there is something that the minister cannot accept that is one thing but if as i think we are likely to be told time and time again it is covered by tupe as referred to in the earlier debate the minister must know that those who are to be involved and affected are dissatisfied with what he believes are adequate protections <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the care he has taken in responding <e> <s> but we are talking about the past <e> <s> the minister is confident that in respect of securing the proper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that stricture because it was never intended that my remarks should be a criticism of how the ordnance factories have operated in the past <e> <s> the noble viscount will at least extend to me the courtesy of taking on board the points i am making <e> <s> my concern is that whatever the imperatives set by the management of the rofs in the past there will be an additional imperative introduced in the management of the rofs in the future and that will be their commercial viability <e> <s> i am not going to knock the national integrity of the defence industry that is not my job <e> <s> i am simply saying that the element will it pay <e> <s> will be introduced in the future whereas it was not there in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister but the fact that the minister sees no reason why that should not be so does not mean that it will be so when the two parties to the contract get around a table <e> <s> in the past there have not been two parties there has been one party substantially the state <e> <s> in future there will be the state and the private management of the rofs <e> <s> there will need to be two to make a contract and two to make an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would say that wouldnt he <e> <s> as far as i am concerned i am not knocking for one moment the past arrangements and the satisfaction with the past arrangements <e> <s> however in the past at the end of the day the government have been the governors they have been able to lay down the arrangements because they have had the muscle <e> <s> after all they are giving the contracts <e> <s> we cannot see why the form of words that we introduce which will strengthen the hand of the government when they come to make the kind of arrangements which the minister has pointed out are perfectly and properly capable of being aimed at and which as the noble lord just pointed out already exist in his knowledge and which i respect is not capable of being accepted <e> <s> therefore i intend to press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> the minister now has a further opportunity to get rid of the unease which is felt on this side of the house <e> <s> we are not uneasy that the minister does not know the timetable and the detail of many matters but we are uneasy at his reluctance to bring this house and those who work in the factories into his confidence <e> <s> we cannot believe that after some months of progress from the queens speech of last year the government do not have a clear idea in their head as to where they want to go <e> <s> of course they have <e> <s> the trouble is that members of this house have not been brought into their confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is correct we shall not press this amendment to a division and take up the time of the house <e> <s> the minister spoke in terms of the contents of the scheme the minutiae of the scheme <e> <s> they may be minutiae to the minister and i but they are matters of very great importance to many other people <e> <s> the minister rejects the charge that he has something to hide we are not making the charge that he has something to hide <e> <s> we are arguing that it would be proper and in accordance with open government if knowing what the minister knows those whose interests are vitally affected were made privy to the scheme at an earlier rather than a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to surprise the minister by saying that i fully understood every word he said <e> <s> to be fair it was a very lucid explanation of the difference between the two sets of circumstances <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> just as he has indicated that one needs to study some of these matters with care what the minister has said on this matter will be studied with care by those outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the ministers intervention <e> <s> as always in these matters the minister is per cent <e> <s> more in possession of the facts than i am but i raise them because we are talking in terms of protection for employees not merely at bishopton but at other places <e> <s> the minister will be aware that at the rofs at birtley chorley and blackburn there are other rumours circulating that as a consequence of bishopton and other factors redundancies including those at bishopton could very well total <e> <s> rof employees are in the situation where their interests are affected by this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and do not intend to press this matter to a division <e> <s> that does not mean to say that this debate has not been valuable or that it is exhausted <e> <s> i have been at pains to have the minister say in precise terms that the terms under which an employee is compensated for redundancy will remain the same after vesting day as before <e> <s> the minister has sought to reassure me by pointing out that the same contract and the same terms will be transferred <e> <s> but it is perfectly possible that the new company which is not the old management will take a different view <e> <s> the minister says that that can only be done at the risk to the company of industrial disputes <e> <s> that could of course very well be the avenue which employees may collectively have to explore after vesting day <e> <s> the minister can fairly say that up until vesting day the government can control matters but that after vesting day <e> <s> they cannot do so <e> <s> we are arguing that the minister has a responsibility to ensure by some mechanism by writing on the face of the bill that after vesting day such protection is written in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister ought to recognise that given the authority of parliament the passage of this bill vesting day and all the other paraphernalia which will be absolute then these things will be done <e> <s> if i am properly advised that the better passage of the transfer is being inhibited somewhat by the present management of the rofs in satisfying the trade union negotiators <e> <s> who wish to protect their members then of course the vesting day will happen and that will be the end of it <e> <s> but the government will be responsible for having stood aside and not ensuring as they have the power and authority to do now that the trade unions will be able to say to their members <e> <s> not only have we got the best deal that we can but we have achieved a proper settlement of your fears <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my intention to withdraw the amendment but i am appalled at the ministers belief that leaving the trade unions to press their case as they are fully capable of doing will resolve the matter <e> <s> at the end of the day if they are not as satisfied as is the minister that the bill and the arrangements under tupe fully meet their <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful but we are talking about making clearer the continuation of the existing negotiating and arbitration rights and procedures <e> <s> the minister tells us that he is satisfied that in so far as the people concerned are covered by their membership of existing civil service provisions they shall continue <e> <s> what the unions tell us is that they are experiencing great difficulty in trying to spell out these matters though perhaps not in the bill itself <e> <s> we are here tonight because we are told that the normal process that one should expect that is understandings translated into words which can then be used afterwards is not forthcoming <e> <s> so we are forced to the clumsy device of having to write into the bill what we recognise is a poor substitute for the normal and sensible way of making progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that i feel like pressing the amendment but whether or not i shall is another matter <e> <s> the minister really dodges the issue <e> <s> if an employee wherever he works and whatever the justice or equity of what he is enjoying may be is to have his benefits diminished by the transfer of his employer from the state to the private sector he is entitled to say i am entitled to continue to enjoy that which i have <e> <s> other people are entitled to say you had a benefit <e> <s> beyond that i believe the minister used the term good industrial practice <e> <s> in other words it is not normally prudent in some circumstances for that particular benefit to be enjoyed in the generality <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is entitled to feel weary at having to make the same case or put forward the same defence again <e> <s> i thought that we had come to an understanding about the reason for that <e> <s> the minister can rest assured that if it had been the more proper procedure we could have had a speech on this amendment just as long as that on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the geneses of the solutions posed in both instances hang together <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and attempted to spell out how the future organisation of the policing of the rofs should take place <e> <s> the minister is rightly a little touchy about the criticisms made not of himself but of the general oversight and of course of his government <e> <s> he has failed completely to answer the charge that i make that a great deal of the departments attitude to past and future policing of the rofs has more to do with saving money than the security of the establishments <e> <s> i make that charge quite seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very grave charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may feel that it is without foundation <e> <s> i rest my case partly on the views of the defence police federation which i quoted <e> <s> we see other moves and manoeuvres by the government to seek savings <e> <s> we may be told that the same criteria for reducing manpower levels do not apply and i will certainly argue that point at length on some other occasion with the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his careful explanation <e> <s> i point out that it was not exactly a try on <e> <s> we recognised that there was an unusual feature about the proposal <e> <s> however in view of the fact that the minister appoints all of the members of the cda we believe that he shares our very high regard for the performance and stature of the two principal officers ralph woolf the chairman and george jones the chief executive and all other members <e> <s> we have supreme confidence not only that they are responsible but also that they would want to take fully into account anything that the government said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i have often said that if the minister says something does no harm there is no reason why we should not accept it <e> <s> i listened to what the minister said <e> <s> when i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his concluding remark that he cannot see any circumstances in which this power would need to be used <e> <s> earlier in his speech he sought to give us an instance in which it might be used <e> <s> it was very interesting <e> <s> he asked us to suppose that the cda in pursuit of its functions had spent its that years tranche and had other work to do that it was unable to fund <e> <s> in those circumstances and i think the <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been moved but it will be moved separately later <e> <s> we are taking amendments nos <e> <s> and at this stage and then there will be a brief reference to no <e> <s> in order to be technically clear and correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for taking the opportunity time after time when we raise the spectre of winding-up to point out that he has no intention of winding-up except in exceptional circumstances that he cannot envisage <e> <s> the more often we raise it and the more he says it the more satisfied ought to be the people outside <e> <s> but we cannot get him to say it unless we raise it and having raised it he keeps on saying it <e> <s> i certainly accept that the spirit of what he has said is fully understood and i shall not pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has done us all a great service and not least a great service to the government in taking the steps which have led to the debate that we have all enjoyed over the past hour or so <e> <s> in doing so he has demonstrated his grasp of the subject sufficiently so to impress me and i suspect many who have been here tonight <e> <s> of course he would say immediately that his task has not so much been to impress us but to try to bring some influence to bear on the decisions of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like fully to support the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> this is a very reasonable and moderate amendment <e> <s> we agree completely with much of what has been said as regards the genesis of the bill or the philosophy behind it <e> <s> we are agin it <e> <s> but this amendment is not talking about the bill it is talking about the minister coming to the house once a year and telling us the progress or otherwise that he has made in disposing of the assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> the minister may well have absolute confidence that when parliament sees the detail of the scheme or schemes it will be satisfied <e> <s> however he is saying that whether it is satisfied or not parliament will then have agreed to the principle of the transference of the assets in one way or the other <e> <s> if the minister is also saying that that for which we are asking is not only unusual but even unique may i say that i am not just talking about the employees or the national interest i am talking about the interests of parliamentarians <e> <s> we do not want to clutter up the order paper but we want to see that as often as possible we are kept advised on how this scheme evolves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for the robust defence that he has put up of the words that he used <e> <s> i accept completely that after vesting day we are in a new ball game <e> <s> that worries us <e> <s> prior to vesting day the minister is wholly in charge <e> <s> for instance he is wholly in charge at this moment of what rof management is saying now <e> <s> if prior to vesting day that is at this moment the management of the rofs are saying and one hears this second and third hand that they have heard what the minister has said but they do not intend to operate in that way then it is a very serious state of affairs <e> <s> it does not give the trade unions much confidence <e> <s> although the minister in good faith and his civil servants and advisers have been most constructive with the unions in trying to get together a package which will get us through the next period the unions do not have much confidence that once they are thrown to the wolves the words of the minister unless they are embodied in an act of parliament will offer a great deal of protection <e>", "<cs> steady on <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the proceedings in this house in fact in the dying moments of the passage of this bill we have the opportunity to reflect on its changed shape <e> <s> before i do so on behalf of my colleagues i want to pay a warm tribute to the noble lord lord trefgarne the minister in charge of the bill <e> <s> he has dealt both expeditiously and courteously with all the matters that have been raised from these benches <e> <s> we are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i rise to support the very reasonable amendment which has been moved by my noble friend lady nicol <e> <s> more than once during the passage of this bill the minister has told the house that he has some difficulty in giving illustrations as to why certain powers are being sought but nevertheless he said that it is better to have them than not to have them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take a little of the time of the house by first expressing our appreciation echoing the words of my noble friend lord bruce of the unfailing courtesy of the minister in piloting this bill through the house <e> <s> at all times he has tried to be helpful <e> <s> very often he was unable to be helpful but at all times he tried <e> <s> the fact that there have been proscriptions upon spelling out what we wanted him to spell out did not stop us from time to time trying to get him to do just that <e> <s> i speak from these benches not with the authority but with experience of the co-operative moment primarily the consumer co-operative movement <e> <s> i can certainly tell the minister that the view that is held in the consumer co-operative movement is that we value the extension of the life of the cda recognising as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has said that there are many ways in which the co-operative idea can be applied <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very briefly to intervene and i apologise for not having put my name down on the list and given the minister notice <e> <s> my noble friend lord glenamara has on more than one occasion during the current year raised on the floor of the house the special problems of the students at newcastle polytechnic <e> <s> in his unavoidable absence today he would have liked to be here i shall raise some points that he would have wished to make in the debate upon which i should be very grateful if the minister could perhaps reply to my noble friend direct <e> <s> my noble friend will certainly be reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this house would not countenance administrative inconvenience <e> <s> i am also sure that the house accepts that this was one of the prime reasons for the change in the system by the government <e> <s> if however one of the consequences of the change is to cause the kind of hardship which i have illustrated the government must surely recognise that change for purely administrative convenience may drive away good students from universities or as my noble friend lady david pointed out induce students to look more closely at universities which are nearer to where they live though they may not be the right universities for the kind of studies they wish to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying to the noble lord who has just spoken that there is no challenge from this side that there is any constitutional impropriety in what the government are doing and we were at pains to point out that there is no constitutional impropriety in what we are seeking to do <e> <s> in other words we are saying to the government that in this debate we have not sought to argue the merits <e> <s> we have argued and we have lost <e> <s> the parliamentary arithmetic stands up pretty well in both houses <e> <s> we are not arguing about the principle that has gone <e> <s> we are arguing about the opportunity which the government have and which they decline to take of taking parliament into their confidence treating it with a little more respect and simply saying to us although we are intending to do something before we do so this is what we intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase airline competition policy is reasonably precise and the report from the civil aviation authority dealt substantially with a range of matters understood to be contained within that phrase <e> <s> but as has been demonstrated by previous speakers notably by the noble baroness lady burton who time after time serves the best interests not only of this house but of millions of other people who are the travelling public it is not just a question of privatising or not of route allocations of market penetration of predatory or monopolistic pricing <e> <s> it is in its effect very much about the welfare of passengers the consumers of airline services <e> <s> of all the groups or categories of air passengers carried by our airlines in both the domestic and international spheres

am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes play with the expenditure of the glc on putting forward its case against abolition and he makes his views quite clear <e> <s> he then goes on to say that the government have no money to put the counter-case <e> <s> surely the noble lord is not unaware that in recent weeks the government have spent much more money than the glc in putting their case on both the rate capping and the abolition <e> <s> the noble lord ought to be more careful before he makes such sweeping statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in the knowledge that everyone who has spoken from these benches has spoken with considerable experience and authority in local government <e> <s> i do not make the charge that other benches are bereft of experience in local government far from it <e> <s> but we on these benches take with a pinch of salt being lectured by ministers ex-ministers and academics on the reality of local government as they see it from

years experience there are others with a great deal more <e> <s> what we bring to this debate is our experience of course our emotion and our party bias and invective <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for misunderstanding the drift of the noble lords argument <e> <s> if we are talking in terms of qualifications we should look at the net result of properly qualified people <e> <s> at the same time

service <e> <s> i have with me a cutting from the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the minister that when he spoke on this matter on th october he told the house that the prime consideration had

that all of the applicants or more than one of the applicants comply with those criteria will the minister not agree that it would be in the best national interest that the ultimate criterion ought to be that which provides most british jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support my noble friend lord stoddart who spoke from the labour front bench in saying kind words about the speed of the government once they recognised and it was drawn to their attention that inadvertently a number of very small people in this particular field could very well be placed at a disadvantage <e> <s> i do not have a direct interest to declare other than that as an active member of the co-operative movement <e> <s> i am always interested in consumer affairs particularly any concerning the co-operative

being denied proper resources to spend money on housing the homeless and adequately looking after the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear to me that a consequence of the economic policies being

chancellor responded to the sense of what i was trying to say <e> <s> i am disappointed that he feels that my amendments would be too onerous or too costly <e> <s> i can understand although i do not accept his argument that the amendments are not necessary because there are means whereby the public and parliament can be made aware of the activities of the council other than by laying it down as a duty <e>", "<cs> i am not disappointed because i appreciate that there was not exactly a dilemma in my mind but a dichotomy in the very fresh legislation by which we are trying to ensure that the council is given clear advice from parliament as to what we consider its functions ought to be because one of the powers that we are giving to the council is to prescribe in the subsection what it is that we are saying should happen <e> <s> yet by the same merit as i understand it and the committee will appreciate that i am a million miles away from the familiarity which the noble and learned lord and others in this committee have with the legal profession similar power to prescribe is in other legislation which affects solicitors and to my knowledge is not activated <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is absolutely right <e> <s> what he has just said on the record is sufficient for me and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not to be sneezed at my lords <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the matter but i am intrigued by the fact that in schedule the government in presenting the bill have gone out of their way to lay down that <e>", "<cs> in view of the final statement by the noble and learned lord i am satisfied and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is even worse than that because in trying to be helpful i pointed out that there was a group of amendments from amendment no <e> <s> down to amendment no <e> <s> excluding amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> those amendments dealt with two points the first one of which was the proper peg for amendment no <e> <s> which i moved in relation to deleting the defendant <e> <s> the next group which i would have dealt with when that point was out of the way related to costs and

conveyancer and those amendments that seek to delete the word fees and insert the word costs <e> <s> i understand that if i withdraw these amendments the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will consider this matter further and perhaps at the next stage either in his name or mine there will be further progress <e> <s> if that is the clear understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my amendments are not moved on the clear understanding given by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> more than once he used the expression may be <e> <s> that was a clear indication that he was not wholly satisfied that the drafting before us is absolutely right <e> <s> all that i have sought to do is to raise some questions <e> <s> if they are answered either in writing or by conversations which lead to further amendments at the next stage i shall certainly understand the spirit in which the noble and learned lord has responded to the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> on the basis of equity and parallel treatment the noble lord has drawn to my attention a facility which could very well be extended to the new profession or trade of licensed conveyancer <e> <s> to that extent i am very pleased to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister prevail upon his right honourable friend to desist from considering imposing vat on newsprint where it could have catastrophic consequences not least for local newspapers with the prospect of jobs and more than weekly newspapers going to the wall <e>", "<cs> i rise to counsel caution in respect of accepting this amendment <e> <s> i do so with some temerity because the case that has been made by my noble and learned friend was well-founded and reasonable <e> <s> what we are talking about is the establishment of a new procedure <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon in his final words felt that that was the appropriate moment to introduce the procedures in this amendment <e> <s> however i would remind the committee that the genesis for the whole idea of a private registry is contained in amendment no <e> <s> and particularly at the top of page of the bill <e> <s> at the top of page there is reference to the relevant amount which will remain as registerable at <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will well remember the announcements in late that it was his intention to raise that figure from to <e> <s> this was done primarily in order to reduce the staff that were then needed to maintain a registry at that level <e> <s> he will recall that the credit-granting agencies and businesses pointed out what they considered to be the consequences of being denied access to information on debts between and that has been registered being denied to them <e> <s> the noble lord lord chelmer and i took a small deputation to see the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> arising from that i understand that over the past months substantial progress has been made and we now have the registry virtually in existence <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first of all to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> but is he not aware that this is an extraordinary statement <e> <s> is he aware that he has completely failed to justify the massive use of civilian and military police to deal with this situation <e> <s> to use military police and an unspecified number of civilian police to deal with peaceful unarmed civilians is surely overkill in the extreme <e> <s> what in actual fact has been the estimated cost of this operation <e> <s> in his statement the minister made a number of remarks which i invite him to substantiate <e> <s> he indicated that these actions have been taken because it was unacceptable to continue the serious inconvenience to local people <e> <s> does the minister care to spell out what inconvenience to local people has occurred which merits such an extraordinary use of military and civilian police <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the fact that besides military personnel inside the perimeter there were civilian police outside <e> <s> i asked him whether he could say how many civilian police were involved in the operation <e> <s> i assume that he will be able to tell me that now <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers in this debate i want to begin by acknowledging the debt that we owe to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> lord renton is not merely a noble lord but as far as i am concerned he is also a noble friend <e> <s> in another place over a number of years he has joined with me or i with him in projects which we in common saw as serving the best interests not only of our constituents but also of the nation <e> <s> i refer particularly to the national heritage aspects of our work <e>", "<cs> my lords we come to the realm of priorities <e> <s> some people attach more importance than others to civil defence <e> <s> some people attach more importance to spending public money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to say so <e> <s> i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the germ of an idea <e>", "<cs> my lords can we have an assurance that action resulting from the research project will not be delayed because of any possible financial implications that may fall upon local authorities in carrying out any recommendations contained therein <e> <s> surely the minister is aware that when legislation dealing with homeless persons has gone through both houses there has clearly been a marked reluctance on the part of local authorities to carry out what they genuinely want to do particularly in respect of fire precautions safety and hygiene <e> <s> is the minister aware that local authorities are reluctant to take on those responsibilities because of financial implications <e> <s> can the minister assure us that any delay in the report will not be due to any financial restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement that was made in another place <e> <s> but does not the minister understand that the statement will be viewed as adding nothing less than insult to injury <e> <s> why does the secretary of state choose to treat rate-capped authorities with such contempt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his frankness but he has left me very uneasy <e> <s> he will recall that the charge we made was that the minister was seeking information from conservative councillors <e> <s> the minister has said that conservative councillors have gone out of their way to make information available to the minister upon which certain assumptions can be made <e> <s> i think that one needs to be very careful before any government decide to treat with individuals or the whole of a minority group on a council <e> <s> the majority group on a council represents the council and i am very disturbed to learn that this minister and his department see nothing wrong in seeking information which is refused by the majority that is the council from a member of the minority party <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with a great deal of appreciation to the speech from the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> i followed substantially everything he said and the thrust of his speech which was that even after years this approach of unseemly haste comes through time and time again if we do not do it now it might be too late if we do not do it this way there may be financial or commercial considerations <e> <s> the noble lords speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way and for the clarification <e> <s> when the decisions have been taken by the government and announced and when the minister then says that they will be reported to the house and that the house will have an opportunity of expressing a view does that mean that if the house in a vote however managed or marshalled were to vote contrary to the views of the government it would be the end of the matter or would the government merely take into account the views of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl will answer the question that i asked tonight <e> <s> apart from the argument that certainly exists as to the <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply rise briefly to reinforce the reasonable way in which my noble friend lord irving moved the amendment <e> <s> may i also begin as he did by thanking the noble lord the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the very learned and noble lords who have contributed to the debate and who have expressed interest in and some sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> they have certainly conveyed to me that the matter still requires both inside and outside the house some further study of the words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> the minister has assured me as to the intent <e> <s> i am bound to say that the further away the body is from the real action the more worried i become about its ability to do the job <e> <s> in my view the local council in certain circumstances is better able to do the job than the development corporation and the development corporation is certainly better able to do the job than the commission <e> <s> that is simply because those concerned <e>", "<cs> there is a fundamental difference <e> <s> i have been trying to argue that the status and stature of elected councillors and the democratically-elected council are worth more than being embraced by the words <e>", "<cs> yes indeed the noble lord lord graham can be persuaded he is not persuaded but he can be <e> <s> the minister has to satisfy me about the reconciliation of a matter which i just cannot at present accept <e> <s> on the one hand the minister went out of his way just now to stress that no properties will be realised unless a proper price is obtained <e> <s> whether it is a reasonable price the market price or a satisfactory price we are talking in terms of an asset which everyone agrees is worth for example million <e> <s> what the minister is saying is that you cannot get rid of that asset for less than million or for much less than million without his approval <e>", "<cs> i understand that in the light of what is possible targets are set <e> <s> my question is this <e> <s> in the light of the reality of the next months when the targets can be achieved only by disposing of property at less than its market value to what extent are the demands of the treasury paramount over the local authority needing to sell its property at a lower amount <e> <s> i can understand that due account is taken of unemployment depression and so on <e> <s> the minister must bear in mind that this process has been going on for three or four years <e> <s> the first such new towns bill was introduced in so we have had three or four years of experience <e> <s> i want the minister to say what happens if there is likely to be a shortfall on realisation of the treasurys target <e>", "<cs> that is heartening <e> <s> the minister has been as avid a reader of what happened in the other place as i have <e> <s> he will recall the arguments about the creation of company towns <e> <s> this is a situation where certain companies dominate in the acquisition of assets and instead of a new town being <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press this amendment to a division <e> <s> i am interested in the confidence of the minister that he and his colleagues know what local authorities will or will not accept <e> <s> i know that some community-related assets were looked upon as burdens by councils there can be arguments there <e> <s> but is the minister in a position to tell us to what extent consultations on this point have taken place between the ministry and those who represent local authorities <e> <s> that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> if i have misunderstood the thrust of the clause then i accept that that is what i have done <e> <s> if the minister is saying that what we are talking about is taking over assets which in effect are liabilities in other words if you are taking over assets that nobody wants they almost <e>", "<cs> it is the irritating habit of the government to wrap up more than one big <e>", "<cs> i believe that i indicated that i rose to speak on clause stand part as an opportunity to look at dockland issues in general <e> <s> in case i did not make it clear the thrust of the clause is wholly acceptable so far as i am concerned personally and i would say acceptable also to those behind me <e> <s> the minister was very fair and i think proper in outlining to the committee the reasons why this clause will be helpful not just to the docklands but also to other new towns <e> <s> the distress that i feel is that there is an opportunity as i believe the minister will recall and the <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank my noble friend for his persistence <e> <s> i think that the minister will agree that at each stage of the bill my noble friend has listened very carefully to the legitimate queries that the minister has advanced <e> <s> the queries have been largely on the grounds of practicality <e> <s> each time the minister has made a point my noble friend has sought to come back with an improvement or something to take it into account <e> <s> although the minister is right to say that there will always be some authorities which legitimately will say it is difficult i am heartened by the remarks of my noble friend who indicates that at this stage it appears that the local authority associations which of course cannot speak wholly for every single one of their members are saying that what we are seeking to achieve is achievable <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purpose of this bill as i have done on previous film debates i declare an interest in an association with the association of cinematograph television and allied technicians <e> <s> the house could not be other than impressed by the breadth of experience that has been brought to this second reading of a very important bill <e> <s> the minister must be aware that regardless of the friendship that we might show towards him personally the bill itself is virtually friendless all around the house <e> <s> that does not mean to say that we are unanimous in our feelings towards the different parts of the bill <e> <s> members have said that there are parts of it that are good and parts of it that they do not like while various noble lords have indicated some changes which they would support and some which they would not <e> <s> so noble lords are certainly not unanimous about what they want <e> <s> but i think the minister can take it that it would not be an overstatement to say that there is a hostile reception to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the general welcome that has been given by everyone to the useful measure that is before us <e> <s> certainly there will be no opposition from these benches to the second reading of this bill <e> <s> this is one of those occasions when i would certainly want to

will be sufficient police in place and that we shall not have a situation where some are taken from one factory in order to ensure that another factory is up to standard thus leaving the first factory undermanned <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that not for the first time the noble viscount lord hanworth has done this house a service by providing us with the opportunity of debating this topic and even if it is not properly timed the minister and his colleagues should accept the challenge by making a response tonight <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the contributions to the debate will be made from experience and deep interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for being able to comment on the specific point <e> <s> the minister is right the kinds of small friendly society which have made representations to me are those which originated to carry on the function of looking after the burial arrangements of their members <e> <s> with the reduction from to the amount of business that they are able to transact is insufficient for them to be able to run their organisations which is not merely for the provision of their benefits but for a wide range of community-related benefits too <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree <e> <s> where abuse and real abuse can be proved i am no party to wanting that abuse to continue or any evasion <e> <s> it is the small friendly societies which in my view are being punished severely <e> <s> they are the ones i am concerned about and i simply ask the noble lord and his colleagues to bear their future in mind <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the sense as well as the principle of this amendment <e> <s> the minister should take note that this chamber clearly is genuinely trying to probe the government even at this late stage to establish whether they are prepared to devise some mechanism that will provide the british film industry with a source of essential income <e> <s> the government appear to have made their arrangements which are not unfair and which might not even be ungenerous and have then said thats it <e> <s> at the end of the day you stand on your own two feet <e> <s> as the many experts and people of experience both in this chamber and outside it have said that approach is not enough <e> <s> the british film industry cannot even begin to operate because it cannot attract the investment

provide the opportunity for people who may make something out of the fact that they are unable to get information <e> <s> however if they are able to get the information they will be satisfied one hopes and at least the ministry will feel that although they may not have felt it to be necessary or to serve any great purpose if those people for deep reasons consider that there are things that could happen and that they should be made aware of them if in fact the information is made available on a regular basis i do not think that the amendment in those terms is asking for a great deal

carefully <e> <s> knowing this minister i am satisfied that he will do that <e> <s> but will the noble earl agree that we are also concerned about the government doing more than being willing to respond to anxious consumers <e> <s> what the government ought to be prepared to do is to take the initiative in making the information available <e> <s> such information will not be harmful to the governments case and may go a long way to assuage the anxiety of other people and it is all part of the cost of democracy <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that in many instances the absence of candour feeds the people who for malicious or malevolent reasons want to make something out of nothing <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will watch the issue very closely as i intend to do <e>",

has said so and i believe every word that he says sometimes i would simply as a layman assume that the inclusion of those elements has caused no suspicion no annoyance no anger and no fear <e> <s> however we know that no matter how the government proceed there will always be a very large section of the population who will be suspicious <e> <s> just as the minister said on the earlier amendment

chancellor and the government said that this was a budget for jobs <e> <s> bearing that in mind would the minister care to tell the house what assessment he and his colleagues have <e>", "<cs> my

it more conducive to the argument to point out the very low percentage of those who were in favour of abolition <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord by pointing out that in the same polls <e>", "<cs> the committee should be indebted to the noble lord lord broadbridge for giving us this opportunity of examining whether in a complicated and complex situation the use of the device of a referendum has any part to play in convincing either the government or those who oppose the government view that the proposals which the government seem hell bent on proceeding with come what may are the wishes of the people who will be affected <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord i am not in favour of over-exerting myself <e> <s> the dilemma faced by the committee is that there is evidence produced

entitled to interpret <e>", "<cs> what i believe the minister said in my own way as well as is the noble lord not from a somnolent position but certainly lying back and perhaps enjoying it <e> <s> the

his notes and spoke from the heart he gave more reassurance in his last two or three paragraphs than he did in reading out how this matter is seen in another place <e> <s> i am bound to say that the

answer is yes <e>", "<cs> i shall read carefully what the minister has said and consider action at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not admit that on this occasion the government speak with a forked tongue <e> <s> is it not a fact that while they give a general welcome to the recommendations of the auld report for complete deregulation of hours and a potential -hour shopping week they fail completely to say anything about the protection of the wages and conditions of shop workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he not appreciate that the consultants said that in the first two years creating the jobs worked out at a cost to the public purse in excess of per job <e> <s> does the minister not understand that retailing and distributive outlets which operate inside an enterprise zone do so at an unfair advantage to those retailers and distributors outside who have to pay higher charges <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in his earlier reply he failed to see how there was an unfair advantage to the operator inside the zone by comparison with the operator outside the zone <e> <s> does the minister not understand that if there is a cry that rates are too high and that the operator inside does not pay them and the operator outside has to pay them that is an unfair advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise wearing two hats <e> <s> first i represent the front bench of the labour party but secondly as is the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> the noble minister is quite right <e> <s> it was because of the complete absence of a provision as to who in future would accept or have placed upon them this very serious responsibility that this way of disposing of the matter was conceived <e> <s> however the minister is quite right <e> <s> when we see the amendment it may well be that those outside the house will feel that it is satisfactory <e> <s> in view of that i shall not spoil matters before thursday <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in seeking to preserve and protect the marine and aquatic environment from tbt or any one of the substances listed by the ec directive as being particularly dangerous he will have widespread support not only in this house but outside it as well <e> <s> may the house be informed of the work being done to reassure paint makers and users that it is possible to satisfy their imperatives without poisoning the ocean and the marine life that lives therein <e>", "<cs> my lords in this matter of genuine public interest in view of the first appointment to a residuary body which is the precursor to the successor authorities being of the manner which has been described will the minister bear it in mind that the broad political allegiances of the populations oversighted by the residuary bodies will be very mixed and that unless the appointments made broadly reflect that political allegiance across the board there will be strong support for the view that the local government bill has less to do with democratic accountability than providing jobs for the boys and the girls <e>", "<cs> i believe the minister my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept completely what the minister has said that it is impossible for one individual to reflect all political views <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind that i simply want to know that at the end of the day when all the appointments which the minister has in mind have been made the political complexion of the authorities will be reflected by the totality of the appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the ministers indication that nothing final has been determined <e> <s> bearing in mind that we are thinking of a possible five-year stint when these bodies might be in existence and realising the enormity of the guidance that can be given by the residuary bodies in the period can we have an assurance from the minister that he will be flexible when looking both at the remuneration and at the number of days in the week on which the individuals may be called upon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct <e> <s> in the light of what has been said i shall not press my amendment <e> <s> i was however slightly irritated by the remarks of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway when he said that in seeking to transfer powers to the fire authority we were saddling them with responsibilities which were amorphous and unrelated <e> <s> our amendment can be criticised on many grounds but it is a genuine attempt to establish that the fire authority is the appropriate body to have the function of ensuring that sports grounds are safe <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply say from this side of the house that we are grateful not only for what the minister has said tonight but for the spirit in which it was recognised earlier that there was a genuine oversight <e> <s> the government have acted quickly in the spirit of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if inadvertently i have caused a rift in the lute then of course i withdraw what i said <e> <s> in the meantime someone better able to deal with this than i am has appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the wrong answer <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise the ambitions of the government in this matter may i ask the minister whether he will not acknowledge that these teams are very poor substitutes for giving councils who know their problems well increased support in the rate support grant so that they can get on with doing the job in their own areas <e>", "<cs> my lords are any figures available to show how many new jobs are really new <e> <s> if it is felt satisfactory to produce figures to record the number of employees on enterprises operating in enterprise zones as newly-created jobs may we be told how many of the jobs are simply transferees from enterprises outside the zones <e> <s> those are enterprises such as distribution and warehousing which have moved into the enterprise zone simply to take advantage of the rate and planning benefits which of course are real benefits but which are unfair to those operating outside <e>", "<cs> and very well too my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to withdraw it but it is rather sad that the minister has so much faith not in the willingness but in the ability of the boroughs to carry on that which the glc has carried on <e> <s> this is the government that will be screwing down as tightly as possible the resources that the boroughs have to enable them to do a range of things this is the government that will be laying responsibility upon responsibility on the boroughs and yet this is the government that say that they see no reason why on the question of organising and partially funding these london-wide events they should not continue in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i took one minute in moving the amendment and the minister has quite properly taken five minutes to reply <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the value of the debate to those outside will be in direct proportion to the time taken <e> <s> i am sure that the minister has said something that will be helpful to those who have sought this opportunity to raise the matter here <e> <s> i very much hope so <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what about the conservatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the opposition to the amendment i am advancing <e> <s> the minister invites the house to consider two sets of circumstances <e> <s> one is the will and authority of parliament as against the will authority and power of a local council over its employees <e> <s> the minister is inviting the house to agree that the will of parliament shall prevail over the will of a locally-elected council <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister and i are at one in understanding first that there is a function to perform rather than a policy to be determined <e> <s> i can well understand that the business will be exceedingly dull <e> <s> they may be very businesslike and efficient but there may not be a great deal of meat in the matters that they are debating <e> <s> they may not provide very many exciting discussions but as i pointed out there are a number of matters of interest to groups of people and certainly to ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems an eminently sensible extension of provisions which quite clearly were designed by parliament and by government to protect workers and public servants <e> <s> when the minister says that this is extended to the new ilea can he tell us precisely what we are talking about <e> <s> does it involve all the ramifications of the ilea structure the teachers who are employed by them or the administrators <e> <s> can the minister tell us a little more about what it is and about the powers and the responsibilities that have been extended <e> <s> is this a gift from the government or does it place any responsibilities upon the ilea <e> <s> as the minister is aware the future of the ilea has been a sensitive topic in this place and outside and i should not want to find later that something which appears to me on the surface to be welcome but about which i have no <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last few words of the noble lords remarks it all became clear to me but the noble lord had to go through the first part to get to the better second part <e> <s> this will give power to people who have information to pass that information to ilea <e> <s> ilea then becomes embraced in the information receiving body and an authority which on receipt of information is then able to carry out what ought to be the responsibility of every responsible employer which is to make sure that the premises the equipment and the operation of the equipment etc <e> <s> are covered by an important act <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this policy of eliminating competition is contrary not only to the philosophy but also to the current political practice of the government <e> <s> does the minister really want to deprive pharmacies large and small of the opportunity of expanding which will inevitably lead to enhanced values for existing sites and shops which will inevitably lead to increased prices for the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot recall using the word transitional but the record will confirm it <e> <s> if i did i can understand the minister having difficulty trying to reconcile transitional with starting in april and for each year thereafter <e> <s> the purpose here is to recognise that for as long as the joint boards are in existence we are looking at this against the authority of the residuary bodies and i mentioned five years as the period we see the necessity as do those outside the house who are advising us and who are concerned in these matters for some means of simply co-ordinating <e> <s> at the end of the day these people will produce their budgets and somebody has to reconcile and determine how much shall be spent <e> <s> we are saying as does every person who has served on local government committees that some committee of every council whether it be the finance committee the general purposes committee or the co-ordination committee has to reconcile competing claims between various bits of the empire <e> <s> we are asking how will that be done at the joint board level <e> <s> we are suggesting because in this particular clause a range of functions is laid down for the joint committees it says that the joint committee is to discharge the functions mentioned and there follows a range of very important matters including to co-ordinate the making of preparations that one of the things that it could usefully take on board are the matters referred to in this amendment <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make the next period for the minister as relaxed as possible by saying that i do not intend to press this to a vote <e> <s> i come back to a point made by the noble lord lord molson <e> <s> is there not a danger he asked that when the dust dies down separately precepting authorities with legal responsibility to undertake a function as a joint committee could very well collectively produce a greater cost to the ratepayer and taxpayer than that which is ostensibly the reason for the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan counties the waste of public money <e> <s> the minister may tell us that that is not possible <e> <s> he obviously knows the kind of people who are going to serve and the kind of decisions that they are going to take <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister if he wishes can decide that he wants to see this killed stone dead by a vote <e> <s> it will not bother me or this side of the house <e> <s> it is not a matter of central principle <e> <s> we have put forward this amendment because we see it as a possible means of improving the arrangements <e> <s> the minister can take it from me as i know he will if i look him straight in the eye that if he wants to vote on it and vote it down we on this side of the house will not oppose it <e> <s> we are not in the business of losing votes regularly <e> <s> that is quite likely to be the outcome <e> <s> this is not an argument of that size <e> <s> we are trying simply to get a better arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister recognises the anxiety of my noble friend lord irving and many of the officers who serve our councils and councillors those they are serving at the moment <e> <s> there are divided loyalties <e> <s> it is all very well for the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to have left-wing councils to hit at and to have trade unions and trade unionists to hit at <e> <s> the noble lord lord irving speaks on behalf of the officers themselves <e> <s> there have been smokescreens brought into a situation that it very serious <e> <s> i was sorry to hear the noble lord lord molson introduce pejoratively an illustration that is not denied <e>", "<cs> make a gesture <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he is aware of the damaging impact on the british film laboratory industry of the import into this country of used film prints <e> <s> in the interests of protecting british industry and british workers and jobs will the government consider proposing at any future meeting of gatt a levy in order to protect vital british interests in a time of recession and job losses <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the minister that i understand that in any gatt negotiations there can be very sensitive issues and swings and roundabouts obviously play their part <e> <s> if in fact the idea of a levy to protect this particularly vulnerable british industry does not commend itself to the minister bearing in mind what i think were his hopeful remarks in the final part of his first response will he be prepared not only to receive representations from me but also to see representatives of the british film laboratory industry in order to see if there are any other ways in which he and his colleagues can assist <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i draw the attention of the minister to the excellent question that was asked by the noble baroness lady masham on wednesday which was responded to so very well by his ministerial colleague baroness cox and which is a good backcloth to this problem <e> <s> will the minister acknowledge that the experience and expertise of prison officers can play a crucial part in effecting a smooth transition in matters of this kind and that there is dissatisfaction among prison officers that very often their opinions or views on matters of this kind are sought far too late and then ignored <e> <s> for instance why is the purpose-built remand centre at thorp arch being used as a means of relieving the dreadful problems at leeds instead of proceeding with the planned fourth wing at thorp arch <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am told that when his right honourable colleague the home secretary in another place made an announcement of changes which affect thorpe arch that statement was made without prior warning or consultation with members of the prison officers association at either national or local level <e> <s> while i acknowledge what he said in his answer will the minister take on board that though he may be satisfied that the consultation procedures are adequate there are others who are dismayed at the manner in which they are being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply say that the minister has outlined not consultation but information <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the labour benches in your lordships house may i say that we certainly do exactly what my colleagues did in another place <e> <s> first of all we congratulate mr freeman for his initiative and certainly i pay full <e>", "<cs> my lords a wooden plug <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the observation of the agreed quota is of crucial <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that besides statistics and besides annual reports it is desirable that the iba companies should reveal their programme schedules marked up to indicate what is quota material and what is not and what is non-exempt material and what is not <e> <s> surely a body such as the radio and television safeguards committee or the fbu ought to be able to scrutinise these schedules at least once every six months in order to satisfy themselves that the quota is being strictly adhered to <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to say from the labour front bench that we are very grateful for the case that has been made by my noble friend and we certainly support all that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me to pay a tribute a very warm tribute to many outside this house who have served the oppostion very well indeed by enabling us most effectively to present their case which of course was our case too <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard warm tributes paid not only to his maiden speech an impressive beginning to a long and distinguished period in your lordships house but to the qualities of the man called lord crawshaw of aintree <e> <s> from these benches i give him a warm welcome <e> <s> he knows that he comes among many friends from the other place <e> <s> friendships made then despite regrettable shifts in political allegiances will serve not only him but the whole house <e> <s> our personal friendship remains unimpaired <e> <s> i wish him well in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that when most blanket bans are applied they contain anomalies <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister bear in mind for instance the plight of my own local football club tottenham hotspur of course i say that with a tyneside accent <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister acknowledge that for clubs such as spurs and many others the income and prestige which accrue to them and their country from their overseas tours can be very seriously affected by such a ban <e> <s> for instance a club such as spurs when it has an ordinary home game employs policemen and stewards and such clubs are therefore eminently respected <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister further agree that there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin as most other noble lords have done by extending a very warm welcome and congratulations to the two maiden speakers in our debate <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden had to say and i look forward to enjoying on many future occasions what he has to say because he undoubtedly speaks with knowledge wisdom and wit <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so i listened with even closer attention to the remarks of the other maiden speaker the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester <e> <s> i intend to strengthen and consolidate the case that he made so excellently <e> <s> he demonstrated quite clearly as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said that he is a modern model of a bishop which i find all too refreshing in his willingness and ability to make a case on behalf of the people whom he seeks to represent <e> <s> i look forward very much indeed to hearing the right reverend prelate on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister be a litttle more positive than that <e> <s> does the minister not recall that when the bill of my noble friend lord wallace of coslany left this place it was blocked in the other place by the governments spokesman doing what he was entitled to do that is object to the bill being read a second time <e> <s> will the minister reflect on the value to millions of people who will be able to take part in and extend their ability to enjoy their recreation if some progress is made and some legislation brought forward <e> <s> there is a great need for more food to be grown in this country as well as for enhancing the opportunities for ordinary people who may well be confined to high-rise developments to enjoy a little recreation on their own allotment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can be reminded of the organisation that i have already suggested should receive his support <e> <s> i refer to the initiative shown by the national council for civil defence <e> <s> the president is the noble lord lord renton who is at present in his place <e> <s> that organisation is strongly advocating the depoliticising of civil defence <e> <s> is the minister interested in building bridges among those authorities and councils who hitherto have spurned the efforts of the government on what i would call the traditional civil defence line to take account of the kind of accident or hazard that can occur <e> <s> if the minister is anxious to make friends i believe that this speech is a very good one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the contrast which is posed in the question <e> <s> it is proposed radically to alter if not to abolish the minimum wage of shop workers which stands at a week whereas for four attendances in your lordships house a member of this house can claim a week <e> <s> is that not nauseating hypocrisy and humbug <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin as everyone in this house has done by welcoming the noble lord lord donoughue and paying a warm tribute to his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it is a trite phrase to say that we look forward to hearing him often in the future some of us have heard him often in the past <e> <s> all i would say to him is that he did not disappoint any of his friends on this side of the house or indeed throughout the house <e> <s> we certainly look forward very much to hearing from him often in the future <e>", "<cs> oh no <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support my noble friend <e> <s> more than once since second reading began we have posed to the minister the problems and consequences of the legislation <e> <s> i fully understand the imperatives of the minister <e> <s> he has every justification for taking what i call drastic action <e> <s> however the minister is a fair man and the department is anxious to proceed with the maximum co-operation from those who will be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the information regarding the next statutory meeting is well known <e> <s> is he further aware that last week as a matter of the utmost urgency the leader of the ama and the leader of the ala asked for a meeting as quickly as possible even against the background of that statutory meeting <e> <s> i understand that the letter was sent last week and that no response has yet been received <e> <s> will the minister accept from me that the purpose of this question is benign and not malignant <e> <s> we are recognising that at the end of a very difficult period of rate capping or rate setting there is an urgency to begin the dialogue as quickly as possible <e> <s> in view of what has been said in the press lately regarding the possibility of changes in finance would the minister not agree that there is great urgency in this matter <e> <s> i would simply ask him to ask his right honourable friend to respond to the initiative taken last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i am also surprised and disturbed at the advice he has given the house <e> <s> i am sure he will appreciate that i shall make urgent inquiries regarding the letter which i understand was sent last week and of which he says the department has no trace <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from me that that information is very welcome news indeed particularly against the background that at present the funds made available to the british film institute allow them to treat only million feet <e> <s> my understanding is that they are required to treat million feet and that appears to be something for the future <e> <s> but would the minister not agree that since there is the prospect of losing some of our national heritage nothing would be lost by arranging a conference of the entrepreneurs the workers in the industry and the british film institute to see whether they can produce over a period of time a scheme that will guarantee absolutely the safety of stock which is in danger <e>", "<cs> my lords may i once more repeat my gratitude to the noble earl the minister for his opening statement which is certainly encouraging <e> <s> in view of what he has said that is in regard to the limited nature of his remit in this matter almost wholly directed to the stock held by the british film institute cloes not the noble earl the minister agree that the governments presence at a conference which he suggests could be called by the british film institute would do nothing but good <e> <s> if in fact that initiative comes forward without financial <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government intend to look at the fiscal and legislative framework which affects owner-occupiers would the <e>", "<cs> my lords without the benefit of having seen the white paper may i ask the minister to tell the house whether it contains anything with respect to the burdens on small businessmen arising from the bureaucracy surrounding vat <e> <s> is the minister aware that the national federation of self-employed and small businesses and the national federation of market traders have drawn to my attention the growing unease of their members at various matters arising from increased powers of inspection in regard to vat given in this years budget <e> <s> can the minister tell us that when the white paper is out consultations will take place with such bodies as i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> where <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord to relate what he has said to the recommendations of the auld committee <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that the auld committee recommended the retention of the two wages councils which operate primarily in the retailing and distribution sector <e> <s> does the noble lord recognise that if i understand rightly what he has said the minimum protection for juniors will be abolished <e> <s> i understood him to say in respect of overtime that in effect shopworkers would be very seriously affected <e> <s> does the noble lord recognise that if the government wish to see progress in their legislative programme in respect of the auld report what is recommended this afternoon is a damaging piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to take less than two minutes in speaking <e> <s> first of all i wish the bill well <e> <s> secondly i should like to acknowledge the manner in which my noble friend and colleague lord mishcon has made as plain as he possibly can his unease at the rushed legislation and at some of the premises upon which the legislation has been allowed to go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the minister both for the brevity of his speech and also for its clarity <e> <s> in effect this exercise is about cutting public expenditure and any other words that the minister or his colleagues might care to use would be a sham because as the minister points out at the moment the balance of moneys received by councils for planning applications which it was hoped by the government would be per cent <e> <s> of the costs of the planning control departments has resulted in about per cent <e> <s> of those costs and now they want to increase that to per cent <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> unless i am advised otherwise i do not think we are on record as saying that we shall abolish them <e> <s> i stand to be corrected of course <e> <s> we opposed the introduction of them but as with most oppositions there are certain things one makes commitments about which are matters of great principle <e> <s> this is important but it is not in that category and what my party does after gaining power which of course we shall do after the next election remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fair point if one looks at the purpose of the planning application as being to give the applicant a benefit <e> <s> but we take the view that the whole community is the beneficiary of a planning system <e> <s> in other words it is the public who get the benefit of ensuring that development is controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister is in a position to relate whether the planning application fee system has anything to do with the speeding-up of the backlog <e> <s> for instance i can well imagine that if people are paying for something they will be just a little more impatient and perhaps a little more aggressive <e> <s> i can also see that a planning department which before had simply processed applications as fast as it could is now under pressure from people who can say i have paid you or i have paid you <e> <s> is the minister in a position to say whether the fee system has a bearing on the speed with which the planning applications are processed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made by his honourable friend in another place <e> <s> in hearing that statement we have the benefit of the report which was published last week by the defence committee <e>

care and attention to her speeches <e> <s> we shall hope to hear her often <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to comment on the disparity between the compensation that is available to the overbooked passenger on scheduled flights and that which is apparently on offer with difficulty to package holidaymakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is the minister aware that this question is raised at a time when the prison population at is the highest on record <e> <s> was this intolerable and unacceptable total at this time taken into account when the building programme was framed <e> <s> if it was not is the minister satisfied that the programme is capable of taking account of the upward curve in the prison population <e> <s> can we be assured that professional bodies such as the prison officers association are always fully consulted on the design aspects and many other aspects of prisons upon which undoubtedly they have expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the fullness and fairness of the ministers original reply to my question <e>

amount of money in the world spent on building new prisons will be any use unless there are discussions in respect of the proper manning levels within the prisons <e> <s> will she undertake that that matter will be considered in consultation with the prison officers and governors <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to consultations that have taken place <e> <s> will he tell the house about consultations that took place with interests in this country which have agreed with the action that the government took last week <e> <s> for instance as the house well knows i live in edmonton and the mk electric firm are very close to <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is the duty of any government is it not to build and improve the housing stock of the nation <e> <s> while it may be difficult for this government why do they persistently fail to harness the goodwill and resources of the building industry the financial institutions and more importantly of those in local government who have the responsibility of solving the desperate housing shortage <e> <s> for instance why do the government persist in believing that a policy of selling off council houses is an adequate substitute for a national house building programme <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we are entitled to assume that every effort will be made to make the november summit as successful as possible <e> <s> what comment do her majestys government have on not the staggering statements but the swaggering statements that have been made recently by the president by robert mcfarlane and by richard perle <e> <s> surely her

issued last week by the staff commission which said that at present <e>", "<cs> my lords surely my noble friend lord jenkins of putney is being unusually moderate in asking for no further increase

verification <e> <s> a technology capable of creating the star wars programme and of detecting the details of the soviet ss <e> <s> should be capable of developing effective verification methods <e>",

involved <e> <s> for instance how many jobs are likely to be created by the developments in tourism in comparison with the number of jobs that were lost and have been lost by the closure of the

encourage the perpetuation of international resentment and bitterness should we not do our best to remember that war and in particular the manner in which it was ended <e> <s> can the minister tell the house what consultations the government had with those who would have wanted to be consulted and who may well have had something important to say before they decided not to commemorate

standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he say what steps he has taken to confirm the information that i know he has received from the welsh schools swimming association indicating that in some schools tuition has been cut back or stopped as a result of cuts in central government funding <e> <s> will the minister also confirm that it is unlawful to charge for swimming tuition <e> <s> yet there are instances about which he has been informed as i have of parents being asked either to pay for tuition or for transport from the school to the swimming pool <e> <s> will the minister also acknowledge that to learn to swim at an early age is a right not to be denied to any child <e> <s> can he give some assurance that his department will take steps to emphasise to authorities that the provision of swimming is not only a right but a moral duty upon those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow up the normal helpful question from the noble lord lord beloff in which he introduced the matter of the effect of industrial action may i ask this question <e> <s> will not the minister agree that the purpose not only of the question but of the representation which he has received from the welsh swimming association is to point out the damage that has been done is a result of cuts by the government in central funding <e> <s> i hope that the minister will accept that i am not pursuing this matter from the point of view of the excellence of swimmers as potential olympic gold-medalists although that is an aspect <e> <s> i would very much welcome the minister saying at the proper time and in a proper place that due emphasis should be given in our schools to this important activity <e> <s> this difficult time has been brought about by the governments financial priorities <e> <s> the government ought to ensure that every child at the age of nine or is given the opportunity to learn to swim <e> <s> the fact is that as a result of cuts by the noble lords government children in many schools are not being given that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which has been made by his colleague in another place <e> <s> however is the minister aware that this participation agreement locks britain into the strategic defence initiative more firmly than ever <e> <s> in our view this agreement will be seen in retrospect as a crucial part of the escalation of the nuclear weapons arms race <e> <s> the question must be asked

coming in our direction <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a noble gesture <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister will be pleased and grateful for the reception this order has received from the house <e> <s> he is entitled to be so <e> <s> i certainly stand up and give a very warm welcome to the order <e> <s> as the minister will appreciate we have had the benefit earlier of looking at the

satisfaction in following the moving of this amendment so cogently and effectively moved by the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> if the law is being broken on an enormous scale the noble lord must

paper very often provides there is a progression <e> <s> the previous itemised schedule was criticised for its exclusion of certain matters <e> <s> it so happens that this revised schedule includes

noble lords who knowing me would normally expect me to deal head-on with the points they have raised will therefore excuse me for not doing so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> to say that i am disappointed at the reception that has been given to this amendment is an understatement <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson valiantly produced another variation <e> <s> i am prepared to consider that

word at the top resist that is before the debate starts <e> <s> i should like to feel that from time to time one of the ministerial replies not merely acknowledges what has been said that is said very often but agrees that something said in the debate will cause the department to reflect <e> <s> the problem for the committee is that we know from what we have heard before and what we are hearing now that the government are apparently not prepared to reflect on any aspect of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to bring them both together in a spirit of conciliation <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the married woman who at the moment works in a shop with six-day trading need not worry because she will be protected in the future <e> <s> she will not have to work on a sunday if she does not want to <e> <s> that is the biggest red herring that the government have attempted to perpetrate in this bill <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate the bishop of chichester pointed out the experience now where shops open on a sunday though they are not entitled to is that their employees are invited to work <e> <s> of course they can say no but all sorts of devices are used to compel them to work either economically or because otherwise they will become disadvantaged when it comes to promotion and in other ways <e> <s> but those are debates not just for another day but for another year because we shall return to those subjects next year <e> <s> perhaps we may conclude the bill next year <e>", "<cs> i am very conscious of the words of the noble lord the government chief whip earlier today that it was hoped that at about this evening the proceedings on this bill would be adjourned <e> <s> however i am sure the committee will understand that i need to make a short response to the debate which has now gone on for minutes <e>", "<cs> let me read these words to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i will come on and just a little bit more slowly in view of the invitation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not hear what the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble earl was here yesterday when my noble friends lord galpern and lord ross of marnock told us bluntly not only what is happening now but the trend and the consequences of what is happening in glasgow <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister used the phrase from his statement that the greater the spending by a local authority the less grant that authority would receive <e> <s> this is germane to the exchange <e> <s> surely local people elected people whatever their political complexion are in a far better <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also agree that it is right and proper for a local council if it wishes to increase its services to recognise that that will be reflected in increased rates and allow the local ratepayers to decide at election time and not for central government to decide by curtailing the amount of rates which the council wishes to spend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to say a little more about the nature of the agreement that was made on nd august <e> <s> bearing in mind that the french were one of the original five partners can he say a little more first on why they are dragging their feet and secondly on what is required as an inducement for them to participate fully in the matter <e> <s> would the minister care to say anything about the employment prospects for the united kingdom arising from this development <e> <s> to say that they are good or excellent does not quantify the possibilities of employment <e> <s> would the minister care to say something about the firm design proposals <e> <s> what progress has been made towards them and when will actual building begin <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the minister categorically to deny the assertion that there is a higher incidence of leukaemia in the parishes around aldermaston <e> <s> my question therefore is this in view of the assertion that there is a higher incidence of leukaemia in the parishes around aldermaston would the minister care to tell the house how that incidence compares with the national average <e> <s> if there is indeed disquiet in the area and i understand that there is then surely the best way of satisfying public concern would be to hold a public inquiry or at least to make an authoritative statement on the matter <e>", "<cs> what an actor my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give a welcome to the bill at second reading and to remind the house that in a previous session the bill somewhat enlarged began its progress through another place <e> <s> those who follow these matters will be aware that on that occasion that bill ran into a number of difficulties not least because it caused a great deal of distress to street traders because of provisions in it about which the national market traders federation and the london union of street traders expressed very great concern <e>", "<cs> and long my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge that the prison staff at holloway are doing their tasks exceedingly well in very difficult circumstances <e> <s> despite what the minister has said concerning the improvements that are in hand is it not a fact that ultimately the best solution is the fulfilment of the promise made some time ago for the creation of secure regional units in dhss establishments <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask for clarification whether i am to understand that if the amendments that were not moved earlier today to delete sections and of the act amendments which do precisely what the noble lord has just said were to be moved at a later stage in the bill he would support them <e>", "<cs> i have previously given notice of an intention to oppose the question that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> we have had a very good debate on the earlier amendments so ably moved by my colleague the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> that provided a number of insights <e> <s> it was the first indication by the government that they may be prepared to accept some amendments on this part of the bill <e> <s> that was not in response to the speech by my noble friend but came in the ministers second intervention after the noble earl lord stockton had made his very powerful speech <e>", "<cs> the minister has said that he is prepared to look with the greatest possible care at subsequent amendments <e> <s> i have been under the impression that the minister considers every amendment with the greatest possible care but there will be even greater care taken with those in future <e>", "<cs> i had given notice of my intention to oppose at the appropriate time that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> however much water has flowed under the bridge since then <e> <s> just as i have earlier this evening withdrawn my opposition to clause in order to allow for a period of reflection i am equally satisfied that i should not move that clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the bill is not complicated but our procedures are <e> <s> those who followed the debate closely will know that there was an amendment down to delete the mention of section of the shops act in clause which would have been a paving amendment to the general approach here <e> <s> because of the time-scale and tactics in order to get the maximum time to debate general principles that omission has weakened the general strength of the argument that would have been made <e> <s> but the argument is still valid <e> <s> does the minister want to help me <e>", "<cs> there is no dispute but we have taken up minutes on this matter and i am happy about that <e> <s> the intention is at all times to be consistent <e> <s> we need to bear in mind the difficulty of the committee as we have yet to see the colour of the wages council bill <e> <s> we know the intention of the minister which is also seen in the bill that there will be two rates of pay <e> <s> one will be a statutory minimum and the other will be one overtime rate <e> <s> depending on circumstances and the number of hours under the wages council provisions there are a range of overtime rates time and a quarter time and a third time and a half time and three-quarters double time <e> <s> we do not argue that if there are to be two rates the second should be double time but people who statutorily will be forced to work on a sunday whether or not they are only or are entitled to be paid double because in our view they are being forced to give up the precious value and benefit of a sunday <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he cannot believe that adult shopworkers would wish the restrictions on their shop hours to remain and that they would be in favour of their removal <e> <s> would the minister care to say what consultations have taken place and with whom they were undertaken by the government which have brought him to that conclusion <e>", "<cs> i hope so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister graciously gives way <e> <s> will the minister understand that all the unions who have submitted evidence and all the assessors who had a responsibility to the committee have said since the production of the report that the findings and conclusions of the report are far removed from the evidence upon which they are alleged to have been based <e> <s> in other words the report sets out a body of opinion from which the conclusions that have been drawn are very far removed <e> <s> the minister therefore will get little comfort from pointing out that the auld report listened very carefully to a wide range of people <e> <s> those people to whom they listened including the shops inspectorates have said that the conclusions are divorced from the evidence which they gave <e>", "<cs> the minister lays great faith and confidence in the ability of local authorities the better to fulfil their obligations under law and statutes in the future than they have in the past because there is no shadow of doubt that the prime culprit for the law being brought into disrepute has been the unwillingness of council after council to enforce the law <e>", "<cs> if it is to be left to each council or to anyone in the land to come to their own conclusion as to what is logical or not and therefore to enforce or not when they are enforcement authorities then the minister has opened up an enormous problem <e> <s> the inspectorate who have had the responsibility of enforcing the shops legislation up till now have said to the house and have said to the auld committee and to everyone else wherever a council has provided the resources and the support we have found no difficulty whatsoever in enforcing the law <e> <s> that has been a fact <e> <s> now we are going to find in the future that all sorts of laws are needing to be enforced but at the same time we have a government which in their finance policy towards local authorities are making it increasingly difficult for councils who wish to enforce the law and to carry out their obligations to do so because of the restrictions which are placed upon their ability either to engage properly-qualified people or to do so in the required number <e>", "<cs> the minister is naive if he does not believe that there is a category of shopkeeper or establishment keeper who if it is possible for his premises to be inspected for a range of things on six days more rigorously than on the seventh will not relax the provisions of the law on the seventh <e> <s> it is a fact of life <e> <s> i am not talking about the large reputable storekeepers the chains or the big businesses i am talking in a nation of shopkeepers the minister and his noble friend sitting beside him are shaking their heads <e> <s> whether they do not believe it is possible for shopkeepers to be other than absolutely law-abiding i do not know <e>", "<cs> the world referred to by the noble lord who has just spoken would be nice if everyone who worked in shops was covered by circumstances of the sort he has outlined <e> <s> of course the overwhelming majority of those whom we seek to protect already have good protection either under the law or under collective agreements collective agreements which are industry-wide and in which the employers are well organised enough and sensible enough to combine and the trade unions with members in those industries do likewise so that agreements are made <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raises the spectre that if we are to envisage every aspect of life <e>", "<cs> with great respect i am not <e> <s> i am saying that the people covered by this bill who are affected by this particular provision deserve consideration <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will be lucky <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would care to say what kind of opportunity or avenue of redress there would exist for those workers in such establishments who are not able to secure sound sensible amicable arrangements with their employers not merely for holiday entitlement but for other matters <e> <s> the minister is perfectly entitled to say that the majority of workers whether they are in shops or in other establishments with good employers as most of them are see the sense of coming to terms on a range of matters one of which is holiday entitlement <e> <s> but my noble friend gave an illustration of a survey taken not in but in of certain workers in certain circumstances whose employers are not as enlightened as many others <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would care to tell us in the absence of some statutory provision what kind of redress would be available to an employee who is not receiving his fair entitlement in such an organisation shop or establishment and who is fearful of raising the matter in such a way in the present climate of unemployment <e> <s> what avenue of redress has such a worker who is not getting his fair entitlement <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e>",

establishment that when this bill becomes law states that it has no intention of opening on sundays because it does not believe in sunday trading <e> <s> say that a person becomes an employee of that company in such circumstances because it is that shops policy not to open on a sunday <e> <s> what if subsequently the firm is compelled to open on sundays owing to competition <e> <s> what kind of

move that clause shall not stand part of the bill in order to facilitate what i am sure will be a very short debate at the end of which it will be my intention not to press the matter to a vote <e> <s> this motion has been put down because as those who have followed these matters will have learnt from the proceedings on tuesday in particular there is immense dissatisfaction not just with clause but also with schedule which is the substance of clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for this short debate <e> <s> the committee will appreciate that with my intention not to press the matter i could simply have stood up minutes ago and said not moved as i did on a number of occasions on tuesday and as i intend to do later <e> <s> but i had understood from conversations i have had that members of the committee wanted to use this opportunity simply to underline and reinforce without committing any words to paper or putting words into the ministers mouth the feeling that there did appear to be the possibility of some improvement which would go a long way toward satisfying the general anxieties <e> <s> so this short debate has certainly been helpful <e>", "<cs> in a moment <e> <s> the principle of differentiation apparently is accepted in that particular instance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord but i am bound to point out that there are many noble lords including myself who believe that the protection for existing workers does not amount to very much at all <e> <s> while we would not wish to deny them that protection we shall certainly be questioning very strongly in later amendments the value of this protection <e> <s> however unless there is some other noble lord who wishes to make a point it is now my intention to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be

press this amendment to a division but i am wholly unconvinced that the noble lord the minister and other noble lords who have spoken have it right in respect of the ability of employers to persuade their employees freely either to sign a contract when they become employed or even to agree to the insertion into <e>", "<cs> with respect if there is no question that existing contracts which take away that right are negatived by the passing of clause then it will be welcome news to a great many people because not everyone has been under that impression and a great deal has been said about the protection of the shopworker the conscience clause and the right not to work <e> <s> however if despite a contract which has been entered into which specifically lays down not that shopworkers shall work but that in the event of legislation being passed the employer shall have the right to make them work that kind of condition is in effect non-operable in the light of the passing of this bill

shall be very grateful and be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes hit exactly on the reason for the amendment and that is the example of the employee who voluntarily enters into an agreement to work on a sunday in the changed circumstances shall we say <e> <s> of months time and where there are financial inducements but who finds in the event that it does not work out to suit him <e>", "<cs> the minister without giving anything away said to the noble baroness lady gardner that perhaps

second that <e>", "<cs> without any authority whatever the noble lord has given us nothing and we are looking forward to something at later stages <e> <s> i shall be much more flattering in my praise at later stages when that happens <e> <s> however i share the expressions of thanks from the committee <e> <s> i do not take from anything that has been said other than that the minister has genuinely tried to understand our arguments <e> <s> he has been unable to accept almost all of them but we have had the feeling on this side of the committee that he is genuinely sincere when he says that there are things worthy of consideration at a later stage <e> <s> i certainly share in the expressions of gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister pointed out in the statement that the three fundamental weaknesses in our present arrangements are distasteful in a number of ways <e> <s> in view of the fact that the present arrangements are the creatures of this government what faith can the country have that the new arrangements will be any better bearing in mind that the present mess results from this governments means of tackling local rates <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i rely in part on newspaper reports but is the minister not disturbed that the report which is in the course of preparation and which i understand is to be submitted to the prime minister in february says that the report upon which the short fat ship was rejected is deeply flawed and in many critical categories totally inaccurate <e> <s> in view of the fact that we are talking in terms of million a ship and perhaps ships in all will the minister not say something helpful about at least reviewing the policy <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i have appreciated and respected all the contributions in this debate <e> <s> we are something of a repertory company <e> <s> we not only know our own lines but other participants lines as well <e> <s> i very much appreciated the remarks of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i immediately join in the oft expressed sorrow and regret at the horrendous tragedy which befell the challenger her crew and the american people last week <e> <s> it was a price no one should be expected to pay and i mourn the loss of all the human lives and everything else that was concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say anything about the comment i made on the difficulty of british firms receiving contracts from america in the light of american law and in the light of the comments made by john pike to the congressional committee <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that if it was the case that there was a public clamour to get rid of these practices the democratic way would have been to allow elections to proceed in the metropolitan counties and the glc and then we should have seen whether people wanted to abolish those authorities for those purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the noble lord used the phrase a whole generation of schoolchildren <e> <s> would the noble lord care to give us the evidence of the number of schoolchildren who he believes are subjected to that process <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by striking a novel note and announcing that i intend to remain to the end of the debate <e> <s> i shall start as the noble baroness lady cox did when she spoke very sadly about declining standards and about sloppy professionalism selective quotations bias and the grinding of axes <e> <s> however my target is not that of the noble baroness lady cox it is the government the minister and her supporters in the debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks where are the media <e> <s> as far as the press is concerned it has its means of hearing certainly if it heard the earlier speeches <e> <s> there will be that kind of imbalance and bias and an attempt to prejudice that will appear in the press tomorrow <e> <s> there will not be a headline which says <e>", "<cs> my lords against the background that there is a dispute which is grinding on and on i am trying to see what the effect of this debate will be in getting a resolution of the problem <e> <s> who in fact is under attack <e> <s> primarily it is certain teachers <e> <s> we have sought as i did in an intervention to ask members generally to quantify the size of the problem <e> <s> all we have heard from is a small band a number who are influential and insidious <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be the last time and i hope it is the last time but i am talking about history <e> <s> if it is the case that most teachers in schools vote conservative then we must be led to the conclusion that in their professional organisations they are outnumbered out-manoeuvred outvoted and out-argued or that they are taking no interest in such matters either as teachers or as trade unionists or even as parents <e> <s> i cannot believe it <e> <s> i believe that the teaching profession is very caring and very understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not saying it is not available <e> <s> i am simply drawing attention to the fact of its existence <e> <s> as far as ilea is concerned i am told that no one would disagree with the draft circular on politics as outlined in the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important amendment which i believe the house should consider very seriously indeed <e> <s> the report stage provides all members of your lordships house with the opportunity to reflect and i very much hope that the government are also in a reflective mood <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble earl to say that bookshops of which he has knowledge open until pm which at the moment is against the law <e> <s> if in fact it is against the law and this law has been flouted in that way how does the noble earl expect us to believe that future laws will be obeyed <e>", "<cs> my lords we can all learn from experience <e> <s> if the noble earl genuinely believes that it is legal to open until midnight then with great respect i believe he is wrong <e> <s> but not only with respect would traders be wrong to want to do so we come back to the local councils who have a spokesman in this authority who knows that they ought not to do so but yet he does not enforce the law <e> <s> the question remains <e> <s> if the present law is being broken and not enforced by people who are urging that it should be abolished what laws are those people going to enforce in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness chides me for having on one occasion urged protection for small shops while on this amendment i support the principle regardless of the size of shop that they ought to be allowed to open longer than they do at present <e> <s> this is all part of a piece of the defence mechanism of the noble baroness and those who support her complete abandonment of any regulation <e> <s> it goes along the lines that if you start off with the premise that you wish for no restriction at all and on second reading have accepted the principle that you do not accept any restriction there is no amendment of any kind that is tolerable <e> <s> if it is the case that every time you put up any variation from complete deregulation it can be argued we have already agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of a number of factors which one minute of your lordships time will help to resolve <e> <s> it is quite clear that the government are certainly not prepared to look remotely on some very good amendments that have been moved so ably <e> <s> i am looking at the rest of the amendments on the marshalled list amendments nos <e> <s> and which precede the amendments relating to clause <e> <s> i very much hope that when we get to clause noting what the minister has already done there will be scope not only for satisfactory amendments to be moved but for a better response to them from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes the fair point that those who are organised and are able to articulate in retailing have the opportunity to come to collective agreements <e> <s> surely the minister is aware that less than half of those who work in retailing are organised that there are more than a million workers who are not organised in trade unions <e> <s> would the minister care to tell us how those more than one million workers primarily women part-time women workers are going to seek to enjoy the present protections <e>", "<cs> there is no evidence my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a bill for deregulation of shopping hours <e>", "<cs> my lords weekdays and sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords the final words of the noble baroness were that this amendment would provide the employee with the ability to have a number of trial periods to repeat the trial period <e> <s> if the noble baroness had been listening or had read the proceedings of the last debate on this matter she would have found that it is clear that hinged upon the remarks of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes this is an attempt and the noble baroness may be able to point out to me that it is a wrong one to take the once-only option <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may have his background and experience <e> <s> let us take this very slowly <e> <s> that may be of benefit to all of us including myself <e> <s> we have a situation where the law is changed <e> <s> under the changed law the management of a shop such as the director or the owner is legally entitled to open <e> <s> the management says to the workers we would like you to work on a sunday and an amicable agreement is reached <e> <s> later by force of economic circumstance the management decides that it does not wish to open on a sunday <e> <s> that is a unilateral decision <e> <s> he has decided that he does not want the employee to work on a sunday forgetting all the changes that might have been made by that man or woman boy or girl to fit in with the need <e>", "<cs> bombs my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it somewhat astounding that the noble baroness pleads in aid as a means of denigrating the argument that conditions on the streets and in our environment are no more dangerous in than they were for instance in or that in or bombs were dropping in the streets <e> <s> of course they were but that is a different kind of danger <e> <s> i believe the noble baroness by that remark reveals her complete inability to appreciate i do not say accept but appreciate the argument that we are deploying <e>", "<cs> my lords subsection quite clearly indicates that the main body of this amendment does not apply to new workers because the new workers are in a special category and they have signed a contract <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is right <e> <s> as regards the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it quite staggering that those who oppose this amendment are saying that matters relating to the functions of wages councils i do not mean the contents of the wages bill do not properly form part of this debate <e> <s> let me read to the noble baroness something which i am certain is written on her heart which is every word of the auld committees report because that is the bible <e> <s> that has been prayed in aid by the government as their justification not that it gives any <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend rises perhaps i may make an apology to the house <e> <s> earlier today i was party to an understanding that amendments nos <e> <s> and would be moved together <e> <s> inadvertently after an event which caused some excitement to me at least about an hour ago <e> <s> i forgot to brief my noble friend adequately <e> <s> i do apologise <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> my lords i apologise i simply wanted to make sure <e> <s> earlier today my views were sought and i agreed that it would not be inappropriate for amendments nos <e> <s> and to be taken together <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord simon said it is a probing amendment <e> <s> if and when the bill begins to operate i am prepared to acknowledge that many of the fears put to members on this side of the house may prove unfounded <e> <s> apparently those fears have not been put to members on the other side of the house otherwise being fair-minded men and women they would have mentioned them <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point <e> <s> that goes back to the previous amendment which the noble and learned lord did not support <e> <s> some people may agree to work on a sunday but then find that it is not convenient and so wish to break the agreement <e> <s> we thought that we had a form of words to cover the option or the trial period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very satisfied with the tenor and sense of the discussion <e> <s> it will guide us on the remaining amendments that are on the order paper <e> <s> they contain one or two implications <e> <s> i am also conscious of the timescale that has been announced of when for instance we are going to have our own supper or meal break <e> <s> i look to ministers to help me keep the debate going until at least that time <e>", "<cs> my lords not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i know just how cross some benches can be <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my normal tone <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i have misled the house <e> <s> i said that the amendment i moved was in effect the major property of the noble lord lord renton who is sorry not to be here tonight <e> <s> he wishes to see the amendment not pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords that number is going down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister because quite genuinely he has taken great care in marshalling his arguments and he has dealt with all the points that were raised <e> <s> i should remind him that that is against the background that when this amendment appeared at committee stage surprisingly late at night there were eight speakers <e> <s> eight members were moved four of them from the noble ministers side of the committee and they all spoke in strong terms in support <e> <s> it was against that <e>", "<cs> my lords if in fact it is not there i wonder whether the minister could take just half a minute to explain why it was deleted <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house not at all but what we have got in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that if we dislike the waiver rights which are part of the terminology of the discussion in recent months and the bill provides for the worker to waive his rights we shall have to seek some other opportunity either in this house or in another place to test whether that is valid or not <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the noble baroness has found the right set of notes because i fear that we are going to hear the same set of notes on a different bill <e> <s> in fact this was a dress rehearsal <e> <s> it is quite ludicrous <e> <s> this may be a principle which the noble baroness and her advisers do not like <e> <s> in any one week of seven days an employee who works on six days one of which is a sunday will be entitled to the two days off in the next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for taking the care that he has <e> <s> i should simply like to remind him that the amendment that we have made to the original paragraph which was superseded by the new paragraph requires to be studied with care by those outside the house as well as the minister studying what has been said here <e> <s> in the spirit in which he has said without any commitment whatsoever that he will see whether the points that he believes were due to be met have been met i shall want to take advice from outside the house as to whether the concerns of those outside are being met in the bill <e> <s> i thank the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall his announcements during the passage of the royal ordnance factories privatisation legislation that powers were taken to limit to a maximum of per cent <e> <s> the share in foreign ownership <e> <s> in view of that undertaking then and the advice that we received yesterday and today on this matter how can the minister square his previous announcements with his statement today <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel like inviting the minister to make a statement which i am sure might put most of us out of our misery <e> <s> i am sure that this is within his gift not only having listened to the speeches but also having read the report <e> <s> i wish to begin by expressing what has already been said about our indebtedness to the noble earl of seizing this opportunity just as his honourable friend and indeed my friend from earler days mr toby jessel did in another place <e> <s> both have shown themselves assidouus in making sure that if the wrong decision is made this will not be due to any failure by members in both houses to lay before the minister and his advisers what are the facts <e> <s> the noble earl spent his time factually fairly and i believe powerfully in setting out the case <e> <s> he did not weary the house with a long history of exchanges questions and arguments <e> <s> we are indebted to him <e> <s> i want to underline also our indebtedness and that of the constituents of mr toby jessel at twickenham for the tireless efforts that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to say whether any account was taken of the dual role of royal marine trained bandsmen <e> <s> for instance in the recent falklands war they provided a valuable service of first aid and ambulance facilities etc <e> <s> surely that is a factor that needs to be taken into account when looking at the cost of deal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister for information on the statistics that were provided by his own statisticians which were at such <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is not a shred of evidence to back up this story why does not the minister say precisely that <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> the faith that the minister and the noble and learned lord have in the phrase have regard to or the phrase due regard which the minister used staggers me <e> <s> i should be more interested if we could quantify or measure such phrases <e> <s> the town clerk may say to the chairman before you take the decision you must have due regard to a range of matters and the chairman may reply that due regard has been given to them <e> <s> but how do we measure due regard <e> <s> the phrase is designed as a cover-up or a cop-out <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the minister tell the committee what needs to be taken into account and how long should be spent on weighing or measuring due regard <e> <s> can he tell us how many original intentions of a local authority committee or a chairman have been thwarted after due regard has been given to representations <e>", "<cs> or give it an aura of respectability <e> <s> in my humble opinion the minister is demonstrating the shoals of uncertainty that will flow from attempting to have due regard to <e> <s> he is absolutely right legislation is studded and pitted with references to having due regard <e> <s> i simply want him to tell us how that due regard is to be taken <e>", "<cs> i made something of the words having due regard because the minister rests on the premise that if one had due regard to a great many other things everything would be all right <e> <s> i am speaking to the amendment in the sense that we are saying that the only action of a council which ought to cause reflection is that which is quite clearly <e>", "<cs> taking the second point first i know what the bill says and i heard what the minister said <e> <s> the minister used the words have due regard not particular regard <e> <s> that could have been a slip <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord lord broxbourne has made <e> <s> particular regard are stronger words <e> <s> i sense that the minister has moved ever so slightly <e> <s> i am genuinely puzzled as to the precise way in which a council committee which is in effect what we are talking about will be advised about authorising publicity <e> <s> i am puzzled as to what is the due regard or the particular regard <e>", "<cs> that is strong language <e>", "<cs> that is a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take this opportunity to remind the house and millions outside that getting out of government has gone too far with this government and that what we need is a minister for sport <e> <s> will the minister also note that many of the less glamorous sports organisations such as the british judo council for example require encouragement and support <e> <s> will he assure them and others outside that he intends to give encouragement to small organisations with small followings of people as well as the large ones <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill is read a second time and i certainly would support that may i ask the chairman of committees to ask the select committee which will receive this bill to pay particular attention to clauses and <e> <s> clause is entitled control of noisy unloading <e> <s> all sensible people would agree with any council that seeks to diminish the nuisance from noise during the hours which are sought that is pm to am <e> <s> in the instance of exeter i am advised by the co-operative society which serves exeter that is co-operative retail services and also i understand other traders that they are very gravely concerned at finding themselves at fault under this bill if they are unable to transact their business from am <e> <s> the house may well be aware that modern retailing very often demands that supplies of fresh foods are brought to large stores early in the day <e> <s> consequently there is a danger that not only this business but others will be disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i share the views of many noble lords who want to pay tribute to the manner in which the noble lord the minister has steered this bill through the house <e> <s> he deserves a far better bill <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords given the importance of the british and french independent deterrents in the nuclear disarmament debate what has been the nature of the participation by the british government in the discussions between the super powers <e> <s> are we invited to comment and what do we say <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a double pleasure first in acknowledging the debt that the house owes to the noble viscount lord torrington and secondly to echo the words that have already been said so eloquently by the previous speaker in congratulating the noble viscount lord chilston on his maiden speech <e> <s> as the noble viscount will have gathered and one senses these things he was very well received <e> <s> he was also very well listened to by those in the film-making business <e> <s> i noticed that behind him sat the noble viscount lord mersey who is a film-maker and opposite was the noble lord lord aylestone who brings to this house his experience as a former chairman of the iba <e> <s> there are many in the house with some experience in these matters <e>", "<cs> what about monte carlo my lords <e>", "<cs> what about liechtenstein my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords he is seated on the steps of the throne <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch prevailed upon the minister to take this debate seriously <e> <s> i make no such plea because i know the minister and i know that he intends to take the debate very seriously indeed <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not arguing that in all circumstances the ultimate use of nuclear weapons must be wholly abandoned not unilaterally <e> <s> our posture is one of discussion and negotiation and we support the negotiations that are taking place at this particular time <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that it would be right to violate the protocol <e> <s> i am saying that i want the minister to explain to the house why in that exclusion was made and why it has been maintained in the policy of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side certainly appreciate the intention of the government and the minister in trying to clarify some uncertainties as to the impact one upon the other of the use by a council of powers under sections and <e> <s> once we have got over the hurdle of the great gap and difference in the philosophy behind the bill in responding to these amendments what we ask the minister is whether he fully understands what they will mean in practice in a number of areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the expenditure of the p rate <e> <s> the minister is seeking fairly to provide a mechanism for boroughs for instance in london to carry on that kind of job creation work once the glc has gone but still within the p rate <e> <s> what do they do at the moment within the p rate and what scope have they <e> <s> no matter how much is given or how complicated are the formulae which are being grappled with in town halls we still come back to the central point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> what i am concerned about is for instance even the marginal cost of publicity <e> <s> we are talking about the appropriateness of expenditure on publicity under section <e> <s> it is quite properly related to the principle of the section expenditure <e> <s> what i am saying to the minister is that without taking on the extra responsibility of taking the devolved responsibilities from the metropolitan authorities even the marginal cost of the publicity which might be needed we are told could very well be too much <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a reasonable case of the removal of doubt <e> <s> however we are here looking at current practices against the background that some practices and purposes are objected to including publicity that can be seen if not wholly then substantially to have a political purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise so that the noble lord may better read the note which has just come from the box <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a particularly nasty new clause <e> <s> i certainly hope that the minister will have no truck with it <e>", "<cs> i will explain why at length <e>", "<cs> and clearly <e> <s> clearly at length <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to remove from councils the powers they have for what is called contract compliance <e> <s> contract compliance is comparatively new in this country but not new in many other

baroness is aware that every year when there are changes in the rent and rates each council tenant is advised of those changes <e> <s> in other words at least once a year the tenant is made aware of

establishments stems from inadequate manning levels <e> <s> for instance at styal of separate establishments are left unmanned at night <e> <s> will the minister take this opportunity of refuting statements in the press that the removal of the governor was campaigned for by prison officers <e> <s> will he say that this is in fact a statement without any foundation whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords

was quoting <e> <s> i simply want to say that the member representing the area of direct concern in plymouth has certainly indicated to the other place and i simply report to this house that the

understanding is that it was the managing director of rosyth who gave the advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the minister that there will be no difficulties though there will be differences between us in ensuring a speedy passage of this bill through your lordships house because we on this side of the chamber and indeed noble lords from all sides of the house recognise that a bill of this kind is an integral part not only of our legislation but of the proper conduct of discipline in the armed forces <e> <s> though this bill is simply a piece of legislation to us we believe that it is of vital interest to those who are serving in the armed forces and more importantly so far as concerns the minister to those whom he seeks to attract to serve <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reflect that while the prison department manages budgets governors and prison officers have to manage men and violent and dangerous men at that <e> <s> will the minister not agree that a ballot held in conformity with the governments own legislation giving the poa executive a majority of per cent <e> <s> for industrial action is a powerful mandate <e> <s> the voice is not the voice of the poa executive it is the voice of the members of the poa <e> <s> will the minister accept that the offer made by the prison officers association late last night was both statesmanlike and responsible and that his right honourable friend would do well to follow the pattern then set by the prison officers <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the level of overtime has been and is an emotive issue does the noble lord the minister now appreciate that the working of overtime is called for wholly in the interests of the prison service and that hitherto prison officers have worked overtime to avoid the kind of situation that occurred yesterday <e> <s> now that the prospects of talks has emerged does the noble lord the minister accept that prison officers recognise their great responsibility to the service prisoners the public and their members and that there must be a successful outcome to the talks <e> <s> i wish the home secretary and the prison officers a fair and honourable resolution acceptable to both parties <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> of course you can <e>", "<cs> my lords noting the interest in the empty council properties will the minister comment on the fact that the largest number of empty dwellings are owned by the government that the next largest number of empty dwellings are in the private rented sector and that the smallest sector that has properties which are empty and not let is the council sector <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness describe how the signing of these protocols has in any way influenced armament policy among the various signatories <e> <s> can she reconcile the use of nuclear weapons with what is said on page of protocol i article <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that on st march last year at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords when i came to look at the subject of the debate this evening i was struck by the fact that i speak from this particular place on defence and on sport and i wondered what my colleagues were doing in giving me a brief either on defence or on sport <e> <s> i think it is a brief on the defence of sport because the noble lord lord trefgarne appears in his ministerial role at some stage not that the problem started from his visit but certainly the solution to the problem that we are now considering flowed from his proper ministerial interest in the matter <e> <s> i am delighted to see with us tonight the noble earl lord caithness who introduces a third dimension that of transport because of course that is his specialism <e>", "<cs> my lords they were not lost within the zone <e> <s> i wish the house to appreciate the quality of the management and the skill of those who point to the need for keeping out glider pilots and glider organisations because of the manner in which they have managed their resources <e> <s> no doubt the minister is well aware of the background <e> <s> i am told however that this is usaf upper heyford data <e> <s> if it is disputed i can only say that it is the advice that i have been given <e> <s> it is fair to say that fs have been very much in the news of late and much interest is therefore taken in them <e> <s> we have been advised through briefings from the mod to mps who are in effect the public who include parliamentarians like ourselves that the f in its landing or take-off attitude is widely known to have poor visibility through its canopy <e> <s> the pilots have therefore to rely on their instruments and advice from air traffic control to detect and to avoid other airspace users <e> <s> these are i am told the words of the mod <e> <s> i find this incredible <e> <s> i put it to the minister that if as is suggested pilots have to rely on instruments and air traffic control advice because they cannot see out of the fs this means that the aircraft could not be certified and would not be much use as a fighter <e> <s> perhaps the minister can say tonight or can write to me later to say how if this is so the mod was able to advise mps <e>", "<cs> my lords the size of this zone is almost comparable to that which surrounds heathrow <e> <s> if the minister is concerned with safety would he also acknowledge that as one excludes gliders from the area then immediately outside the area there is built up a volume of traffic which is greater than is proper <e> <s> so as one takes away the possible danger inside one is helping to create further problems on the perimeter <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept completely what the minister has said <e> <s> however i shall send to him the correspondence that i have seen where a number of the bodies which the minister has said have written in support are party to contrary views to that having expressed it in some other way <e> <s> i appreciate that the minister is in receipt of information that he has been given i am in receipt of information that i have been given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> if one of the problems is an unidentified aircraft which could have caused accidents how is one able to lay blame on the fact that the unidentified aircraft was a glider <e> <s> if at the end of the six months one looks at the record and if it is similar to the record of previous periods where one has unidentified aircraft likely to cause risks how is one able to say in the future any more than in the past that the planes causing the risks are gliders <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl glided over that very nicely <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the minister will have good news for the committee <e> <s> however having read the ministers remarks during the second reading debate and from conversations that i have had i suspect that there may not be a great deal dividing us <e> <s> i am prepared to believe that it is the intention of the minister and the government to seek to perpetuate some kind of structure to allow the articulation of the consumer voice <e> <s> i am strengthened in that view when i look at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i hesitated long enough for the noble lord lord swinfen to make his very effective intervention <e> <s> it gives this piece of legislation a warm welcome <e> <s> from these benches we do so too <e>", "<cs> my lords while i share the thrust of the question by my noble friend lord molloy will the minister take this opportunity of condemning the imperialism of libya of syria of iraq and of morocco who all occupy sovereign territory of neighbouring arab states <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i acknowledge the constraints under which the minister must operate in that respect does he not recognise that the take-over of screen entertainments by cannon presents both a crisis and a challenge <e> <s> government action in recent years in abolishing the eady levy and capital allowances has not helped <e> <s> on the positive side with the emergence of cannon as a major force in the british film industry may we be assured that her majestys government will be urging cannon to help sustain a british film industry by making quality films here in britain by keeping cinemas open and not closing them and more importantly by preserving the historical movietone film library <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing that i would wish to do would be to pour cold water on the prospects of reviving the fortunes of the british film-making industry <e> <s> i only hope that the government will not stand idly by and that they will seek positive discussions with the new owners in order that their aspirations may be brought about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and also for his helpful letter on the subject which i received recently <e> <s> however does the minister not accept that by the very nature of the community programme projects the programme will rely heavily on the involvement of small to medium building companies <e> <s> to that extent does the minister not accept also that it is crucial that the federation of master builders be deeply involved in making the programme a success <e> <s> bearing in mind that the commission has already had discussions with the range of bodies that the minister has outlined will he assure the house that no firm action will be taken until there have been the discussions that he mentioned with the federation of master builders <e>", "<cs> before we allow clause to stand part of the bill i intend to raise with the minister a matter of crucial significance for many outside the chamber <e> <s> as the marshalled list shows amendment no <e> <s> stands in my name but i have been advised that its terms do not fall within the proper rules of debate in other words it is out of order <e> <s> therefore it is not my intention to move it <e> <s> but this question provides me and i believe many others with the opportuniy to look in essence at the matters raised in that amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble countess was here when i first rose to my feet when i said that it was my intention to deal head on with that issue in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however the amendment that i have tabled is due to follow the debate on clause which substitutes the words <e>", "<cs> because this is the committee stage i am entitled to make a few more observations <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister and for the forbearance and tolerance of the chamber which recognises that this is a very important matter <e> <s> the minister provides us with the reason why we should not let this opportunity go by <e> <s> he talks in terms of reporting just as soon as possible but that kind of language this is not meant to be offensive has been used frequently over the past period <e>", "<cs> i certainly intend to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> the last thing that i would say is that the minister is sanguine <e> <s> i appreciate from what he said that steps are being taken <e> <s> but despite that the minister is aware that the number of british servicemen convicted of drug-related offences in military and civil courts has risen from in to in <e> <s> the minister might say that that is a better record than in civilian life that is a doubling <e> <s> it may very well be so but it is a matter for concern <e> <s> the item which i have read from the <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> the minister has had the opportunity to explain not just to the committee but to the wider world outside that the government to the same extent that it is possible do not agree to any extent with discrimination whether it is on sectarian or any other grounds <e> <s> i am quite certain that the question of race relations as well as equal opportunities and other rights which are enjoyed are equally applicable and are made available to members of the armed services <e> <s> certainly those outside your lordships chamber having heard the minister should recognise that if they know of instances and have evidence to support those instances which they believe are contrary to what the minister has said they have a responsibility not only to those who come to them with complaints but also to the minister and to the government in <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord the minister for his remarks but i am somewhat puzzled because i am still unclear as to the extent to which mutiny is capable of being defined or understood <e> <s> in my view what the minister has said is not on all fours with the words that appear in the act <e>", "<cs> i was hoping for at least one supporter but i did not hear one <e>", "<cs> no but the arguments deserve to deployed <e> <s> i was intrigued by the noble and learned lord lord denning who disclosed passionately where he stands on the issue <e> <s> if he had been in this chamber or in another place in he would have voted against the law of the land <e> <s> the impression he gave which i am sure the <e>", "<cs> even if i am wrong i shall continue with my attempt <e> <s> we are seeking to apply to service life as much as possible of what applies to civilian life <e> <s> my case was made by the noble lord lord elton when on second reading of the prosecution of offences bill on th november he said <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend is right <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for pointing out some good reasons as to why it would be wrong to carry this amendment <e> <s> if the purpose of bringing this forward is to permit a march on all fours with civilian legislation we have to provide the appropriate government ministers with the opportunity to reflect <e> <s> i am grateful also to the minister for saying that at first sight there are perhaps some aspects of the amendment that may commend themselves to ministers <e> <s> those outside the committee will read what the minister has said and will guide me as to the actions they might wish to take <e> <s> my advice to them is that they should not look a gift horse in the mouth <e> <s> the half promise that we have been given by the minister that he will look sympathetically at the matter is i suspect the best offer that i will be given today <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady faithfull clearly trying to be helpful wrapped together her observations on the amendment which i moved and on the question whether clause stand part <e> <s> i hope that the minister will deal with them separately <e> <s> indeed we may have to deal with them separately <e>", "<cs> perhaps the initiative as to whether clause shall stand part of the bill lies with the noble baroness but i certainly have a view which i shall indicate to the committee <e> <s> regarding the amendment that i moved which initiated this debate i am satisfied and i believe that the noble baroness lady faithfull will be satisfied with the caveat that we shall read very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> in fact our own researches and those outside may satisfy us that substantially the points we sought to be made are already covered <e> <s> in that case the minister and his advisers have done us a good service for which i express my appreciation and i do not wish to press amendment no <e> <s> which i have moved <e>", "<cs> the noble lord obviously speaks from experience <e> <s> i do not know from which side of the table he speaks from but i take the point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister because as he points out the procedure in another place was known to me and on reflection perhaps one ought to have left it at that <e> <s> but i took the view that having read the proceedings of the select committee i wanted to take part to raise matters and to have the assurances which the minister has given <e> <s> there are people and certainly organisations outside this place who despite what has happened in another place seek to get support for their point of view by <e>", "<cs> the minister confirms what i feared that is i was chancing my arm <e> <s> however the table having accepted the amendment and not as with the earlier amendment amendment no <e> <s> having advised me that it was out of order i felt it was not unreasonble <e> <s> the minister has said that the substance is something on which he is at least prepared to give an answer if i put the matter to him in another way <e> <s> of course i do not propose to press this amendment <e> <s> however may i say to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that we have had a very useful period of almost four hours really on a matter which is crucial that is how our armed forces are going to be guided by a code of discipline which affects not only themselves and their families <e>", "<cs> it has persuaded me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am disappointed by the dismissive nature of the ministers comments and also by those of the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> if i gave other than the impression that i believe it would be a good thing for trade unions i am guilty of misleading the committee <e> <s> i never said that there is a demand either from the trade union movement or from the armed forces <e> <s> when one looks at the experience of other countries one sees invariably that there is a no-strike clause <e> <s> a range of things is contained in the arrangements which are made <e> <s> one of the matters that has disappointed me in reading this report is the extent to which the mod believes there is very little it can learn from experience elsewhere or be told by anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not wish to agree with that for two reasons <e> <s> the first is a matter to which i did not refer directly the report by mr calcutt on the methods of interrogation in respect of airmen in cyprus <e> <s> i do not refer to the detail of the case <e> <s> the minister knows how disappointed many people are that that report was not available before the concluding stages of the bill in another place <e> <s> we were not led to believe that is right but we hoped that we would have it before today <e> <s> certainly in the light of that report there may be grounds on which we would put forward amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of her majestys government does the noble lord the minister find any satisfaction in revealing such job increases when as a result of the same governments policies more than million people have been made unemployed since <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have enjoyed listening to the debate which has been stimulating <e> <s> i have been very impressed by the manner in which perhaps sometimes by accident we have covered almost all the questions that could be asked at this stage <e> <s> i want to begin as others have done by expressing gratitude to the noble baroness lady nicol not only for initiating the debate but also for the splendid way in which she laid down the markers <e> <s> the minister may very well have been able to anticipate them by the words that form the motion nevertheless that will provide him with a further opportunity of commenting later <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that if these changes really do reduce the burdens on small businessmen they will certainly receive a welcome from me <e> <s> would he bear in mind that up to now there has been an intolerable burden often a stupid burden carried by small businesses particularly in having to carry out regulations from the dhss <e> <s> we want the burdens to be lifted not shifted from the government on to small businesses <e> <s> can the minister also say something about how sanguine he might be at a time when local councils are under great pressures to reduce staff and to reduce costs that in relaxing planning applications there may be a danger of getting a proliferation of such non-conforming industry types as the use of industrial sewing machines and the carrying on of car sales and repairs in residential areas which will certainly not be what is wanted by the people who live there <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first congratulate the noble lord lord trefgarne on a step up in the pecking order in the ministry of defence <e> <s> i do not know whether any money is involved or whether it carries anything but even if it <e>", "<cs> if the government are in danger of making fools of themselves it is not part of my brief tonight to intervene <e> <s> however i think that the minister needs to deal with this matter head on <e> <s> we are talking about the consequences of the bill that those with whom the noble lord has had conversations have said will follow if the amendment remains unamended <e> <s> those who are carrying on a profession in this country are subject to our laws <e> <s> if in future they are to be at a disadvantage in comparison with those with whom they compete in that profession internationally under their laws we surely do not legislate to put our people and our business at a disadvantage <e> <s> if the minister accepts that that is the effect of the bill and the amendments he will surely want to get this right <e> <s> that might mean satisfying the interests of those outside who say that they have got it wrong as well as changing the form of the bill <e>", "<cs> this is a committee stage and i assume that i am able to make more than one contribution <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the minister said to the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> he was saying that when we see the advance licence it will be in such a form as to put the british company in the same position as a foreign company <e> <s> the rights and responsibilities which have to be accepted by the british company before they are as free as a foreign company to dive on a designated ship in international waters will be minimal but will be so unconstrained that in effect they will be on a par <e> <s> if that is the case i am reasonably reassured <e>", "<cs> so far as i and my noble friends on this side are concerned we also are grateful for the progress which has been made and which the noble lord lord sandford quite fairly has read into the record because it is important that those outside the house not only hear what we have to say but also know what is the ministers response <e> <s> there is no question of bad faith or lack of good faith in what is going on but when people outside express anxieties even though they may not have had the experience we have of the present minister and his advisers and their integrity in these matters it is right that their anxieties should be placed on the record <e>", "<cs> it is except that referring again to what the noble lord lord sandford said it is vital for the code of practice to be seen and agreed and to become operable at the same time as the issue of the licence <e> <s> they are both part and parcel of <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the noble viscount lord trenchard who obviously speaks with much experience of industry in general will forgive those like myself who as often as we can during the debates and as the night wears on will profess that we are not as well equipped as he is to understand not only the nature of the bill but also the views on the irrelevance of the amendments <e> <s> there was a certain petulance in the outburst of the noble viscount lord trenchard and almost impatience <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> the minister criticises the amendment on two grounds <e> <s> first he says that it is unspecific when it refers to standards of customer service <e> <s> perhaps the minister is leading us to believe that if the amendment had been more specific and had spelled out the standards of customer service that we have in mind it may have been more acceptable <e> <s> but then the minister went on to point out that it would need to be a very good extension of those words to fit what is already in the bill in other words if we had spelled it out <e> <s> that spelling out is already covered in the range of matters to which the minister was kind enough to draw our attention <e>", "<cs> the minister asks the committee to recognise that at a later stage we may perhaps see something much more positive and concrete but we are now debating amendments nos <e> <s> a and b which relate to specific matters on which it is absolutely crucial that certain members of our community should be satisfied <e> <s> from my own experience as a parliamentarian and not only in this chamber i certainly know that there are members of our community who need to be satisfied and their families need to be satisfied that it is recognised that they are in a special position and that by virtue of their age or disability they require special treatment <e>", "<cs> i did not think that the noble lord had <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> the first time i turned to the detail of amendment no <e> <s> b was when the noble lord the minister referred to it <e> <s> i am certain that he was trying to be helpful but i take the point and i shall leave my remarks on that amendment until later <e>", "<cs> the minister used as one of his arguments for not imposing these duties that the public gas supplier will be in competition with other forms of energy <e> <s> if we believe in the concept of energy efficiency and the development and promotion of energy efficient appliances why in the area in which we can have some input do we decide not to do that <e> <s> it is said that it would be unfair <e> <s> but it is a challenge <e> <s> it might he seen to be onerous but we are talking in terms of a massive concept <e>", "<cs> i very much hope the minister will reflect upon what he has said <e> <s> he has <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> people are telling me of the kind of people who are to be affected and for whom this clause is designed <e> <s> i used as an illustration those people for whom the request to pay more than one months supply estimated would be too much <e> <s> the minister says that those are not at all the kind of people for whom it is designed it is the kind of people to whom the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes referred <e> <s> where is this clarified in the bill <e> <s> all it says is that someone who wishes to obtain a supply of gas shall be called upon to make a payment <e> <s> we are debating the size of the payment <e> <s> the minister can tell me from where he gets the evidence on which he indicates the kind of people concerned <e> <s> it is his own idea of the kind of people <e> <s> my idea of the kind of people are the ones i have described for whom a limit in the size of the deposit is necessary <e>", "<cs> i too see a great deal of merit in the amendment though i am bound to say that it raises some questions <e> <s> for instance line states <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord reflect on the additional burdens or as we understand it the existing burdens that already fall within the purview of the director <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to take away not the power or the stature of the director but the sheer weight of what could be termed minor responsibilities in the context of his being the prime person in charge of a massive industry <e> <s> i know that not all the decisions which fall on the office of the director will be taken by that one man <e> <s> however the minister in his concluding remarks alluded to this matter by saying that he will have staff <e> <s> he will need a big staff and they will all need to be managed controlled and directed <e> <s> they will be the directors staff <e>", "<cs> the minister puzzles me because if he understands what we are trying to say then surely he must understand that in no way does one wish to whittle away at the ultimate responsibility and power or at the necessity for a decision to be taken in the way that the bill lays down <e> <s> however we are concerned about the stature and standing of the consumer council <e>", "<cs> i take the opposite view <e> <s> there should be no danger that a consumer will be charged rent for a meter to which he has no access if it goes wrong because of a fault in the meter not vandalism <e> <s> the supplier responsible is adequately protected on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> the minister once more pleads maximum flexibility for the supplier even if protecting that flexibility imposes a rigidity upon the ability of the consumers council to do a more effective job <e> <s> he stresses again that the role of the consumers council is substantially to react to complaints <e> <s> the trigger mechanism for the consumers council in the words of the minister is merely to react <e> <s> we see the consumers council role as being much more than that <e> <s> there is a fertile area to be tilled and looked after between the supplier and the consumers council <e> <s> we are not talking of conflicts of function or conflicts of power <e> <s> we are talking about elevating and enhancing the stature of the consumers council in the eyes of the supplier the director and the government but equally importantly in the eyes of the consumer <e> <s> we are not talking of the creation of a complaints committee or a complaints procedure which is then called the consumers council <e> <s> we are concerned to give it some real functions and some real responsibilities <e> <s> these will be responsible people <e>", "<cs> the minister has been helpful in pointing out current practice and the intention but i see nothing wrong with the practice advocated in the amendment <e> <s> i believe that the minister once again overstates the burden that will fall upon the supplier if we were to carry some of our amendments <e> <s> he said that the provision would be grossly unfair and damaging to suppliers <e> <s> all that the amendment seeks to do particularly at the top of page in subsection a is to prevent the public gas supplier having <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the minister would deal with this point if i have it right <e> <s> the amendment proposes that disconnection shall not take place until a court order has been obtained <e> <s> in order to obtain the court order the case has to be made that it is not unreasonable to disconnect <e> <s> under present practices the supplier needs to be satisfied that he has a grievance <e> <s> this will mainly be the non-payment of bills <e> <s> he then disconnects <e> <s> the minister says there is no difference <e> <s> for the person in trouble whether he has the right to plead his case before an independent arbitrator namely the court or whether he has no redress the fact is that he is given notice <e> <s> when he fails to pay within days he is given a final demand <e> <s> he fails to pay and he is then disconnected <e> <s> there is surely an enormous difference <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether i have got the difference right between the practice which he believes will work and that which this amendment seeks to carry out <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for attempting as he says twice to convince me that the practices which will be carried out under the bill are no less fair to the person involved than is our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us an assurance that when the review takes place the question of conditional disposals in contested take-over bids where a bidder attempts to sell off part of the target company without its consent will be looked at very closely <e> <s> this is a matter that was alluded to by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> will the minister note for instance the current situation where dixons in an attempt to purchase woolworths have already made arrangements to sell off comet and that this quite clearly is designed to keep themselves within the law and avoid a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a mean and repugnant bill <e> <s> it is shoddy and shabby <e> <s> it is worthy of this government <e> <s> it is an attack on the living standards of the poorest in this community and those who presently have to suffer from low wages <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will be good enough to give way <e> <s> is the noble lord prepared to produce any evidence <e> <s> if in fact all that we have are premises then surely we are dealing merely with dogma and doctrine <e> <s> where is the evidence that the bill will produce the extra work that will absorb unemployed people <e>", "<cs> the minister says come on <e> <s> if the noble lord is able to assure the committee that with the arrangements that he and his colleagues have in mind there is not the slightest possibility that in future the management of nuclear and radiological safety will not be as satisfactory as it has been in the past i believe that many people including myself will at least be satisfied with that aspect of the bill <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have contributed <e> <s> perhaps i did not take sufficient care in my opening speech to say in essence what it was we were seeking to achieve by this amendment <e> <s> in essence whatever other changes are envisaged in the bill this amendment seeks to leave untouched the arrangements in the dockyards for servicing our nuclear and radiological installations <e> <s> in other words and the noble lord makes a fair point that means splitting up the dockyards <e> <s> that is right <e> <s> what i am saying is that it is preferable to split up the dockyards than to transfer to a non-governmental agency the control supervision and management of nuclear and radiological safety <e>", "<cs> i have only a few comments before my noble friend reaches his final conclusion <e> <s> the minister made a fair point as to why given the authority of the act we did not come quicker to the concept that a trading fund solution for the dockyards was the answer <e> <s> surely the minister must acknowledge that the first experiment or experience was the royal ordnance factories which came following the act <e> <s> the period up to was not a long period <e>", "<cs> it may have seemed long to the minister but not half as long as the subsequent period has been to me <e> <s> we now have a situation where the options are open <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning quite fairly and comprehensively told us what are those options <e> <s> the minister fairly referred to the workforce <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning pointed out how crucial is the workforce <e> <s> it is not that the workforce would be unhappy with any other solution <e> <s> the workers are realistic and are saying that their preferred solution would be the trading fund <e> <s> in other words given that there has to be change of a fundamental nature and i say it should be to a trading fund <e> <s> although people are pooh-poohing how fundamental it is it is a fundamental change from the present <e>", "<cs> it is a fair offer <e>", "<cs> i would simply say to the noble lord the minister that the thrust of the amendment certainly commends itself to those on these benches <e> <s> the minister is in fact invited to consider ways in which the workforce can feel even more that they are part of the action than they have been in the past <e> <s> that is an laudable objective <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister will tell the committee how the magic figure of seven years was chosen as opposed to five or nine years <e> <s> clearly there must have been factors which led to that decision experience consultation or even a hunch must all have come into the consideration <e> <s> however someone must have said that seven years was right taking into account a number of factors because although the contractor will not have to provide an enormous amount of fixed stock and fixed assets he will have to do a lot of planning find a lot of money and go to a lot of trouble <e>", "<cs> before we proceed may i say that my attention was momentarily distracted when i believe the noble lord the minister answered one of my points namely whether any contractors who had originally showed some interest and had made progress had decided to withdraw late in the day <e> <s> i was given and appreciate a list of those still in and i took the point that they wanted more than five years which is why we have seven years but was there anyone actually involved who decided to withdraw late in the day <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and in particular to the noble and learned <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister satisfies me substantially but my understanding is that each trade specification is assessed jointly by management and the trade unions concerned <e> <s> can the minister tell the committee whether in the future there is a part to be played by established trade union machinery <e> <s> i am not referring to negotiations and wages but there must be some kind of current <e>", "<cs> so far as i am concerned i take the ministers assurances at their face value <e> <s> he understands that there is every intention on the part of those who are concerned with scrutinising the contract that it will be fulfilled and met <e> <s> if it is met there is no problem <e> <s> however i have already pointed out a number of ways in which problems can arise <e> <s> ministers are always loath to write on the face of a bill what are small commitments compared to the totality of the bill <e> <s> of course it begins to look a hotch-potch <e> <s> i am anxious that those who are concerned in plymouth and rosyth and particularly in the trade unions affected will carefully read what the minister said and if they are not satisfied and i understand that dissatisfaction i shall certainly come back with a comparable amendment on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the members of the committee who have spoken and to the minister <e> <s> i accept his understanding absolutely <e> <s> the problem is that two years ago the minister who is now sitting next to him gave comparable assurances when we were dealing with the privatisation of the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> they were the same kind of assurances that discussions were in train between management and trades unions which were certain to lead to understandings and agreements <e> <s> i have to tell the minister that two years later no such agreements on procedure machinery and consultation have yet been reached <e>", "<cs> we have only asked the minister to write or to authorise a letter to spell this out <e> <s> people outside the house can read in <e>", "<cs> i assure the minister that it is not my intention tonight to press this amendment <e> <s> but those outside the chamber advise me that the matter should be taken further <e> <s> we understand the reality of parliamentary arithmetic and we shall not waste the time of the committee or do anything which at the end of the day may be counterproductive <e> <s> a sensible atmosphere has pervaded the committee this evening <e> <s> we wish to demonstrate that we are as full of good intentions as is the minister <e> <s> i accept his offer that so far as he can and i realise there are limits to how far he can go he will attempt to satisfy the worries of those outside the chamber by a letter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister rests his case on the right of future management to manage <e> <s> i have listed the matters upon which the current management has felt it proper to have agreements with the trade unions pay overtime and travel to work <e> <s> i do not believe that we are contemplating an enhancement of those terms when future management has the right to manage <e> <s> the right to manage means if not a licence to reduce certainly the freedom to reduce <e> <s> without the guarantee that i am seeking to put into the bill the workers conditions are worth nothing <e> <s> i intend to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will accept the sense of what we are trying to say <e> <s> the methods of procedure followed in this chamber primarily involve majorities and not necessarily force of argument and if the government have got this right and have the parliamentary approval that they need what we say to the minister is before you proceed tell us what you have done with the authority that we have given you <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning as he very often does perceptively drew attention to one or two areas about which we need to be satisfied <e> <s> the secretary of state will then be able to persuade us in presenting the orders that he has faithfully kept to the provisions of the bill the undertakings the contract and so on <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister confirm the point made by the noble lord lord crawshaw and myself there will be two different forms of pension scheme one superior and one inferior <e> <s> new employees will be members of a fund which is different from that of those who have transferred <e> <s> if that is to be the position one assumes that people making the same contributions doing the same work and having the same skills will receive different pensions because they are members of two different funds <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press my amendment not least because there are matters upon which the committee will await with interest the actions of the minister concerning amendments which <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am as disturbed as is the noble lord lord mayhew that the minister uses the phrase completely disrupt <e> <s> how do we know that if the amendment were carried it would completely disrupt unless one has done some homework and has some idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i will get out my cuttings and ask the ministry of defence to clarify what is contained in them <e> <s> if there was no one under the age of actually engaged in the fighting <e>", "<cs> no soldiers my lords <e> <s> the royal marines would be upset if they were not classified as soldiers in this context <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords so what we have is a joke made about boys under the age of fighting not only for their lives but for ours who apparently are not included when i make a general remark <e> <s> if we are saying that there are royal marines and members of the royal navy who are under the age of who were fighting then my case is made <e>", "<cs> my lords methinks the minister doth protest too much <e> <s> he is saying that there is a creed that all advancement is on merit <e> <s> over the coming weeks he will need to consider answers to the questions that i shall table <e> <s> we are led to believe that those with a black skin or of ethnic minority are persistently and universally in comparison with white people less able and inferior and that is a matter of serious concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is not replying <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like every other preceding speaker i rise to begin what i have to say by offering my sincere congratulations to the two noble lords who have given us their maiden speeches today <e> <s> i think i can best describe them by saying that it has been an enjoyable experience <e> <s> all of us who have gone through this process will understand the tensions and the preparation involved but if at the end of the day or on any other occasion colleagues come up to one and say i enjoyed what you had to say i believe that is an accolade <e> <s> i enjoyed what i heard from our two maiden speakers today and i look forward to hearing from them again <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister and to my noble friend for rising in the gap on the list of speakers to take up just a minute or two of your lordships time <e> <s> it was only today that my attention was drawn to some aspects of the bill by the association of london authorities <e> <s> i happen to be its president and therefore declare that tangential interest in the matter <e> <s> the association drew my attention to the bill and asked me to deal with one or two aspects not of car parking in general but of the use of meters in the environs of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful and understand the problem but i should be grateful if the minister would give the assurance that if the association of london authorities feel that it has a useful contribution to make in dealing with this problem then he and his colleagues will be happy to meet the association to discuss these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that we are talking in terms of housing shortage and crisis <e> <s> will he justify the morality of refusing councils the freedom to spend their own money in providing houses with cash that has been raised from the sale of houses <e> <s> if the noble lord is arguing that to release all the money now would be catastrophic the reason that it has accumulated is that government policy has not allowed it to be spent in reasonable tranches <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the first thing i have to say is that while i appreciate all that my noble friend has said it has nothing to do with the words of the amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes to join with others in suggesting how to improve recruitment then we can go a long way <e> <s> but this amendment deals not with how we can improve recruitment but with how we can apply the law to the armed forces with a little more bite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed at the response of the minister <e> <s> i think he will appreciate that on many of these matters members on this side of the chamber are substantially guided not only by our own feel for the issue but also by advice that we receive from bodies outside <e> <s> the very eminent and respected organisation nacro the body devoted to the care of offenders and the prevention of crime have drawn my attention since the last stages to their very firm conviction on this matter that the clause is not only unnecessary but is also undesirable <e> <s> the minister continues to rest his case on the fact that all he is doing is to make the people who are subject to the armed forces bill on a par with those outside <e> <s> i am very disappointed but in view of the response that the minister has given and the reality of parliamentary arithmetic i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house very much appreciate the brevity with which these orders were moved <e> <s> if i simply say to the minister that we take his word for it i am sure he will understand that we do not wish to debate one of these orders with articles i am told and schedules <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out these cover a matter of great importance and substance not just to the business community as one might think but <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying how much i appreciated the comprehensive introduction given to the bill by the minister <e> <s> i was also very heartened by the stimulating speech made from my front bench by my noble friend lord barnett <e> <s> we shall certainly be in business when this bill reaches the committee stage because my noble friend and others have raised a number of matters that will definitely need to be explored <e> <s> today i wait to hear what the minister has to say about the very pungent remark made by my noble friend in regard to mr austin mitchell and his interest in the conveyancing issue <e>", "<cs> it is the understatement of the night if i say that i am disappointed with the response of the minister <e> <s> he fails completely to see in the context very often of very lowly paid employees the situation of their having to be responsible for the acts of others when they are not dishonest when they are not negligent or when they have not been at fault <e> <s> i tried to explain to the minister that in the nature of retailing there are many episodes and practices which will cause a stock loss for which a person who has been honest careful and without fault can be held to be responsible <e> <s> i simply ask this <e> <s> why should we not write on the face of the bill a protection of that kind <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what i think is a sympathetic response to the intention of the amendment and i also thank the noble baroness for her reception of it <e> <s> the noble baroness is absolutely right and her final words were very pertinent <e> <s> what we have in the bill is a first step and there is the promise of even more to come <e> <s> i hope that as the minister said between now and then even more work can be done upon it so that what we shall have in future will be even better than that which we have now in draft <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed because the illustration i gave of what is going on at this moment is well founded <e> <s> it is not in my interests or in the interests of the committee to be more specific <e> <s> the minister must understand that it is more administratively convenient for some employers not to force their employees to open bank accounts but simply to say we wish to draw your wages on the bank of our choice <e> <s> if you do not have an account with that bank into which that cheque can be paid we are going to issue you a cheque <e> <s> issuing them a cheque means that they have to make arrangements <e> <s> if they do not have a bank account but their banking is done through some other institution such as a building society they have to go to the trouble of making those arrangements <e>", "<cs> no no my lords <e>", "<cs> he cannot do it <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has expressed its appreciation to the noble lord lord trefgarne for starting off this important debate <e> <s> i echo all that has been said <e> <s> it was a very good introduction <e> <s> we have also been treated to the special character of your lordships house including as it does specialists of a high order <e> <s> that has been amply borne out over the past five hours <e> <s> my noble friend lord boston treated the house to an impressive and comprehensive review of our defence needs <e> <s> his speech was impressive in its penetrating analysis of major facets of the matters contained within the pages of the defence estimates and comprehensive in its mastery of those details and their implications <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene to ask what is going to happen to all those employees who have been made redundant in anticipation of the flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> may i first of all ask the noble lord to join me in expressing appreciation of the initiative taken by the university of ulster for blazing a trail and establishing a unit of this kind <e> <s> may i also pay a particular tribute to the department of economic development and its chairman mr paddy devlin for encouraging the formation of credit co-operatives like the ones at derry and ballycastle and consumer corps like those at galleagh and glencairn and also the belfast unemployed centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful for the supplementary answers that the minister has given <e> <s> may i say he has made it quite clear that he shares my conviction that co-operation is better than confrontation not least in the context of northern ireland <e> <s> may i ask whether he would ensure that this support for that concept and also for the work that is being done by the unit is reflected and made known to the various forums considering its future <e>", "<cs> my lords i take up the point made by those who have been privy to the many meetings that the noble baroness said have taken place but which have clearly excluded people like myself who speak for the labour opposition <e> <s> apparently consultations have taken place with a selected group of individuals perhaps representing a selected group of views on this bill <e> <s> i make no complaint about that because from time to time we are all excluded for one purpose or another <e> <s> no doubt the minister will reply to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer to the undertaking that was given that the royal ordnance factories would not be sold off piecemeal <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may be right and i shall stand corrected <e> <s> amendments were moved on the bill dealing with the royal ordnance factories to ensure that the factories would be kept as a unit not the sold off together but that there would be groups <e> <s> the minister wags his finger but i believe the record will show that he wags it in admission of what i have said <e> <s> however i shall check my facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say that this minister and the government gave certain undertakings in respect of how they intended to dispose of the assets of the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> in the event based upon those indications many people made their arrangements <e> <s> they have been thwarted <e> <s> we know why they were thwarted in respect of the ordnance factories <e> <s> it was because the government attempted to ensure that when the factories came to be sold off they would be in a better position that is that they had a better future with a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down he invites me after checking my facts to come before the house in a suitable manner and indicate that the allegation i made was wrong <e> <s> of course i unreservedly say that that is what i will do <e> <s> equally if the minister finds that what i have said is correct that is that undertakings were given that the or factories would not be sold off piecemeal i assume the minister will do likewise in the same spirit in which i raised the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask for some clarification <e> <s> i listened to what the minister said <e> <s> he pleaded in aid the unanimity which exists that the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations should apply <e> <s> he said that the trade unions wished that to be the case <e> <s> will the minister put on record in the light of what has transpired which caused the government to reflect and delete clause that there have been recent conversations with the trade unions and that he is fully satisfied that what the government propose meets with the trade unions approval <e>", "<cs> my lords can i assure my noble friend that if the minister were to say that the sense of what is contained in the proposal now before us is acceptable i would certainly expedite the business of the house by not moving the subsequent new clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that it may be an offer that the minister will be tempted to refuse <e> <s> but if he is tempted simply to tell us that he has every sympathy with this that discussions are going on that understandings are abroad and that there is no need to write this into the face of the bill we are faced with this dilemma <e> <s> far too often we are told that some other words in the bill mean exactly what we wish to write in <e> <s> we are simple men and women <e> <s> we want to see in writing what we want the bill to mean <e> <s> when it comes to foreign ownership i am sure that the minister will tell us about the golden share and about the inability of anyone to aggregate sufficient financial power to outweigh that held by the government <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with writing into the bill the words of this clause <e> <s> the minister says from our point of view there is no need for this <e> <s> however we are not talking about the governments point of view <e> <s> we are talking about the point of view of the ordinary man and woman in the street the employee and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to tell us what would happen to the negative order procedure in the event of a dissolution of parliament and a general election <e> <s> am i right in assuming that in such circumstances i appreciate the minister may not be able to give me a precise answer now certain powers will be in the hands of the government in which case they can proceed so even the limited opportunity to which the minister has drawn attention can be denied us in some circumstances <e>", "<cs> or in fact my lords if parliament resumed with a different government which would take an entirely different attitude from the previous government <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to pursue the amendment but the minister fails completely to meet the legitimate concern of the unions because as in the case of the ordnance factories we are talking about the removal of employees from the civil service and therefore their withdrawal from the existing machinery <e> <s> the minister may be satisfied that the other arrangements will work out but what the trade unions are saying is that before the bill proceeds the arrangements for the negotiating machinery should be made and understood <e>", "<cs> my lords in another place on th april the minister then involved with the bill mr norman lamont said this <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has failed to satisfy me and i believe other fair-minded members of your lordships house <e> <s> he has done nothing to allay the genuine worries of the workforce <e> <s> i give no undertaking that i shall not return to this matter in some other form on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister seriously saying that those figures from the sources i have produced are wholly fallacious <e> <s> i am certainly prepared to give the minister outside this debate at least the basis upon which i have been supplied with that information <e> <s> the figures total more than million in order to start <e> <s> if the minister is saying that there is a wide discrepancy between the million and the million then an explanation is needed not just to myself but more importantly to those outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the minister said that perhaps the figures i gave are separate and that we are not comparing like with like <e> <s> he said that in any event many of the expenses would be incurred anyway <e> <s> i refer to the private pension scheme arrangements <e> <s> they would not normally be undertaken <e> <s> that is a new commitment <e> <s> i am told that the redundancy payments could amount to million <e> <s> the minister says that overall the figure is million for all sorts of costs <e> <s> therefore i shall certainly be very happy to give the minister the information i have which i repeat is from the public accounts committee the ministry of defence information given by mr john lee information supplied to the dockyard planning team and from other factors in the bill <e> <s> i will certainly give that information to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be thoroughly ashamed of ourselves for being sandwiched in the middle of a most important bill which is the main business of the day and having to try to discharge our responsibility to the people of northern ireland in such a shabby fashion <e> <s> it is no fault of the minister but in the debate on the first order minutes were taken up by the minister minutes in the introduction and minutes in reply <e> <s> other noble lords took only minutes in order to curtail the debate out of respect for the minister and for other colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned that there was one of categories the orlit house that had been built in northern ireland <e> <s> can he tell me whether in actual fact there are any other than orlit houses in northern ireland <e> <s> bearing in mind that the designation of those entitled to the grant is always under review there is great pressure <e> <s> everyone who bought a house that has turned out to be defective is putting the government under pressure to include that housing in the list for treatment <e> <s> i should be grateful if he could write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from me that it would be sensible to have within our armed forces a representation from the ethnic minorities in the country that is broadly in line with the population <e> <s> is he aware that there is merit in trying to achieve these proportions not least to demonstrate that all those who live in this country enjoy the protection of the armed forces and minorities are entitled to have their numbers reflected proportionately in the ranks <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not understand the frustration of many people at the inability of the minister to give any statistics at all <e> <s> surely what we need in order to be satisfied on many counts is for the minister to be able to tell the house and the country what proportion of our armed forces comes from the ethnic minorities <e> <s> for instance his right honourable friend the home secretary says that he is very worried at the absence of black faces in the police force and is doing something about it <e> <s> ought we not also to have the basic facts in respect of the armed forces so that we can discover whether there are any problems and do something about them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is complacency <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first ask the minister to accept from me that i wish to withdraw without qualification any implication that i may have made on friday last that he had misled the house in this matter <e> <s> is he aware that he must reconcile his statement of intent which was given on second reading that the factories which were to be floated would be floated in divisions of three and four together with the clear impression gained from recent announcements that factories such as the enfield small arms factory can be sold separately <e> <s> is he further aware that in enfield there are workers who according to the local press fear for their jobs as a result of what they perceive as a change in government policy <e> <s> will he give the workers at enfield an assurance that their fears are groundless <e>", "<cs> my lords in his response the minister repeated earlier indications that the factories would be floated either as a whole or in divisions <e> <s> we are now faced with rumour innuendo or something stronger that it is possible that individual factories such as the enfield small arms factory will be floated separately <e> <s> the employees whether or not they are right believe that their interests will be worsened if that happens <e> <s> will the minister confirm that what i have heard that there is a possibility of the factories all being bought by one purchaser vickers is correct <e> <s> will he also tell the house what are the levels of performance or achievement that the government have in mind before they float an individual factory <e> <s> at what level do the interests future and careers of the employees equate to the governments intentions to float the factories at any price <e>", "<cs> that is another question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister seeks to persuade the house that the government resist the changes in the best interests of the employer and the employee <e> <s> i do not speak for employers although as director of a large retail organisation from time to time i sit in the boardroom of the enfield and st albans co-operative society <e> <s> but the minister can take it from me speaking from the point of view of the employee that usdaw and many other organisations with workers in the retail trade will deeply resent the governments not accepting the sense of the amendment <e> <s> unfortunately some employers whatever the size of the organisation will take advantage of weak systems <e> <s> it is perfectly proper for an employer as far as possible to make sure that his business is run so efficiently that he reduces to a minimum what we call leakage <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder how the minister can justify at a time when the average industrial wage is in excess of a week the suggestion that shop workers are apparently in danger of pricing themselves out of a job when the rate under the wages council is less than a week <e> <s> where is the logic <e> <s> if there were a surfeit of workers queueing up to take work at less than a week that would be a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to be very brief in following the point made by my noble friend lord stoddart <e> <s> it is not a question of knocking the present system <e> <s> in fact there is a great deal of good and satisfaction to be obtained from the voluntary method whereby under the umbrella of corgi the industry is attempting to do a very good job <e> <s> however if one looks at lines to on page of the bill the enormity of the damage and danger is apparent <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart or i myself certainly will not wish to be accused nor shall we stand accused of being alarmist but we are dealing with a very important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to be of assistance to the minister and to the government <e> <s> they have the option which the noble and learned lord set out <e> <s> failure to accept the amendment will not only land them in trouble and embarrass them but the situation will continue to be a running sore which is highly likely to end up in the courts <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord is asking the government to accept is simple <e> <s> people want to see on the face of the bill what the minister has said is part of the deal the arrangements under tupe <e> <s> that is reasonable and a reasonable government should accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words before the bill passes <e> <s> without the pleasure of the vote ten minutes ago i would have been extremely angry <e> <s> i would certainly not have said that i wished the bill well <e> <s> but in the context of the task in which we are engaged and the role of this house as a revising chamber i believe that on the margin and late in the day we have modestly improved the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that too <e> <s> in the same letter the trade unions point out of course <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i rise to follow the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> events as recent as last night prove that on occasion we are a winning team and i look forward to working closely with him on many of the matters covered in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i share the disappointment of my colleague on the front bench at the ministers not understanding why the amendment has been moved <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the ministers case on why it is not needed and he may very well have a point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am also pleased to know of the amount of capital expenditure that is involved not only at wormwood scrubs but elsewhere <e> <s> can the minister confirm that a further million will be spent to transform a purpose-built kitchen into a prison workshop <e> <s> can the minister also confirm what i believe he said that eventually there will be integral cellular sanitation throughout the prison and that the disgusting practice of slopping-out will not proceed into the st century <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the admission by the minister which in my view took a bit of courage that the conditions there are deplorable <e> <s> but i should be grateful if he could reply to the point made concerning the purpose-built kitchen <e> <s> may i also ask him to comment on the fact that was spent on the prison hospital and when it was decided not to proceed that capital expenditure was used to store equipment from the works department <e> <s> will the minister take on board that i am as concerned as he is that when the prison department is making statements concerning a waste of prison expenditure it ought to look very closely at home and at matters of this kind as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been very fair to the house with the supplementary questions <e> <s> but taking the point made by my noble friend lord williams concerning the state of the hospital is the minister aware that the accommodation in b-wing which is being used as a hospital has urine running down the walls from a defective sewerage system <e> <s> in conditions of that kind surely the point made by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must be joking <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister in his second contribution said that he would be the first to pay tribute to the open university <e> <s> i was somewhat disappointed not to hear the words open university in the original statement <e> <s> it is quite clear that the new endeavour will owe something to the experience of the open university over the past years <e> <s> the minister will be aware that the noble baroness lady carnegy and i serve on the council of the open university as nominees of the lord president of the council so perhaps the minister can tell us the way in which he and his colleagues have sought to use the experience of the open university over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he confirm that although when the full programme is completed in it will add a further places in prisons it will do no more than match the current needs <e> <s> can we be assured that the new prison capital expenditure does not starve the work that is required and not merely for refurbishing <e> <s> for instance can the noble lord confirm that the capital required to bring lindholme in yorkshire which i recently visited up to date will be found as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from me that i acknowledge and appreciate the increase in the capital programme in both improving existing prisons and building new ones <e> <s> but would it not be fair for the government to spend a little more time on examining the non-custodial sentence aspect of the current situation <e> <s> as well as making conditions in prisons better ought we not to spend at least as much time in trying to avoid sending people to prison at all <e> <s> finally to what extent does consultation take place with among others prison officers when new prisons are being designed <e>", "<cs> before we agree to schedule i should be grateful if the minister would take on board some points that i wish to make and perhaps reply to them <e> <s> these are very important to the co-operative movement on whose behalf i declare an interest <e>", "<cs> i had intended to raise this matter on the question whether schedule should be agreed to but perhaps when the minister deals with the amendment he can tell the committee where the government see a place for those employed in the industry on the governing body <e> <s> paragraph of the schedule talks about <e>", "<cs> good industrial relations figure more prominently now than ever before <e> <s> there is a need for those employed in a business to be satisfied about the conduct of that business by those who have executive authority who should take into account the needs and views of those employed in the business <e> <s> i merely want to leave that on the record for those who will study with care what the minister and other members of the committee have said <e> <s> i believe a case can be made out for that <e>

echelons of companies may well have served for a short time only <e> <s> they may be clever and able and they will certainly be able to make a contribution <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to appear tiresome but the minister will recall that during the second reading on lth july at col i made a brief reference to clause <e> <s> what i understood following exchanges in the standing committee between the minister in charge of the bill and my honourable friend bryan gould was that some clarity and understanding had been reached on the import of clause to friendly societies because that is what the clause deals with and also to those friendly societies which have what are known as branch societies where they are not only centralised but have in addition many branches <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> the noble lord describes the provision as a safeguard <e> <s> i think it is a cop-out <e> <s> one is not talking about anything other than honesty and integrity <e> <s> but it is so capable of wide interpretation that i do not think that it provides very much protection at all for the investor <e> <s> i have heard what the minister has said i shall read very carefully what he has said and it may be that i will come back at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister and say now grateful we are to him for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> but can the house be told why the statement was obviously first made to a press briefing some time last night <e> <s> if the noble lord has done as i have done and seen copies of the press reports this morning he will know that there is no material fact in respect of this matter which he has given to the house that does not appear in this mornings press <e> <s> if the government and the minister are to treat the house with that kind of contempt i believe that we are entitled to an explanation <e> <s> the minister announced a figure of million and the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will deal with the point about consultation with the trade unions at leeds <e> <s> will the noble lord accept from me that as recently as less than an hour ago representatives of the trade unions at leeds told me that repeatedly in recent weeks they have written to the ministry following press speculation on the future of the factory seeking urgent discussions so that they could discuss with ministry officials the future of their members <e> <s> they tell me that they have had no response <e> <s> i asked whether they meant literally that there had been no reply and i was told that they had got nowhere in being able to sit <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this is the opportunity for me to make a general response to what has happened but i know that various amendments need to be moved <e>", "<cs> that is fine my lords <e> <s> i begin by acknowledging that at the end of a difficult period agreement was reached which so far as we are concerned will not be breached either here or in another place <e> <s> however we are greatly puzzled about the import of what we have achieved <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning i and many others are convinced that we have strengthened protections for the trade unions <e> <s> but in some discussions people say that nothing has changed the timetable has not changed and neither have the procedures <e> <s> we know that there is recourse to the high court <e> <s> but as mr john lee said last night in another place the timescale remains unchanged <e> <s> we are labouring under some difficulty without recourse to the precise report but in winding-up he said that we were talking about a full four-month period between the selection of the contractor for the particular yards and the date of th april when commercial management begins <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can say that again my lords <e> <s> three cheers for the garden party <e> <s> the reality was the timescale <e> <s> had agreement not been reached by tonight they would have been faced with another defeat in this house and i make no forecast or a delay of three months <e> <s> as i said this afternoon the government are pragmatic <e> <s> they want in their possession by tomorrow this bill and it is a new bill when we talk about opportunities <e> <s> it is a great victory not just for the noble and learned lord who declared his passionate and emotional interest in the issue by virtue of the long association that he and his family have had with all things naval and with the dockyards <e> <s> i believe that that was an extra spur and he has done his duty not only to his conscience but to the city of plymouth to rosyth to the trade unions and to the nation <e> <s> i certainly am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is early days will the minister assure the house that among the views that he will study with care will be those of representatives of the people employed in our broadcasting services <e> <s> will he also reflect on what the report has to say concerning free television licences for old-age pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend joins me in that request <e> <s> will the minister take on board the anomaly whereby although elderly people in residential care accommodation have their television licence free in gateshead recently an year-old pensioner was held in a police cell for refusing to pay his television licence <e> <s> finally will the minister and his colleagues resist any pressure to award television franchises to the highest bidder <e> <s> should not every attempt be made to maintain the highly satisfactory regulated process of our broadcasting service <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not recall that when these matters were before the house the minister expressed every confidence that the bodies that deserved to be <e>", "<cs> it could very well be and not for the first time that there is misunderstanding about the purposes of parts of this bill <e> <s> do i understand the minister to say that the consequences resulting from clause will form no part of the remit of those who serve on tribunals <e> <s> clause relates to the employment of prohibited persons as the minister knows <e> <s> i put forward my arguments on the premise that part of the responsibilities of those on the tribunals will be to take <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> no one better understands the situation of an employee selling insurance than someone representing their interests <e> <s> if we have good and true men or women who are looking at the way in which these matters work out in practice as i see it that is to be the remit of the tribunal surely they would be better served if at least one of them had some recent experience of life at that sharp end <e> <s> the other nine may be better qualified on a range of other matters but no one will be as well qualified to understand as someone representing those who work in the industry <e> <s> they will understand and not condone or plead the case for them <e> <s> we are not arguing about the industrial tribunal nexus <e> <s> we are talking about the application of the provisions of clause and others <e>", "<cs> great stuff <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed at the response of the minister he is consistent <e> <s> he makes the same case as he did on an earlier amendment that i moved seeking to establish that employees are in a special category <e> <s> besides having the interests of the business at heart if they do not know as much as those who are pre-eminent in the industry at least they understand what it is all about and they also have their livelihood at stake <e>", "<cs> for those who like myself are not completely untutored in these matters but who certainly do not have anything like the level of experience or expertise of other members of the committee it is quite clear that we have reached the extraordinary position after going through the long process of this bill and the long consultation period prior to legislation appearing in another place or here of being able to consider that there are ways in which the face of the bill can be altered sensibly and reasonably <e> <s> for example when i listened to what my noble friend lord williams said was the genesis of his desire he certainly had my support and i believe the minister said that he had his support too <e> <s> my noble friend said he wanted the ensure that financial institutions in this instance insurance companies but there is a later amendment relating to friendly societies are in effect able to operate in such a way that the security and safeguards they provide for those whose interests they protect are no less than for those who do not have special provisions <e> <s> for instance from what the minister said and from the documents that i have read i am satisfied that under the insurance companies act it is possible for legislation and that means of course the department of trade and industry to ensure that all that the bill sets out to achieve in that narrow field of insurance companies is capable of being achieved by i shall not say a proper a rigorous and fair application of existing legislation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> i believe that we are all as one throughout the committee in wanting to ensure the maximum peace of mind and security for everyone concerned <e> <s> clause presages schedule and deals with the affairs of friendly societies <e> <s> i have already declared an interest which i repeat on behalf of the ancient order of foresters <e> <s> the minister will recall that when we dealt with clause he was kind enough twice to spell out precisely what clause means in relation to what are called centralised societies as opposed to those with branches <e> <s> i want the minister to bear in mind when i hope accepting the spirit of this amendment and coming back to us perhaps with an acceptable form of words the complications that can occur for a friendly society where in effect its branches are virtually separate organisations within the major organisation <e>", "<cs> i accept that undertaking with alacrity and appreciation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that noble lords are faced with dilemmas and conflicts against what they believe their party ought to do <e> <s> as the last two speakers in the debate have indicated they are appalled at what they see to be as a betrayal of basic principles <e> <s> if indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes is in such good form and before she has said a word on the bill <e> <s> i look forward with interest to what she has to say <e> <s> the previous two speakers have expressed their astonishment at what is contained in the bill <e> <s> the speaker before the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne reported what was said by a member of the party of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes in another place <e> <s> and he certainly shared those views <e> <s> perhaps for the same reason that those noble lords have expressed such astonishment i see a great deal of merit <e> <s> indeed noble lords will not be surprised that these matters should be viewed from strictly party or partisan standpoints <e>", "<cs> my lords proprietors have an interest in these matters <e> <s> those proprietors collectively own more than pharmacies <e> <s> whatever other interests noble lords have in these matters those people have an interest in the matter as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful <e> <s> the noble lord has doubled the value of my argument by halving the amount that i thought was going to be saved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> bearing in mind that the average family package holiday represents a considerable investment and that that family relies upon the protection of the caa and abta will the minister urge both the caa and abta urgently to examine their practices as regards liaison in order to root out any dubious practices <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us how often and how regularly the government meet either abta or the caa in order to examine and improve the practices in the travel industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister concerned as i am that the public very heavily rely upon travel agents who represent their integrity by displaying the abta or atol sign <e> <s> will the minister ask the caa more carefully to monitor circumstances in which either one or other of those symbols is withdrawn so that the caa is satisfied that the practices carried out by the travel agent are proper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for all that he has said <e> <s> however in view of what my noble friend lord mellish has said my concern is not so much travel agents who set up without the symbol but travel agents who are given the symbol then have it withdrawn but continue to practise <e> <s> in my view in those circumstances there is some deceit <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether he will draw that in particular to the attention of the caa <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by congratulating and welcoming the noble lord to the dispatch box for the first time <e> <s> he carries a name which is deeply respected not only in the house but also in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the need to ensure that the holiday consuming public are fully protected from anti-competition forces will the minister consider amending the retail prices act to include services such as travel <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that what i was seeking to obtain was the governments response to the report <e> <s> i understand <e>", "<cs> my lords as i know that this is a minister who leaves no stone unturned may i ask him to accept that i am not at all certain that under the previous system of dual tendering ministries were as enthusiastic as i believe they ought to have been to see that the scheme worked <e> <s> although i acknowledge the response given to my noble friend lord underhill can the minister tell us what was the response of the national coal board that is to say the minestone executive to the recommendations in the report <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that the minister does not assume that a public inquiry has <e>", "<cs> i am intrigued by the confidence the minister has in the approved tenancy nexus within the housing field <e> <s> i understand that there are about approved bodies and the minister has told us that collectively they are responsible for tenancies <e> <s> that is a ludicrous pimple on the face of the housing condition in this country <e>", "<cs> i do not quite know what the minister expects to happen <e> <s> we are looking back on a period in which assured tenancies were encouraged and in six years we have <e> <s> i am not at all certain what the detrimental effect of these measures will be if as the minister says they will discourage the creation of assured tenancies <e> <s> in the event that an approved landlord for whatever reason and we are talking about a malpractice of some kind ceases to earn and retain the status we are talking about the innocent tenant and how he is left <e> <s> we are saying that in those circumstances it is not unreasonable that the tenant becomes a fully protected rent act tenant <e>", "<cs> disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> what comes after amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> so we progress backwards <e>", "<cs> my lords as a non-member of any of the committees whose reports we are discussing this morning perhaps i may say what a pleasure and a privilege it is both to have had the reports drawn to my attention and to have listened to the excellent introductions that we have heard this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i await with interest the response of the minister to the reasonable case made by my noble friend lord morton who pointed out that he was doing no more than use the ministers words perhaps only changing their place in the bill <e> <s> the self-regulating organisation will be a very powerful body with enormous influence <e> <s> the bill on page refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he explain who determines what a proper balance is <e> <s> different people looking at the composition of a body or board will say that it is proper or improper fair or unfair <e> <s> it would certainly ease my mind if the minister was able to say that there is some very superior person or body of people it may very well be the sib or some other organisation that has to judge <e> <s> the question of deciding what is proper in the context of fair is most important <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that the minister on this occasion is in a receptive mood <e> <s> ever since i have been in either of the two houses of parliament we have always been able to have good arguments on may or shall <e> <s> one is permissive or flexible but that does not mean to say that it will not be used <e> <s> when one looks at paragraph of the schedule perhaps some people might believe it cannot be improved because it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister accepts that this is a helpful amendment <e> <s> we have traversed a lot of ground and a lot of people outside this house are pinning their hopes of the success of the bill on the precise wording <e> <s> no one better than a parliamentarian understands the value of the written word <e> <s> the day after a debate all arguments about what was said perhaps not what was meant but what was said can be confirmed or denied because the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister recognises the danger of making fish of one and fowl of another <e> <s> it is always interesting to listen to colleagues who have taken great care not so much to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for meeting my request head-on and giving me a little flesh on the bones <e> <s> however in doing so he used the illustration of a profession where there were so few members i am sorry would the minister care to <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made himself absolutely clear but he anticipated incorrectly the point i was making <e> <s> the minister used as an illustration a profession in which there were so few members engaged in the gravamen of this bill that it would not be right to grant recognition and status to the whole profession <e> <s> he said that the individuals concerned had a means of becoming authorised persons in another way <e> <s> however i want to ask him what the damage done would be <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas shakes his head so vigorously that i am sure he will intervene and if i have it wrong i shall apologise <e> <s> however the point i was going to make was that if it is a professional body of standing and it has a few members who are involved in giving investment advice or who can be caught by some of the provisions of this bill in the fullness of time those few may become many <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will demonstrate if not flexibility at least understanding as to the explanation given by my noble friend particularly of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth in an earlier exchange drew attention to a halfway house between may and shall <e> <s> we were arguing between must and shall <e> <s> i recall the noble lord saying earlier this afternoon that there may be circumstances where the word appropriate i believe he said could apply where appropriate complaints may be investigated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am puzzled as to why the minister should reject the word reasonable between the words such and information when subsection in dealing further with the matter says that the secretary of state may reasonably require <e> <s> there is a difference <e> <s> but no argument can arise over the appropriateness of the word reasonable that we seek to introduce when reasonably is already written into the bill at the top of page <e> <s> we are saying that the information that is requested shall be reasonable <e> <s> the words are such reasonable information <e> <s> when we talk about the impact of subsection at the top of page it is action that the secretary of state may reasonably require <e> <s> there is a subtle difference <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has certainly helped me to understand that the bill contains in different parts a substantial element of what is covered by this amendment <e> <s> but i am very pleased that it is this minister who is dealing with the matter <e> <s> last week on our first exchange we dealt in another context with the continuing use by a body such as a travel agent of an authorisation of status after it had ceased to earn it <e> <s> i was concerned that the general public may use a travel agent which had at one time enjoyed the status and protection of the abta symbol but which having lost that status has been able to trade with different directors <e> <s> the public might not understand that the integrity of the organisation had been diminished <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested indeed to hear the remarks of the noble lord lord strathalmond <e> <s> in effect he was making a case for special pleading <e> <s> it was a very good case <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that there are other financial institutions in this context lloyds is a financial institution who could put forward exactly the same case <e> <s> the noble lord used the phrase tried and tested <e> <s> these other institutions could argue in general that they have a system they have a monitor they have procedures they are very jealous about the integrity of their organisation in the market place that is very important to the national and international economies they are seen to be beyond reproach <e> <s> yet from time to time there will be a ripple a disturbance or an event that will cause more distress to the noble lord and his friends than to someone like myself <e> <s> the noble lord will be more distressed than i because it has happened in his own family as it were <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house approve of the order <e> <s> the minister began by pointing out that despite a misprint we are not dealing with gold silver or diamonds <e> <s> but we are dealing with the emerald isle and to that extent it is fortuitous that the mistake was made <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can tell us whether he has comparative statistics in respect of the late payment the non-payment and the rate-paying records of the people of northern ireland as against those of england and wales because he said that we now have a more efficient service <e> <s> by inference that means that there was a less efficient service in the past <e> <s> but it was less efficient only in the context of this very narrow point of streamlining and bringing into use the quite reasonable device of using the post <e> <s> it may not be possible to give me those statistics tonight but for the completeness of the record we ought to see where the payment of rates as a social responsibility and a civic duty stands in northern ireland as opposed to great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly give our support to the order from the benches on this side of the house <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can help me on one or two points <e> <s> reference was made to article and the increase in the consolidated fund as regards the department of the environment from million to million <e> <s> is this increase of million simply in order to keep the fund topped up or does it represent specific capital expenditure requirements <e> <s> how much of the total amount in the fund is currently in use <e> <s> i understand that the nature of a consolidated fund is to be all-embracing comprehensive and always turning over and of course there is a limit to the moneys in use <e> <s> can the minister tell us a little more about the kind of use to which the money will be put <e> <s> i understand that it concerns housing but is it in response to a demand from the housing executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having taken the trouble to remind us of the genesis and the gravamen of this particular clause <e> <s> this is very important to many people who might be called the ordinary or small people of the insurance business <e> <s> at this stage i certainly cannot cavil with the further steps which the government have taken to try to get it right <e> <s> i am certain that these are not merely second thoughts on the part of the minister his team and his advisers but are also the result of consultations at each stage with various bodies and individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister and his colleagues are well aware matters which appear on the record for example what the minister has said tonight are if nothing else a starting point for those outside either to have their understanding confirmed or to realise that there are things which they should do <e> <s> if a large trade union such as the one i mentioned has some need of clarification as to precisely how its members will be affected <e> <s> it at least raises this interesting point <e> <s> if the widest possible consultation which is the phrase used by the minister still leaves a responsible trade union like astms in some uncertainty as to its responsibilities in protecting its members then i very much hope that those outside the house having read what is said will perhaps even remind unions and others of what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord lord kimball is seeking to do <e> <s> he is trying to have carried in this house a point that failed to be carried by his friends perhaps in another place <e> <s> that is perfectly legitimate and like the noble lord lord kimball we shall of course wait to see what mature reflection has produced <e> <s> his friends have thought that it was worth making another attempt to carry this point which the minister would have anticipated in the summer months and he may now have reached the stage where perhaps he can respond <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask whether he has noted reports in the press that a large retail chain has announced its intention to trade on sundays and that many other traders are also continuing to trade on sundays <e> <s> bearing in mind that at about this time last year in the run-up to the christmas shopping period the prime minister announced that the law must be obeyed will the minister take this opportunity to issue a comparable christmas message aimed especially at those people who believe in law enforcement except on sundays and when it suits them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider urging on those who having completely lost the argument last year are taking initiatives at this time that there are considerations of partial deregulation <e> <s> would it be good advice to give to any campaign or organisation that they must be able to carry with them the views of consumers shop keepers shop workers and councils and that any attempt to alter the law without a combination of those interests will be doomed to failure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is the minister aware however that the incidence of cervical cancer among women in the to age range is on the increase and that women die from cervical cancer and from breast cancer every year <e> <s> is she aware that many of these cases are preventable <e> <s> i know that the minister appreciates that early detection is crucial <e> <s> will she therefore lend support to those trade unions <e> <s> among them the union of shop distributive and allied workers who are increasingly negotiating with employers a facility whereby women at work are enabled to leave work to attend nhs facilities or the firm encourages visits to its factories shops or offices by mobile screening facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for using more than once the word encourage <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us in regard to the health authorities who in june had no system whatsoever how far the number has been reduced <e> <s> has the minister taken careful note of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the minister is willing to look at the point which i seek to make <e> <s> perhaps i may elaborate my point <e> <s> the policyholders protection act provides the possibility of compensation broadly in line with the kind of situation and circumstance which the government seek to meet in what is a major new provision <e> <s> since the government announced their intention albeit to provide better consumer protection and better policyholder protection in general i can see a great deal of merit in it <e> <s> i am simply arguing as we have argued before on other aspects of the bill that we do not wish to add two layers of bureaucracy and certainly two layers of financial provision to anybody within the financial services sector <e> <s> therefore the minister having said that he will consider whether something may happen as a result of discussion or correspondence not least with the organisations involved and certainly those that will be covered by the sro and lautro which will have a great deal to do with the conduct of business rules which will affect insurance companies and societies on the basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will look favourably upon the amendment and upon the reasonableness that my noble friend on the front bench used when introducing the amendment <e> <s> i am mindful that the governments general attitude to cold calling is broadly acceptable <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mcintosh pointed out it is not something which we can be dogmatic about <e> <s> there are organisations such as the consumers association which say that there should be no cooling-off period <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister will accept that i appreciate that he and his officials consulted very widely indeed with many individuals and organisations <e> <s> looking at the glossary of organisations involved there must be a tremendous number <e> <s> one of the problems which the government have is that if discussions of this sort are to be meaningful there are many people who will wish to tell the minister what they would like to see happen and to that extent he is almost hoist with his own petard <e> <s> i take the view and i hope the minister will take this kindly that it is far better to consult widely and perhaps disappoint some people than to be accused as some ministers are of exercising a cavalier attitude to such matters by not consulting anyone at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i wonder whether he would take on board the natural anxiety of a number of groups of people who are affected by the constitution the membership and the functions of the tribunal <e> <s> i refer to the people who are likely to be most affected that is the employees who will be brought before the tribunal to face charges of dereliction or misdemeanour the outcome of which at the end of the day will in all probability be very serious for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a which is in my name i also indicate how pleased and grateful is the friendly societies liaison committee which represents all friendly societies at the manner in which the government have looked upon their concerns <e> <s> as the minister is aware the difference in the friendly societies between collecting societies and branch societies and their need to re-align their affairs in the light of the bill with other legislation is all taken care of in the various amendments that have been tabled <e> <s> therefore i am grateful to the government for agreeing to bring forward their own amendments and also accepting the amendment in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are seriously concerned about increasing the amount of rented accommodation is it not time that the government stopped the nonsense of prohibiting councils from selling their capital receipts <e> <s> is it not disgraceful that the amount of public sector building in is the worst since neville chamberlain was in charge of housing in <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene cautiously and tread warily in this matter <e> <s> this is one of those occasions when if procedures had allowed me to do so i should very much have liked to listen to the noble earl who is to follow me <e> <s> undoubtedly he is not only in possession of a great many more of the facts than i am but i am also certain that he can give us the right flavour and atmosphere although i have not spoken to him this evening on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> that is all right <e> <s> i think the noble viscount has his name on the record <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i await to listen to the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the minister not only will do that but will take fully into account that there are interests other than the altruistic one of being satisfied that consultation has taken place <e> <s> let me give the minister an illustration of an event that took place almost exactly a year ago tonight on rd october <e> <s> the development committee of tower hamlets council voted in secret to sell the waterlow estate bethnal green to barratts <e> <s> this was a package deal involving barratts handing back some of the refurbished flats to the council <e>

ignore the reality beneath <e> <s> it can in fact result in the sort of conditions i pointed out in regard to that case <e> <s> it resulted in three-quarters of an estate being sold over the heads of the tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble lord for the statement which he <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the house that the minister has referred more than once to the substantial progress made at reykjavik but no progress would have been possible without both sides agreeing and working to that end and are therefore entitled to take the credit for any such progress <e> <s> the minister is uncharacteristically churlish in not being prepared to acknowledge to the extent that progress was made and it is common knowledge that it was an equal proportion of credit for that progress is due to the attitude of the russians <e>", "<cs> yes my lords any weapons <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that in an exchange earlier this week in which his noble friend baroness young spoke for the government in response to a series of questions initiated by my noble friend lord molloy she refused to give such a categorical statement <e> <s> she said that in the event of a war which began by using conventional weapons nato would reserve the right to be the first to use nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he accept that all who know sir james hennessy will expect a thorough professional and worthwhile report <e> <s>

normal regime <e> <s> does the minister agree with the regional director of prisons for the north west who said last week following a major disturbance at the risley remand centre that it was due to staff shortages and that it is in tackling this problem that a solution can be found to the crisis in the prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to he the generous time-scale for the production of the report that has been promised may we also take it that there will be an equally generous time-scale for considering a fresh start <e> <s> that is a matter of at least equal importance to the prison service as the result of the inquiry into the disturbances <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that nacro an organisation of the highest repute says that ex-prisoners are finding difficulty in establishing their identity <e> <s> i noted carefully what the minister said concerning an identification document or form which is issued but if the nature of that form causes the sort of problems that mean that an ex-prisoner who has served his sentence and paid for his crime is then faced with insuperable difficulties this may well lead him ultimately to resort to further crime <e> <s> can the minister not indicate that he is prepared to examine closely what nacro tells us on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the intention of the discussions is to eliminate the overcharging of air fare consumers which matter has reached scandalous and unacceptable levels <e> <s> can the minister explain further the extent of what his ministerial colleague has described as compromise and as the bottom line having been reached <e> <s> will the noble lord take note that consumer groups will be outraged if full and real liberalisation is sacrificed for some shoddy and shabby deal in pursuance of financial interests <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down am i correct in having heard him twice tell the house that the developers have indicated that unless they get the bill they will not find a commercial base from which it is viable to proceed <e> <s> is that not some form of blackmail <e>", "<cs> we will remind you of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow the noble lord lord mellish in seeking as he did to go back in history to denigrate democracy and in my view wickedly to malign some very good people who had worked not as successfully as the corporation in latter years but had worked very hard to try to do what the noble lord lord mellish i accept has wanted to see happen over the past years <e> <s> no good will come out of the debate if the opportunity is given over to using the kind of emotive and i believe unworthy language that the noble lord lord mellish has chosen to use against some very good locally democratically elected unlike the noble lord lord mellish and me in your lordships house councillors and their supporters in the docklands area <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that i have not left the chamber during the debate <e> <s> i heard every word that he said <e> <s> i shall read with care in the <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister taken on board the point that it is still possible for the secretary of state to call in the application for planning permission for the circus and to say to the lddc that that is what they intend to do <e> <s> is that still an option <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he places great reliance upon the sanctity of parliamentary approval for what the lddc can do <e> <s> would he care to square that with the conflict that exists with the greater london development plan which has a statutory basis and yet is in conflict with what has been proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand that the minister has taken both orders together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful <e> <s> from these benches we approve the action of the government and the thrust of what they are doing <e> <s> we all appreciate perhaps even more so in northern ireland the value and benefit of properly funded recreation and sports facilities <e> <s> we know just how big a boost it was to northern ireland when mary peters won the olympic gold medal and we know just how devoted are the soccer fans and the boxing fans <e> <s> however they are the names that hit the headlines <e> <s> there are literally hundreds of thousands of other men and women boys and girls who enjoy this so we do not intend to be obstructionist in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords these provisions are not dreamed up by civil servants for the sake of it although on the other hand they may be <e> <s> however if they are not they clearly rest upon some experience <e> <s> i should like the house to be told why the minister feels that it is proper to do that at this time <e>", "<cs> please my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply rise to say that we on this side fully support not only the renewal of the order but the manner in which the minister has introduced it <e> <s> can the noble lord give us one or two illustrations of the new projects which it is possible may be included <e> <s> if one looks at the order under the heading continuation of certain functions of enterprise ulster we refer to <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me he said that he could not readily place the name of mr hubert young <e> <s> the name my noble friend gave was mr hugo young <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin as i believe almost every other speaker in this debate has begun and as i look around the chamber i know that everyone present now has been here like me for almost seven hours by saying to the noble lord lord thorneycroft that we are all indebted to him not only for what he said but also for the conviction and the seriousness that he introduced into the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords he said it in october <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i shall give him the quote and its source tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that when this matter was raised in the house about a year ago a promise was made to consult parliament at the time the agreement was made <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether there is an intention to do that <e> <s> the minister talked about the voluntary agreement being published <e> <s> will there be an opportunity for the matter to be raised in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help the noble lord by referring to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful not only for what the minister has said but for the sincerity with which he said it <e> <s> those who are directly concerned will look not only on the presentation of the bill but particularly on the words that will appear in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can help me on one important point <e> <s> i understand the no voting and the confidentiality and security aspects completely <e> <s> i can also understand that it may be felt that there is no necessity for police federation members to be present on all occasions <e> <s> the minister was kind enough to say that there would be occasions when they would be invited to appear <e> <s> will the minister indicate whether or not members of the police federation can make a written request to attend certain meetings which they believe it important to all sides for them to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords the price commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin like every speaker in this debate by thanking the minister most sincerely for the very clear manner in which he outlined what we are about in this second reading and later stages of the bill <e> <s> i follow the noble baroness lady elliot who has a high reputation in these matters <e>", "<cs> no my lords with respect it is arguing that if the defence were taken out and one then had to seek insurance cover for the liability it does not see that as a punitive on-cost <e> <s> my noble friend lord williams pointed out that it was an increase but said that if it was an additional cost which had to be borne by the consumer then so be it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister spell out what he has just said <e> <s> he says that the bill will make the work of enforcement officers easier <e> <s> the association of county councils and others have pointed out the additional workload that will fall upon those same officers <e> <s> is there to be no consideration of this factor to be taken into account when the rate support grant is struck <e> <s> is the minister really saying that local authorities must determine their own priorities and that in effect they will be faced with either making this act work or not pursuing other aspects of their responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for at least noting the recommendations <e> <s> will he accept that among the strongest opponents of the black economy are bodies like the federation of master builders which object very strongly on behalf of their tax-paying members <e> <s> will the minister recognise that a modest easement of the tax regime including vat being paid on essential repairs and maintenance could act as a stimulus to the whole building industry <e> <s> does not the minister further agree that more importantly it could lead to greater employment and to greater training facilities in the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government accept the premise upon which this report has been prepared that the treasury is being deprived of an estimated billion can the minister indicate that the government will urgently discuss with building employers although it is not restricted only to building what ideas they have to eliminate this drain upon the national purse <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the excellent presentation of the facts and the feelings which the house has already heard i do not intend to delay your lordships for very long <e> <s> i want to say to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich how grateful i am to him <e> <s> i may add that he may be assured i shall not say that very often on many other issues <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for seizing the opportunity that we have tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for allowing me to make this intervention <e> <s> an impression was gained by the employees who attended the meeting that when the cards were put on the table they were invited to play them in the proper order or else <e> <s> that was the impression with which they left the room and we believe that that is a very serious allegation <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take note of what has been said and what we believe took place and that when the meetings take place next week a categorical rebuttal can be given to the people who have made the charges to the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister is able to tell the house to what extent the deprivation of rate support grant which involves hundreds of millions of pounds particularly to london authorities affects the situation <e> <s> will the minister also bear in mind that there are many authorities which under pressure from the government have reduced their staff to such an extent that they are having great difficulties in carrying out their duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is some misunderstanding <e> <s> we on this side thought that the statement would be taken after the present business had been concluded <e> <s> i am sure that the house will be tolerant <e> <s> there has been a misunderstanding which of course can be put right <e> <s> i am sure that the minister would wish to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be appreciated on these benches if the next speaker inscribed on the list could speak <e> <s> if that were done the noble baroness lady david could then be in her place <e>", "<cs> if the minister will allow me to intervene it would certainly expedite <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister noted that part of the press report of the speech refers to the governments rate support system giving credit to an eastern european country and quite possibly wasting the equivalent of the total expenditure on the national health service <e> <s> will the minister comment on that part of the speech <e> <s> will the minister also take this opportunity to confirm that councils have never defaulted on loan repayments and that interest payments and principal repayments are and will continue to be the first charge on any authoritys rate income <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps mine will he the only voice in the debate that is not in favour of giving this bill a second reading <e> <s> i want to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

"<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that the trade unions concerned namely the ipcs and usdaw have received representations from their members stating that the savings which are alleged to be made in the proposals are not cost-effective and will result in a diminution in the quality of the service <e> <s> why have the government refused to allow sight of this trial report to those who are most affected the dental technicians who have been dismissed as a result of a review in which they were not involved and who were not consulted about the matter during its compilation <e>", "<cs> my lords do we not have the worst of all worlds <e> <s> there is to be a traumatic change allegedly to save public money but it will cost more and there is no evidence to back up the need for it <e> <s> the minister has seen the evidence <e> <s> the trial report has been produced but those who are affected have not seen it <e> <s> is the minister aware that i have details in my possession as he must have of eight of the individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us whether he has the view of the heads of the three services and of the people involved in dentistry <e> <s> i wonder whether they actually wanted this change or has the whole motivation for it simply been one of reducing public costs and more importantly reducing the size of the role of civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> has the minister seen the report by michael harrison in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that he has advised the house that the future of the rosyth dockyard was publicly announced today without proper consultation with the trade unions which is due to take place tomorrow <e> <s> when one looks at what according to the act should take place as regards consultation does the minister really consider that he has consulted properly <e> <s> does not the minister accept that he and the government have reneged on their responsibility to consult meaningfully <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill meets with the approval of members on this side of the house <e> <s> as the minister is aware members of the defence police federation who are more directly affected by the bill have said not only that they approve of the bill but that they were properly adequately and lengthily consulted on it <e> <s> they have asked me to express to the minister their appreciation for the manner in which he has dealt with the points they raised <e>", "<cs> my lords like other contributors to this debate i wish to begin by saying how grateful we are to the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> it is quite clear that there are two worlds <e> <s> one world occupies the national health service hospitals and the other world occupies the private hospitals <e> <s> other than the arguments concerning entitlement if any noble lord argues that there is no difference then there will be a great argument indeed <e> <s> there is a world of difference between the quality of care the quality of attention and ultimately the quality of opportunity for survival by those who for whatever reason but in the main for economic reasons are condemned to rely upon the national health service facilities and those who rely on the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the text of a reply given in another place to a private notice question by my honourable friend <e> <s> i agree with him that we pre-empted a substantial amount of the content of the question being asked in another place today in our exchanges yesterday <e> <s> nevertheless we take advantage of all opportunities that we have in this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend on the front bench for providing the opportunity which was seized upon immediately by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter as he is entitled to do to raise matters about which we are concerned <e> <s> one of the precise problems is exactly what is within the ambit of the bill <e> <s> he reminds me too that in the context in which applications have been made for community radio i must declare an interest in being associated with a company based upon the community in enfield <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply but is he aware that common fletton production by the london brick company has declined from million in to million in and has been described in this months issue of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the consequences of the hanson trust takeover was that brickmakers employed by lbc were made redundant <e> <s> it is no good the minister decrying the shortage of new houses when the policies of the government and the actions of hanson trust are making brick shortages and putting brickmakers out of work <e>", "<cs> the minister will appreciate that many people in addition to the front bench spokesman in this debate have shown a keen interest in this subject <e> <s> i believe that the minister has seriously taken on board the views conveyed to him from major interests outside the house <e> <s> he referred to the manner in which those interests have got together to form a concordat and produce a concerted view <e>", "<cs> because we are in committee the noble lord lord henderson of brompton suggests that we are in an analogous situation to that in committee in another place when the government say that there are some matters that they will put right on report <e> <s> some things they say they cannot put right on report but undertake to put right in another place <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether under the question whether the clause shall stand part of the bill the minister can help me with this problem <e> <s> we are dealing with the first clause concerning misleading prices <e> <s> i am certain that this will affect the interests of millions of people <e> <s> we take on board the interests of traders and organisations and also the legal profession in guiding us <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to tell us whether or not he or his department have in mind how they are going to publicise in an attractive way to the general public the net product of what will finally emerge at the end of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the minister could assist the committee in clarifying this point <e> <s> the clause is dominated by the word facts <e> <s> it includes in fact the facts and on facts <e> <s> for instance where the bill states that the applicability of the clause will be determined by the facts who will determine them <e> <s> will they be determined by the courts <e> <s> where there is a dispute or someone takes a trader to court will the matter be determined wholly by the court or has the minister any other mechanism whereby one is able to contrast what is alleged to be the price and what is purported to be the real price <e> <s> are we simply saying that in all instances this will need to be considered or clarified in the courts <e> <s> in that case i venture to suggest that the courts will be very busy indeed <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble and learned lord could explain why this is necessary <e> <s> as i understand from the questions that have been asked and the ministers replies what we have here by virtue of the exclusions listed are two classes of consumer <e> <s> at the end of the day all services are consumed either once or twice removed <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could tell us why it is considered necessary to have a clause of this kind <e> <s> the first two lines read <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to be thick <e> <s> i can hear what the minister says but my question was why should these exclusions be thought necessary <e> <s> if the exclusions cover consumers at one level or another why are they not given the protection of the clause and the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord but the more he goes on <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether this is a suitable moment to invite the government to look again at one of the most misleading passages of the bill <e> <s> it is the one which deals with the financial and manpower implications <e> <s> we are discussing clause and considering the range of duties contained in clauses and where responsibilities will be laid upon the authorities to ensure that the bill works <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> the noble lord has assured us that he and his colleagues anticipated the possible criticism <e> <s> they have satisfied themselves on balance with a diminution in some responsibilities and a reallocation of officers <e> <s> i can understand the argument <e> <s> those outside the house inform us of the situation and not those in whitehall <e> <s> from their knowledge they say that this will impose additional burdens <e> <s> they could be wrong only time will tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i have not been speaking for minutes as the clock indicates <e> <s> i am sure there is going to be an adjustment to the time <e> <s> i see that the message has got through the time has been altered <e>", "<cs> that relates to no <e> <s> not to the co-operatives <e>", "<cs> yes <e>",

noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> not for the first time has he like noble lords on the same benches told the house that the level of rates charged in a number of authorities is acting as a deterrent against employers seeking to locate their businesses in those areas <e> <s> will the noble lord comment on a study commissioned in by the department of the environment which was undertaken by cambridge university <e> <s> this is what the study said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am an owner and controller through being a director of my local co-operative society <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that when we examined the effect of rates on our business a study that covered a range of politically coloured authorities this was found to play very little part in deciding where to locate <e> <s> i suggest that rates do not form a major if any consideration by employers or entrepreneurs in locating their businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a snide remark <e>", "<cs> my lords like other members of the house who have spoken i am grateful to have the opportunity of making a contribution in what is considered by all of us to be a vital sector not only of the economy but of democracy <e> <s> i am sad that although the first part of the motion refers to the problems few remarks have been addressed from the government benches about ways to deal with the problems <e> <s> criticisms of the solutions to the problems there have been and many justified but from my experience i believe that many members have no idea of the nature of the problems

point that the noble lord makes not for the first time tonight about changes in the electoral system is a fair one <e> <s> despite a determination by others to tell the voters what to do in we increased our vote in enfield brent and other places <e> <s> the electorate had its own store of experience <e>", "<cs> my lords let us try to quantify the amount of money involved <e> <s> manchester city council has been used more than once as an illustration of a hard left council which wastes money on equal opportunities a race unit and gay and lesbian grants <e> <s> it is suggested that such money would make a big difference <e> <s> those budgets amount to per cent <e> <s> of its budget <e> <s> in a workforce of people people are involved in equal opportunities <e> <s> i make no complaint about members opposite who given the opportunity would not pursue certain policies but i strongly object to the way they have sought to smear not merely the authority which is doing a difficult job

authorities are bad that it is only a minority and that there are many good labour-controlled councils and councillors <e> <s> but the intention is to smear labour local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we have moved from minority to substantial minority <e> <s> i stand by what i said the intention of both this debate and the illustrations used to support it has been to smear the good name of

concentration <e> <s> however there is an inability to recognise that if councils are responsible for per cent <e> <s> of their stock being empty something must be said about other sectors of the housing market <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes the point that with rates go rents and in general the labour government or labour councils are not responsible <e> <s> into the equation of the problems in inner london and london itself goes the level of rents <e> <s> that of course is a manifestation of the capitalist market and not the manipulation of a labour government or labour authorities <e>", "<cs> which of the noble baronesss noble friends had been elected to local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as president of the association of labour authorities <e> <s> if in fact the implication is made that somehow or other the integrity of the audit commission who are the sole masters of their own report has been in any way affected by representations that have been made to it that is the integrity which means the honesty of the report then the minister ought to say so <e> <s> i find it somewhat astounding that the opportunity which was taken by the ala in the

the minister will by warmly congratulating my colleague the noble lord lord brockway not only on giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter but also on something that has not been stressed i refer to the tone and earnestness with which he asked his questions <e> <s> i think that the minister should not be too much on the defensive <e> <s> it is not as though this question or the speeches which have been made are attacking <e> <s> i stress that word <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the trident cancellation fee will be per cent <e> <s> of the original cost of billion

mandate to do so <e>", "<cs> and edmonton my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he recall that when the cable and broadcasting bill and the films bill went through this house concern was expressed on all sides about the need to protect the british film-making industry <e> <s> without some form of quota british cultural and artistic identity will be damaged <e> <s> how does the minister reconcile the fact that although we have a regulatory framework in this country we shall be unable to control the input into this country from europe <e> <s> does the minister also accept that without a quota there is a possibility of great damage being caused to the jobs and work of those who are engaged in film making in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind the parlous state of this countrys film-making industry <e> <s> will he tell the house what consultations he and his colleagues had with british film makers and those who work in the industry before reaching their point of view <e> <s> will he also give some assurance to those who make films in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord also accept that when we talk about expenditure by local government and sometimes it is derided a great deal of it goes to the private sector <e> <s> for example in enfield which i know per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure of the housing department goes to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords along with other noble

unemployed <e> <s> that he has a special category having been taken off the list and shown in other statistics i do not deny <e>", "<cs> my lords as others who have spoken i am enormously grateful to the noble earl lord longford for having provided the opportunity to have this debate <e> <s> i should like first of all to congratulate him very much on the amount he managed to pack into what he had to say <e> <s> it was of a very high value and i am sure that when we read it in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> does he not understand that if there is a constant tirade of distortion one decides from time to time to go to the expense and trouble of making reports and so on <e> <s> but in the main most people simply say i hope people will not accept the nonsense of what is being said <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is talking about national security can he also say something about local security <e> <s> can he tell us how the discussions and consultations which are part of the legislation in respect of the social and economic consequences of the privatisation for the city of plymouth are going ahead <e>", "<cs> i hope so <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has far more experience both of ilea and the glc than myself but in commenting upon the ability of ilea to control its affairs she should look carefully at the recent report by the audit commission <e> <s> it criticised expenditure by local authorities but it said nothing about ilea <e> <s> my noble friend lady david took the opportunity in a recent debate

ilea about the management of its money <e>", "<cs> it has the worst problems too <e>", "<cs> that is true <e>", "<cs> i very much hope the minister will appreciate that this amendment is an opportunity to accept a compromise and still leave the opportunity for the secretary of state to determine that which i fear he is determined to determine <e> <s> we are talking about determination

introduced <e> <s> it was not a question of dealing with money but of changing the whole basis of the system that is the right to apply for redetermination <e>", "<cs> i do not know what my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones will say in response to the final few words of the minister <e> <s> i certainly see some hope <e> <s> i detect that the government instead of just looking at figures

whole nexus of cold calling <e> <s> there is no dispute about that <e> <s> i rise now because on a previous occasion when i spoke in a debate i was less than fulsome in acknowledging that that was the standpoint of the consumers association <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lord went on to relate its attitude to polarisation as somehow being contradictory to its attitude to cold calling <e> <s> i

grateful to the minister for the tenor of the reply <e> <s> but i hope she will understand that delays of this length cause havoc to the morale of the staff in hospitals whose future is being determined <e> <s> will she <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept from me that millions of women will find great relief from the announcements that have been made this afternoon <e> <s> however <e> <s> does she recall that some time ago i urged upon her support for the initiatives that are increasingly being taken by trade unions in particular by the union of shop distributive and allied workers to try to ensure that screening facilities are made available in workplaces offices shops and commercial premises <e> <s> will the minister again consider whether it is possible to encourage more women to take advantage of the facilities <e> <s> they may for some reason or another be inhibited but might be encouraged to do so in a workplace <e> <s> certainly the union to which i have referred and many others have good arrangements with large employers and these should be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i should like to begin my contribution by offering the warmest congratulations to the noble lord lord donaldson not only for having initiated this debate but also for the comprehensive and excellent way in which he dealt with the subject <e> <s> the noble lord tackled the problems in a very fair and humane way <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that i had taken less time than others but in deference to the minister i shall sit down now <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the general congratulations to the minister on bringing forward a much improved way of dealing with this matter particularly as i have learned from listening in this past minutes the genesis of it and also the genuine attempt to meet queries <e> <s> will the minister allow me to raise one other point <e> <s> he may say that this is not the appropriate place but i believe it needs to be raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has clarified the issue which is what i wanted rather than an opinion on whether it was desirable <e> <s> i am grateful <e> <s> but what worries me from the ministers perfectly fair answer is that there is no obligation in other legislation <e> <s> it is all very much a question of may rather than shall <e> <s> what i think the minister needs to understand is that in view of the horrific accidents which have been mentioned here and which are the genesis of this bill i am absolutely certain that it is right and proper to consider seriously that an adequate emergency lighting provision must be one of the stable ingredients of a building which escapes a prohibition notice <e> <s> i thank the minister for what he has said so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> what we are being invited to do by the minister and by the noble and learned lord is to say that if there is going to be trouble let us leave it to the courts they will be able to interpret and decide <e> <s> without any disrespect to the courts i should imagine that we have an obligation to be as precise as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> at least two <e>", "<cs> i think that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can deal with what i regard as the quite extraordinary process which he has adopted in dealing with very powerful forces that is the concordat added to by the cbi who came along after the concordat began to work which include consumers industry local authorities and enforcement officers <e> <s> the minister has told us quite fairly that he wishes to widen consultations <e> <s> i believe that trade bodies will need to look carefully at how this government view their status and stature as well as their ability to represent their members <e> <s> in all good faith they consult with their members and produce what they consider to be the opinion of their members for the minister <e> <s> the minister may then say that in that case or is it only that case <e> <s> he has consulted not merely representative bodies but also many individual members and others <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct that the noble lord said that chambers of trade had asked to be consulted <e> <s> if so does he not understand that the national chamber of trade is a member of the retail consortium and to that extent the collective view of chambers of trade is conveyed through it <e> <s> are we to understand that if any one body in a constituent body asks to be consulted in effect it gets the same weight as the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start my run with these three amendments by giving this one to the minister <e> <s> i am certainly prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i take some comfort from the fact that the minister said that where the secretary of state is satisfied that there is a testing house which is competently staffed and has adequate equipment it will be authorised to test <e> <s> there are some large municipal authorities which will be able to satisfy the government that it is possible to provide competence and expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house will the minister say that if a testing house is within the ambit of a local authority that will not prevent it being approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the care which the minister has taken in explaining that this amendment is not necessary <e> <s> however the more he used certain phrases which i carefully wrote down the more worried i became <e> <s> in effect the minister is saying that when goods come into the country and he reminded the house that we are talking about any consumer goods then all officers at a port are competent to make what he termed a preliminary assessment and to form a judgment <e> <s> if the obligation is to be laid upon those people to come to a view within hours i can see a great many of them deciding if they have an option <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept completely immediately and unreservedly that that is what the noble lord the minister said <e> <s> but if there is an onus on the customs officers for the consequences of exercising their powers by allowing goods to go out and subsequently finding it proved that the goods were dangerous and that if they had not been allowed to go out they would have been properly tested and found dangerous then that is contrary to the interests of the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am sure that the whole house appreciates that progress is being made in these matters and that consultation has taken place with a range of people the police the league magistrates and others will the minister say to what extent the views of the players and of supporters clubs have been sought in order to make sure that any plan is implemented <e> <s> surely the minister will agree that the players through their representatives and the responsible supporters clubs are not only entitled to provide the missing ingredient in bringing peace to the terraces <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the spirit of this question is not to decry what is being done either by the minister or by central government but merely to ask for more so that the best interests of the consumer the trade and indeed the nation can be served <e> <s> would the minister agree that a powerful central body capable of playing a pivotal role in training and maintaining standards in the meat industry could be a national asset and that such a body could well be the institute of meat <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister can speak about joint agreements i can certainly try to make both ends meet <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his general support for the aspirations of a great many people to ensure that the meat industry and those who work in it have access to the kinds of opportunities which the minister is aware are provided in japan and in many european countries <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could say anything about the possibility of access to ec funds in order to make sure that the responsibilities which the government have placed upon bodies like the institute of meat are capable of being fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> has he seen the most up to date comparisons published today by nacro which show conclusively that britain continues to head the european league for imprisoning its citizens <e> <s> bearing in mind that the prison department has publicly stated that the certified normal accommodation of is expected to reach very soon does the minister not accept from me that he will receive support from all around the house if he takes positive steps to reduce the prison population by <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister now accept that there are many members of this house and of the other place who wish him well in seeking to reduce and not merely to contain the prison population <e> <s> will he advise his right honourable friend that it is a question not only of numbers but also of the conditions inside the prisons and that it is a very dangerous situation indeed <e> <s> unless it is tackled energetically and imaginatively in the next few months there could be an explosion which will dismay the whole nation <e>", "<cs> hear hear my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he accept first of all that the action announced yesterday by the minister for sport is welcomed not least because that minister also has planning responsibilities <e> <s> does the minister understand that when a property speculator buys out the shareholdings in a football club it does not merely represent the making of a quick million or million but is also an attack upon the heritage and culture of a community <e> <s> surely the government have a responsibility to monitor these matters and take appropriate action <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that as in the case of fulham and queens park rangers situations develop very quickly <e> <s> if one accepts completely the propriety of acting in relation to planning permissions does he think it will be helpful to urge local authorities which have football grounds in their areas to monitor events <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that there is a deadline of lst april this year for the submission of topics to be discussed at the conference <e> <s> will the minister confirm that <e> <s> if that is the case surely the minister and her colleagues have in mind matters to submit <e> <s> will she tell us for instance whether there will be a submission on chemical warfare <e> <s> if so would she care to comment on the publicity to the effect that british universities and polytechnics are currently funded by the mod to research biological and chemical warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords all that we on this side of the house wish to say is that it seems to be a very sensible arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i point out to the minister that there have been many occasions on which i have expressed disappointment at a lack of consultation on matters proceeding through the house <e> <s> on this occasion i sought the views of m k electric because it is the largest employer of labour in edmonton and is very heavily involved and affected by these regulations <e> <s> i was told that there had been a long period of consultation not only with the company directly but also with the various trade associations <e> <s> the minister is obviously looking forward very much to satisfying my noble friend <e> <s> i can assure him that those at the sharp end who are directly affected by the regulations have certainly given me to understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the reason for the delay is that there have been lengthy and proper consultations by the authority with parents teachers pupils and governors <e> <s> can she also confirm that the positive images policy of haringey has not been imposed on anyone <e> <s> in fact if it were to be considered and programmed it would be in conformity with section of the education act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that british rail are imposing this cut without any meaningful negotiation or consultation with the travel agents <e> <s> to describe what has happened as negotiation or consultation is a travesty of what actually took place <e> <s> is the minister also concerned that the reduction in the commissions which are already at a low level will diminish the number of travel agencies that sell british rail tickets in the high streets and that this will undoubtedly react against the best interests of the travelling public <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reflect carefully on the quality of the information that british rail have given him <e> <s> to say that the travel agents were consulted at the abta conference in australia and subsequently is not only a travesty but i believe a deceit <e> <s> the travel agents were told by british rail what was going to happen <e> <s> at no stage were the travel agents involved in negotiating or pleading for a change in the commission <e> <s> all that happened at those meetings was that there was an attempt to delay the implementation <e> <s> will the minister go back to his advisers and say to them that abta rejects completely the idea that there has been any meaningful consultation <e> <s> it is a disgrace <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin as has every noble lord who has spoken in the debate following the maiden speech of my noble friend lord basnett by extending to him my deep thanks and appreciation for bringing not just to this debate but to i am sure all the debates in which he will participate <e>", "<cs> he will convert you <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will accept my assurance that that is a most heartening reply <e> <s> perhaps he can also accept that if the archival records of britains film and cultural heritage leave these shores it will be an appalling and irreplaceable loss <e> <s> bearing in mind that the british film industry is fighting for its commercial and artistic life will the minister review carefully the powers available to him so that the film industry and those who work in it will take on board the fact that he is as concerned as they are with the cultural aspects as well as the commercial aspects of these undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that when he uses the term a difficulty in putting a value on the archive film library many of us would consider that it is priceless <e> <s> it is a national heritage and it ought not to leave this country in any circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by saying how very much i appreciate the manner in which the bill has been presented to your lordships house by the noble lord lord gisborough <e> <s> we are very indebted to the government for their recently announced decision to promote something along the lines of this bill and to amend section of the act <e> <s> we are also entitled to place on record our appreciation to the honourable member for davyhulme mr winston churchill <e> <s> when one follows these matters one appreciates the care and sympathy that he displayed in another place <e> <s> he certainly deserves our congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords with your permission and approval i intend to make the shortest speech of this debate <e> <s> i begin by declaring an interest of a direct association with the trade union actt which i think the house will appreciate has something valuable to say in a debate of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> if the noble lord lord buxton is saying that he is in favour of quotas provided they are not fixed by the government that is a major change <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was saying that he was against quotas but if there is a mechanism which will fix quotas not by civil servants or by the minister but by some other means that to me is a major achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the minister for the careful and sober way in which he has presented this measure to the house <e> <s> as in all debates on northern ireland the house is exceedingly well served by those who are well connected with northern ireland and who bring to our debates their experience and views to the benefit not only of the house but also of the people of northern ireland <e> <s> i have listened to every contribution with deep respect <e> <s> those of us who do not live in northern ireland but who perhaps once removed take responsibilities in these matters are certainly indebted <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that of all the elements that can assist in reducing hooliganism the supporters clubs have a major part to play <e> <s> while i understand the minister saying that they have been part of the consultation process will he not agree that concentration on encouraging supporters clubs to be more vigilant not only about their members but about non-members whom they can identify would go a long way to reducing hooliganism <e>", "<cs> i shall wait until the minister has finished <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by recognising immediately the seriousness and significance of the ministers remarks that although we appear to have a choice in effect we have no choice at all <e> <s> like many of those who have spoken in this discussion and in another place i appreciate the enormity of the step that the minister took on th december last year <e> <s> no one will lose sight of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a brief word in support of what my noble friend said about the care that must be taken over the composition of the boards <e> <s> i can endorse what she said about the aggravation that took place in docklands <e> <s> however that does not mean to say that we do not know and appreciate all that the docklands development corporation has done since <e>", "<cs> and a very good man too <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak on behalf of my noble friend lord prys-davies who unfortunately is unable to be present <e> <s> my noble friend has asked me to pay tribute to the minister for the strong assurances given at second reading and on other occasions regarding the maintenance of confidentiality <e> <s> my noble friend lord prys-davies was most anxious to make that public declaration of thanks to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house how the government propose to influence the commercial judgments and decisions of the new owners <e> <s> is it not a fact that the workers of the enfield small arms factory have been cast off abandoned and sacrificed for party purposes <e> <s> is the minister aware that there are thousands of workers at the enfield small arms factory who helped to save this country in the falklands war and in many others and that they have been abandoned and betrayed by this government <e> <s> how does the noble lord intend to secure the future welfare and well-being of such workers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that if in the commercial judgment of the new owners it is in the best interests of their shareholders to transfer work to close down a factory completely or to put it to other use that is perfectly within their gift <e> <s> in that circumstance has the noble lord no shame that workers who have served the national interest so well are to be abandoned in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords better than anything else the last speech demonstrates the wide gulf in attitudes to the management of the economy and fiscal policy in this country that exists between the government and the opposition <e> <s> it is rather sad that although there are certainly people who benefit from the budget we have failed to hear from members opposite anything about large sections of the community who not only get very little in comparison with others but have been disadvantaged by the way in which the budget has been drawn up <e>", "<cs> my lords does that take into account any increase in vat and other direct taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he share my concern and regret that a large number of consumers who booked their holidays as long ago as last october to go to a certain resort stay in a certain hotel and leave from a certain airport are now finding sometimes with less than hours notice that those arrangements have been cancelled and that they have now been offered holidays at a different resort in a different hotel flying from a different airport <e> <s> that is the nature of consolidation <e> <s> when the minister pursues this matter as i am sure he will will he bear in mind that simply to offer a different hotel or money back is not good enough <e> <s> does he not agree that someone who is left in that position ought also to be offered compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the position is largely due to a determination by the large operators to reserve to themselves as much of the trade as possible this year and that they took steps to book millions of extra holidays in order to do that <e> <s> will the minister seek some means of drawing to the attention of the trade perhaps through the office of fair trading that at the end of the day by operating in that way they are more likely to put small companies out of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that encouraging and sympathetic reply in the light of the teething troubles in establishing both the unit and the course <e> <s> however will the minister confirm that it is the governments intention to increase the training facilities for co-operative leaders of the kind provided by the course at the university especially in view of the emphasis which has been laid by the government and by the secretary of state for trade and industry on the encouragement of co-operatives particularly in the inner cities and elsewhere where there are experiences of deprivation and unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged by the first reply but a little nonplussed by the reply to my supplementary question <e> <s> if the government are committed to the continuation of both the unit and the course it seems strange to me that the existing tutors are on short notice and that notice has been given today <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that he takes the long view and not the short view and that in establishing a course and a unit of this kind he considers it essential that they be given enough time to play themselves in before any firm conclusions are drawn <e> <s> otherwise the government will be guilty of simply using words and not putting their money where their mouth is <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise conscious that this is the speech for which the whole house has been waiting <e> <s> it is the speech which precedes the wind-ups <e> <s> i am conscious that i stand between the house and release from a long important and i believe fascinating debate <e> <s> i wish to begin as many on both sides have done by congratulating the noble earl lord caithness on resuming his responsibilities and to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that one of the aggravations stems <e>", "<cs> my lords blessed are the meek <e> <s> will the minister attempt not to use one reason for inaction as a general reason for inaction <e> <s> the minister seized upon the cost of retrospection <e> <s> retrospection is not the only anomaly <e> <s> if the house agrees with the minister that there are other anomalies then the question simply asks for a review to examine and iron out where possible anomalies that have been revealed <e> <s> we understand the matter of a limited budget <e> <s> however injustice exists and i can assure the house that the british legion feels very passionately about the anomaly which it drew to my attention that the widow of a man killed in the second world war is at a disadvantage compared with the widow of a man killed in the falklands war <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords in referring to my noble friend lord williams the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will agree that that was a one-off situation which we are hoping will not be repeated <e> <s> can he tell us what consultations have been taking place between the cricket and other authorities in order to pool their experience of these and other matters <e> <s> does not the minister also acknowledge that ready accessibility to alcohol very often has a great deal to do with the violence <e> <s> the government perhaps should reflect very much on their plans to extend drinking hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply so far as it goes <e>", "<cs> my lords what plans has the minister for extending employment rights for instance including pension rights to part-time workers <e> <s> in his original reply the minister said that there is no differentiation but i wonder whether he would care to comment on the situation that in many cases in the retail and distributive trades young people are being used as a pool of low-paid casual and temporary labour <e> <s> surely there are categories of workers and in my question i mentioned the low paid and women who are especially vulnerable in todays circumstances <e> <s> can the minister help me on that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what i believe he said <e> <s> but may i be clear that he would be willing to receive a deputation led by myself of those outside who are convinced that the case i have made is correct and that there is evidence of widespread abuse <e> <s> if that evidence is assembled will the noble lord be happy to receive the deputation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister understand that this is a benign question <e> <s> it is neither malignant nor malevolent <e> <s> can the minister take on board and does he fully appreciate the frustration felt not only by magistrates but by the whole panoply of the courts when they assemble at oclock only to find for instance at the highgate court that prisoners who have to come from brixton arrive very often as late as oclock <e> <s> even then they have to be seen by their solicitors <e> <s> is this not a waste not only of the good voluntary services of men and women but also of public money <e>", "<cs> my lords when i visited brixton prison last week i was told and was completely satisfied that the prison vans leave at <e> <s> however i am also told by the highgate magistrates and i also accept it completely that the vans invariably arrive as late as oclock <e> <s> i understand the point about transfers and other stops which have to be made but is not a two and a half hour delay highly unsatisfactory <e> <s> i shall write to the commissioner but will the minister not also agree that he has some responsibility to ensure that our courts are not frustrated not least because people who could become magistrates might very well be put off and spend their time elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords when the report is finally published does the secretary of state expect it to contain recommendations which will give the public any confidence that the derisory fine enjoyed by mr collier convicted of insider dealing will not be repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that over the past three years successive reports the barrow report the cup report and the turton report have all declined to come up with the answer the ministers were hoping for <e> <s> indeed in the turton report of it was reported that the crown suppliers were an example of value for money and that privatisation would not be in the overall public interest <e> <s> why do the government persist in spending good public money now more than in searching for a recommendation the independent consultants refuse to give <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am sure that he recognises that the different privatisation options in the question are lifted directly from the terms of reference of the coopers and lybrand and samuel montagu study <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether any estimate has been made of the costs if and when the crown suppliers were to be privatised in particular in relation to the increase of staff of other government departments to take up the slack which will be left if privatisation takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister is aware that per cent <e> <s> of the commodities supplied by the crown suppliers are british made <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind whatever the report advises that the small businesses in particular the sheltered workshops which are one of the main sources of supply will be given preferential treatment and protection if any change is to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> together with other noble lords he has stressed the limited number of sundays on which racing would take place six and perhaps twelve <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned york perhaps two <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that if betting shops were to be allowed to open they would not just be open on the six the twelve or the two days <e> <s> in order to maintain their viability they would be open for many sundays <e> <s>

it not be helpful for the minister to ask his right honourable friend to invite merton council into his office for a chat <e> <s> when passing on that request will he ask him to treat this conservative-controlled council with a little more respect and less contempt than the secretary of state showed to labour-controlled authorities which were invited to discuss their problems with him last week and which were told that as a precondition they would have to embrace the whole of the governments legislative programme before any discussions could take place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that for many miles the new river meanders along the same terrain as the river lea for instance through enfield and edmonton <e> <s> is the minister aware of proposals by the thames water authority to create a new waterway and thereby make the new river redundant <e> <s> will the minister undertake to have conversations with the thames water authority to persuade it not to proceed with that proposal but to enhance the already historic character of the new river by making more investment in it and thereby creating better management <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to thank most sincerely the noble lord lord orr-ewing for giving us an opportunity to have what i believed was going to be a debate on the united kingdoms air defence <e> <s> yet i am bound to say i was most surprised that the overwhelming proportion of the time taken by the noble lord did not deal so much with air defence as perhaps fairly with the criticism of a certain programme <e> <s> i hope very much that the minister has come along to deal with the question that appears on the order paper and not the question which has actually been posed because if one wanted to pursue the content of the opening speech the question really should have been to ask her majestys government whether they are satisfied with the current and planned improvements and the standards of fairness and lack of bias in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to respond to my query as to the delivery of the two which are either outstanding or programmed <e> <s> can the minister comment on the report i read in the press which i accept could be wholly inaccurate that there is some dispute as to the date or whether in fact they will be delivered at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i heard the minister say that he welcomed the initiatives of british airways <e> <s> will he encourage other air companies to follow the lead of british airways <e> <s> can he see any connection with the action of british airways and the current consideration of the merger with bcal <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill is passed i wish to crave the indulgence of the house for one minute <e> <s> i do not intend to oppose the bill which is a simple even a modest measure <e> <s> it is designed to give the london borough of bexley not only the opportunity of enlarging and improving its existing market at erith but also the possibility of establishing a new market within one mile of the town centre <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the point fairly made by the previous speaker <e> <s> we are talking about legislation and powers <e> <s> if this chamber and the other place were to take a decision on the matter there is nothing to say that a subsequent opportunity for a change of mind would not result in a change of legislation <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that one council which approved the fixture list that was presented to it would be in danger two years later if there were a change of control and a change of heart the answer is yes <e> <s> that is what we call democracy <e> <s> if the second group of people were so minded as to change something they would be doing it because they believed that it was in the interests of the local people <e> <s> they could be right or they could be wrong <e>", "<cs> it is dated th june <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord elton <e> <s> paragraph which is headed <e>", "<cs> with respect i said that the only reference in the bill to time was the noon in respect of betting but as regards the commencement of events there is no control <e> <s> the problem is that the bill seeks to serve a number of purposes one of which is to legalise betting on sundays <e> <s> we are also trying to be fair to the promoters who tell us that the bill is about more than betting it is about the holding of sporting events <e> <s> in this amendment i am proposing that sporting events are not commenced before pm <e> <s> it may not be acceptable and the committee may take the view that it wants no restriction of any kind at all <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly true that rather than have as the bill stands a sporting event at which money is charged for admission starting at any time of the day we are trying to limit the time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wyatt has done the committee a service by indicating that once opponents of the bill concede an inch they provide the ground for the next step <e> <s> the noble lord says that if in this amendment we envisage on-course betting on those sundays then <e>", "<cs> the noble earl should appreciate that even if the grand national were run at midnight on a tuesday there would be million wagered on it <e> <s> everybody would want to see it <e> <s> the grand national is one of those events like the derby and many other races that causes enormous interest whenever it takes place <e> <s> that is a fact <e>", "<cs> we have yet to come to that amendment and i await with interest the view of the committee <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that if all those interests who have already expressed their views have big investments in betting shops they will be satisfied only to open them on seven days we may certainly get into the illegal argument not merely concerning the punter but concerning the people who own the shops <e> <s> i say simply that in a place like edmonton where the betting shop is open and where there is the opportunity for other shopkeepers to seize upon the traffic that is coming through in the vicinity it is only human nature to say if the betting shop is open legally i am going to chance my arm because the law is going to be changed and i will open my shop whatever it may be <e>", "<cs> we have already had the profession by the noble lord lord wyatt that per cent <e> <s> of the betting in this country is illegal already under the present laws <e> <s> no one can produce any reliable statistics as to the extent to which there would be an increase in illegal betting <e> <s> customs and excise cannot give a figure because they have no experience since since the change in the law <e> <s> there could be an increase <e>

the pub <e> <s> it already exists in many pubs you cannot stop that <e> <s> we know that is the main source of betting on a sunday in france <e> <s> where else <e> <s> in homes <e> <s> that is human nature and that is going on now <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not mean to refer to the inside of betting shops because most of them after certain changes were made have been vastly improved <e> <s> i am talking about the ambience in which the betting shop is situated in the high street in the community <e> <s> we are talking about the normal dirt and distress which is caused by traffic not just by motor cars but by people <e> <s> i can envisage in my mind parts of enfield enfield town and edmonton green and i can see the way in which certain councils will be called upon to spend more money to clean up the streets <e> <s> there will be more police and buses and all the rest of it <e> <s> it is an aggregation of additional aggravation and in my view we can do without it <e>", "<cs> i wish to be helpful <e> <s> can we receive guidance on the stature of the amendment in the light of what has just taken place <e>", "<cs> in order to consider the significance and extent of the vote i think that we should have time to reflect <e> <s> i fully understand that means that all sorts of things can happen not least to supporters and the support at another stage <e> <s> to be fair to all the interested parties not least the genuine attempt by the noble lord lord manton to seek to overcome the difficulties that he foresaw may arise we need a period of time <e> <s> my noble friends and i would be willing not to proceed with the motion that clause as amended shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do so with some diffidence <e> <s> in the shops bill we moved amendments designed to apply to all workers <e> <s> in seeking to resist that the government conceded that there could be a case for those who were already working in the industry <e> <s> we were not greedy <e> <s> we did not try to provide a basis of protection for everyone <e> <s> we said let us see whether we can get the chamber to accept that those who presently enjoy whatever they do enjoy shall not have that disturbed <e> <s> when new people enter the industry they may then be prepared to accept the kind of terms or conditions which they freely enter into <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> if there is any dubiety about that i should certainly be prepared to bring forward a drafting amendment <e> <s> as far as i am concerned this covers all those who are employed in the racing industry <e>", "<cs> i think that two or three points need to be made <e> <s> i do not doubt for a moment that what the noble lord lord wyatt has told the house is the intention of those who control the purse strings if racing on sunday comes about <e> <s> however the people who work in the industry and reference has been made to the stable lads have their own store of experience against which to judge what their employers say will happen in the event of certain action <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble lord would say a little more about the significance of deleting the words referred to in the amendment that is the whole of subsection <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say <e>", "<cs> there is a solution to this difficulty <e> <s> the amendment that we have just passed which includes a schedule relating to protection of employees contains the word track <e> <s> to that extent events have moved on since the committee accepted amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the way out of this difficulty is for the committee not to proceed with this amendment if in order to make sense at the next stage we look at further amendments <e> <s> rather than accept the amendment and then put it right the sensible thing to do would be not to accept this amendment and if there is need for clarification at the next stage a further amendment can be made <e>", "<cs> we seek guidance <e> <s> we want to be consistent with the earlier amendments which the committee has accepted <e> <s> i am certainly willing to move support or not move that which does precisely that <e> <s> so i think we need some guidance from the table <e>", "<cs> if one does that the minister is saying that this matter is clearly without prejudice <e> <s> if on reflection the accepting of this amendment which is an alteration to the long title does not fit properly with the amendments to the bill that we have carried there should be no dispute that we will be changing the long title at the next stage <e>", "<cs> that is done without prejudice <e> <s> if the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford or others after reflection consider any changes should be made to the long title or to the words of the bill they are free to move an amendment to either at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the lateness of the hour but i want to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord bethell on seizing the opportunity <e> <s> i know how these things are handled by the business managers <e> <s> they have provided us even as late in the day as this with the opportunity although perhaps the significance of what we say may not be capable of being taken into account <e> <s> but i live in hope <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the helsinki final act still has a useful part to play in the objectives of western defence <e> <s> what have her majestys government to say of the implications for western defence priorities in view of the cuts in defence expenditure widely predicted as a result of current considerations regarding the american budget <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the law in respect of sunday trading is clear unambiguous and enforceable <e> <s> is not this proved every week by those local authorities which have the will and respect the law <e> <s> they are bringing successful prosecutions whenever they choose to do so <e> <s> would it not be good advice to those who call themselves supporters of the law but who at present dislike it that they should support it until it is changed <e>", "<cs> my lords if majority decisions are in order at this meeting can the minister inform the house whether the liberalisation of air fares will be a matter that can also be dealt with at the same time <e> <s> when we are talking about liberalisation apart from access we are talking about making the nonsense of the comparison of scheduled air costs which are operated by a pseudo cartel in europe comparable with the charges made elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords surely if that is a fact and the minister wants to ensure that those who need milk for nutritional purposes get it he should leave the present welfare food order alone <e> <s> low income groups will then continue to get milk tokens after april <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate what the minister said about those who are at present receiving the welfare benefit and that the food which is primarily milk will continue will be acknowledge that there are other groups who are in great need of the nutritional value of milk and who in future will receive cash <e> <s> surely the minister appreciates that if we value the benefits of milk as a food we ought to do everything possible to ensure that it is drunk <e> <s> is the minister aware that it has been calculated that under the scheme million litres of whole milk a year will not be consumed <e> <s> is the minister satisfied that this is a proper way of using public money particularly in the case of those who are on a low income <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help the minister <e> <s> i could have been misunderstood <e> <s> the million litres of whole milk is milk that will not then be available once the governments intentions are carried through <e> <s> in other words it will be denied to the present categories who at the moment enjoy it <e>", "<cs> thereby hangs a tale <e>", "<cs> otherwise correct <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the report in a newspaper this morning that at a recent meeting with the employees his ministerial colleague mr chope said that the board of crown suppliers was a trade union acolyte for refusing to accept the idea of a management buy-out <e> <s> does he consider that such language is conducive to a good relationship with employees <e> <s> surely in the light of the successful profit return of the employees the minister and his colleagues ought to be encouraging them and not discouraging them by using language of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo entirely the call made by my noble friend that more houses should be built <e> <s> will the minister take on board the effect in london of the homeless on the tourist industry <e> <s> is the minister aware that in areas such as paddington and bayswater one-third of the hotel accommodation is taken up by the homeless <e> <s> is he also aware that more than rooms are occupied by the homeless throughout london <e> <s> does he not deplore the fact that this leads not only to a loss of jobs but also to lost income to london from tourists by less spending in shops and restaurants <e> <s> will the minister take that on board when he is trying to cobble together a policy for housing londoners <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the chasing of every penny for efficiency in street-cleaning and refuse collection is not only dangerous but can lead to unhealthy conditions <e> <s> will the noble lord look closely at those authorities which in trying to save pennies use black plastic bags for their refuse collections <e> <s> these bags are very often attacked by animals and can be highly dangerous in the streets <e>", "<cs> i have been interested to hear the drift of the arguments <e> <s> the point is not so much that there may not be a public interest but that one ought not to write that into the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning invited the committee to leave the matter to the judges <e> <s> there may be some parliamentarians who would prefer to leave the matter to the will of parliament <e> <s> if we are being invited by the minister to say that this is unnecessary that is another argument <e> <s> if we are being invited to believe that in the absence of precise wording these matters invariably find themselves in the courts and will therefore be determined by the courts that is a further argument <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord lord denning attacked the argument saying that the matter would be laughed out of court <e> <s> i am not as learned in these matters as are other members of the committee but i fail to understand that point <e>", "<cs> i rise only to say that the mover of the amendment made an impressive case in general terms <e> <s> as i think he acknowledged there are others in the committee with far greater experience than either he has or certainly i have and whose opinions we deeply respect <e> <s> i listened carefully in an earlier debate to the words of the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> he was quite clear and strong and quite rightly in wanting the original creator of works to have either acknowledgment or payment <e>", "<cs> therefore you pay your money and you take your choice <e> <s> i am of the view and always have been perhaps because i am on this side of the chamber that i would much rather see the words in the bill even though people tell me that they are not really needed <e> <s> there is great comfort and peace of mind for the layman if he can refer to something even though he is told that it is covered by something else or covered in another act <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be helpful to the committee as i believe he has been all along and that if he cannot accept the amendment he will say something that will be helpful to those of us who are sympathetic to the aims of the amendment <e>", "<cs> not at westminster my lords <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can help someone like myself who has taken an interest in the bill but who clearly is not as privy as many others are to the vast panoply of consultation that must have taken place between the minister and his advisers before the bill was drawn up <e> <s> for instance when in clause we are talking about an educational establishment can the committee be told precisely what was in the ministers mind concerning the interpretation of those words <e> <s> what is an educational establishment <e> <s> what are its ranges and so on <e>", "<cs> in response to the remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone i thought i was addressing myself to the amendment <e> <s> it deals with clause and seeks to alter its meaning <e> <s> i acknowledge that the noble lord lord mottistone is better versed than i am in the genesis of the bill and in many other matters but i was genuinely asking what consultation had taken place <e>", "<cs> if in order to make my case on clause i need to refer to the previous subsection am i being invited to believe that am out of order or <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl going to deal with my point on consolidation <e> <s> that is the genesis of my argument <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the quality of the construction of housing and factories is of the utmost importance <e> <s> is he aware that he has a pivotal role to play in maintaining standards <e> <s> will he consult the industry rather than wait for it to come to him <e> <s> if he would consult the industry and bodies like the federation of master builders they would not only give him good advice but also help him to improve the flow of apprentices in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that if this was a boxing match i believe the other side would have thrown in the towel by now because what we have heard from the noble viscount lord tonypandy is in my view not only a demolition job on the amendment but a stout defence of the character of the english sunday <e> <s> the noble lords opposite are perfectly entitled to believe that there is a clamour that there is a desire and that there is a need to have racing on sunday <e> <s> i have seen extracts from the surveys and the statistics which can be used or abused <e> <s> the case will not rest upon statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment betting shops are closed in the evening <e> <s> the ordinary person who wants to bet on an evening can <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the clarity of his remarks but whether they are acceptable is another matter <e> <s> i simply point out that clause lists the circumstances in which the right does not apply <e> <s> quite clearly subsection c refers specifically to the film industry and to the director <e> <s> when we consider what that means it is that the right of a work not to suffer unjustified modification does not apply where copyright is vested in the directors employer who is the producer <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend <e> <s> the realities of the film and television industry are such that there will always be immense pressures on writer-directors to consent to a waiver of their rights <e> <s> there is also a tendency in that industry and it may not be an exception to work at very great pressure <e> <s> in the first instance agreements are verbal <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the minister <e> <s> i am not sure that those <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> those who believe they have gained something under the bill find once again when they look closer that the substance disappears <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will read with care what the minister has said <e> <s> clearly it is possible to presume difficulties which the ministers words may overcome <e> <s> without reservation or qualification because i may need to come back at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain the minister is anxious to answer the question which is contained in the submission by the noble lord lord kennet and it is not my business to stand in his way <e> <s> i certainly would not subscribe to the view of my noble friend lord hatch who asked if we are to be met by his usual evasiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that information <e> <s> is the minister aware of the growing national concern at the plight of patients in such hospitals as friern barnet when they are to be returned to the alleged care of the community <e> <s> can he tell us what monitoring he and his officials have in order to ensure that before patients are sent for instance from friern barnet into the london boroughs of barnet enfield and haringey they take steps to ensure that the local authority has adequate social services for instance in housing and unemployment <e> <s> i am sure that the minister is aware that there have been grave situations in which patients who have been returned to the care of the community are left virtually neglected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there is a conflict <e> <s> does the minister recall that he told the house that patients leave hospitals such as friern barnet only when the hospitals are satisfied that the authorities in whose area they live have adequate resources <e> <s> will the minister accept that practice on the ground shows that very often the system does not work as the minister and his colleagues believe <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise perhaps for the first and only time <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wyatt has indicated the need for these amendments was foreseen at the last and earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> at the committee stage one recognised that in some haste and perhaps confusion insufficient attention had been given to the precise detail in the proposal that i put forward <e> <s> immediately thereafter the noble lord lord wyatt indicated to me that this series of amendments to tidy up and to make more relevant and meaningful my amendment to the bill was best dealt with at this stage <e> <s> at the last stage the noble lord lord wyatt gave notice that we would put this forward now <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> when i mentioned the transport and general workers union it was in the context of the industry including the betting shops <e> <s> i acknowledge what has been said about the stable lads <e> <s> i am delighted that there is rapport on all sides within the industry <e> <s> that may be the wrong word to use but i understand that some useful discussions are going on which are bound to benefit those who work in the industry <e> <s> i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that information <e> <s> has he reflected on the plea from the central council for physical recreation which represents governing bodies of sports that his plan to encourage the privatisation of sports facilities should not discourage the young and disadvantaged from sports participation <e> <s> will the minister also recognise the fact that when famous football clubs and even the sponsorship of the fa cup arc regularly put up to the highest bidder the government have a great responsibility to achieve the right balance between private and public funding <e> <s> should he not encourage public provision whenever there is a need <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has rested very heavily on the open letter from his ministerial colleague to the chairman of the sports council <e> <s> in view of the fact that the secretary of the ccpc has said that the letter confirmed his worst fears and was the kiss of death for national sports governing bodies will the minister have a word with his parliamentary colleague the minister for sport in order to ensure that he goes about building bridges and not blowing them up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beloff will not expect me to follow what he said and neither will the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> however i intend to make reference to one or two of the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dispute the information that the noble lord has given but if he is saying that less than per cent <e> <s> of the contracts have been awarded to the two dominant groups he knows very well that industry is in a process of takeover and merger <e> <s> i have information which states that when the west midlands local authority put its services out for tender companies put in tenders <e> <s> those companies are now reduced to four as several of them have been taken over <e>", "<cs> my lords in the main postmen are worried about liability for attacks by dogs <e> <s> if one has no system one is in great difficulty <e> <s> if there is a licensing system one at least begins to find where liability lies <e> <s> sadly more than half the attacks that were made on postmen over the past years have come from family pets and not from strays <e> <s> i have mentioned the word stray and i am afraid that that is what i have been tempted to do more than once during this short discourse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> is she aware that last friday i went to chase lane school in chingford at lunchtime to observe the dinner ladies who will be affected by the bill if it becomes law <e> <s> they are dedicated people and provide the best possible value for money <e> <s> but they are right in believing that if the bill is passed and they win the contract it will either result in a diminution of the value of what they provide or a reduction in their wages and conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i first express my appreciation to the noble lord lord donaldson for having sought this opportunity but even more for the fullness with which he has painted the picture <e> <s> he has done so to such an extent that a great deal of what might otherwise have been said by <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise but i have one supplementary point <e> <s> the newspaper report refers to the staff having been told by the home office to go on to fresh start immediately with only prison officers <e> <s> do i understand from what the minister said that that is wrong <e> <s> the minister has also told us that fresh start will only begin by agreement <e> <s> he made the third point that he and his colleagues are working very hard to produce a formula which will allow fresh start to commence <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister will confirm that i have understood the position correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from me that time and money spent on reducing crowd violence at soccer matches is well spent <e> <s> does he not take very seriously the evidence that the danger arising from alcohol-induced violence affects not only those who are in the football grounds <e> <s> it also affects communities and the transport and shopping facilities of those who live near the grounds <e> <s> will he further accept that whether or not it is a football authority any authority which places the raising of money before the safety of the public ought to be severely chastised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in favour of devolution by evolution <e> <s> i certainly hesitate to contemplate the enormity of a change as dramatic as that which has been painted not only in this house but in another house and which would so radically alter the management of the affairs of scotland that the scottish people to all intents and purposes become a separate nation state <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister has said is good so far as it goes but could he be helpful by telling us what action the government intend taking as their contribution to the european child safety campaign which is due to begin in april <e> <s> can we be told of the extent to which the voluntary sector and the media will be involved <e> <s> when doing so will the minister bear in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches perhaps i may first congratulate my noble friend lord willis on seizing this timely opportunity <e> <s> his good luck has meant that we are able tonight to discuss this question <e> <s> the words joy pride pleasure and satisfaction have been used in this debate <e> <s> i feel all those emotions when i think of australia <e> <s> the noble lord lord willis said that he visited australia for the first time

may be borne down by worry despair and a great many of the other feelings that can beset us can return without having become a friend of australia for the rest of his or her life <e>", "<cs> the last shall be first and where there is a willis there is a way <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a most disappointing reply <e> <s> i shall try to summarise what he said <e> <s> first he said that the amendment is not necessary because there are other provisions in the bill which will do what it seeks to do that is to take account of the variety of circumstances that apply to different authorities and the local availability of contractors of which the minister will take account if he is prevailed upon to do so <e> <s> nevertheless he wishes to lay down blanket legislation <e> <s> he speaks with some authority about the communist party and monolithic structures <e> <s> what he is doing is to begin at the very beginning by laying this down <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down will she confirm that i heard her correctly when she said that this bill will not compel local authorities to put all their services out to tender <e> <s> if that is the case i draw the attention of the noble baroness to clause at the top of page which states <e>", "<cs> let us suppose that the service that a local authority is invited to deal with is not the one which to its knowledge it believes it would be preferable to deal with first <e> <s> the minister has outlined a scheme which i can understand which means that not all authorities will put out tenders for <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> as the minister is aware his advisers have suggested that amendments nos <e> <s> and can perfectly properly be debated together so my remarks will include those three <e> <s> but i acknowledge that when the matter is resolved if it has to go to a vote the vote will be taken on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the deputy chairman of the committee pointed out that will negative the other amendments <e>", "<cs> the ministers response is far from satisfactory <e> <s> perhaps it is only he and i who have the benefit of having studied the consultation document which is the key to what i believe is a misunderstanding <e> <s> the minister understands the matter very well because he has read the document and so have i however i fear that the noble baroness lady blatch could not have done so because she persists in putting forward the argument that it is wholly within the gift of the local authority to determine its pricing policy to establish its criteria and to go out to tender <e> <s> it then says to those who are tendering these are the charges to be applied and you must manage the situation <e> <s> in other words it is perfectly clear that in all other tenders cleaning catering and matters of that kind the authority will be able to lay down its standard and then invite people to meet that standard <e> <s> but that is not so with leisure and sports <e> <s> i believe that it may be helpful to the noble baroness to read out the appropriate part of the consultation paper <e> <s> the government have invited local authorities to comment on which alternative they prefer there is no question that if there is a majority in favour of one or the other they will get it <e> <s> the options are either <e>", "<cs> the swimming pools and sports complex having been handed over if it turns out that the policy was wrong one will find that many facilities for community use that have been handed over will be closed <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will appreciate that these concerns are genuine <e> <s> they are not merely restricted to what is the hitherto known major disaster of a contractor going bankrupt <e> <s> the remarks by the noble earl lord balfour need reading and answering here tonight <e> <s> we are into a new ball game <e> <s> there are going to be many more private contractors for cleaning catering sports facilities and other activities <e> <s> in this amendment we are not concerned with dealing with what one might call a normal management situation <e> <s> bankruptcy and failure to deliver the service is better known in private rather than in public facilities <e>", "<cs> now i have two pieces of paper instead of one <e>", "<cs> i am staggered at the amount of time and argument that the minister has used to justify his unwillingness to include in the categories of exemption the minuscule numbers involved <e> <s> the minister spoke in terms of the people i am trying to include in the exemptions for competitive tendering not being as prominent in the caring role <e> <s> i have news for him <e> <s> as my noble friend lord dean said someone who is looked upon as a functionary the caretaker in the eyes of a child assumes major significance <e> <s> the people those in excepted schools day centres and institutions for the adult mentally handicapped see year in and year out could well be the cleaning staff <e> <s> they are part of their life <e> <s> they are part of their empire <e> <s> the people who perform a more important role may come and may go <e>", "<cs> the minister was right in saying that they would not be surprised <e> <s> the minister is telling us that the earlier position was capable of misinterpretation or different interpretation otherwise he would not have taken his recent action <e> <s> i believe it is breath-taking that although the intentions of the government have been made clear for some time the actual documentation that triggers the request or the remit has to wait <e> <s> the minister tells us that not only do they have to start doing things on st april but they must have actually completed the preparations in order to begin to do things then <e> <s> if they continue to do that which has not gone out to competitive tender after that then they are in default of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he talks about built-in flexibility taking into account and consultation processes that have yet to be completed <e> <s> but the only specific thing we have is that st march and st april are something like eight or nine weeks away <e> <s> i am trying to assess the weight of the work <e>", "<cs> one year and eight weeks <e> <s> my noble friends on the other benches are smiling at what they obviously think was a mistake <e> <s> i shall make their smiles even bigger it was <e> <s> but i count carefully and there are very few people here who heard me say that <e> <s> no doubt they will read <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure for me to respond to the noble lord because as i understand it these are the first amendments to a bill to which he has had the doubtful privilege and pleasure of replying and he has done so most ably <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps help the minister <e> <s> how a contractor will comply with his responsibilities will first be part of the terms of the contract <e> <s> secondly it will be up to the authority to make sure that it gets the best contractor to apply <e> <s> the sad thing i believe is that some contractors are irresponsible they will do a great deal in order to get the contract <e> <s> once they have got it they will not be too careful as to how they fulfil it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has properly taken the opportunity which the amendment gives him to refer to a number of issues which are wrapped up in it <e> <s> he has fairly touched upon four or five separate debates which we on this side of the committee perceive as being worthy of examination in detail <e>", "<cs> before the minister responds he quite fairly dismissed the idea that councils would be asking prospective contractors to complete questions about their employment practices <e> <s> he quoted what the leicester authority is doing and i do not think he thought much of it <e> <s> would the minister care to comment on the views of the secretary of state for the environment in another place when the issuing of questionnaires with regard to compliance under section of the race relations act was discussed <e> <s> if we are dismissing the necessity for a council to ask questions about the employment policy of a prospective contractor then indeed we have a conflict <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> i do understand <e> <s> the amendment we are debating is the second amendment on the marshalled list amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> with it we are taking amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was simply outlining that one is a paving amendment to the genesis of the other <e>", "<cs> we have had a very good and well informed debate even though not everyone will have had the benefit that the minister has had of reading the documents <e> <s> all the observations have been well meant and the concern is genuine <e> <s> but if it comes down to a legal opinion perhaps i may ask the minister whether he has had the benefit of the advice of the government law officers <e> <s> if we are faced with a legal opinion by someone on one side and a legal opinion by someone else on the other side we are involved in an interpretation <e> <s> the government say they are prohibited from doing what we desire because of a directive <e> <s> i would hope that part of the panoply of advice which the government have had is the advice of their law officers <e> <s> genuinely and without malice <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> with great respect they were decoupled from amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a was the subject of the very first general debate of the day and it is quite clear that these amendments were decoupled from that <e> <s> they are now listed separately <e>", "<cs> if that is the case why did the ministers advisers agree to decouple the amendments and list them separately in the groupings <e> <s> the minister well knows what happens before a debate starts <e> <s> his advisers make a suggestion as to which amendments should be grouped together <e> <s> those of us who are involved make our suggestions <e> <s> because we wanted to deal at length with each of the <e>", "<cs> perhaps we are being invited to have the longest clause stand part debate in history <e> <s> let the minister be quite clear <e> <s> if there has been an error then the way to deal with these matters in detail is to debate them with the general reasons why the clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is no good the minister telling me that no error has been made if i have admitted making an error <e> <s> when we asked for the amendments to be decoupled it was on the basis that we could deal with them separately later <e> <s> that was our error <e> <s> what i am saying to the minister in the light of that error is that we still have a lot to say on the subject matter of these amendments and as the deputy chairman has kindly pointed out the opportunity will occur on clause stand part <e> <s> i am not getting excited <e>", "<cs> or a mythis <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that in listening to the general debate the minister will hang on to the central theme <e> <s> there is discrimination <e>", "<cs> before the clause is allowed to pass i should like to say a few words <e> <s> i believe that we have had in defence of this clause an exercise in complacency and arrogance by the government such as i cannot recall having happened for a long time <e> <s> we have not even had the grace of crocodile tears <e> <s> there is not a word in this clause that the government feel is either wrong or could be improved <e> <s> members on this side of the committee have sought for five or six hours to inject a little bit of humanity local knowledge and flexibility into the two intentions of the government which are to take work away from local authorities and give it to their friends in the private sector <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear that the minister is intransigent <e> <s> as an example strathclyde regional authority has lists containing the names of firms <e> <s> all of them will in future have to rely upon seeing the advertisement according to the minister <e> <s> i fail to see why the minister cannot accept that in the overwhelming majority of authorities the minister would have to specify even if there were only one authority if one company is excluded on what i consider to be the spurious grounds of noncommercial interests they have to go to that trouble <e>", "<cs> i bet that if the minister had the details he would not hesitate to spell them out <e> <s> i strongly suspect that he does not have them <e> <s> i am not saying that they are not available <e> <s> over the past few minutes the minister has again <e>", "<cs> once bitten twice shy <e>", "<cs> it was amended <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i should also like to advise the house that my noble friend lord mcintosh is not dealing with the matter as in his professional consultancy business he acts for the crown suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords but will the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for providing the opportunity to raise one or two matters <e> <s> will he explain why in the terms of reference of the last two reports consideration of the public interest aspect was not included <e> <s> he will be aware that the public interest was the strongest prevailing criterion for the advice given to the minister in the first two reports <e> <s> will he explain why it was deliberately excluded from the last two reports <e> <s> in my view the public interest is very important <e>", "<cs> i am amazed at the defence that the government have put forward for their unwillingness and inability to accept this amendment <e> <s> it boils down to this <e> <s> by virtue of a timescale that they set themselves they have been unable to deal with the objectives of the new clause with which i believe the minister expressed sympathy <e> <s> we are not talking about people with a lot of money <e> <s> we are not talking about people who have alternative sources of housing of benefits or of largesse <e> <s> we are talking about people at the desperate end of the scale who feel that they have been badly done by <e>", "<cs> the minister will recall that i have raised questions before on what i call the good sense in not arguing with the general case that the government and the minister support but only when we are able to draw to his attention what we believe is the serious impact upon groups of people who are less able to look after themselves than others <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister is trying to be helpful but he uses phrases such as <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a turn-up for the books for the noble baroness but not for those who know of sheffield and others <e> <s> they have deep concern for their responsibilities in responding to emergencies in peacetime <e> <s> if the minister takes on board the comments of the noble baroness about the need to build into the cost structure of the tendering document that will solve some of the questions that have been asked <e> <s> however that poses the question that the cost of the tender will be inevitably higher than otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his promise to write if in fact any points were not covered <e> <s> i am satisfied that a perusal of the record will be sufficient <e> <s> he has answered a number of the points i made <e> <s> i understand that the department assumes or expects <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it an affirmative order is not capable of amendment <e> <s> the earlier six provisions which are part of the bill are capable of amendment <e> <s> therefore to that extent there is a narrowing of the opportunity to change the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords he is turning in his grave now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the care that he has taken in trying to allay the fears of many outside the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter seemed to feel that it was possible for a local authority to build into any contract tendering procedure the specific groups in the community it wished either to benefit or to protect <e> <s> but i am sure that he will not mind if i draw to his attention the crucial part of the document for consultation that went out to local authorities <e> <s> in that document there are two options <e> <s> the first is that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very fair question <e> <s> i should like to know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i thank the minister <e> <s> in order to be clear about it did the minister say that in effect from day one now until the successful tenderer operates there will be a -month timescale <e> <s> can the minister help me with that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are asking for months from the first day of consultation <e> <s> i made the point however that i would understand if the minister because of his political imperatives felt that that was a delaying tactic <e> <s> i said that those outside would want longer <e> <s> he was careful in the remarks he made and therefore one must read them very carefully to get their full meaning <e> <s> am i right in thinking he said that without the amendment there would be months available for consultation until implementation <e> <s> that is my understanding and i want to be clear that it is right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the minister is saying that once it is decided to add a new service which is a decision to which no one will be privy except the minister and his colleagues before it is announced there will be a three-month consultation period on the document that sets out the arguments <e> <s> for example there was a document issued last november on sport and leisure with a consultation closing date at the end of january <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that i am surprised would be an overstatement <e> <s> the weight of evidence that the noble earl heard at the last meeting was very powerful <e> <s> the supporting evidence which we have quoted here underlines the case <e> <s> first let me say on behalf of my colleagues and many outside the house that we are very grateful indeed for what quite clearly is a concession the size of which will vary according to the authority and the individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that consultations between himself and british telecom could be better used to ensure that traditional services are preserved and maintained <e> <s> i know that we can take most things from the ministry as read <e> <s> however when we are considering service to the consumer surely it would be more profitable to ensure not only that red boxes are available but that the telephones in them are maintained and serviced and that the consumers interest in respect of access to the telephone and the charges being made by british telecom is pursued with vigour <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that the minister would wish to respond to some of the points directed to him by the noble baroness lady seear who put forward a powerful argument <e> <s> the minister is virtually saying that there is no need for the words on the face of the bill because there are ways in which a local authority can draw its own conclusions <e> <s> it has access and the experience of watching people <e> <s> listening to my noble friend lady phillips one would imagine that the westminster council needs its head examined if with its experience it engaged the contractor to which she referred <e> <s> however that is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he said that the standard of expertise being offered by virtue of membership of an association should not be the only criterion <e> <s> of course the minister is correct <e> <s> he then said that the previous work record was equally important <e> <s> it is but what about those businesses that have no previous work record <e> <s> what about new businesses <e> <s> a companys previous work record may be thin because it is new and so it will not comply with that precondition <e> <s> what about long-standing businesses which change ownership <e> <s> what about long-standing <e>", "<cs> my lords so in effect the previous work record is not so important because the noble earl has told the house that he had no previous work record <e> <s> however he had an ability to convey confidence to the authority by virtue of what he was able to say to it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to rise immediately following the noble baroness lady macleod and the noble baroness lady masham because they are both signally successful in representing their beliefs on particular aspects of matters contained in the bill <e> <s> i have known the noble baroness lady macleod for many years <e> <s> she is acknowledged as being devoted not least among many other things to her work for the magistracy <e> <s> in my community of enfield she is acknowledged as having played a major part in elevating the stature and standing of magistrates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend not only for giving way but for advising me that he would say what he has said <e> <s> if he had listened carefully i did not make the plea on behalf of any one element <e> <s> i said that i made my point against advice from the retail consortium <e> <s> i said that the retail consortium represented per cent <e> <s> of the retail sales in this country <e> <s> i then instanced the organisations certainly the co-op and tescos asda marks and spencer and all the others <e>", "<cs> as well as others <e>", "<cs> my lords what about doing it in a newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the speech of my noble friend lord peston who said very wise things about what has been described previously as a silly bill an unnecessary bill and a dangerous bill <e> <s> as far as i am concerned i subscribe to that general condemnation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships house long but it may be helpful if i set out the basis of the bill and its importance to london and the people who live and work in our capital city <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister has something useful positive and <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he comment on the european situation where the position appears to be different to the point he is arguing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a letter addressed to the noble lord lord beaverbrook from the actt which is speaking on behalf of directors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am puzzled at the remarks of the noble lord lord mcgregor <e> <s> as i read the amendments the copyright remains firmly in the hands of the newspaper when one is considering the purpose for which the object was commissioned <e> <s> his employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work for the purpose for which it is created <e> <s> in using illustrations of fetes weddings and so on we are talking about a photographer who is an employee of a newspaper and is sent on an assignment to take those pictures for the purpose of being used in the newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recognise that if he wishes to see barbaric conditions for prisoners all he needs to do is to visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the minister will know that this relates to a point i raised earlier on the advice of the association of cinematograph television and allied technicians <e> <s> it has a real concern about the value of the moral rights although it is pleased to see them in the bill <e> <s> the more one looks at it the more one sees a real danger in clauses and in relation to film directors that the rights which are given with one hand are taken away in all other normal circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount care to tell the house a little more about who will eventually own the industry <e> <s> is it not a fact that at the moment the industry is owned by the taxpayers <e> <s> would he care to tell us what steps will be taken to ensure that foreign interests will not be enabled by various means to own this industry <e> <s> also will the minister address himself to the explanation that the industry is all for what he has proposed <e> <s> for instance would he tell us the response of those who work in the industry that is the employees <e> <s> what consultation has taken place with them to enable him to make that statement <e> <s> would he also care to tell us what consumer bodies he has consulted in order to be able to say that those who are affected by the industry are all for it too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the care he has taken <e> <s> but he has not satisfied me <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with the point made by my noble friend lord howie <e> <s> i appreciate as i said in my opening remarks that there may be circumstances of great speed and pressure <e> <s> my noble friend quite fairly questions the practicality of this <e> <s> i acknowledge that there are and are likely to be practical difficulties <e> <s> however by virtue of proxy and power of attorney in the absence of the right which is being infringed i can see practical people coming to practical solutions <e> <s> i am talking here in terms of little people as opposed to big people and it is their interests i wish to protect as much as possible <e> <s> the minister has failed to distinguish <e>", "<cs> if there is good faith and integrity between the two of them i believe this matter could be resolved by virtue of the trust that one has in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord willis speaks with far more authority experience and candour than i can about the nature of the world in which he has been an eminent practitioner for a great length of time <e> <s> we are being invited not to put into the bill that which is seen by those outside as likely to afford them some minimum protection <e> <s> i acknowledge that in practice it may prove to be difficult and irksome and it may very well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as always to the minister for the care that he has taken to answer the argument <e> <s> he places much greater faith in the value of the moral rights held by certain individuals in certain circumstances <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b simply seeks to establish that the person affected the director or any other individual in that position will have seen and have had put to him in writing information so that he can then make an informed and meaningful decision on the waiver <e> <s> that is all that amendment no <e> <s> b is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving that reply <e> <s> can he say anything about the offence of shoplifting in respect of these matters <e> <s> can he also tell us how extensive is the consultation process as regards fixed penalties taking into account the fact that there are distinctions between scottish and english law <e> <s> for instance are the views of magistrates taken into account because i undertstand that the pressure on the courts could be considerably relieved under the fixed penalty system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the care that he has taken in answering the question <e> <s> however will he comment on the point that i raised <e> <s> prior to the powers being exercised to what extent do consultations take place with magistrates courts and their representatives <e> <s> i understand that the courts are under great pressure and that the fixed penalty system may well be one way of easing the pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords why have the government continued to cut the housing investment programme year after year particularly of london councils <e> <s> why do they continue to acquiesce in the misuse of public money in cramming thousands of families into bed-and-breakfast hotels which are very unsatisfactory <e> <s> why is it tolerated that in london streets every night there are more than single homeless people and in london there is one school where out of pupils are homeless <e> <s> what will the minister do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that under this government the rate support grant to councils has been steadily reduced from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> why do the government persist in giving to local authorities the impossible choice between maintaining a good road programme housing education and the social services <e> <s> why do not the government increase the general rate support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> as the house understands from time to time the full implications and consequences of legislation in every situation cannot be foreseen <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to say that this is such a situation <e> <s> i cannot believe that knowingly willingly and deliberately the minister and his advisers are seeking to say to unemployed people who are retained firemen doing very dangerous jobs for the community because you are unemployed and because a certain measure has been passed you will receive less after th april <e>", "<cs> my lords can her majestys government say anything about the value of contracts that have so far been won by british firms <e> <s> i am sure the minister will recall that in when the agreements were reached we were told that anything up to billion dollars-worth of contracts would be given to this country under sdi <e> <s> my information is that the figure is fewer than million dollars at present <e> <s> can the minister tell the house anything arising from the recent statement made by general abrahamson about the delays that are likely to be experienced in the fulfilment of sdi <e> <s> so far as concerns sdi can we not say that such a project would be better lost in space <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord harris of greenwich who has spoken out with compassion and conviction <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that what he wants to achieve is not to castigate anyone but to find solutions and ways in which the circumstances outlined will never happen again <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he makes the case for the minority members of a union in a dispute who lose their argument and find themselves in a minority <e> <s> we are arguing about the right of a trade union to discipline such people <e> <s> how would the noble lord react to people in a minority working for the employer by for example taking payment or giving out leaflets encouraging the members of the union to work <e> <s> will the noble lord say how he would view the right of a trade union to discipline its members in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the minister will accept this as being a very modest amendment <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will recognise that perhaps this is the appropriate moment at which i ought to have raised the issue that i inadvertently raised earlier <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing his observations now as he was inhibited about making them earlier <e>", "<cs> i agree <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the noble lord keeps referring to the elections of the num and commenting on their

amendment <e> <s> i take the matter seriously although it is not a matter of life and death <e> <s> it would not be of great importance if the amendment was moved and not carried <e> <s> if the amendment is put to the house and the vote is lost there would be no great outcry <e> <s> the amendment is moved in the sense that the bill presents an opportunity to attempt to rationalise an ongoing situation <e> <s> my noble friend lord ardwick misunderstood what i had said <e> <s> i was not arguing that the extra half an hour would be used by people buying their drink earlier in order that they could consume it earlier <e> <s> it is for the convenience of the ordinary shopper <e> <s> i was making a case for the consumer who having entered the store at am is confounded by his inability at being able to leave by am having purchased his goods <e> <s> i am saying that we should look at that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the courtesy and care with which the minister has made his remarks <e> <s> i am not going to press this amendment to a vote because i am well aware that what has been said here can clearly put this matter in a wider context <e> <s> all noble lords who have spoken and commented upon my remarks have quite fairly pointed out that logic is on my side <e> <s> i am very much taken by what the noble lord lord somers said <e> <s> logicality is not the only matter that has to be considered regarding these issues <e> <s> i am very much minded of the way in which not only the right reverend prelate but others have alluded to the totality of the argument that one day will have to be joined about the whole rationale of our life on sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with what the minister has said <e> <s> in effect he acknowledges that i have arguments but with great respect to him he chooses to ignore them <e> <s> the minister is saying that there is no difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i well understand that as regards a clean sheet the views of the police would be sought in the consultative processes that have taken place between the minister his advisers and others <e> <s> however were their views sought on every amendment and on specific amendments <e> <s> i think that it is still possible for the minister to reflect on what the amendment tries to do <e> <s> if he is seeking to provide justices with the opportunity to review every transferee and transferor i am prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i do not ask him for a commitment <e> <s> but between today and the next stage of the bill perhaps he can seek the views of those who i have mentioned and who have a very real <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the case that has been made by the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> both at the beginning and at the end of his speech he quite rightly said that this is very largely a technical matter <e> <s> i listened with great respect to the minister when he argued on technical grounds about this amendment <e> <s> as i understand what the noble lord has said this is an attempt to make it easier for alcohol-free or reduced alcohol content drinks to be not only produced but produced more easily <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall the house being told in that awarding the awacs contract to boeing would result in the creation of new british jobs although in fact it resulted in the cancellation of nimrod with the loss of jobs <e> <s> will the minister comment upon that matter <e> <s> now that it has been revealed that billion of the annual billion equipment budget was unforeseen expenditure does he not agree that that is a scandal and a disgrace for a government that pride themselves on being efficient and cost-effective and even boast about it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real pleasure to speak in this debate the opportunity for which has been very kindly presented through the initiatives of my noble friend lord dean of beswick <e> <s> i congratulate him not only on his choice of topic but also on the breadth of the manner in which he introduced a very serious subject <e> <s> all the speeches which i have heard since that of my noble friend have added not i hope to the problems of the minister but to the worth of the debate for the minister and his colleagues when they consider what can best be done next <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister has had time to reflect <e> <s> if he accepts as i do the motivation of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lucas but cannot accept it for technical constitutional or legislative reasons that will be sad <e> <s> i have listened to all the arguments put forward on this matter <e> <s> i have had the benefit of reading the excellent report of the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> the amendment seeks to take account of the current social situation and to ensure that a wider and more acceptable range of drinks is available which would be less alcoholic than if the amendment were refused <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may correct an impression which he or i may have given but which i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with a great deal of pleasure to follow what has been said by the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> although there is pressure on my time as well as that of other members it is not so great that i can ignore the excellent maiden speech made by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> it was a model of its kind <e> <s> he said a great deal with which i agree <e> <s> i hope that the house will hear him again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not been listening <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister correct in saying that those massive sums of money from the capital receipts to which he has just referred could be spent <e> <s> is he saying that that figure equates to per cent <e> <s> of the total of their capital receipts that they are entitled to spend <e> <s> how often does the minister and his colleagues try to relate to the boroughs which have the problem of homelessness and to encourage them to build new housing <e> <s> surely the answer for homeless people is not to urge them to buy their own house but to ensure that there is an adequate stock of rented accommodation at prices they can afford <e>", "<cs> i seek the guidance of the minister <e> <s> i apologise for intervening but this is a matter of procedure <e> <s> reference constantly has been made to this amendment <e> <s> as i understand the position the proposed grouping covers amendments nos <e> <s> to and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is it the procedure that all those whose names are linked with those amendments as my name is to amendment no <e> <s> need to speak to their respective amendments during the general debate <e> <s> in

argument will be disparate from the arguments on amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> there is a difficulty here <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is a genuine attempt to assist the minister and her colleagues in defusing a proposal which it has been put to me causes grave unease not least in the teaching profession but also among many others <e>", "<cs> is it not incumbent upon the chair <e>", "<cs> is it not in order that when there is as a result of accepting amendment no <e> <s> the consequences now advised the committee should be informed of those consequences before the amendment is moved <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house in general terms how the government view the interests of individuals like mr tikkoo with reference to the affairs of northern ireland <e> <s> is the idea of relief for the taxpayer tempered in the minds of the government with a proper sense of the national interest and concern for the protection of jobs in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the ministers case is that the bill already provides for the <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me considerable pleasure to follow the noble lord lord jenkin for whom i have a great respect in view of the positions that he has held and the service that he has rendered to local government <e> <s> i should like to begin as no doubt will most of your lordships by emphasising how this debate has been illuminated by three excellent maiden speakers <e> <s> i enjoyed all three speeches but in particular the one by the noble earl lord carnarvon who illustrated his remarks from his experience of local government <e> <s> those who have had experience in local government will have the edge on those who simply talk about it <e> <s> while the latter may very well understand it there is a difference between being a practitioner in local government and being an advocate for a point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> in our constitution we have a democracy which every four years provides local people with an opportunity to turn councils out <e> <s> if one examines the latest illustration which was only last thursday in cambridge where lives the noble baroness lady blatch who constantly gives us information from cambridge one discovers that there where the poll tax was a big issue before the elections labour was not in overall control but <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate not only the speed with which the noble lord has brought this matter before the house but also the care that he has taken in putting before us the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is not possible but could the minister give some indication of the attitude of the building societies to people in that position <e> <s> approval to do something is one thing <e> <s> the minister will well recognise the argument that even though the house may be put in good order to the satisfaction either of inspectors or of the person when the house needs to be sold the prospective purchaser of a once defective house has to get approval for a loan from the building society <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister made a general statement <e> <s> i was anxious to know whether the building societies in the context of being willing to advance money on mortgage on a previously defective house were being fair reasonable and understanding <e> <s> the minister may well be unable to give us the building societies associations attitude on that point in which case perhaps he could write to me later <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the matter at this stage but i believe that the minister does not understand the real world <e> <s> he started by saying that the government have a concept that the opted out schools want to get away from a dependence on the local education authority and that they should stand on their own two feet and be captain of their fate <e> <s> in doing that they could very well act to the detriment of the community and other schools <e> <s> the minister is right that in nine cases out of or cases out of there will be understanding and agreement <e>", "<cs> freedom for one lot of parents <e>", "<cs> my lords when fixing the rate support grant how high in the list of priorities do the government see the importance of local authorities ensuring that they have sufficient inspectors in order to comply with such standards <e> <s> can the minister tell the house this <e> <s> at the present time when local authorities which are under severe housing stress are forced to send their constituents to bed-and-breakfast accommodation what guidance is given to the authorities to ensure that the properties to which they send their constituents are adequate and safe in respect of fire hazards <e>", "<cs> it was agreed that amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name on the marshalled list would be taken with this group of amendments <e> <s> what the noble baroness has said will be much appreciated <e> <s> it covers substantially the matter covered by my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain to the house how in we imported tonnes of toxic waste and yet in to this has risen to tonnes <e> <s> can the minister explain why some countries find it preferable and cheaper to export their waste to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when his ministerial colleague mr david trippier met members of the federation of master builders earlier this year he warmly applauded their idea that apprentices should be apprenticed to the industry and not to individual companies <e> <s> will the minister comment on that <e> <s> further will the minister acknowledge that many of the skilled employees in the construction industry are now self-employed <e> <s> what is the minister doing to encourage larger companies to assist in the training of more skilled workpeople <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am grateful to the minister for his reply does he acknowledge that when the board described conditions inside wandsworth prison as insanitary humiliating disgusting degrading and inhuman it was in fact a condemnation of government policy especially as it was the second year that they had spoken in such terms <e> <s> given that neither the visitors nor prison officers nor the government want a perpetuation of those conditions why do the government persist in trying to force more prisoners inside prisons like wandsworth thereby making conditions even worse <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that many people appreciate the practice started last year of publishing the reports of boards of visitors <e> <s> it enables a great many more people than hitherto to know about conditions inside prisons <e> <s> bearing in mind that the wandsworth hoard of visitors reported in similar terms last year and has seen very little happening does he accept that that not only breeds cynicism but adds to the conditions in which industrial unrest occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that members of the federation of master builders are reporting that they are often given a supply time for common fletton bricks of four months and that the alternative of importing bricks from denmark and germany is both ludicrous and expensive <e> <s> bearing in mind that the oxford clay used for the making of common flettons is in a virtual monopoly situation with the london brick company what steps do the government propose to take to ensure that british bricklayers are able to lay british-made bricks <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is of course quite right when he says that there are other types of brick besides fletton <e> <s> does he not accept that the overwhelming experience of bricklayers in this country is not only that they have relied upon them but that many of the houses that have been built which from time to time need renovation and repair rely upon a supply of common fletton bricks <e> <s> further bearing in mind the fact that the virtual monopoly supplier is also undertaking studies to acquire a source of concrete for making bricks what steps are the government taking to monitor the predatory activities of those who are involved in such activity in the brick-making business <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not appreciate that there are trends that need to be watched <e> <s> if he is telling us that only per cent <e> <s> of common bricks are imported is he not monitoring the situation <e> <s> further can he assure the house that should the situation worsen he will consider taking some action <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house about consultations that have taken place between the government and interested parties on how the problem of sunday trading can be resolved <e> <s> will he reflect on his inability to give advice to local authorities which find that the law is being broken by so-called law-abiding citizens and companies <e>", "<cs> the minister is right <e> <s> anything which on careful analysis and reflection has caused him and his fellow ministers to exempt such groups is welcome <e> <s> those members who follow the proceedings in another place will recognise that this kind of matter is raised and it corrects an anomaly <e> <s> will the minister justify and explain the terms of the amendment <e> <s> will he also spell out exactly who is likely to benefit <e> <s> for instance the yardstick or measuring rod for the exemption of an individual is that he is a member of a relevant religious community <e> <s> if i mention some religious communities will the minister say whether they fall within that definition <e> <s> for instance there is the church of scientology which would argue that it is a religious community <e> <s> there are also the moonies hare krishna and the rastafarians <e> <s> i appreciate that the minister may not have been involved directly but will he say how wide were the discussions and who will benefit from the amendment <e>", "<cs> the final words of the minister are very welcome because it is clear that with the very best of intentions he and his colleagues and those whom he has consulted genuinely thought that they had anticipated possible escape holes and routes <e> <s> despite that from all sides of the committee genuinely from a non-partisan point of view and on a basis of curiosity a number of points have emerged <e> <s> it would have been a great pity if the minister had stood by those words as being the definitive ones <e>", "<cs> i moved the amendment and we had it in mind as a gross figure <e> <s> we had experience of the <e> <s> in enfield where i live amounts in excess of a week are being charged which are not borne wholly by the social security department <e> <s> those are the charges being made <e> <s> the figure of is appropriate <e> <s> i should be interested if the minister could explain precisely the relativity of an individual who is exempt from paying the community charge and yet according to the noble lord lord jenkin will be paying the community charge that is a portion of the global sum paid on the business <e> <s> i should like the minister to deal with that point <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say that this is a probing amendment <e> <s> this is an illustration <e> <s> the alternative formula which has been proposed would certainly be acceptable to us <e>", "<cs> the minister is inviting us to look at a situation where we have an establishment a nursing home inside of which there is a patient <e> <s> the patient is a rich man but he pays no poll tax <e> <s> he is being administered to by the workers in the nursing home who are poor people but they must pay the poll tax <e> <s> if the minister believes that that situation is equitable and constitutes accountability it is certainly not acceptable to those of us on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i second the remarks made by my noble friend and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i have as much hope as the noble <e>", "<cs> i genuinely think that the minister has not grasped the point <e> <s> if the take-home pay of a worker in the home at the moment is say a week in future when the community charge has been dealt with and the rebates have been taken into account he will take home perhaps or a week <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the minister could help me <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the range of facilities to which battered wives will have access or recourse <e> <s> i did not detect in any of them anything which takes account of their special circumstances <e> <s> the minister told us that consultations had taken place <e> <s> i am grateful for the fact not only that he told us but also that they took place and that they were meaningful <e> <s> did i detect that the net product of those discussions and of the governments sympathy was the decision by the government to provide anonymity in the event of their registering for the community charge <e> <s> was the minister invited to provide more practical assistance than just sympathy <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness lady lockwood will be able to tell us <e>", "<cs> i rise to give a general welcome to the thrust of the amendments <e> <s> there have been many occasions when we on this side of the committee have moved many amendments that have sought to ameliorate the kind of situation to which the noble viscount has referred that is the net burden upon a family <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me <e> <s> to get rid of a tax dodge which is what the attitude was is unfair <e> <s> if he says that circumstances and conditions in fit exactly the circumstances and the inequity of the bill in then no matter what else i have to learn it is clear that the noble lord has a great deal to learn <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one point to the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> the thrust of the amendment is to try to keep the family together <e> <s> the argument is that the legislation in the way that it will be applied runs the risk of encouraging a drift away from the home <e> <s> i bow to the knowledge of the noble lord <e> <s> however my recollection is that the legislation of was a million miles removed from breaking up families <e>", "<cs> my lords that is being a bit strong <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with considerable pleasure that i immediately follow the speech given by the noble lord lord cullen who was very reasonable and very controlled <e> <s> yet i detected that there was a great deal of if not anger considerable unease about the impact of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously speaking about what has been said up to now and the situation is that the minister does not have a friend <e> <s> however i have flushed one out before the noble lord has risen to his feet <e> <s> to that extent the house can anticipate some support for the issue <e> <s> no doubt the minister will tell us of the imperatives which have driven him and his colleagues to this particular aspect of good housekeeping or reorientation of priorities <e>", "<cs> there is more to come <e>", "<cs> may i try to help the committee <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord meston that the amendments are related and refer to the uses to which the register can be put for commercial purposes or otherwise <e> <s> i certainly intend to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> e f and which i find on the same line <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will allow me to ask whether it is his intention or that of his right honourable friend to indicate their views while the bill is still being considered by this chamber or whether we shall hear them when the bill has passed from this house <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord lord meston will return to this point <e> <s> in the light of the ministers considerations he may come back and say that the list shall not be sold and in effect that will remove our concern in one fell swoop <e> <s> however if he returns to say that the list and extract shall be sold in accordance with the powers in the schedule but that there are certain caveats we shall need to look at those conditions while we have the opportunity to do so at report stage or third reading <e>", "<cs> the minister has made a fair statement <e> <s> those outside the committee who have sought our assistance in obtaining assurances are entitled not only to take what the minister said at its face value but to read into it as i do that if an authority acts in the way that we fear without authorisation or there are suspicions that it is doing so the minister and his colleagues will consider what steps are open to them <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the ministers answer is in the negative <e> <s> however we are looking for further opportunities for the chamber to exercise its function <e> <s> the minister is absolutely right that the schedule is tightly drawn on precisely what it seeks to do <e> <s> however one must consider exactly what it will do <e> <s> we are debating regulations that make provision for the collection of amounts that persons are liable to pay for community charges <e> <s> although that is precise it is enormous in its impact <e> <s> we are referring to the collection of amounts that individuals will have to pay in contribution to amounts which other persons are liable to pay in respect of collective community charges <e> <s> those regulations will have an enormous impact on many people <e>", "<cs> the minister would certainly find a friend in me in commending local authorities and their sense of fair play justice and equity <e> <s> i shall say nothing which opposes that view <e> <s> however the noble lord is saying he believes that every local authority in whose area there are individuals of the type i have described will by virtue of the regulations which enable them to do so make such arrangements <e> <s> the noble lord is well aware that by virtue of measures undertaken by the government each council despite the fact that there will be claims upon its time and its hierarchy of responsibilities will be driven every day of its life to consider just how it can avoid the expense and how it can legitimately pass on some of its responsibilities to others <e>", "<cs> the noble lord certainly has a point i have not sought to define poverty <e> <s> he may very well argue that different magistrates courts will according to the varying levels of circumstances interpret poverty as meaning one thing in one area and another elsewhere <e> <s> therefore the minister may very well tell us that the words in the schedule provide for that taking place and that my amendment is not necessary <e> <s> all i am asking the minister to do is to assure us that when his honourable friend said that the debt that is the nonpayment the refusal to pay or the plea that someone is unable to pay because they are in poverty is such that it would be possible to plead in that manner that could be acted upon by a court remitting the charge on the grounds of poverty <e> <s> perhaps the minister could assure us that the intention of his honourable friend is given effect in the bill either in paragraph c or in some other way <e> <s> if that is done i shall be perfectly satisfied <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister and i confess i have confused the committee by referring to paragraph c <e> <s> the minister was kind enough not to draw that to the attention of the committee as i am now doing <e> <s> when i read again paragraph c and the provision allowing remission of payment where no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed the minister has confirmed that that covers the circumstances both of what his honourable friend said in another place and the intent of this <e>", "<cs> we have had a useful and constructive debate <e> <s> i would not want to detract from anything the minister said about what the government have done for small businesses <e> <s> they have created more small businesses than many other governments <e> <s> the simple fact is that when the government came to power those small businesses were large businesses <e>", "<cs> we understood them <e>", "<cs> i rise simply to say that what the minister has proposed goes some way towards ameliorating the impact of the nexus of the <e>", "<cs> although he probably has a brief which says resist i very much hope that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but if he rests his case on the basis that the purpose of residual rating is to reduce the final community charge bill to the charge payer that does not square with the facts <e> <s> i am told for instance that in camden with no residual rating there will be an increase of <e> <s> with residual rating it will be because once the safety nets have gone

figures <e> <s> my figures come from the local authorities the lba the city of london and the ala who will have to make the system work <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may say that i am staggered at what he has said on the problems that we have put to him <e> <s> he sums it up in the phrase i have no doubt that they will manage <e> <s> this is typical of what the minister and his colleagues have said throughout this bill <e> <s> they have recognised the burdens <e> <s> they have recognised the changes <e> <s> they have recognised the punishment <e> <s> but they have then said to local government we have no doubt that you will manage <e>", "<cs> this on the face of it looks like a technical amendment <e> <s> will the minister tell us what consultations have taken place with the local authority associations and perhaps in addition with the library association <e> <s> as the minister will be aware the library movement feels that it has been badly treated from time to time by the impact of certain aspects of the governments legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for those remarks which were very helpful <e> <s> i listened carefully to what i call the excluding criteria <e> <s> i can see that all of them could apply almost anywhere except the final factor that the minister mentioned which was language <e> <s> i believe that the minister said that one of the qualifying bases upon which this provision would apply in wales was the language factor <e>", "<cs> the amendment speaks of leaving out <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the minister has said and i am grateful <e> <s> however it puzzles me that clearly nothing has happened in the course of the passage of this bill which has caused his advisers to come to that conclusion <e> <s> in other words the first premises on which the bill was drafted were clearly incorrect since nothing has happened since <e> <s> either second thoughts wiser counsel or retrospection has prevailed <e> <s> i only wish that that would happen more often <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister not only for his brief but also because it is clear that he has listened carefully to the arguments deployed by the noble baroness lady stedman and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first to congratulate my noble friend lady ewart-biggs upon her very clear exposition of the bill <e> <s> there was one omission from her introduction <e> <s> she gave a very long list of people who support the bill but did not mention my name and i must put on record that i give the bill a very warm welcome <e> <s> i should also like to extend the warmest congratulations to my very good personal friend in another place mr chris smith who has worked hard and persistently on this bill <e> <s> at one time as i read the details of the debates in another place it seemed a distinct possibility that he might well be ambushed in respect of other legislation <e> <s> given the timescale imperatives for bills of this kind to return to the other place with the minimum of delay and the minimum of change i hope that he is successful in that respect <e> <s> certainly i have not the remotest intention of delaying the bills departure from this house nor of burdening it with any impediment which may be seized upon by members in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will give way i should like to clarify one point <e> <s> the minister said that to enter comments on the register could be defamatory <e> <s> he implied that the comments that could be entered on the register by the trader could be held to be defamatory <e> <s> i am talking about the trader believing that the comments entered on the register by the authority could be held to be defamatory <e>", "<cs> my lords only in relation to the trade secrets aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords if local authorities are invited to get ready for emergencies of the kind that the noble lord lord renton pointed out could easily happen and at the same time are under severe pressure in deciding the priorities on which to spend their money surely some positive encouragement by the government in doing what the noble lord has asked will go a long way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i stand corrected and suitably chastened <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the house whether it will take note of the fact that some of those young people have been able to obtain liquor in a manner which while it may not have been illegal was certainly reprehensible <e> <s> i am told that one company hires space at an easily identifiable venue for instance a cricket or football ground or a hotel on a sunday morning and extensively advertises a wine club to which membership is free <e> <s>

giving the temporary telephone number and venue of the vendors visiting representative <e> <s> inquiries lead to delivery and supply <e> <s> sale or return is an established trade technique and is now beginning to appear in conjunction with each of the examples i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister has made a majestic speech covering one of the major aspects with which the bill deals <e> <s> i refer to the wine warehouse which now has a legality <e> <s> the other people who are selling in wholesale quantities from the kind of places that we have talked about will be caught by the law <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed to the minister for filling in a number of gaps which i might fairly have spelled out <e>", "<cs> did the noble lord say that the government gave a firm commitment before the election that the community charge would be in place by <e> <s> i should very much like to have the reference for that because the government did not make up their minds on the poll tax as the alternative to domestic rates until after the election <e>", "<cs> my heart bleeds for the problems which the government have created by dealing separately with scotland <e> <s> the minister has pointed out that he intensely dislikes the inequity between the treatment of scotland and england and yet it was the government themselves who decided to treat scotland separately and earlier than england <e> <s> they cannot have it both ways <e> <s> the amendments seek to respond to the words that we have received from the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the minister <e> <s> if the registrar generals figures appear to be punitive but there is a means whereby they can be adjusted i would agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment is moved so

consultation paper on how to make progress on this matter has not been received <e> <s> it is no good the minister being bland about it and simply ignoring what repercussions this could have <e> <s> it is possible for this to have a serious effect and i invite the minster to help me <e>", "<cs> the minister makes an interesting point about what should happen and says that no decisions have yet been taken <e> <s> i accept what he says about the absence of a decision <e> <s> i accept too that it would be normal to assume that those data are the best but it aint necessarily so <e> <s> the minister may look at some other measuring rod and there may be valid reasons why these are not the best data <e> <s> however what the minister has said on the record <e>", "<cs> in his very last words the minister gave an assurance <e> <s> local authorities will have an indication of the likely timetable that will be worked through <e> <s> that is all they want <e> <s> they are not interfering with the manner in which the government and their advisers seek to give effect to the bill <e> <s> what <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from me that prison officers acknowledge that the prison department is alert to the dangers inherent in the aids problem and that working together is the best solution <e> <s> does the minister also understand that there is a great difference between the outside world and the closed cloistered community of a prison which houses many dangerous men and women <e> <s> will he not think again about looking at the possibility of compulsory blood tests and also isolation units <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to infrastructure costs being <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that certain developers enhance their applications within planning guidelines by offering to provide community civic or other such amenities <e> <s> i am simply asking the minister what guidance he gives to authorities as regards the kind of control that they need to apply <e> <s> otherwise some developers may be seen to be doing more than getting their planning applications through strictly on merit <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask for clarification <e> <s> i wondered at the use of the words <e>", "<cs> in effect then it covers the employees of the ministry <e> <s> people who are not as it were employees of the ministry but are employed by the ministry will not be covered by this part of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister and his colleagues will not be panicked by any well-heeled pressure group into taking precipitate action and will subscribe to the view that it is better to get it right than to get it soon <e> <s> can the minister provide the house with an update on the views given to it by his noble friend speaking for the home office who said only a month ago that consultations were taking place among interested parties in order to achieve the best possible consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister sounds very reasonable and i say that genuinely <e> <s> from my limited knowledge of the topic it appears that there are opportunities for authorities which are faced with the kind of problems that i have outlined to raise them in what the minister says may be rare circumstances that is where the existing arrangements detailed in the consultative document are inadequate to cover the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the battersea project is an imaginative enterprise that should command support from all quarters <e> <s> bearing in mind that it is the intention to attract million visitors and to provide work for people does the minister not agree that some special treatment is required <e> <s> would the minister care to tell the house bearing in mind the damage to the environment that already affects residents and the volume of traffic in london what special criteria he has in mind to guide wandsworth in dealing with this exceptional problem <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that wandsworth is not an island and that it is affected by wider considerations not least those which have been mentioned by the noble lord on the opposition front bench <e> <s> does the minister recognise that this question is benign and not malignant <e> <s> we are genuinely seeking from the minister a recognition that this is an exceptional development which calls for exceptional powers <e> <s> what can wandsworth expect from the minister in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that wherever else responsibility lies in this matter there is a prime responsibility upon the government to react to the disgraceful scenes in germany which we have witnessed over the past two weeks <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind that what we have seen on television and elsewhere of events overseas is very familiar to those of us who follow the situation in this country <e> <s> does the minister agree that when considering the various measures that might be taken to curb this distressing situation it should be recognised that excessive alcohol consumption by the young plays a very important part in the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister and his colleagues when considering how to deal with this problem look very carefully at the situation in which right-wing extremist groups have been seen to have deliberately provoked violence for political purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the night is yet young <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that it is his departments own figures that indicate that the greatest number of properties left empty are those that are owned and managed by the government the themselves <e> <s> what do the government intend to do about that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us when she expects to be able to make the announcements

the <e>", "<cs> the government <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no one like the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister is in a receptive frame of mind <e> <s> i begin as the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale began by acknowledging that the government amendment is sensible and is an improvement <e> <s> we hear that those who will be deeply involved in the implementation of the nexus within the bill are saying to the government that it can be improved on the margin <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale said in simple terms that there is an argument between certification and assessment in establishing the bona fides of those who can legitimately be exempt from the charge <e> <s> it is miserable for the individual and for his family and friends to be involved at all in having to plead a case in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i failed to say in my opening remarks that of course we acknowledge that the government took on board the anxieties that were expressed in another place and here that one needed to take account of making provisions for religious orders <e> <s> the nexus of the nuns and the monks was taken into account <e>

establish the existence of a relevant religious community <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given the same reply <e> <s> i take heart from the words of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i shall think very carefully about what he has said and no doubt shall be in touch with him about a better amendment <e> <s> however i am disappointed because the minister is arguing not just on the basis of the practicalities but on the principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little disappointed <e> <s> however to be fair to the minister he and his colleagues have taken seriously the points that were put to them <e> <s> he was also fair enough to point out that correspondence has been exchanged with the noble viscount lord brentford who i am pleased to see in his place <e> <s> he may very well wish to say a few words <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the grouping i take this opportunity to speak to those amendments in my name amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the minister who follows these things closely will be well aware that on second reading i raised the concern of the credit granting <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl lord caithness sits down perhaps i may say that i appreciate very much the care and attention that the minister and the government have given to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the aggravations in london courts is the great delay in presenting prisoners at the commencement of the day <e> <s> when he considers how to improve efficiency and the quality of running courts in london will he seek to ensure that prison officers the police magistrates and others work more closely together to ensure that the courts start their day efficiently <e>", "<cs> and he knows it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the normal course of events i would not have risen to speak because as the minister has said these amendments are of a technical nature <e> <s> it is always a great puzzle to know how announcements such as the one made today about the abolition of residual rating will appear <e> <s> as i understand it there will be a need at a later point in the report stage for amendments and we will wait until then to say what we have to say <e> <s> however the minister has quite properly drawn our attention to amendments grouped with amendment no <e> <s> which relate to schedule and which become unnecessary because the schedule is to be deleted <e>", "<cs> my lords i would love to think that the minister really means it when he says that he wants to leave discretion to local authorities in this matter but not in so many others <e> <s> as i said at committee stage we are deeply concerned at the burden that will fall on many people who by virtue of the change in the allowance regime and of a great many other factors will have to budget very carefully <e> <s> the minister is right in saying that we are laying down a sum which small instalments shall not exceed <e> <s> however we are not in the mood to press this amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise but i did not hear the noble lords last sentence which seemed to me to be significant <e> <s> may i ask him to repeat his last words <e>", "<cs> that my lords is what i thought the minister said <e> <s> it seems to me to be rather punitive <e> <s> i can understand the nexus of an agreement the basis of which is a commitment to pay a due sum in an agreed form which is by instalments and certainly those instalments need to be paid <e> <s> but can the minister tell us what are the procedures for pleading the case of someone who finds himself in real difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the situation does not sound any better <e> <s> in rates offices which will be charge offices there will be people who will be well known <e> <s> it is not an uncommon practice for people to delay paying bills including gas bills and so on until they get a final demand <e> <s> can the <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that i am not trying to put a case that the government are either uncaring or unbusinesslike in their procedures <e> <s> what the minister said as regards time is not unreasonable <e> <s> however i believe that there will he many more people who will be obliged to meet a charge and a number of them may hitherto have left such matters to their mams or dads <e> <s> they will now have to make payments and there will be a lot of people who will have to become used to dealing with the council in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that the noble lord lord glenarthur had taken as much trouble in his reply in a previous debate as the minister now <e> <s> the content of his reply covered two column inches of <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to acknowledge with appreciation the care to detail that the minister has shown in this opportunity and those of us who have an interest in the affairs of northern ireland do not get many such opportunities to debate the order somewhat dispassionately away from some of the awful happenings with which we are all too familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the growth in debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords he knows it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support the sense of the amendments <e> <s> they have been reasonably moved <e> <s> as we move towards implementation of the bill the minister should bear in mind that the assessment and perception by the public of how fair the government have been even to the extent of falling over backwards will have a great deal to do with how well the bill works <e> <s> if the amendments are not accepted the operation of clause will be seen to be harsh if not punitive by many people <e> <s> the noble earl lord lytton and the noble lord lord ross have provided the minister with an opportunity to accept the amendments in principle as he has done three or four times at report stage and to come back at the final stage of the bill with other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord make it quite clear that the repayment of interest upon delay applies to individuals as well as to businesses <e> <s> is he saying that the impact of this amendment is to place the individual charge payer in the same position as the business charge payer <e> <s> if so we shall be satisfied <e> <s> we should like the minister to give some indication as to whether that is so because that is the impression that he gave <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble lord know that <e> <s> is he saying that the government decided that the local authorities were not prepared to meet the demand <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has successfully wriggled a little way out of that difficulty <e> <s> of course i understand that the nndr will be paid by individuals <e> <s> however i think that the noble lord could have been much more helpful and sympathetic than

sifted through the formula contained in the amendment i am pleading by comparison for special treatment for small businesses <e> <s> i am not asking that they be given advantages so that others will be disadvantaged although i recognise that by virtue of the nexus of the community charge if somebody is eased in one way or another then somebody else will be disadvantaged <e> <s> to that extent the government are on a good thing because few people will voluntarily accept being disadvantaged although in equity somebody else will be advantaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed at the ministers reply <e> <s> he said more than once that relatively few small businesses would be detrimentally affected by the implementation of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has told the house fairly that he cannot be precise until the autumn <e> <s> however certain figures are being given <e> <s> the government have hinted at a uniform business rate poundage of p <e> <s> other organisations have brought forward similar figures in an endeavour to estimate <e> <s> based on a poundage of p this is what has been said <e> <s> if the poundage is less the prognostications will have been alarmist <e> <s> however organisations like cipfa and others estimate that the uniform business rate poundage may be p or p <e> <s> i do not put this forward as global <e> <s> i say that when the minister attempts to tell the house and small businesses that a few people only will be affected in a small way they will laugh all the way to their shops as long as they are open <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is taking advantage of report in which she ought not to have had the licence to do what she has done <e> <s> all that she has done is to point to the dilemma of small businesses <e> <s> they are fearful of the impact of the bill <e> <s> when they read what the minister has said i am satisfied that they will be no less fearful <e> <s> as i understand the procedure if the amendment is carried i shall be unable to move subsequent amendments <e> <s> i am disappointed at the ministers reply <e> <s> i believe that he and his friends will hear from many small businesses in the country in the months ahead <e>", "<cs> rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister seeks to make a party point i ask him to consider the experience in scotland <e> <s> i have before me indications bearing out to good effect the prognostications for england based upon the scottish position <e> <s> there were businesses in the sample <e> <s> in edinburgh there are increases

said and the book is what has happened in scotland <e> <s> it is very bad <e>", "<cs> my lords we can see some merit in what the government are seeking to do but will the minister explain why the government persist throughout the bill to build in further complications and refinements of this kind <e> <s> more scope for complications will be involved in this matter <e> <s> the amendment is not as straightforward as the minister tried to make it appear <e> <s> we should like to know the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister answered part of the question <e> <s> what has caused the refinement to be thought necessary at this stage in the progress of the bill <e> <s> the minister is entitled to say that all the pieces of the bill are coming together and will fit and work better and i would accept that <e> <s> however i am intrigued to know why at this late stage the government are adding this further refinement to a requirement which will be difficult for local authorities to handle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has told us that consultations will take place with the local authority associations that the basis upon which the calculations will be made will be explained to them and that they will understand the procedure <e> <s> will the minister tell the house now upon which basis the calculations will take place <e> <s> the minister is telling us that that is part of an ongoing consultation and refinement and that once the regulations have been arrived at parliament will be told in one way or the other what has been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords illusions are shattered every night here <e> <s> the minister and i play our part to keep that process going <e> <s> we are talking about equity but we are also talking about fairness

minister for an assurance that the consultations which will take place will be real and earnest and not a charade <e> <s> sadly it is sometimes the case that on other occasions with other ministers consultations have been a sham <e> <s> i should like the minister to give us a little more help on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords where will the figure come from <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that taxable capacity relates to population <e> <s> is it the number of heads or portions of heads upon which the tax shall be levied <e> <s> therefore we are down to being satisfied that the population figure is an acceptable basis <e> <s> the minister may recall that earlier we were arguing about the up-date validity of the census of population figures and when that comes into effect <e>

grown quite dramatically <e> <s> we understand that syndrome <e> <s> is the minister telling us that as near as possible there will be an attempt to seek satisfaction from the people who represent those populations and that the basis of the figure is fair even though it is bound to fluctuate from the time that the minister sets the figure based upon whatever decisions have been taken and whoever is included or excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i say sincerely to the minister that those who outside the <e>", "<cs> my lords i take a minute or two of the time of the house to say as my noble friend lord mcintosh said on a previous <e>", "<cs> my lords they are being enforced also <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in the debate on northern ireland matters last friday my noble friend lord fitt said <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting always that the taxpayer not only has a right to be considered but there is also an obligation for him to be considered in the special circumstances of northern ireland belfast and what we call the troubles will the minister pay very close attention to the consequences for the general situation in northern ireland if he accepts the case that economically harland and wolff could be privatised <e>", "<cs> this one would not my lords <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister who i know is a compassionate man must have been deeply unhappy to hear most of what his noble friend lady faithfull said about the realities of housing not only in london but in general <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a failure <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is telling the house what he intends to do but the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the memory of the minister go back before the cold war to the real war <e> <s> many of us remember the russians as our allies and our friends <e> <s> cannot the minister and his colleagues see the value of this gesture <e> <s> does not the minister recognise that when ultimately the governments objective of a world without arms or enemies is achieved one will look back on this gesture as having played a real part <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that concern has been expressed about the problem in the south-east <e> <s> that problem is not the shortage of runway space but rather the availability of safe air space capacity <e> <s> has not the chairman of the caa expressed concern along those lines <e> <s> would it not be advisable to have early consultations in which the caa the airports authority eurocontrol and scheduled and charter flight airlines are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with my normal pleasure and satisfaction that i speak at the end of a defence debate not least because the noble lord lord trefgarne got us off to a very good start with a lucid explanation making the best of a bad job in putting to us what my noble friend lord irving of dartford said was a very bland statement and it is right and proper that the bland should be leading the bland <e> <s> but that is not the right posture for a minister of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting from <e>", "<cs> my lords it is more important that the minister and his colleagues should get it right than that i should get it right <e> <s> i accept what the minister said and stand corrected <e> <s> the question i wish to ask is to what extent the minister and his colleagues monitor statements not the promises which they accept because as the noble lord lord trefgarne realises this one was the subject of correspondence which appeared in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> i do not dispute for a moment what has been said <e> <s> if those matters are wholly financial and the consequences of the contractual arrangements which the minister makes result in human terms in desolation and distress that may give some people the idea that they have been deceived <e> <s> surely the minister has some responsibility to avoid that impression being given <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is perfectly correct <e> <s> these amendments are innocuous in the sense that they are simply giving effect to that which we already well understand <e> <s> in view of the enormous impact of what will be done to individual london boroughs can the minister give any guidance about the kind of consultation that will take place either formally or informally <e> <s> i am not arguing about the powers <e> <s> i believe that the boroughs that are to feel the impact of these measures are entitled to some consultation <e> <s> i am not raising the issue of time or amounts <e> <s> it would demonstrate a good spirit on the part of the minister and his colleagues if the opportunity was there for the councils to have an input into these discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords in other words the minister is saying that he has every confidence that consultation will take place <e> <s> can the minister be more specific as regards this amendment namely the codification of a new levying body and authority <e> <s> does the minister hope that consultation will take place on this subject <e> <s> i realise that the minister cannot dictate to the london residuary body but that organisation is comprised of wise men and women and they will read what is said in this house <e> <s> with ordinary sense and fairness can he say whether he hopes that this particular issue will be the subject of some form of consultation <e> <s> if that is so i shall rest assured <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not gone anywhere yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson is to he congratulated on bringing forward another formula to deal with the principle that there are those in the community who are better able than others to pay across the board <e> <s> with regard to the community charge in our view it is a simple device to adopt this or some other formula <e> <s> we ask the minister whether he is prepared to consider equity in the application of the community charge to among others those residents in the kind of establishment covered by the amendment <e> <s> we believe that this is reasonable we hope that the minister can be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for taking two bites of this particular cherry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that his bland and sanguine replies of today and yesterday will do nothing to lift the hearts of those who feel that the british film industry is in crisis and desperate <e> <s> although the minister is advised of successes which are not denied there is a very real feeling that the british film industry is slipping away from the british people <e> <s> in those circumstances will the minister accept that this is the right time for the government to demonstrate their interest and concern for the future of the british film industry by calling a conference or a meeting with the leaders of the industry to make sure that anything more that can be done will he done before it is too late <e>", "<cs> my lords if consultation took place with the tenants can the minister tell us what has been done for those tenants who objected very strongly to being moved <e>", "<cs> that is what will happen <e>", "<cs> you bought them on spec <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that although he indicated that there had been a decline in the number of public sector houses built between and at the end of that period even the lowest figure for houses built under labour was higher than that for any year under this government <e> <s> will the minister take this opportunity to confirm that local authority house building still has a prime part to play in providing rented accommodation <e>

"<cs> my lords we give our warm and unqualified support from these benches to the minister and his colleagues in bringing forward this order <e> <s> i am delighted that in doing so the minister paid tribute to the work of the honourable member for exeter mr john hannam who is well known to me and who has my highest respect in this and many other matters <e> <s> it was right that the minister should draw the attention of the house to the part played by the noble lord lord cullen <e> <s> as we know the noble lord had a major parliamentary victory yesterday in this house on another matter

noble lord and his advisers will be satisfied as to the quality and calibre of such a course <e> <s> however if he then goes on to say that two people are there now and that there is space for others

that the labour <e>", "<cs> my lords what special steps are the government taking to improve the efficiency of the tourist industry in this country <e> <s> is the minister aware that the service industries undoubtedly play a vital part in entertaining overseas visitors <e> <s> is he further aware that in many of the service industries not least the catering industry wages and conditions are

may well be right <e> <s> i know that he is not dogmatic and that his remarks are based on the empirical experience of himself and others <e> <s> he argued that the provision would be to the disadvantage to the landlord <e> <s> i am not primarily concerned with the landlords interests <e> <s> i am primarily concerned with the tenants interests <e> <s> however i accept that there are circumstances when <e>", "<cs> the ministry of transport <e>", "<cs> to say that i am disappointed in what the minister has said is the understatement of the evening <e> <s> without wishing to give offence perhaps i may say that i genuinely believe that the minister and most of his colleagues on the other side of the chamber do not grasp <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to wait <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am disappointed not only with the ministers reply but with the attitude of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> we are talking of people who if they had any other option than to be a tenant in the kind of establishment about which we are talking with a resident landlord or any other option than to be in a hostel for a special purpose would not in general want that to be

the minister has said we may come back to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down does he not appreciate that this amendment is an attempt to achieve some clarity over the period which the bill regards as a holiday <e> <s> is he not aware that there are sham holiday lets <e> <s> they are called holiday lets as a device for the landlord to avoid the responsibilities which he would have if they were otherwise classified <e>", "<cs> the minister is certainly optimistic about making progress <e> <s> those of us who have taken a special interest in this matter cannot help but be amazed at the fortitude of the people who are faced with living in the conditions which this amendment seeks to put right <e> <s> it is the absence of rights that concern us <e> <s> those tenants are bereft of any belief in their ability to do anything about their circumstances <e> <s> of course at the end of the day all they want is a decent place in which to live and bring up their families <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly do that <e> <s> i note that the minister has made no commitment until we see what the ama survey throws up <e> <s> i know from looking at the correspondence i have received in preparing for the debate that the residents of many indeed most local authorities in the north are very concerned <e> <s> we think that this solution as a security measure would be the answer <e> <s> we do not say that it is the only answer <e> <s> i hope that those outside the committee will think of this as an ongoing matter which has not been closed dropped or killed by the minister <e> <s> however he has given me sufficient hope to enable me to say that i doubt whether i shall be coming back to it during discussions on this bill <e> <s> like the minister i shall await the findings of the survey <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> he rests his case on the possibility of dealing with the issue in a landlord and tenant act <e> <s> however we have not been without such acts over the past

practicalities <e>", "<cs> per association <e>", "<cs> when i was talking about a few thousand pounds the figure was per association <e> <s> i was making the point that the administrative costs and the bureaucracy involved could well be disproportionate <e> <s> of course millions of pounds are involved globally but i was referring to the figure per association <e>", "<cs> answer that one <e>", "<cs> i have just told my noble friend lord mcintosh that that was a fair offer <e> <s> it is certainly the best that i shall get tonight <e> <s> the minister said that he recognised the problems that existed and that steps were being taken to produce a code of practice <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be churlish if we did not wait to see whether the code achieved our objectives <e>", "<cs> the minister has been helpful in acknowledging the problem which we have brought before the committee <e> <s> i believe that he appreciates the way that oppositions work <e> <s> we are told that there is a problem <e> <s> we do not bring it forward before studying and understanding it <e> <s> part of the exercise is to get on the record and into the public domain matters which may have been amicably discussed and negotiated between the advisers of ministers and those outside <e> <s> the ante is higher as it were so that we must be more careful <e>", "<cs> on that basis i am perfectly satisfied <e> <s> we cannot ask for more <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> never <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege and pleasure to make a contribution to this debate and i do so very willingly <e> <s> i concur with the noble lord lord barnett in a great deal of what he had to say <e> <s> his contribution like that of my noble friend lord jay comes from long experience in another place and in government at a high level dealing with the matters which are covered by this debate <e> <s> i want not only to commend what they said but also to say how much i enjoyed their speeches <e> <s> i want also to contrast their view of the realities of the budget and the underlying situation revealed by the budget with the comments of for example the noble lord lord strathclyde <e> <s> he said that there is not a family in this country which has not benefited in some way from the budget <e> <s> to put it politely that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very interested if the noble lord would care to sustain that point with statistical evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not going to quote what gordon brown said i was going to quote what he said that somebody else had said <e> <s> i am out of order once removed <e> <s> let me see if i get away with it <e> <s> perhaps i may tell the house what a firm of accountants said the business enterprises scheme would do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from the residents of southwark which prays that this house will amend part iv of the housing bill so that more than per cent <e> <s> of those eligible to vote have to be in favour of the proposition to choose a new landlord for it to proceed and that the vote be conducted by an independent body and by secret ballot <e> <s> the petition bears signatures <e>", "<cs> disgraceful <e>", "<cs> i say at once that i do not intend to press the amendments in the light of what the minister has said <e> <s> we would have wished to have on the face of the bill words giving if not an absolute guarantee then much greater security and peace of mind to the people affected <e> <s> i am satisfied in two respects with what the noble lord said <e> <s> first at an appropriate stage the local authorities in whose areas hats are situated will be provided with the opportunity for consultation and discussion on whether these kinds of properties should be included or excluded <e> <s> the minister was not able to say that they could be excluded <e> <s> he was saying that they might very well be excluded if after discussion the local authority was of the view that they ought to be excluded for very good social reasons <e> <s> i am satisfied with the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and i intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i was interested to hear him argue for flexibility <e> <s> is that flexibility a two-way street <e> <s> or is that flexibility for the minister of state when he wishes to vary an understanding by saying that he will exercise flexibility and change it <e> <s> if flexibility is part of an understanding does that mean that whatever the secretary of state has agreed the local authority has the right to say that it will exercise its flexibility in a different way <e>", "<cs> if the hat fits the noble lord can wear it <e> <s> i cannot recall either the spirit or the words which the minister has put into my mouth <e> <s> i start from the premise that we want a democratic right for people who live in council accommodation to have a meaningful say as to who their landlord should be <e> <s> we are not saying that everyone should in an anarchistic way be able to frustrate the will of the government a hat the council or a majority <e> <s> we are saying that a majority of tenants might find themselves in this situation i was careful not to say unfortunate situation <e>", "<cs> we all have to row together <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot really thank the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> will he not acknowledge that for county hall which is a listed grade ii building to be changed from its use for local government into a speculative hotel development on a riverside site must call for some public comment and scrutiny <e> <s> how can the minister ignore the court judgment of last year which rejected any hotel or residential use and the current planning decision to restrict it to local government use <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is resting his case on the due process of law and the planning procedures will he bear in mind that the persistence of this secretary of state in not accepting the outcome of public inquiries is a matter which causes much distress to those who are concerned with retaining the building for its present use <e> <s> will he bear in mind that today he has simply stonewalled on behalf of the secretary of state who in our view is very guilty of vandalism <e>", "<cs> my lords while i acknowledge with appreciation what the minister said and what she wrote to me in a letter last week perhaps i may ask whether she will acknowledge that there is deep unease in the industry at the time-scale which she has just outlined <e> <s> will she also bear in mind that only last month more than organisations led by the nfu condemned that short time-scale as ludicrous in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take on board the fact that the food processing industry has not been as fully consulted as other sectors of the industry <e> <s> will she also recognise that more than per cent <e> <s> of the maff-funded research at the institute of food is under threat <e> <s> will she also revise what she said concerning the safety of research into poultry because my information suggests that the whole of the research regime relating to poultry is under threat <e>", "<cs> not to the tenants <e>", "<cs> it will be <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers reply with regard to amendment no <e> <s> v <e> <s> as a result of the fact that the minister and the government were reluctant until three minutes ago to acknowledge the concern of those who wanted the positive right written on the face of the bill there has been some uncertainty and disquiet in fact i would use the word distress <e>", "<cs> i was thinking of potential bad new landlords <e> <s> the idea that a cooperative would be a bad new landlord never crossed my mind <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i sense that he understands the importance to the tenants of the criteria listed in the amendment <e> <s> i think that he is saying in effect that no landlord will be approved who does not satisfy the housing corporation as to his ability and his intention to fulfil what i call the good landlord provisions <e>", "<cs> or a private owner <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has gone some way to supplement and augment our concerns <e> <s> i believe that in one of his phrases he said that the new tenants choice landlord would have to satisfy the stringent criteria that would be laid down <e> <s> on the basis that he has to satisfy those criteria before he is accepted on the approved list we are concerned that those stringent criteria although they may very well be known to the new landlord because he has already met them to the housing corporation and to the government should be made public knowledge <e> <s> can the minister assure the committee that they will be public knowledge <e> <s> it may be that i have not read the bill aright but i am anxious on that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for going some way to reassure the committee <e> <s> however he used the word more than once that it is the intention of the government <e> <s> i very much hope that the government are satisfied that the legislation which gives effect to their intention is completely in place <e> <s> once matters go out of this chamber and begin to be implemented if the intention is thwarted either by sloppy legislation or a failure to perceive the intent then we are in serious trouble <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for giving effect to the assurances given by his then ministerial colleague in another place the honourable marion roe when the issue of tenant management co-operatives was raised by my honourable friend george howarth <e> <s> what he has done so far has eminently satisfied <e>", "<cs> i shall be there <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and i understand the situation <e> <s> however without putting words into the ministers mouth i should like to know whether in the light of the time that we have until the next stage of the bill the national federation of housing co-operatives can successfully discuss with his advisers a form of amendment to be put forward at the report stage which will give effect to its concern <e> <s> will the minister and his colleagues look at that without prejudice <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the care that the minister has shown in this matter <e> <s> however there are still a number of points on which i should like clarification <e> <s> the minister has told us that there is a review on the whole vexed question of how a council which finds its properties transferred is left in the light of its existing debt burden and other matters <e> <s> i want to be sure that the minister has taken on board not only my concern about the effect upon the tenants but also that upon the council <e> <s> if i can be assured of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers comments <e> <s> we shall need to look further at what he has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has demonstrated that he grasps what i am trying to avoid <e> <s> he illustrated the large family <e> <s> let us suppose that there are five adults and they have one vote between them <e> <s> they have to sort out how that one vote is going to be cast <e> <s> if they have their family discussion and all five agree one way or the other there is no harm done they are of one mind even though they may not win in the ballot <e> <s> but if there is a split whether it is four to one or three to two i can well imagine that what they may decide is that unless there is unanimity they will not cast their vote at all because whichever way they cast the vote it will be against the wishes of some of those in the house <e> <s> in other words if they do not vote it is a negative vote and will be counted in with those who are in favour of the transfer <e> <s> we went through that argument earlier on <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the minister has said <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what he has said consult others outside and i may come back again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> any speech of the minister which ends with the words that he is prepared to look at what we have said is more than welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the difficulties of legislating in this field but will the minister acknowledge that changes in legislation in recent years whereby the control over domestic premises has been relaxed for instance to allow developments of a commercial and industrial nature need to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister listen carefully to what has been said this afternoon which indicates that there is genuine sympathy in the house for individuals who innocently find themselves affected by the activities of a speculative developer or predator <e> <s> i acknowledge that there will need to be changes to primary legislation but will the minister consider the creation of a special class of landowner namely a residential householder whose land ought not be the subject of planning permission without his permission <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister care that the high cost of borrowing very much affects the ability of people to build houses to let at affordable rents <e> <s> will he bear in mind that he can do a great deal to relieve that position by reversing his policy of starving councils of the necessary moneys to build houses for rent <e>", "<cs> notice has been given that these benches intend to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> we touch here on what i am sure the minister appreciates is a vexed question namely that of trying to reconcile the desire of the government to assist tenants to become owner-occupiers the desire of a tenant to purchase a property on advantageous terms which he may very well quickly sell once he has become the owner of it and the dilemma of a council with a heart that wants to perpetuate its role in housing and wishes to be the main provider of housing in the rented sector <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl continues his reply i simply remind the committee that those who follow these matters closely are well aware of the purport of the clause <e> <s> i am looking forward very much to the minister dealing with the content of the clause <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the reply <e> <s> the minister has quite fairly said that he has listened to the voice of the tenants <e> <s> the tenant faced with the prospect not only of becoming the owner-occupier but of becoming the owner-occupier at a very cheap price is having to bear some of the burden of ensuring that under existing legislation there is what i consider to be a modest cut-off <e>", "<cs> i have been asked by my noble friend lord mcintosh who is temporarily absent from the chamber to say how grateful he is for the ministers action <e> <s> i refer to his letter to my noble friend dated th october which sets out <e>", "<cs> i rise to say to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes that i fully understand what she is trying to do <e> <s> by one means or another she is trying to force the government to face up to the problems which arise from homelessness particularly in london <e> <s> i am sure that the committee share her belief that the government should do something <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness responds may i say that i understand the difficulties of the minister <e> <s> however the situation must be seen against the background of nine years of his government <e> <s> the position has not been suddenly sprung upon the government this year or last year <e> <s> it has been a mounting problem <e>", "<cs> i rise from these front benches to say that we very much support the thrust of the amendment <e> <s> there may be better ways of dealing with the problem but it rests upon indications that have been made by the government that they recognise the problem and are considering it and many other aspects of homelessness <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friends case <e> <s> i can recall that it was the noble lord lord skelmersdale who took the bill through the chamber and i responded from this side <e> <s> i was much more familiar with the detail <e> <s> i can also recall the category of housing that concerned the constituents of my honourable friend mr terry davis <e> <s> i think it was smiths houses <e> <s> there are or different types of house <e> <s> i can understand the governments dilemma in dealing with the matter in a blanket fashion <e> <s> i can understand that they designate types almost on a hierarchical basis <e> <s> they have all been proved to be defective and the governments dilemma is that unless they take the lot they have to have some kind of a queue <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i would ask him to pursue vigorously the question of whether the issue is not one in which the government are resisting the equity of the case because of the cost of meeting it <e> <s> i recall the debates and visiting some of the houses and listening to people who came to see me <e> <s> it is transparent to the council to councillors to tenants to building societies and prospective purchasers against the background which is rich in this chamber of what we did in local authorities in the s and s to get these kinds of concrete houses built and that we are faced years later with the consequences <e> <s> i very much hope that the authority together with other authorities will press the government by saying it is not right that they should find a means either by designation or a way round it of avoiding accepting responsibility which could very well be because it is costing the government money <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say why the government persist in making members of the armed forces and their families pay more under the community charge when there is in existence a perfectly acceptable arrangement of collective payment which we have already been told has the full support of the forces <e> <s> does the minister recognise that what he proposes will add further to the administrative costs and burdens of local authorities and that what he has said this afternoon simply confirms what has all along been the view of the labour party namely that the community charge is unjust unfair and inequitable <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what the government intend to do about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for saying so succintly that the amendments he has proposed give effect to what is proposed in our amendments <e> <s> i shall be very happy in a moment or two to withdraw the amendments and to support those of the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is satified in substance that what i have sought to write on the face on the bill in amendment no <e> <s> will not be required because he knows precisely what will be on the prescribed form <e> <s> i do not <e> <s> those outside the house do not <e> <s> i am prepared to say that we shall rest content <e> <s> the minister is an honourable man <e> <s> if he assures us that what we feel is required will be on the form issued then we can also agree with the minister that there is no need to write that on the face of the bill <e> <s> i am very happy with the information that he has given and on that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been reasonable bordering on the persuasive <e> <s> that is as far as i shall go <e> <s> he clearly draws the distinction and differentiates between the various grounds <e> <s> i readily understand the impossibility in some circumstances if a longer period of intent had to be served <e> <s> but the minister and his advisers always err on the side of the landlord and assume that in every case the landlord even when he has a benefit in seeking to protect his interests is up against individuals whom the court may later find innocent <e> <s> it is the petrifying worry that so many people feel in the circumstances under the ground of two weeks notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the care he has taken in rebutting the illustrations that i have given <e> <s> it is quite clear that the net effect of the bill will he to narrow the range of those who hitherto have some form of additional or strengthened protection from eviction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that at least the minister as i suspected he would fully subscribes to the words contained in the amendment <e> <s> however he indicates that there is no need for them because what the amendment proposes is already being done <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would care to tell us i shall keep speaking long enough for his colleague to bring us the news whether there are sufficient funds available to meet the needs of the number of applications for assistance <e> <s> we are not asking merely for a grant per se we are asking for a grant for five years <e> <s> we are not asking for the normal grants for capital and capital uses we are talking about sustaining the birth or the growth of such bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> however it is interesting that the minister said that the sums are carefully considered in discussions with the corporation <e> <s> he means discussions between ministers and the corporation not discussions involving the housing association movement ministers and/or the corporation or discussions between representatives of the black and ethnic minority communities the government and the association <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments to which the minister has referred relate to the transitional arrangements for housing association finances during the changeover period <e> <s> i should be most grateful if the minister could comment upon one or two questions that i should like to ask on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that refers to accounting years that end after april <e> <s> if an accounting year includes a period before april where will that leave the housing associations in respect of treatment of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> it was very fair and satisfactory <e> <s> i am therefore happy with the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i am disappointed that this has again been a typical debate no one has been moved either by what the minister has said or by the case that has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i do not doubt his intentions especially in respect of guidance and responsibility but i shall ask him the simple question how will he force a hat to fulfil and comply with government requests <e> <s> a local authority is the present housing manager and the government have a range of measuring rods and yardsticks that they can apply <e> <s> the minister could do himself and those outside the house a great deal of good if he spent a little time considering the possibility and i put it no higher than that that some hat management teams will feel disinclined to go any further than they need <e> <s> they will need to be prodded and probed <e> <s> there will be some which will anger the minister by the lethargy with which they look after people <e> <s> what does the minister have up his sleeve statutorily or otherwise to make such people comply with what he and i want <e>", "<cs> my lords it helps me but it does not answer the question <e> <s> at the moment we have councils which are democratically directly accountable to the electorate and which are therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us when there was a change in the secretary of state <e> <s> surely he is not referring to the present one <e> <s> i am bound to say that the minister has not only failed to convince me i am certain that he has failed to convince many people outside this place that the government genuinely intend to look after the disadvantaged and disabled if the hat is unwilling to look after their interests <e> <s> however i think the minister has gone as far as he can which is not very far <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is far more optimistic than we are about the ability of local authorities satisfactorily to reach agreements with hats under the wording on the face of the bill <e> <s> for instance at the moment there is a comparable obligation between local authorities and housing associations under section of the act <e> <s> quite frankly it has failed to work <e> <s> housing associations are quite unable to house the homeless <e> <s> to give one illustration <e> <s> in the london borough of greenwich per cent <e> <s> of local authority properties house the homeless <e>", "<cs> in a moment <e> <s> what about the rights of succession which the present tenant has <e> <s> the lot of a tenant who remains a council tenant will be weakened <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not a question it was an intervention <e> <s> i shall reply to all speeches at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall reply at a later stage <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise because i did not hear the last sentence of the noble lord <e> <s> i wonder if he would repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords if out of tenants vote and one is in favour of the transfer and are against the one wins because the one is aggregated with the who did not vote <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has a concept of a council tenant wholly concerned and only concerned with his situation as an occupant of his house or flat <e> <s> a council tenant on an estate is conscious of a great many other things <e> <s> he is not only voting against the transfer of his house he is voting against the transfer of the whole estate <e> <s> he is saying i do not like the idea <e> <s> i do not think that that my arithmetic can be argued against <e> <s> given that people are invited to vote and vote the minister says that if there is one vote in favour of the transfer then the one wins over the per cent <e> <s> because that one is aggregated to the per cent <e> <s> who for many reasons did not vote <e> <s> noble lords must have a word for that kind of democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an offer that i cannot refuse <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for that offer <e> <s> though i have the privilege of moving these amendments tonight as the noble earl and others will appreciate my noble friend lord carter and other members of the house have demonstrated very often from their personal family knowledge how important it is to try to secure the best possible arrangements for individuals who are disabled <e> <s> i am very grateful to the minister for what he said as regards the first amendment <e> <s> i am very well satisfied because these matters are a question of record <e> <s> the minister and his advisers are honourable men <e> <s> what has been explained to me in the last minute certainly will go a very long way perhaps further than we want to ensure that the policies of any new prospective landlord are as sympathetic as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given me a full i was almost tempted to say fair reply <e> <s> however i must be careful because i have a reputation to keep up as he knows <e> <s> he is saying that provided a landlord is able to demonstrate that there are at least per cent <e> <s> of the tenants at the preliminary stage who wish to transfer that is the trigger which he has to achieve <e> <s> but if he achieves that in the first instance and then there is a negative ballot he knows that he has the per cent <e> <s> and that they are not likely to go away <e> <s> i do not dispute the fact that there will always be perhaps per cent <e> <s> or even more almost <e>", "<cs> good <e>", "<cs> my lords i invite the minister to cherish this moment <e> <s> there will be very few like it and there have not been many previously <e> <s> not only is there complete agreement on this side of the house but we fully acknowledge that he has gone as far as he can <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the house that the minister has done it again he has satisfied me <e> <s> i am very grateful <e> <s> he has pointed out quite fairly and reasonably that what we sought to write into the bill was already in the minds of the minister and the housing corporation in respect of the procedures that he intends to lay down <e> <s> i am sure that those outside the house who guide us in these matters will understand the wisdom of the ministers remarks <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> he made reference to the tenants guarantee and i understand that consultation is taking place at the moment with associations and authorities as to what should be contained in it <e> <s> can the minister help by telling us whether the result of that consultation will be available to the house before the bill leaves parliament <e> <s> there is very little time of course but it may be possible for queries to be raised either in this house or another place <e> <s> we only have until next week in two or three weeks from now the bill will have received royal assent and become an act <e> <s> the contents of the guarantee are certainly intriguing and i believe would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords my sense tells me to say no more <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he goes a long way towards reassuring me that the spirit of this amendment will be met <e> <s> in fact he goes even further because we say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he should understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of the information being in the primary language of those affected <e> <s> i shall use the word significant here because it will be appreciated that different languages are taught in ilea schools <e> <s> it is of course impossible to do this in all those languages <e> <s> however if examples are drawn to the ministers attention of cases in which groups of people of a significant size have not received advice in their primary language can he confirm that he will take steps to ensure that that is remedied <e>", "<cs> my lords we are speaking here of the interpretation of communications <e> <s> i am prepared to withdraw the amendment but the minister seems to jib at accepting the words primary language <e> <s> i am not clear why he has that reservation <e> <s> if he wishes every person to understand what is happening to him the only way that that can be done apart from plain english is in an ethnic minority language <e> <s> i take it that the minister agrees to take steps to ensure that that is done <e> <s> i do not wish him to say any more because i am quite pleased with my last few words <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side fully understand and appreciate the amendment and are grateful for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i shall not delay the house but all that he has said is that what will be laid down must be complied with <e> <s> i am reminded of other situations where people will set out their stall which will look most attractive <e> <s> they promise to do this that and the other and the minister will satisfy himself that this is the bill of sale which the lew landlord is putting forward and that it is acceptable <e> <s> but what do the minister and his advisers intend to do subsequently if it turns out that the tenants whether they were willing or not have bought a pig in a poke in regard to the delivery of what the minister wants in terms of looking after the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he and the corporation know that their reputations and political integrity are on the line <e> <s> i am sure that they will want to ensure that this procedure is a success <e> <s> to that extent i had forgotten but the minister reminds me so often <e> <s> it will not be in the interests of the minister or of the corporation if there is a shoal of objections <e> <s> not only will the publicity be detrimental but the political credibility of the minister who has said as much as he can on this matter will be on the line <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister undertake to give serious consideration to the rest proposals from the keep sunday special campaign <e> <s> when he and his colleagues have come to a conclusion which i sincerely hope will not be complete deregulation will it be their intention to issue their views in the form of a white paper so that they can be considered rather than simply to slip them through in one line in a future queens speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lady turner for giving us the opportunity to debate this situation <e> <s> although the peg upon which the debate hangs is the future of shorts this debate is not about shorts but about northern ireland because shorts figures largely in the economy of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> disgraceful <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall telling me on th october last year when i alleged that the enfield small arms factory site was valued in excess of million that he had valued the site a site with hundreds of acres of development potential at million <e> <s> now that it is crystal clear that the minister has been complacent careless and plain deceived or all three is he not ashamed to be involved in the shabby and shoddy theft of taxpayers money and the lining of the pockets of private shareholders at public expense <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that i like the noble lord will rest content with the outcome of the consideration by the public accounts committee and the auditor general as to whether the minister obtained a fair value for the assets <e> <s> but is this not a case of the government being more concerned with flogging assets than looking after the interests of the taxpayers and the workers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall visiting the royal small arms factory in enfield before privatisation and giving the workforce an assurance about their future <e> <s> now that people the whole workforce have been made redundant would he care to return and explain to some of them why in fact he was misled <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl note that i am delighted with his delight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to my noble friend lord carter for asking for the debate and also to the minister who was most anxious to be here to respond <e> <s> i am grateful to her <e> <s> we all understand that she has had to undergo some problems of a personal nature over the past few months <e> <s> my heart and i am sure the hearts

illustration that i gave research into salmonella in poultry and in areas of public safety health and hygiene the public health will be at grave risk <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i want to assure her that those who advised me of their interpretation and their conclusions after discussions will not only be grateful for what the minister has just said which is on the record but will feel that they must have attended an attributable briefing at which the tape recorder broke down <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure and privilege to speak in this debate and not least to follow the noble lord lord brocket who has introduced with considerable humour and skill the wide panoply of this very important and timely question tabled by my noble friend lord ponsonby <e> <s> i believe that the debate has been illuminated by specialist knowledge of many sectors of the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> one learns something new every day my lords <e> <s> i think the minister has some searching questions to answer about the thrust of government policy on this matter <e> <s> britain is in competition with other countries <e> <s> there is also competition among its own people as to the places at which they want to spend their hard-earned money <e> <s> i am all for encouraging people to have a proper holiday and people in the north in particular as well as other parts of the country to enjoy some of the boom that has been visited almost gratuitously upon the south-east <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful to the minister for telling the house that he and his colleagues would want to see this aspect of tourism increased <e> <s> will the minister enter a more positive note <e> <s> there is a difference between <e>", "<cs> my lords she holds all the cards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as are all noble lords to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e>

are in his debt for having given us the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord russsell and the noble lord lord bethel <e> <s> have cloaked what they have said in a veneer of friendship for the people of brent and have wrung their hands <e> <s> i think that i have listened to the greatest demonstration of hypocrisy of bile of venom and of spite that i have heard in this house or in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords all that i have to go on is what the noble earl said earlier <e> <s> if he cares to withdraw what he said of course i shall withdraw my impression of what he said <e> <s> in the meantime the record will speak for itself <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that i have been requested twice to withdraw a charge of hypocrisy which has caused so much offence to the noble earl and the noble lord of course i withdraw that unreservedly <e>", "<cs> of course not my lords <e> <s> i am saying that the noble lord is retailing stories which appear in the press and which i allege have no or little foundation <e> <s> it is easy to pick a phrase and then to categorise and to damn an activity of the council on that basis <e> <s> when last i had an opportunity to investigate these matters they were proven to be completely untrue <e> <s> they could not be traced back to a person <e> <s> they could not be traced back to an incident <e> <s> they simply disappeared <e> <s> i can see a shadow looming on my right <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that the actual problems are more in the knowledge of the noble earl himself <e> <s> i understand the point about the rubbish <e> <s> i also take fully on board the points that were made about problems with the trade unions and workers <e> <s> the reality has to be faced <e> <s> there has been a traumatic revolution in relationships between the council and the workers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e> <s> i am grateful to him for doing so <e> <s> will he agree that there is probably not a borough in the whole of england in which some council properties are not occupied by people who are not those whom the council understands to be the tenants <e> <s> for example when the issue became current it was acknowledged by the housing officials in the london borough of enfield that it was more than likely that that problem existed in the borough <e> <s> the problem also exists in the london boroughs of barnet and croydon and elsewhere <e> <s> will the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity of speaking in this debate which was so ably opened by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> on reflection i think we have had a very well balanced and well informed debate <e> <s> i wish to declare an interest in the form of my association with the co-operative movement <e> <s> when that movement was established about years ago one of its cardinal principles was that no credit should be given <e> <s> the success of the co-operative movement in those early years was partly due to the experience of those who were pioneers of the movement who recognised that working people poor people unemployed people and defenceless people were the greatest victims of the use of credit <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the apr being a handy reference point for consumers <e> <s> will the minister say how the interest-free period within the first year will affect the real apr <e> <s> if consumers need to understand that is it not a powerful argument for better education on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i made one in my speech namely the encouragement and extension of consumer advice centres <e> <s> no doubt he will refer to that in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords after two minutes of his speech the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls wondered whether it was wise to go on <e> <s> those who read what he said will have to draw their own conclusions <e> <s> he made an excellent second reading speech in a debate in which we do not have a bill before us and i congratulate him on that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real pleasure to be the first member of your lordships house to follow the noble lord lord broxbourne in this debate <e> <s> i am very grateful for the gentle way in which he led us into this debate <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that everyone in the house will like me have read the report <e> <s> but we will not have had the benefit of the pleasure that i sense members of the committee had in taking part in the committee proceedings <e> <s> when i look at the quality of the members of sub-committee e i am very impressed <e> <s> i also echo the sadness of the noble lord lord broxbourne as regards the passing of our dear colleague lord silkin of dulwich during the passage of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> twenty years my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she could tell me what the pence in france covers by comparison to what could be covered by or here <e> <s> are we comparing like with like <e> <s> the report says that it was impossible to ascertain from france precisely what the p <e> <s> covered <e>", "<cs> i had a date in tunisia <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by apologising to the house for not having been present at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> however i know that the noble lord lord strathclyde will share my pleasure when i say that i intend to be present at the very end to hear his pearls of wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by passing to the house the very real regrets of my noble friend lady birk who in the normal course of events would have been standing at this box <e> <s> she was looking forward to doing so but she is not well <e> <s> she is unable to be here this evening and i am sorry that that is the position <e> <s> she sends her apologies and regrets <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble baroness i must apologise but the dilemma is that the noble and gallant lord said that in fact there never was an initial drop <e> <s> i was misled by the statistics because they showed me that something like a drop of or per cent <e> <s> occurred in the first year <e> <s> subsequently they appeared to have been rising at the level of about per cent <e> <s> all i wished to say was that if that was as a result of the charges i am referring to the initial drop the trustees appeared to be more concerned with getting more people in than perhaps saving money <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that the cost of housing homeless people in bed and breakfast accommodation is far greater than the cost to a council of housing them in normal housing <e> <s> what is the minister doing to reduce the use of bed and breakfast accommodation and to encourage an extension of council house occupation <e> <s> the minister has referred to the percentage of housing owned by councils which is unoccupied <e> <s> will he confirm that the amount of housing in the ownership and gift of the government is far greater than the unoccupied housing belonging to councils <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take on board the fact that while part of the nexus of housing is mortgage payments it must also be recognised that for many of us it is adequate housing for those in need which counts <e> <s> will the minister tell us what the government are doing to encourage councils to build houses at affordable rents <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that an element in these tragic cases is the over-heavy work load of social workers can the minister tell us what steps the government are taking to monitor the staffing levels of social services departments in particular in london where one sees that they are inadequate in line with their resources and to ensure that further resources are made available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that it is not up to the government but up to the industry to look after itself <e> <s> why do not the government take into account the support other countries give to their indigenous film industries <e> <s> is not the minister concerned about imports of second-rate and rubbishy films which fill our screens and are shown on television when considered in the light of developments in the film industry <e>", "<cs> then why not support them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the executive of the poa is in the middle of organising a ballot of its members urging that the dispute which has lasted for a long time should be called off <e> <s> is he further aware that the executive of the poa has spent many weeks trying to urge its branches to accept the proposals <e> <s> with that knowledge is it not therefore extraordinary that the government have connived at the situation in wandsworth where a new governor has come in and sought to impose arrangements on the local branch which were the subject of negotiation with the old governor <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond briefly <e> <s> as the minister is aware i represent the interests of prison officers <e> <s> i must declare that interest <e> <s> surely he is aware that this dispute which has national implications also has local implications at wandsworth <e> <s> part of the reason for the ballot which will be held is to call off the national dispute with local arrangements being made satisfactorily <e> <s> can the minister confirm that the police have said that they are horrified at the action of the government as this is the first time that the police have been called into prisons since <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from members of the national federation of football supporters clubs which prays that this house will amend the football spectators bill in such a way as to preserve football as a spectator sport capable of attracting a new generation of supporters while having a real impact on football-related violence <e> <s> i have been told that it contains many thousands of signatures as a first instalment <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful to the minister for the care that he has taken to explain the bill in detail <e> <s> i am conscious that we are privileged to have first bite at the cherry in this house <e> <s> i represent the views of my party and i shall also represent the views of millions of men and women young and old who share my partys view that the bill is a bad bill a sad bill an unnecessary bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not criticise the bill because it was restricted solely to football <e> <s> the point i made and the official record tomorrow will prove it is that with the evidence of as much violence or more in other sports why have the government picked on soccer <e> <s> that is not to bring in others <e> <s> it is to ask why have a bill dealing with football inthis way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should listen more carefully <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that the scheme will not be implemented until he is satisfied <e> <s> if it takes two three or even four years before he is satisfied is he saying that it will not be implemented until such satisfaction is achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords if indeed the noble lord is right to say that there is a mechanism in part ii which will deal with known troublemakers going abroad why cannot the same mechanism be applied to the circumstances in part i <e> <s> if the troublemakers are known and they cannot go abroad why cannot they be stopped by the same mechanism here in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> am grateful that he has returned to statistics but when i made my point i said that there were figures that the minister had corrected but there were others <e> <s> have today received a written reply to that question <e> <s> i should tell him that leeds united football club has told me <e>", "<cs> my lords although the overall increase of about per cent <e> <s> is to be welcomed can the minister confirm that this amounts to only per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> will he take on board the fact that in northern ireland unemployment has fallen in the latter period by less than per cent <e> <s> whereas nationally it has fallen by almost per cent <e> <s> as northern ireland fares badly in the reduction in unemployment can the minister tell the house how he intends to redress that balance <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that of the departments global budget less than per cent <e> <s> is spent on industry while more than per cent <e> <s> is spent on social security <e> <s> we do not wish the latter figure to be affected but can he say how he intends to increase the less than per cent <e> <s> spent on industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that young workers are among the most vulnerable sector in the community that they already suffer from exploitation and that they need protection especially in respect of their wage rates but also in respect of other matters <e> <s> if indeed parliament thought about this as long ago as when winston churchill had something to say about wages councils what has changed in the intervening years <e> <s> the attitude of employers to young workers certainly has not <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister respond to the current situation in retailing whereby the wages of many young workers are or a week <e> <s> does the minister take on board the fact that there are employers especially in retailing who will take advantage of the removal of the existing minimum protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> does the minister share my view that congestion on the roads should be diminished wherever possible <e> <s> if he does share my view would he care to comment on the recent cancellation by british rail of the concessionary fares that it operated for conference delegates <e> <s> in the light of that does not the minister agree that there is a likelihood that displaced rail travellers will add to the congestion on the roads <e> <s> what does he intend to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister fairly said that the peg upon which i hung this question that is the abolition of concessionary fares only affects per cent <e> <s> of people who attend conferences <e> <s> but is the minister aware that that per cent <e> <s> can involve many thousands of people who will add to the congestion on the roads <e> <s> will the minister take on board the mood of the house which is that while we want our various forms of transport to develop and grow more successful we also want to ensure that there is co-ordination and not competition in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was fair enough to refer to the vote against the legislation in another place on second reading <e> <s> but he must recall that members in another place voted against their party whip <e> <s> there was a party whip in another place on second reading <e> <s> one of the problems for the government was that more than of their supporters defied a three-line whip and many others abstained <e> <s> that is simply a matter of record and it should not be used to confuse the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow an excellent speech by the noble lord lord elton and <e>", "<cs> five million thank you <e> <s> my lords why make it possible to add to that number another million <e> <s> they would be i shall not say forced because i do not accept that they will have to work put under pressure to work <e> <s> why do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate <e> <s> i should like to begin by acknowledging the fact that the minister and his colleagues have a superhuman task in addressing themselves to the problems not only those in northern ireland but also in this instance those involved in bringing forward some form of law and order inside council chambers which is the genesis of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl can be so precise as to the number of council houses that can be sold can he tell the house the number of houses he expects to be built <e>", "<cs> my lords council houses <e>", "<cs> on these benches we very much appreciate the manner in which the two prime movers of the amendment have sought to engage the attention and support of the committee <e> <s> i join them in saying that we are desperately anxious to deal with the problem at a football level and not at a party political level <e> <s> that is a genuinely held view <e> <s> many noble lords will have come to the chamber today to hear the arguments <e> <s> i very much hope that when they come to vote whether on this amendment or on the others they will acknowledge that there is a problem to be tackled <e> <s> on that point there is literally no dispute in this chamber in another place or in the country <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that the noble lord will not make generalised statements about hooliganism or violence in the lower divisions <e> <s> he must be aware that on th january in response to mr tony marlow mr douglas hogg stated in a written answer in another place that in division four there had been arrests up to st october <e> <s> yet when my honourable friend mr pendry challenged those figures on nd february mr hogg replied in a written answer <e>", "<cs> will the minister take on board the fact that both the football association and the football league stated at no <e> <s> downing street that they were opposed to an identity card scheme <e> <s> as recently as st february this year in response to a letter from the minister for sport those bodies said they had grave reservations about the efficacy of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless they said they would work with the government <e> <s> so the minister needs to be very careful about spreading around the rumour that people who are opposed to the bill but who are members of a working party are tarred and feathered with the outcome of that report <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> it is rather sad <e> <s> he started by stating that consultation has taken place but he tells us in advance of the outcome that that consultation is unlikely to exclude the welsh clubs <e> <s> i do not know what kind of consultation is taking place or who is to be included if the secretary of state for wales is already under some remit from higher authority that whatever the consultation produces it must he ignored unless it is of a certain view <e>", "<cs> in general i am more anxious to understand from the government what they have in mind and for the government to understand what we have in mind than i am in forcing divisions <e> <s> the ball is in the ministers court <e>", "<cs> without id cards and under present law <e>", "<cs> that is one way of putting it <e>", "<cs> recount <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one or two cardinal points <e> <s> the noble lord has been very fair and consistent <e> <s> i mean that most sincerely <e> <s> he restated the governments view and said that it is their intention that this proposal should be universally applied to all clubs <e> <s> even though we have had reference to consultations which take place in wales in respect of the welsh clubs and even though we have had indications from the minister and his colleagues that they are prepared to look at some suggestions i simply invite the committee to consider the matter very carefully <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be able to say something further on this <e> <s> this matter is undoubtedly a hot potato <e> <s> it has been recognised as such ever since the scheme was conceived <e> <s> the minister rests his case upon clause c which states that the scheme may provide <e>", "<cs> you were run over <e>", "<cs> is the minister telling the committee that the scheme divised by the fma to deal with this matter even though it is contrary to the views of the secretary of state will prevail <e>", "<cs> i say to the minister with great respect that substantial questions have been asked that he has failed to answer to our satisfaction <e> <s> he has given answers but i hope that when he and his colleagues reflect after this stage he will see that this house will not be satisfied with the answers that it has had <e> <s> what powers we have and how we can seek to support our premises in these matters remain to others and myself to consider between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> although the minister does not dismiss the schemes he welcomes them i am sad that he is not prepared to accept what we suggest a substitute for the application of a national scheme in certain circumstances <e> <s> let us bear in mind that this is not a cosy relationship between the club the local police and the council <e> <s> it has to be a pretty good scheme to get all three to work together <e> <s> it then has to be submitted to the fma <e> <s> that is the body which has yet to he created under this bill <e> <s> that body has to look at the scheme which has to be supported by the secretary of state <e> <s> the minister seems to be saying time and again that the reason the government cannot accept sensible proposals is because they have already decided to exclude anything other than what is already in the bill <e> <s> if that is the situation why does he not tell us that we are wasting our time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that there would be complications <e> <s> i do not believe that looking at a complete record will cause much difficulty and trouble <e> <s> there would be an incentive a carrot held out to clubs to maintain violence-free records which would lift them from the burden of this bill <e> <s> that is a powerful incentive <e> <s> nothing that the minister said so far the night is young and our impact into the bill is short will encourage clubs to <e>", "<cs> i rise just to make this point to the minister <e> <s> if at the end of the day the scheme is in a form which is acceptable to the minister and it is sensible what is wrong with putting that before parliament and saying this is the scheme take it or leave it <e> <s> i refer not to the bits of the scheme which will be subject to statutory instruments but to the whole of the scheme <e>", "<cs> they were sitting on one <e>", "<cs> what is it <e>", "<cs> the genesis of the amendment is that the punishment for committing or attempting to commit the offence is a term of imprisonment <e> <s> i am asking the minister to explain so far he has not done so why it is so heinous a crime that committing it deserves a term of imprisonment <e> <s> there are many things for which people deserve to go to prison <e> <s> this is a new crime <e> <s> we shall have a new category of person <e> <s> more people will be sent to prison <e> <s> the minister has explained what he understands will happen but that is not what the bill says <e> <s> it provides <e>", "<cs> it depends upon what the policeman says <e>", "<cs> by everybody <e>", "<cs> everywhere <e>", "<cs> we have demonstrated once again not that here has been any evil intention on the part of the minister or his colleagues but that the words on the face of the bill are capable of being misused abused and misinterpreted not merely by those who read it now but by the courts and other tribunals <e>", "<cs> the minister has been given the opportunity to take away these amendments for consideration <e> <s> one of the objectives of my noble friends on this side of the committee is to provide people outside the house and those in another place with the arguments that i hope will be used in both places <e> <s> the more that people outside the chamber have reported to them faithfully by the media what a nonsense the application of the bill is i am not talking about the principle of whether there should be id cards and the more that people who share the views of the minister that something must be done see what it means in practice the angrier they will be <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is separate <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for allowing me to correct that impression <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is the amendment to which i am referring <e> <s> many of the amendments in this group are consequential to our original amendment and so are amendments nos <e> <s> and which we shall be discussing separately <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister who has been forthcoming and has met the thrust of these amendments namely the uncertainty <e> <s> however it is right that two points should be raised <e> <s> first the minister said that he hopes that the fma will be peopled by the league and the association and that they need to come forward with an acceptable timescale <e> <s> i assume the minister is saying acceptable to the secretary of state <e> <s> is he aware that in a letter addressed to the minister for sport the league and the football association said <e>", "<cs> in the light of the ministers offer we shall not press the amendments <e> <s> he fairly indicated that it may not be possible to be more precise <e> <s> i do not expect the minister to answer now but as fluid as the discussions are with the league and the football association and as helpful as the league the association and the government appointee who is discussing how it would work are i very much hope that there will not be an imperative from some other quarter which says we know you have not reached agreement but we intend to implement the scheme from a date which is seen by the league and the association as raising all sorts of problems <e>", "<cs> the minister has been more than fair and i am grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what the minister said is perfectly fair <e> <s> we put amendments down in the absence of any clue as to what might happen <e> <s> we have drawn from the minister i do not mean that in an offensive way and from his ministerial colleague that there is an intention having withdrawn a raft of amendments that we shall see a little more daylight at the next stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> certainly in the light of that i am prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has eased our minds and we understand that there is no intention to do other than have full consultation with the authorities in respect of the life and functions of the fma <e> <s> i look forward as does my noble friend lord harris to seeing what the government have in mind and the amendments that they will bring forward <e> <s> we will examine them closely <e> <s> from what the minister has said i believe that this side of the committee will accept the amendments if we understand from the football authorities that they meet their desire to be in charge of their remit under the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when the minister said that he will reflect and we understand that he is giving no undertaking at the moment he appeared to us to pre-empt the possibility of bringing forward an amendment of his own or of any amendment being proposed in the light of <e>", "<cs> does the undertaking include discussions <e> <s> i want to hear the minister say it <e>", "<cs> will the minister confirm that that is what he said <e>", "<cs> can the minister be helpful for the sixth time <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that there is a widespread programme of research into the problems of salmonella <e> <s> can he therefore explain why scientists engaged on salmonella research at the food and agricultural research institute at langford bristol are under notice to quit what they are doing in april of this year <e>", "<cs> it is a swindle <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other members of your lordships house in congratulating my noble friend lady turner on seizing an initiative which the government have not seized providing an opportunity to debate the white paper <e> <s> it is right that we should look at what my noble friend has sought to do <e> <s> it is not merely a debate on the contents of the white paper we must look at the terms of the question <e>", "<cs> spot on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seeks to demonstrate that what he calls a poor response on the future of wages councils is a deafening silence <e> <s> does he not think that there may be a cynicism among trade unions <e> <s> they may wonder if this government have listened so carefully to what they have been saying for years and have ignored it what is the point of saying to them that while there may not be a case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has sought to cover the point <e> <s> is he really saying that he accepts a system whereby the generality of taxpayer is there to top up the low wages paid by an employer who decides that that is the wage he can get the employee for <e> <s> he is talking about subsidising poor or bad employers <e> <s> by the very nature of employment they are in the business of reducing their on-costs to the lowest possible level <e> <s> therefore it is quite astounding for the minister to say so cheerfully that the system has changed so that the generality of the taxpayer by this raft of other benefits is there to top up the very low wages which i can assure him are paid in many industries not least in those of retailing and catering <e>", "<cs> yet <e>", "<cs> it was a straightforward question <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble and learned lord who spoke before the minister will the minister take the question seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also recognise that it is not just a question of putting down dogs it is a question of trying to ensure that the animal welfare organisations and the local authorities carry out a job to protect the health of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords what steps do the government intend to take to ensure that the money raised from the sale of the site is maximised and is then returned to the people of london from whom county hall was stolen in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that of late mr gorbachev has been cutting arms unilaterally is not the governments best line to abandon modernising nuclear weapons and to seek greater parity with conventional forces in europe <e>", "<cs> it is helpful of the minister to speak as he has done <e> <s> he has not spoken in an aggressive way <e> <s> i believe that he has given voice to what was said after the committee stage certainly in another place by some of his ministerial colleagues <e> <s> what is most unfortunate is the gloss and the interpretation that have been put on by his ministerial colleagues immediately after the passage of the amendments <e>", "<cs> before we proceed the minister may wish to consider carefully that although properly the dicussions will take place with those whose names were attached to the amendment it might be for the benefit of the committee and of the bill if he widened those discussions to include one or two others whose views might be helpful <e> <s> i leave that suggestion with the minister <e>", "<cs> may <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by saying that the minister has made a very good start in his response to the amendments which have been tabled <e>

my intention to press the matter to a vote but we are left with a number of questions <e> <s> we have another opportunity for clarification between this stage and the next <e>", "<cs> if i understand the minister correctly in dealing with this amendment he relies on what he said earlier namely he envisages that among the exemptions which the government favour bearing in mind that it is up to the fma is an exemption for clubs to issue temporary admission cards to guests for whom they will take responsibility <e>", "<cs> the final sentences of the minister will be reassuring to the embryo fma <e> <s> i should like to believe in the ministers confidence that its decisions in the best interests of football will be seen by everyone else including the secretary of state as the best decisions

point and the long night is approaching <e> <s> there are other stages in the bill <e> <s> this letter will bear not only re-reading by myself but also requoting by me as selectively and helpfully as possible <e> <s> i believe that the minister has gone as far as he can as regards this amendment <e> <s> we rest on the premise that the people covered by this amendment may very well be those who are accepted by the fma as worthy of having issued to them a temporary card for which the club is responsible <e> <s> those outside the committee will hear what we have to say <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> for matches <e>", "<cs> if what the noble earl is saying is that there is no difference between applying for a membership identity card and applying for a season ticket you are applying twice <e>", "<cs> if you can get a season ticket by applying for membership of the fma that is a surprise to me <e> <s> what you have are people who pay at spurs and at halifax they pay for matches that is per game to be guaranteed a place <e> <s> i have not seen halifax play lately so i do not know whether it is value for money <e> <s> but the minister has been given a piece of paper with some words written on it which he has faithfully read out <e> <s> let us hope the information was correct <e>", "<cs> the minister has not deviated <e> <s> the noble lord lord mellish is right <e> <s> the mood now is different from the mood on the first amendment because the government were beaten on the first amendment <e> <s> that is why they are listening <e> <s> they are sensitive to defeat <e> <s> i hope that the minister will acknowledge that i have been generous in appreciating what he has done so far <e> <s> the noble lord lord mellish and i have known and respected each other for a long time <e> <s> we are looking at this matter differently <e>", "<cs> yes please <e>", "<cs> let me try to encourage the minister do do even better <e> <s> if he stops where he is we shall have the same kind of impasse as before <e> <s> i do not want him to say that he is prepared to take away this amendment and look at it to see whether he can accept it i want him to tell us that he is willing to take it away without commitment and study what has been said in the debate <e> <s> that is one side of the argument it is the other side to say i am not even prepared to entertain the possibility that i or my advisers might be wrong <e>", "<cs> the minister has dealt as fully as he can with the arguments <e> <s> i say that sincerely <e> <s> he has responded to the points that have been made to the best of his ability on the advice that he has been able to receive <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for spelling out the manner in which the fma will have the major responsibility for putting the flesh on the bones <e> <s> we wanted to hear the minister say that those who can be categorised as being disabled are a special case to be dealt with outside the generality of the football membership scheme <e> <s> we did not want the minister to go any further than that and i am grateful to him <e> <s> i look forward to seeing the small print <e>", "<cs> i believe that the committee will welcome my repeating the experience at crystal palace <e> <s> there wheelchairs are admitted through park road entrance free of charge and accompanying helpers may obtain seats for <e> <s> an accompanying helper is not necessarily someone who is interested in football but he is passionately interested in the welfare and wellbeing of the disabled person <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to speak to my own amendment <e> <s> the past minutes have not been wasted <e> <s> they have revealed a degree of uncertainty in the governments case that must worry the ministers supporters behind him and there are still some left although not many as to his ability to satisfy perfectly simple and straightforward questions <e>", "<cs> i made a note of what the noble lord lord hesketh said earlier <e> <s> i noted four categories of exemption from among the eight or nine which we requested and they were the disabled guests foreign and school parties <e> <s> that was my note of the groups which would be taken care of <e>", "<cs> we have to be satisfied with what the minister said <e> <s> however that is not satisfactory because the fma which is the league and the association will listen very carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> the fma is not irresponsible and is not out to wreck the bill or the scheme <e> <s> because it has to have a relationship with the minister and other ministers and it may very well be those who are answering here tonight it will not wish to make such a flagrant abuse of its opportunity that the secretary of state will strike out something <e> <s> therefore i accept that it is highly unlikely that the secretary of state will want to interfere in the method and the manner whereby school parties are able to go to the grounds <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> the minister has again rested his case on the grounds of excluding the minimum number of people possible <e> <s> even when we make out a case for a large group of people who in our view are not the kinds of people whom the minister wants to exclude that is potential hooligans he says that if they go to the ground they need protection from the potential hooligans therefore they need a card to get in <e> <s> but that is putting not the card before the horse the cart before the horse <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house fully support what the minister has said <e> <s> enabling political parties to finance their campaigns in a sensible manner clearly aids democracy <e> <s> we wish the order well <e>", "<cs> the minister has not made a good case in regard to the central point of my amendment which is to trust a member of the scheme with his own intelligence and to be aware that his membership of the scheme is at risk if he in any way introduces a potential hooligan into the ground <e>", "<cs> the minister will understand that he is losing friends at luton with every statement that he makes <e> <s> the people of luton are saying that they have done everything that the government want <e> <s> they have a scheme they have excluded potential hooligans and encouraged the good supporters of football <e> <s> the minister is saying that that is not the kind of scheme that the government have in mind so the people of luton for whom i have the greatest respect will be unhappy because they cannot win at any level <e>", "<cs> the noble lord invites me to table amendments and i shall think about it <e> <s> i am not holding up the luton experience as the minister of sport has done as a scheme to be replicated <e> <s> i simply point out that the luton supporters of the governments attitude to football will be bitterly disappointed because as the minister said away fans are not going to be banned which is part of the luton experience <e> <s> the present luton experience is that a member of the scheme <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he said that provided the club takes the responsibility of allowing a member of the scheme to bring along his guests the club will be <e>", "<cs> i want to get this clear <e> <s> in future when the scheme is in operation a club will be able to issue an admission ticket to the kind of people i have in mind that is casual supporters and there will be no limit on the number because one cannot anticipate the number <e> <s> i have already given a figure of or for a club with an attendance of to <e> <s> is the minister saying that a club will be empowered to issue guest tickets to casual supporters <e>", "<cs> that is if there are no ifs or buts and provided a club says we shall take responsibility for issuing guest cards to guests of the club who are friends of members or even not friends but who are casual spectators <e> <s> if the minister is saying that or something like it i shall withdraw my amendment <e> <s> we are speaking about the possibility of between and maybe people wishing to attend matches casually <e> <s> they turn up now <e> <s> if we are to be told that a club is able to issue or guests tickets without the paraphernalia required to be a member of the scheme in this amendment i am speaking about casual visitors who are guests of members provided those people will be accommodated by the route the minister has described and not by my route i shall be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister referred to room for chaos with this amendment <e> <s> i assure him that the application of the scheme will provide plenty of opportunity for chaos without the amendment <e> <s> i understand the noble lords reticence about accepting the amendment because it covers too wide an area of potential exclusion <e> <s> that is a good thing in the sense that literally thousands of people already see the advantages of membership of a scheme of this kind <e> <s> i am willing to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i shall look carefully at what the noble lord said and i reserve my right to come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e>", "<cs> the minister has gone some way towards meeting the point of my amendment <e> <s> the impetus for the amendment has come from a number of quarters not least the national council of civil liberties which has studied these matters with care <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the minister has said about the amendment fully recognising that he has sympathy with the desire of members of the scheme to influence their own scheme <e> <s> the minister understands that if the scheme becomes a reality we are expecting a group of people who together will total or even million individuals <e> <s> it is a colossal voluntary body voluntary in the sense that they are compulsorily made to join the scheme that will have the opportunity to use its muscle <e> <s> the group recognises the propriety of these matters the sovereignty of parliament and that it very much depends on the good will of the clubs <e> <s> i liked what the minister said he thought it sensible that the clubs would influence the fma <e> <s> the fma could decide how best to get the fans on its side <e> <s> that does not need to be spelt out in precise words at this stage <e>", "<cs> very dangerous <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may offer a few words of solace to the minister <e> <s> he referred to the general exemptions for foreigners who come here as part of the tourist industry <e> <s> i have been approached by the british inward tour operators association bitoa which is very concerned about the damage that may be done to its ability to induce foreigners to come here with part of the package being attendance at a big match <e> <s> it told me that the clubs which visitors most frequently wish to see are spurs arsenal chelsea liverpool and manchester united <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say without offence that i am grateful for what the minister said <e> <s> it is common sense <e> <s> i use the phrase which may be clumsy that there will undoubtedly be a new era in the running supporting and perhaps the playing of football after the legislation is enacted <e> <s> it is right that the minister should say what i consider <e>", "<cs> it is interesting how the minister picks and chooses the parts of the ministers working party report that he pleads in aid in support of his proposals <e> <s> the minister read first from paragraph on page <e>", "<cs> i accept the sincerity of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> we have yet to see an amendment which will be tabled on report about the creation of the fma <e> <s> the noble lord believes that the fma should be given the job of running the scheme <e> <s> the minister will not have that for a moment <e> <s> never mind that the secretary of state has the power to accept or reject the scheme the minister seeks to give the fma a blank sheet with certain caveats and restrictions about what it should and should not do <e> <s> clause provides that the scheme must include certain points <e> <s> they may not all be to the liking of the fma but whether it likes them or not it must include them <e> <s> there is a list of points which it may or may not include <e> <s> the government are saying i understand this point that they do not want the opprobrium of dotting every i and crossing every t <e> <s> they want someone else to do that <e> <s> if there are any problems those people will carry the can <e> <s> however the government also like the idea of saying to the fma that there are some things it can do and some that it cannot do <e>", "<cs> it is clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and for offering to satisfy my fear that matters which might not be strictly relevant could be pleaded in aid <e> <s> we are worried that the tribunal could give them some substance even though they are not strictly relevant <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the minister has not closed the door to the possibility of the fma being the licensing authority have the government closed the door to the possibility of local authorities being the licensing authority <e> <s> we come back to the belief of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that the government want a hands-off situation <e> <s> i recall that when mr colin moynihan held a big press conference in westminster hall to explain the scheme to the football administrators he told them what could and would happen if they failed to carry out their responsibilities they would lose their licences <e> <s> a ground could have its licence taken away by mr moynihan or the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> the minister makes an interesting point <e> <s> local authorities have central bodies <e> <s> if he is saying that he does not have a fetish against local government <e>", "<cs> you have an open mind <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that he said that previously <e> <s> if he is saying that he said that previously i shall read very carefully what he said <e>", "<cs> we have had this melodrama to get him to say those words <e> <s> if he is saying that the local authorities are prepared to come to him with the proposition that they shall be the licensing authority and he is prepared to listen that is all we want to know <e>", "<cs> i do not consider that i have had a victory <e> <s> at the very last moment the minister has avoided what for himself and his colleagues in another place could have been a great problem <e>", "<cs> the minister said that he would listen to the local authorities against the background that he had already ruled out that local authorities could run it <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept without cavil that we on these benches together with members from other sides of the committee have completely misunderstood and misheard what the minister said <e> <s> we shall read what he said <e> <s> if what he said was what he reiterated in the final minute i believe it is a sensible way in <e>", "<cs> handsome <e>", "<cs> the minister has responded generously to the points that i raised <e> <s> without reservation i accept what he has said <e> <s> we shall read it but it sounded eminently sensible and suitable and i am grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to say that the minister has made an offer which i cannot refuse namely that he accepts the principle that a person who becomes a member of the scheme by one means or another can ensure that his details will not be sold for commercial purposes <e> <s> i am satisfied to leave the matter to the minister <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord winstanley misheard what was said <e> <s> indeed the minister was most clear on the matter and satisfied one of my points namely that inspection of the cards shall not be sought other than inside the ground and not outside <e> <s> however the noble lord has made a valid point who in actual fact said that that is how it will operate <e> <s> i am sure that the minister is telling us that it is in the mind of the government that when the fma is established that is one of the conditions which it will lay down <e> <s> indeed i can see that <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble lord lord harris said about the police concern over the manpower implications <e> <s> the police would need further resources to police the bill <e> <s> the home office is denying county police forces the number of policemen that they require at the moment <e> <s> for instance i have a letter from the cambridgeshire county council director of administration to mr moynihan which states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for small mercies <e> <s> what the minister has said in his concluding remarks indicates that we have drawn to his attention though perhaps not originally and we have confirmed in his mind and those of his advisers that there is a lacuna in the bill in respect of that narrow point <e> <s> it is something which needs to be corrected <e> <s> we all have our definition of terms <e>", "<cs> we shall not make any more progress on this matter tonight as i said earlier <e> <s> we shall read what the minister said and take advice from those outside the chamber who will study this very carefully <e> <s> there is clearly a division of thinking and attitude which we must reflect upon <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept the ministers point <e> <s> he has been honest enough to say that there have perhaps been second thoughts that the word in the bill may not be the appropriate one <e> <s> i shall withdraw my amendment acknowledging that my word may not be the appropriate one either <e> <s> whatever the words on the face of the bill we shall be interested to see what the government intend the word to convey to the ouside world <e> <s> we hope that the term can be interpreted as allowing a provision along the lines of the amendment to which i have been speaking <e> <s> the minister has given us no promise although he has been gracious enough to say that if i withdraw my amendment he will without commitment consider what we have said and bring forward an appropriate rewording or an addition to this part of the bill at the next stage <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i respond to what the minister has said with considerable disappointment <e> <s> despite all the problems and burdens which they carry in trying to keep football alive the directors of clubs will be required once the bill becomes an act to operate in a certain way <e> <s> they may not personally carry the responsibility but as directors they are responsible if one of their servants breaks <e>", "<cs> i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> did the noble lord say sound <e>", "<cs> they are not <e>", "<cs> we have had a good debate <e> <s> when the history of the committees proceedings is looked at those who are concerned about the future of wembley can be satisfied that we have done our level best <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for using words i cannot recall having heard earlier namely that wembley is a special case that it is unique <e> <s> he talked at earlier stages about the peculiarities and the difficulties <e> <s> however if he recognises that wembley is special and unique the very least we can expect is that the solution for wembley will be special and unique too <e> <s> whether it will be acceptable to the fma to wembley or to football in general we will have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord harris that the ministers reply is wholly unacceptable <e> <s> he is inviting club directors to take upon themselves the responsibility for abrogating their responsibilities under the licence in the circumstances outlined <e> <s> let us bear in mind that the noble earl earlier told me that the punishment of imprisonment will be visited on those directors shown to be regularly and deliberately flouting the scheme <e> <s> there will be clubs regularly flouting the scheme because they are physically incapable of carrying it out between and pm for a match starting at <e> <s> the defence for directors that they have done all they can and that they have tried to comply may be accepted the first time <e> <s> however a club like manchester united which is known by many members of the committee will regularly come before a court or tribunal saying it was not me guv <e> <s> i did my best but i had to let them in <e> <s> the minister needs to take very seriously what we are saying <e>", "<cs> will the minister say a little more about the whole nexus of the designated reporting agency <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill which tells us what or who the designated reporting agency will be let alone why there is to be one <e> <s> what is the reporting agency <e> <s> is it the police <e> <s> is it the probation service <e> <s> is it the football club <e> <s> clause provides <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has knocked days down to five <e> <s> the bill initially provided for days and so at some stage days must have seemed sensible <e> <s> i can understand that subsequently the minister and his advisers felt that it should be five days <e> <s> what has caused the governments first thoughts which must have been the result of a great deal of discussion to be changed from to five <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but twice i have asked him what was the product of the consultations <e> <s> by being silent on that i think he indicates that no consultations have taken place <e>", "<cs> the ministers shakes his head and says no <e> <s> if there have been consultations i ask him for the third time what is the product of those consultations <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble earl has done his best <e> <s> i shall be charitable <e>", "<cs> what has been pointed out is that whatever the problem in understanding the words on the face of the bill we now have the interpretation of those words from the noble earl <e> <s> like the noble lord lord monson i was concerned about the possibility that there was retrospection but not only has the noble earl assured us that there is no such intention but he has pointed to a part of the bill which makes that crystal clear <e> <s> i believe that we shall have to see the words on the paper take advice from outside the committee and come back again if we are not satisfied <e> <s> however the noble earl has satisfied me as to both intention and integrity <e>", "<cs> on the basis that amendment no <e> <s> s will be carried perhaps i may be permitted to make a point in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for accepting amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in those circumstances i shall not be moving amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i share the abhorrence felt by the noble lord lord monson for the fact that punishment is apparently being visited twice upon a person who commits an offence abroad <e> <s> i tabled an amendment which i did not move which would have dealt with the point contained in clause upon which he has decided to focus <e> <s> it would have been my intention to table an amendment at the next stage of the bill to which we could both have put our names to take care of the major point <e>", "<cs> the minister referred earlier to agreements with foreign governments on these matters <e> <s> i can see the point if a european manner of dealing with offences of a like kind emerges and there is agreement which must be validated through both houses of parliament <e> <s> however we are saying that if a man commits an offence in england it will carry a certain punishment <e> <s> if a man commits an offence in a foreign country he will be dealt with under the law of that country <e> <s> he will serve the sentence <e> <s> in normal circumstances having committed a crime in another country having been convicted and sentenced and having served the sentence in that country that would be the end of the matter but the minister has said that in this case it is not the end of the matter <e> <s> that appears to be unjust <e> <s> i may have it wrong <e> <s> i may be looking at the issue differently from the minister <e> <s> we shall return to this matter at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for the care he has taken in moving the orders <e> <s> he will be aware that in another place my colleagues who substantially share the noble lords analysis of the terrible problems of northern ireland nevertheless came to the conclusion that they would not seek to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords that night has a special place in the folklore of northern ireland <e> <s> i was in another bar and i remember hearing the noise of a bomb <e> <s> i was dumbfounded and was told by the barman that it was a big un <e> <s> fifteen people were blown to smithereens <e> <s> i also remember that night because i was taken to a co-operative supermarket which had been severely damaged when what one can only describe as bandits held up the store and stole the money from the tills <e> <s> to someone from the mainland this was unbelievable but it was part of daily life of the people of northern ireland <e> <s> whenever we discuss the affairs of northern ireland we can always refer to terrible incidents <e> <s> the debate last week in another place took place after the senseless killings at a garage <e> <s> why these things happen one does not know <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take note of a survey carried out last year by the jubilee centre <e> <s> its survey of shops indicated that per cent <e> <s> were closed and of those which were open only per cent <e> <s> were acting flagrantly in violation of the law <e> <s> will the minister recognise the fact that in a law-abiding country per cent <e> <s> of the shops are abiding by the law unlike the large do-it-yourself centres which have a bad record in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh introduced a word which is not easily used either in this chamber or in another place namely patronage <e> <s> we should not baulk the issue <e> <s> we are politicians <e> <s> one of the arts of being a good politician is the manner in which one uses the patronage and privilege that one has <e> <s> i believe therefore that it is perfectly proper arid sensible for this house to spend a short time in reviewing the history of patronage used primarily by central government over the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting that the noble lord says that to be a trade unionist <e>", "<cs> my lords a body as powerful and influential as the tuc is entitled to consider how best it can demonstrate just how much it dislikes government legislation <e> <s> if it decides not to be represented that is its decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has taken two minutes to tell my noble friend that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for the care and clarity with which he has explained the order <e> <s> however he cannot possibly expect those of us on this side of the house to welcome the thrust of what he and his colleagues are doing <e> <s> i imagine that every single person who will be the subject of this order is already living a miserable life <e> <s> he is already living in circumstances and conditions at which members of your lordships house would be appalled were they to visit him and discuss matters with him <e> <s> the minister has informed the house that this is to safeguard taxpayers money <e> <s> we shall have other opportunities to consider how this government safeguard taxpayers money in other respects on other occasions <e> <s> however the government have brought forward what i consider to be a miserable measure which will do nothing to make housing available more affordable or more enjoyable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> she says that we are really concerned about practicalities and i accept that completely <e> <s> however let us consider the practicality of a family occupying rented accommodation which merits them being in receipt of the subventions of which we are speaking whereby they are occupying a room in excess of the criteria applied for the maximum that they should have <e> <s> the rent officer will say that the rent that he can charge or that he is prepared to allow for that is not which is now being claimed but shall we say <e> <s> a week <e> <s> can the noble baroness take us through the impact of that on the family <e> <s> it either finds the extra which is ridiculous or it has to find other accommodation <e> <s> that may very well satisfy the criteria of the noble baroness that another family will be able to come in but what about the family which in effect is being evicted <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the minister for sport presume that when his football bill is challenged effectively in your lordships house the appropriate ministerial response is to put the boot in further as regards english football being played abroad <e> <s> is that not really the behaviour of the football bully a fact which the bill seeks to deny <e>", "<cs> my lords if the work of the industrial training boards was supported by only a minority of employers in industry does it <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the playing field referred to is in the constituency of mrs angela rumbold the minister of state at the department of education and science <e> <s> does the minister appreciate the intolerable pressures on ilea at this time in respect of its playing fields <e> <s> does the minister also acknowledge and would he care to comment on the fact that the government have given ilea only million for the current year to maintain schools and yet the government have promised million to haberdashers askes school and million to the new ctc in southwark <e> <s> how does the minister reconcile treating ilea with its enormous problems in such a way by giving it only million to maintain schools for the children of inner london whereas it is proposed to give million to two schools for their exclusive use <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take this opportunity to say something helpful both to ilea and to the boroughs <e> <s> i believe that they share his view that sports fields should continue in use as sports fields <e> <s> however where there are intolerable economic pressures they may <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter should not delay the house too long <e> <s> we accept and support the intention of the amendments <e> <s> i pay tribute to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls for the manner in which during discussions with ministers he has pursued what he believed the house had in mind <e> <s> the government will not need reminding of the central issue <e> <s> it was whether to accept the principle that the football authorities should have the opportunity of phased introduction <e> <s> on that issue the government were defeated by a narrow majority and it caused them to think again <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do with his amendment i must ask the minister to give the house a better explanation <e> <s> at column his closing words were <e>", "<cs> i shall give way to the minister in a minute <e> <s> there was no meaning to consultation because the minister knew and we did not that the issue of whether wales should be included was never to be on the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is saying that his interpretation of the word consultation is to invite the parties affected not the noble lord who moved the amendment to consider how to implement the scheme that those assembled did not agree with that is not our interpretation <e> <s> i have references to what other parties to those discussions said <e> <s> i have here a note from mr davies who represented the south wales police <e> <s> he reported that the acpo was seriously concerned about the national membership scheme in general <e> <s> he referred to a four-page letter from the acpo which had been sent to the home secretary expressing the organisations reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords he did not hear the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to take on board directly the question of whether it is possible for the fma to put forward a scheme that excludes wales <e> <s> a great many of the ministers colleagues are hanging on in order to defeat this amendment because of the fma <e> <s> if the minister repeats what he said before he will say that there is no possibility <e> <s> i wait to hear what he has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those of us who have a deep interest in these matters will read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i know that we are dealing with the interpretation of the words exclusions and exemptions because we were trying to exclude the welsh situation from the scheme <e> <s> here we are trying to avoid the application of the entire scheme to a particular and unique situation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow that point and say to the minister that parliaments judgment is something that the government should take seriously <e> <s> all that these amendments are seeking to do is to provide an opportunity for parliament to approve or disapprove and to say whether this principle should be affirmative or negative <e> <s> for the purposes of the argument i shall assume that the government are genuine that they believe that they have a solution to the problem and that they will work out that solution in practice with a body of people whom they trust and who know football <e> <s> that body of people the fma will produce a scheme to which the secretary of state can add in which he can insert from which he can delete and which he can amend or reject <e> <s> finally a scheme will be presented to the secretary of state and the football authorities will say this is how we believe parliament wants us to exercise the authority in this bill <e> <s> the secretary of state will say yes that is the shape <e> <s> we say that before he begins to implement the proposal he should come before parliament to say not that those people have been involved in the nitty gritty or in negotiations but that all that has been done and that this is the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can confirm that this is the first occasion on which this timetable has seen the light of day <e> <s> is the minister telling the house that it is the governments

bill through <e>", "<cs> do not put the idea into their heads my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before i decide what to do with this amendment there are some points which need to be made <e> <s> in this house we have people of great authority and experience like the noble lord lord knights who brings to this house his experience as a senior policeman whom we all respect both on his record and for his judgment on these matters <e> <s> he advises the house that a term of imprisonment is not appropriate in the circumstances <e> <s> however the government have made no reference to that point <e> <s> i believe that i am entitled to draw that to the attention of those noble lords behind the minister who are looking for guidance on these matters from people with experience of them <e>", "<cs> my lords

for football spectators <e> <s> however soft words butter no parsnips <e> <s> i understand that that is a well-known phrase <e> <s> it is no good the minister and his colleagues saying that they recognise the value of spectators and supporters that they believe the hosts are entitled to be free to choose and that they hope that they will invite spectators to become involved <e> <s> i believe that the minister has been less than fair to the people whose money goes into the game of football <e> <s> indeed it is not just their money it is their partisanship in and their passion for football which makes the game of football work <e> <s> moreover without the spectator without the fan and without the organisation there would be no game <e> <s> indeed there is not a football club in the land which is not grateful for the involvement of the spectators and fans in its locality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a mood to seize the opportunity <e> <s> perhaps the minister is saying that the authorities may indicate that they would be satified with having an independent chairman <e> <s> the amendment mentions independent members as well <e> <s> can the minister also assure the house that if it is the view of the fa and the league that they would be content with some injection of independent members he would give the same reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can help the house <e> <s> if the league and the association accept the responsibility and become the fma can he give an indication of the circumstances under which they would be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that that is his one illustration <e> <s> in other words they have the right virtually in perpetuity except for that illustration <e>", "<cs> my lords so possession of the

<e> <s> i know that in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> the minister rehearsed the arguments against them <e> <s> to be fair he pointed out that we had already had a canter over this course in which the minister had argued that what he had given in the form of a concession as to the duties of the fma and the general issue of exemptions was as far as he thought he could go <e> <s> in effect that is merely to insert amendment no <e> <s> on the face of the bill <e> <s> the clarification as to accompanied children is referred to in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not arguing about the age of <e> <s> i ask how the age will be determined <e> <s> the minister appears to be saying that it will depend upon appearance <e> <s> but in that case he is all at sixes and sevens <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister going to object to my amendment which deletes the word and <e>", "<cs> my lords we want to know how you will supervise the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i apologise without reservation for my ignorance about what the minister had in mind <e> <s> i was sensitive to the fact that if we had a debate on amendment no <e> <s> and lost that debate we would lose the opportunity of debating the other issues <e> <s> the minister has said that there may be a grammatical error to be put right but that we can proceed with the other amendments <e> <s> in those circumstances although we have had no satisfaction whatsoever concerning how the ministers advisers consider how they can implement amendment no <e> <s> neither will the new football membership authority nor the individual clubs have any idea how they will interpret these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble earl say that we voted on the exclusion of women and old age pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords surely if we did not vote on the issue of old age pensioners we are perfectly entitled to vote on it tonight if we so choose <e>", "<cs> my lords those supporters may be allowed out but perhaps may not be allowed back <e> <s> they are very choosy who they let back into that country <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell us how foreign football supporters coming to

their team <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am touched by the faith that the minister has in the ability of the fma to produce to itself a satisfactory means of dealing with this problem <e> <s> although we have pointed to simple problems which the minister says are not so simple the minister says that he has faith and that the fma will come forward with a scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am touched by the ministers untouchedness <e> <s> there is nothing more to be gained <e> <s> the situation is highly unsatisfactory and as the noble lord lord harris said whenever we come across a

understanding that we seek <e> <s> in the future as i understand it this simply means that in return for a letter the school will receive a ticket of admittance representing the temporary guest-card

him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may simply say to the minister that if he genuinely wishes to take football with him this is a very good way to do something with which although the minister may not be happy with it football says it is capable of living <e> <s> i am told by the football league that out of the league clubs already have facilities for admitting old age pensioners separately <e> <s> indeed they have turnstiles which are geared to include old age pensioners and juveniles <e> <s> that is very often because the reduced prices which are charged for old age pensioners and juveniles are the same <e>", "<cs> my lords that kind of argument will cut no ice with this minister <e> <s> the fact that there is no hooliganism that individuals do not need protection and that the clubs have no record of violence does not cut any ice with this minister the minister for sport or the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made a fair offer to the house <e> <s> we are anxious that consultations and discussions are able to proceed unimpeded by any dispute about what he intends to do <e>

football identity cards <e> <s> for the real football fan i am not talking about the football hooligan who has transgressed and deserves punishment the possibility of being deprived of that lifeline

amendment on third reading which will take account of the gravamen of the matters contained in the schedule relating to the rights accorded to members under the national membership scheme <e> <s> i am not asking the minister to say that the matter will be enshrined in the bill but if i withdraw the amendment i should like to feel that on report the minister will bring forward an amendment which relates to the points i am making in this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking for some clarification from the minister first <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that the matter includes the content of the amendments i am willing to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take careful note of the point made by the noble lord lord harris that when we see the words on the marshalled list we shall have to decide whether we need to add something further on third reading <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for what i consider to be an assurance that these matters may be covered on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for teasing out the problem and to the minister for responding very fairly to a genuine point <e> <s> we are entitled to seek those assurances <e> <s> we and those outside the house who advise us in these matters will read what the minister has said <e> <s> in those circumstances i am pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall study what the minister has said to see whether it coincides with what we seek to achieve <e> <s> i accept without reservation the ministers genuine desire to make sure that individuals will have their personal details protected whether or not they are covered by the data protection act and his desire to ensure that membership of the scheme will not mean that their details are generally available <e> <s> we shall wait to read what the minister has said <e> <s> we shall take advice from others not least the national council for civil liberties which has been giving us its views on these mattters <e> <s> we may come back again to this matter at third reading <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his courtesy and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given the house figures of house building in the public and private sectors

i wish first to thank the noble lord lord mottistone for his excellent timing and for the deep care that he took in opening the debate on second reading <e> <s> he set the scene for those noble lords of whom i am one who are not as closely in touch with the issue as he is <e> <s> i hope that the minister and his colleagues fully recognise the timing of the bill and the necessity and value of it in

respect <e> <s> however does he understand that the reality on the ground is wholly contrary to what he has sought to tell the house <e> <s> will the minister not understand that most people here

the unhelpful remarks of the noble lord lord renton the minister and i are continuing the happy dialogue that had continued virtually uninterrupted on the previous stage of the bill where a substantial measure of agreement was reached <e> <s> i accept in good faith that there have been difficulties in resolving an attitude <e> <s> the minister has told us that he will not tell us exactly what he will do until discussions have taken place <e> <s> but at least if we know before the appropriate time on third reading whether what he intends to do is in our view helpful then we shall have the opportunity of returning yet again and properly to this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords again the value of this stage of the bill is not to encourage the minister to say more than he said earlier or something different <e> <s> we are not in the business of trapping him into saying things that can be waived by someone else later <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house certainly share the ministers view that this is amore sensible form of words to deal with the situation <e> <s> we are grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not talking about imprisonment for offences we are talking about deprivation of membership of the scheme for various offences <e> <s> in the schedule the relevant offences are listed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government create the criminal offences <e>

of violence <e> <s> the term threats of violence applies to four of those under paragraph b of my amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart is certainly not out of order <e> <s> he recognises that someone who uses a threat of violence to the person or to property or in any other way needs to be dealt with differently from someone who is for instance attempting to enter without a membership card <e> <s> in my view that is a less serious offence than someone who threatens somebody with violence <e> <s> if one talks about carrying alcohol on coaches or trains we believe that it is a less onerous offence than someone who is using a threat of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i carefully noted that the minister said that a term of imprisonment for the alleged crime of allowing people to contravene the terms of the licence was needed for repeated flagrant and deliberate violations <e> <s> i imagine that the people who are licence holders will be very jealous of their licence <e> <s> after all it is their livelihood it is their club and they will not be able to operate without a licence <e> <s> i acknowledge that the minister and his advisers have been very careful to spell out that in giving a list of exemptions the clubs would have to carry the responsibility for issuing whatever is issued in order for the disabled or the accompanied children etc <e> <s> to be exempt <e>

plead ignorance here <e> <s> is there a definition of the word serious in this context <e> <s> can he tell the house what constitutes disorder as opposed to serious disorder <e> <s> we have drawn attention to serious disorder because we believe that there are different levels of offences <e> <s> one must look at these in context <e> <s> it appears to me in the light of what the minister has said that there are matters which although they certainly may not be pleasant or welcome could be caught by this provision <e> <s> who determines what constitutes disorder <e> <s> is that left to the individual policeman or the individual police officer in charge of an area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may assure the minister that countries abroad will not ask that question because they do not have such a daft act on their statute books as we seek to put on our statute book <e> <s> the minister says that given the list of punishments in part i with which we disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that magistrates would be far more sensible than the minister and his advisers in this respect <e> <s> i believe that in practice given the flexibility magistrates will not use it to apply two different periods to the punishment one in regard to the deprivation of membership and the other in regard to the ability to travel abroad <e> <s> i believe that they will exercise their responsibility and make the punishment for the offence applicable to both aspects equally <e> <s> as the bill makes progress through another place i hope that the opportunity will be taken to trust the magistrates in the way that we are prepared to do <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down if he is looking for a friend in the cause that he is fighting he has one here <e> <s> he has witnessed the manner in which equally sensible amendments that i have moved have been treated by the government and he has been treated in the same way <e> <s> we have been attempting to make the bill not only more acceptable but more realistic <e> <s> that is why i did not rise to my feet <e> <s> i certainly agree with everything that he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord but i am constantly staggered at his stance in this matter <e> <s> the government state three days and we are asking for five working days <e> <s> if the minister will confirm that three days means three working days the noble lord lord renton may be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what has been said <e> <s> we are left with the interesting point that five days may mean five working days because that is the recollection of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> if the minister says that he envisages the practice of courts ringing the people involved in cases rather than putting matters in writing <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell us that by agreeing to change three to five although it is not five working days that is what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords if it means five days and the recollection of the noble lord lord renton is that in practice it means five working days we are almost there are we not <e> <s> i believe that the minister has given a concession <e> <s> if the minister starts by giving us a concession by tabling this amendment and then says that he will extend it i should be churlish not to acknowledge that and i am not churlish <e> <s> whether the interpretation is as i believe it to be or as the minister believes it to be can be sorted out later <e> <s> as the minister says this is the last amendment which i shall move this evening and i believe that that is a very good note on which to terminate this part of the proceedings <e> <s> on the basis that an amendment to the ministers amendment will be moved on third reading i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are keen to promote energy conservation why have they slashed the budget for the energy efficiency office at the department of energy <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the governments budget for will be million and for just million <e> <s> that compares with a budget of million for <e> <s> how does the drop of per cent <e> <s> in funding energy conservation and promotion square with the prime ministers claims that britain will become the most energy-efficient nation in europe by <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister now tell the house how it is possible to promote energy efficiency if the office that has been created by the department of energy to do that is having its budget slashed year after year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl cannot answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords it has taken five years for the first marine nature reserve to be established at lundy and it looks like a similar timescale for skomer <e> <s> can the minister tell us for instance the timescale for loch sween <e> <s> will it be <e> <s> for the isles of scilly will it be and for the menai straits <e> <s> in view of this casual attitude to delivering the sites what plans do the government have to speed up this very dilatory progress <e>", "<cs> disgraceful <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that research into pesticide <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> in view of the assurances given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i have to choose between upsetting the minister or the noble lord lord renton i prefer to upset the noble lord and have the minister on my side <e> <s> he has the power in this matter <e>", "<cs> i recognise a gift horse when i see one and i shall not look it in the mouth <e> <s> i believe that that is as much as i shall get because i remember parliamentary arithmetic of half an hour ago as well <e> <s> therefore in view of what the minister said which i agree is not a commitment other than a commitment to look together at the form of words along the lines of amendment no <e> <s> for which i am grateful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am deeply disappointed with both the response of the minister and with the remarks made from behind him <e> <s> i note that the noble lord lord renton considers that a body with major decisions to make which comprised members would be unwieldly and unable to agree <e> <s> i see that the cabinet numbers members i imagine that it would have some difficulty in coming to its decisions unless a certain person in the cabinet room appointed the people who sit around the table <e> <s> i believe that that happens in the cabinet room <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister and his colleagues start from the premise that they do not want the public to be involved or even have access so can an argument for that be produced <e> <s> thus they fall back on the argument that the nra is not on all fours with other bodies that are open to the public <e> <s> it is a quite astounding argument <e>", "<cs> and very well <e>", "<cs> i should like to be clear that the minister is saying that representatives of the employees will form part of the trustees and that nothing will happen to a scheme which will be of disadvantage to them <e> <s> i should like him to confirm that nothing will happen to that scheme even if one trustee objects <e> <s> perhaps on vesting day or whatever term is used the rights which a current employee enjoys will be transferred and protected by a trust deed and in future some of the employees who are affected by the scheme will be members of the board of trustees <e> <s> in that situation we should like to know that nothing can happen to the scheme if one trustee objects <e> <s> can the minister say that my rough understanding of the position is correct <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> quite fairly he used a phrase which i had not picked up when saying that while there exists in employment some of the transferred employees they will continue to have the right to protect the interests which were transferred <e>", "<cs> some noble lords are <e>", "<cs> it is a continuing disappointment to me that the minister relies upon generalities such as properly to carry out the functions <e> <s> it might satisfy the minister to think that when the director general seeks to people the committees he will make sure that there are people there who are able to carry out the functions from the point of view of the tripartite interests which he has just mentioned <e> <s> i do not doubt his intentions <e> <s> however we are seeking now to demonstrate to the people outside this place that is every consumer in the land that the government are actually writing into the bill the provision that among the people who will be on those committees there will be someone who is seen to be to use a clumsy phrase a consumer champion that is someone who is recognised as more of a consumer person than a technical person <e> <s> i realise that it will not be easy to do so <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the committee will bear in mind the concerns of those on low incomes <e> <s> in other words without any direction or guidance it must be sensitive to that impact <e> <s> but can the minister tell us that in his heart of hearts he believes that people on low incomes will be invited by the appropriate authority to serve as members <e> <s> there is a world of difference between saying that a committee peopled by the generalities that we have talked about are certain to think of the problems and having someone on the committee such as a single parent with two children of seven and nine <e> <s> i doubt i do not want to be offensive whether a single person with two children of seven and nine is likely to be considered by the director general <e> <s> i may be wrong <e> <s> i believe that that person is so important in this context that someone in that broad category of income ought to be represented <e>", "<cs> it might be in the forefront of their minds when they are thinking about it but i doubt whether they would think about it sufficiently to opt to come off the committee and allow someone who is in the forefront of their mind to opt to come onto the committee <e> <s> i am not talking about people being inhumane <e> <s> the realities that i have seen during my working life and in democratic organisations are that it is highly unlikely that people on low incomes will be invited to serve on committees of this kind <e> <s> i realise that the minister is unable to go further than he has <e> <s> we may return to these amendments at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was interesting that the minister should look at a prospective committee of against a background of three groups which would be represented and say that six or seven members may represent local authorities <e> <s> on the other hand it is not guaranteed that they will be peopled by the three equal proportions <e> <s> it could well be that in his wisdom the director general will say that in a particular area he will invite two local authority representatives or <e> <s> nothing is laid down <e> <s> the minister is applying equity in saying that if there are three centres of representation it ought to mean something like six or seven from each <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> the minister does not dispute any of the arguments which i invite the government to consider would make these amendments appropriate <e> <s> he has confidence that the director will be as perceptive as perhaps he and i to the needs of a locality and that in the light of t he then ruling circumstances in order to be helpful to himself to ensure that the job is being done properly he will act accordingly <e> <s> i am bound to say that our experience over the years is that there is no substitute for a statutory or mandatory requirement in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> the minister and i believe the government fail consistently to understand what we are driving at <e> <s> that may be our fault <e> <s> there is an option not a duty which i invite the committee to consider the plans are so well drawn so sensible and so in accord with the promises that it would be in the interests of the company to assure the public from time to time that what the government have promised will happen is happening <e> <s> i am not talking about everyone being their own accountants and auditors but about telling the public that what the government wanted the capital for and what they were spending money on was broadly what they said they would do <e> <s> if the public are not kept fully appraised of matters in that way they will not only be denied the information but they would be entitled to be suspicious that the promises that were made were not being kept <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on the whole mainly due to lack of resources and because of other priorities local authorities do not put up notices where there is danger of infection from bathing waters <e> <s> will the minister ensure that resources are available to local authorities in order for them to undertake their own monitoring of bathing water and to take steps to warn the public about beaches where appropriate <e> <s> does the minister understand that in many instances it is a question of resources and not will <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i understand they will be taken separately <e> <s> when i consulted my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey my first reaction was that the three amendments were interrelated although they deal with separate points <e> <s> i hope that the sweet reasonableness which the noble earl lord onslow apparently felt was successful the other night may also be successful as regards one two or even three of the amendments <e> <s> but i shall deal with them separately and be grateful for small mercies <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that a form of words which is not as all-embracing as those in the amendment would meet with his sympathy if not his approval <e> <s> he pointed out that the amendment does not specify the land to which it refers <e> <s> in essence it is all land which is currently in the ownership of or leased to the water authority <e> <s> before such land is disposed of or undergoes a change of use consultation should take place <e>", "<cs> i would happily settle for confirmation from the minister that the planning legislation lays down that all local authorities affected by that change will be consulted about any change of ownership or use of land in an area such as the regional park or in the land which is currently under the sovereignty of the water authorities <e> <s> that is the case for the amendment <e> <s> if that is the case and the noble baroness lady blatch whose views i respect tells me that there is no need for the amendment in those terms i shall happily withdraw my amendment <e> <s> but it aint necessarily so <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that if under the planning procedure there is a change of use all affected local authorities will automatically be consulted <e> <s> does the minister nod his head at that proposal <e>", "<cs> will the minister confirm that all local authorities whether there are five or only one affected by a change of use will be consulted under the planning procedures <e>", "<cs> that is interesting <e> <s> at local level i have come across scores of cases involving a change of use <e> <s> at one stage i was privileged to be chairman of the planning committee of the london borough of enfield <e> <s> it was our policy i am sure that it was the general policy to take the view that the people affected by a change of use should be consulted for example with regard to the demolition of a large house and the construction of eight flats or the change from residential to business use <e> <s> in the main that meant the people on either side of the house or perhaps on the other side of the road <e>", "<cs> that response can be arranged <e> <s> the noble lord suggests that the disposal of a persons house falls into the same category as the disposal of part of the heritage of this country which involves open space land and recreational use <e> <s> with great respect there is no comparison <e> <s> land which is at present owned by the people will now be sold to shareholders in a plc whose prime motive will be to make money out of it and who may then decide to sell that land to other people who believe that they can make even more money out of it <e> <s> if the minister tells me that there are people who will buy that land in order to keep it and restore it to its orginal use he knows more about the matter than i do <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the concluding words of the minister <e> <s> i have a number of illustrations here of existing arrangements none of which relates to anglia <e> <s> the committee in effect wants me to show the colour of my money or to put my money where my mouth is in respect of the fact that there are arrangements that could be disturbed <e> <s> let me give the committee the first one <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving a full explanation of how he views the future <e> <s> i certainly feel that those outside the committee can be assured that the government believe that there are arrangements whereby the best interests of anglers can be preserved in respect of what goes on the charges made and so on <e>", "<cs> the minister chose gratuitously to malign the intentions of the ramblers association and in his final words went so far as to make allusions to its determination to break the law <e> <s> the minister should reflect on what he said <e> <s> if this is related among other things to the rivington rally which is perhaps the most public manifestation of the attitude of the ramblers association to its continued free

grateful and which i shall need to read carefully <e> <s> in his final words he gave an adequate summary of what he was telling me and those outside the chamber <e> <s> he said that some of the amendments are not appropriate and others are unnecessary because they are covered by existing arrangements <e> <s> perhaps i may read to the noble earl part of a letter that was sent in january by mr lloyd of the department to mrs kemp the chairman of the thames regional recreation and conservation consultative committee <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister said that the duties will apply only to the operation land and that is how it stands <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be an adequate arrangement <e> <s> if in actual fact the ownership of the operation of land changes is the minister saying that the duties to observe the responsibilities will also change <e> <s> we do not want to find a situation in which either by a sleight of hand or anything else the law is not being complied with conservation is not being dealt with and so on <e> <s> the minister must understand that i am not trying to score points or find holes at which to work <e> <s> i genuinely want him to tell us how the provisions of the bill will ensure that there is a continuing liability to fulfil the duties by whoever is carrying out the functions on the land <e> <s> how will this be done <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister said receive assets to carry out its duties <e> <s> i say with great respect to members of the committee who are listening those words do not answer the question <e> <s> the question was how do you ensure that the duties under clause will continue to be exercised by whoever is using the land whether it is a successor owner an agent or a subsidiary company <e> <s> how will that be done <e>", "<cs> that means that whatever the core business does with its land whether it leases it or creates subsidiary companies the responsibility for carrying out the duties remains with the original owners <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> does it remain with them <e> <s> if it does not remain with them how do we ensure that it is transferred <e> <s> that is what i should like the minister to tell the committee <e>", "<cs> the minister says that i am correct but i have not put forward a proposition <e> <s> from a sitting position the noble lord lord hesketh tells me that i have <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> the core company has the assets <e> <s> i must confess my ignorance <e> <s> i do not understand what that means in this context <e> <s> was the noble lord lord trafford going to help me <e>", "<cs> this is my last contribution <e> <s> i understand the difficulty <e> <s> the hour is late <e> <s> we need to be clear <e> <s> all that i want to be understood is that at any given moment someone is responsible for ensuring that the duties laid down under the act are being exercised <e> <s> whether it is by a core company a subsidiary or someone else i want <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if my case did not disappoint the minister his response came up to my expectations <e> <s> he said that in order to avoid uncertainty uncertainty created by the bill and the governments intentions it is best that this be done quickly <e> <s> i acknowledge what the minister said about the possible blemishes and defects of the amendment and indeed about its consequences <e> <s> i am not as competent or as well served as the minister in these matters <e> <s> the noble lord lord nugent made the same case now that the ball has started to roll it is best for all concerned to carry on <e> <s> that is the argument for throwing caution to the winds <e> <s> it is not i who said that the case for water privatiation has not been handled well <e> <s> those were the words of the prime minister <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand either the noble lord lord renton or the minister downgrading the desire or the interests of parliament either to be involved in or to have oversight of or to have some opportunity of scrutinising the appointments <e> <s> i understood the noble lord lord renton when he referred to matters of this kind and said however important they may be <e> <s> i believe that they are important matters <e> <s> parliament decides <e> <s> we know how parliament decides by the size of the majority <e> <s> it is quite clear that this parliament will not decide but the principle exists of parliament wanting to be involved in the scrutiny <e> <s> i believe that scrutiny is the right word <e>", "<cs> it could be the case <e>", "<cs> the minister seeks to deride the attempts made by my noble friend lord mcintosh and those on this side of the committee to describe what we intend <e> <s> the minister and his colleague are using emotive and evocative adjectives in describing what we are going to do <e> <s> if i categorise what he has sought to do as deriding i shall not go so far as to say rubbishing the case that has been made i believe that can be sustained on a reading tomorrow of the <e>", "<cs> we still come back to the central principle namely the sense in which people will read the bill <e> <s> let us leave aside the word may and assume that there is a list of conditions <e> <s> the minister and the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls claim that some licence needs to be in the hands of the director and of the secretary of state to determine which of those conditions will and will not apply <e> <s> let us suppose that in the fullness of time which may not be very long most of the conditions that may have to apply are not applied <e> <s> a case can always be made out for a condition not being appropriate <e> <s> i sought earlier to move an amendment to provide the nra the secretary of state and everyone concerned at top level in getting the act right the means to do so before it began to bite <e>", "<cs> the national consumers council does not think much of the guaranteed standards scheme <e> <s> it is possibly better equipped than the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls or myself to study the matters and relate them to the consumer <e> <s> the government appear to be anxious to avoid laying a punishment on the companies found to be derelict in their duties <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that the minister drew to my attention a great deal more of the detail surrounding the issue than i had in mind <e> <s> i am reasonably satisfied that the phrase the minister uses constantly the underlying intention of the amendment is met by his explanation <e> <s> will he justify the -year period because years is a long time <e> <s> a great deal happens in years <e> <s> i believe that the minister used the term monitoring <e> <s> not only are the charges to be monitored but so are the accounts and the method of operation <e> <s> in other words the totality of the business is if not under constant review with a capital r being monitored carefully <e>", "<cs> a business which is stable takes years to change <e> <s> i believe that that explanation is the best we will get tonight <e> <s> i should have thought that if a business is stable those who are in charge of it would be in charge of it <e> <s> that is a phrase which goes down with the ministers as euphemisms i have known <e> <s> people who run a stable business are in control of it <e> <s> they can make changes at any moment <e> <s> an unstable business could take a long time to change because no one is in control of the elements <e>", "<cs> the minister is saying that the review could be three-yearly if the company or the director requested it <e> <s> if it could be three it could be nine <e> <s> i am trying to ensure that at least <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> can he confirm my understanding of what he said <e> <s> i understood him to suggest that already the government envisage that among the directions that will be given and the matters that will be set against the standards are the issues of water pressure interruptions to supply and foul water flooding <e> <s> i believe the minister specifically referred to those problems in the earlier part of his brief <e>", "<cs> the minister needs to do better than that <e> <s> i asked a specific question <e> <s> i believe in the earlier part of the ministers brief he specifically referred to directions in respect of water pressure interruptions to supply and foul water flooding <e> <s> i am prepared to wait a little so that assistance may be provided to the minister <e> <s> i simply want the minister to say that those three problems will form part of the monitoring process by the director general when he looks at the manner in which a company complies with the conditions that are laid down <e>", "<cs> if the minister had said that two minutes ago <e>", "<cs> no the minister said that the matter was already covered <e> <s> i remember that the minister said what he has just again referred to in his opening speech <e> <s> however i wanted that to be on the record <e>", "<cs> i shall give way to the minister in a moment <e> <s> if the minister is getting annoyed with himself we can all sit back and enjoy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister not only for giving me the information but for repeating it <e> <s> on this occasion because i listened most attentively the first time there was no need for him to repeat it but nevertheless i am grateful to him for doing so <e>", "<cs> it is remarkable that the spurs which the government feel appropriate in the realm of local government should not be considered necessary in private monopoly situations <e> <s> the minister said that they would not be necessary <e> <s> if he really believes that there will be any true competition in the provision of water to domestic or industrial users in the future then he must know more than the rest of the country <e> <s> it is a nonsense to talk in terms of protection so far as concerns these companies <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister as always for the clarity of his remarks <e> <s> but they are not much comfort for people outside <e> <s> it is not possible for me to quantify <e> <s> first the minister tells me that the government do not envisage any redundancies <e> <s> i accept that they are not planning to put people out of work <e> <s> he believes that all those who are currently employed by the water authorities will find jobs under the new aegis <e> <s> but that could be a pious hope <e> <s> if the government are true to their political beliefs he knows that one of the selling points of privatisation is the assertion that non-privatised companies are overstaffed and that there are savings to be made by making people redundant by reducing the workforce <e>", "<cs> i did not understand what the minister said <e> <s> not only did he speak far too fast but he referred to documents and matters to which i am not privy <e> <s> if the minister quoted straight from the bill i am as entitled as anyone to have that in my hand and to look at it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord trafford because he may well have said substantially what the minister said but he did so in a kinder tone and light <e> <s> i accept the premises which the noble lord makes <e> <s> on the basis that a company wishes to continue and enjoy the services of its employees no less favourably than previously of course good management will try to sort it out <e>", "<cs> with agreement and approval i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanations <e> <s> i shall study what he has said with care and if i consider that i need to come back at a later stage i reserve the right so to do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i am grateful to the noble baroness lady blatch not only for promoting the bill in this house but also for her lucid explanation of the problems that it seeks to solve and her readiness in understanding its very limited nature <e> <s> from my experience in another place it would be the height of folly and an exercise in futility if we in this house in considering the bill sought what might euphemistically be termed as improvements to it <e> <s> for one reason or another that would provide some people with an opportunity to use the bill not necessarily for our purposes but in order to delay and frustrate legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord has said so far <e> <s> he is correct when he says that there needs to be broad agreement <e> <s> i am told that the interests within the forum have resolved their differences the differences between the ramblers the open spaces society and the countryside commission <e> <s> can the minister confirm that there is now no impediment to bringing forward the bill <e> <s> if there is no opposition within the forum can we anticipate an early presentation of a government measure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord ought to be quite clear <e> <s> we are dealing with the forum and within the forum there is no dispute <e> <s> he is telling us that a body the moorlands association which is outside the forum is having its voice weighed and taken into account <e> <s> that may be perfectly proper but the minister should recognise that the voices to be heard are the forum voices <e> <s> they are now as one <e> <s> to that extent there should be no impediment to progress <e>", "<cs> to be or not to be <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we certainly give a warm welcome to the intention of the bill <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the bill will not suffer the fate that overtook it in another place on third reading <e> <s> the noble earl spoke in terms of the progress of the bill at third reading <e> <s> i know that mr andrew hunter stood up at and sat down at <e> <s> that may be progress but i believe that some delaying tactics were employed <e> <s> unfortunately the bill was set down in the agenda at a place where it was used for quite legitimate parliamentary purposes and we have an extraordinary debate in the parliamentary record on the very modest bill before us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wish to say that i acknowledge and appreciate without question his belief that no further manpower will be required <e> <s> however i gave two illustrations they were the estimate of the numbers required for the crown prosecution service and the numbers given last night for the requirement of the director general of electricity supply <e> <s> i am well aware of what needs to be said in respect of a private members bill in order that it be accepted as such without financial consequences <e> <s> i heard what the minister said but i hope that local authorities believe that the provisions can be accommodated <e> <s> however the evidence clearly shows that environmental health officers are at present under enormous stress and strain and are in short supply <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the minister has given a very full reply <e> <s> however at the outset i must tell him that it does not satisfy me <e> <s> he constantly talks about the totality of these amendments driving a wedge between the customer services committees and the director and between the customer services committees and the companies <e> <s> frankly i am appalled by the idea that the ambition of a consumer committee to be more aggressive more visible more busy and perhaps to make itself more of a nuisance is the <e>", "<cs> the fact that the minister and the government are only replicating provisions in previous bills is no justification for putting them in this bill <e> <s> the minister must tell us a lot more about the kind of entry which is held by the director to be against the commercial interest of an applicant and which therefore should be excluded <e> <s> that seems to be an extraordinary matter <e> <s> the fact that that is in gas legislation and other measures is no justification here <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the minister and i do not dispute for a <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord renton is inviting me to save myself from my own logic i am certainly willing to reflect on the issue <e> <s> however can the minister answer the point that i raised <e> <s> the bill provides that if a water undertaker fails to meet a prescribed standard it shall pay such amount as may be prescribed <e> <s> can the minister inform us what kind of matters would be included and in what amount <e> <s> are we talking of for instance or <e> <s> is there a scale <e> <s> i should like to know more about what the words on the face of the bill mean <e>", "<cs> the figure is <e> <s> the idea of such amount being prescribed means that it can be changed by order <e> <s> the for instance could become or <e> <s> i think that the minister must agree that is a nominal sum <e> <s> it is not a derisory sum <e> <s> however in the context can the minister tell us a little more about what the compensation would cover <e> <s> what is worthy of just compensation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has refreshed our memory not that he has given any new information <e> <s> i can recall having heard that information <e> <s> i am saying that as a consequence of any of those derelictions the cost to the consumer can be measured not just as but in terms of hundreds of pounds <e> <s> as a consequence of delay or of waiting for someone to call one may give up a days work or lose a days pay and so on <e> <s> the minister is telling us that this is a global basic minimum figure of i say that it is a gimmick and part of the sales package that the public is being asked to buy <e> <s> i do not deny what the minister has said <e> <s> his colleagues behind him agree <e> <s> this has not happened before <e> <s> it is a new element in the way in which the consumer will get some redress <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i understood as he did that if there are minor and major matters these are minor <e> <s> again i am satisfied that the director who will be closely watching such things will not lay himself open to a charge that there are matters that would allow an undertaker to escape great responsibilities <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what the minister has said and i may return to the matter later but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister looks at the possibility of a review of the film industry will he bear in mind that the employees in the industry can make a valuable contribution through their experience and their background <e> <s> does he not realise that their livelihood is at stake <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord to take on board a further aspect of this matter <e> <s> clause provides that <e>", "<cs> a wise thing <e>", "<cs> the minister has been more than fair to the committee and has in fact been generous <e> <s> i am trying to find a word which will make the minister smile instead of grimace <e> <s> he has given the committee as much information as he can all of which goes a long way along the lines of the amendment that we have moved <e> <s> it is quite clear that the minister and his colleagues have become more sensitive in these matters than we had hitherto thought they were hence the purpose of the amendments <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies she will of course deal with the amendment as she sees fit is the minister telling the committee not only that there is no need for this provision but that if it were written on the face of the bill it would be detrimental to the interests of water consumers <e> <s> is he saying that to give effect to this new clause would cause delay and would be vexatious <e>", "<cs> it is not a matter of great moment <e> <s> at this stage in the bill we are probing what will happen in certain circumstances <e> <s> can the minister say a little more about whether the circumstances i have outlined could occur only with private water supplies <e> <s> surely in future they will all be private water supplies <e> <s> none will be municipally owned nationalised or publicly owned <e> <s> so can the minister tell us more <e> <s> the minister pleads that the costs have been incurred because an alternative source of supply has been required <e> <s> surely we must not make too heavy weather about the desire of a local authority or any public body trying to insist that there shall be a continuous supply of water for consumption either by the domestic or the non-domestic user <e> <s> if he could say something the minister would be helping the committee <e>", "<cs> well well well <e> <s> that is the best the committee will get tonight and that is not very good <e> <s> in view of the explanation that the minister has given to the committee i shall read what he has said take some advice and possibly return to the subject again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady white has rendered the committee a service by reminding us of the special nature of clause <e> <s> its opening words state <e>", "<cs> the minister believes that i will accept that the cost to a local authority which this clause lays down can be dealt with by saying that where a local authority requests or demands samples of water in order to see whether there is compliance with standards the costs of <e>", "<cs> clause states <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister has gone as far as he can <e> <s> i am certain that there will be local authorities outside and local authority associations which will view with dismay that the only way in which a local authority will be able to recover the cost of complying with this clause is by recovering it from such sources as the undertakers <e> <s> i can envisage that before any samples are undertaken a local authority may have two or three people or or worth of human resources who will run the department <e> <s> there is therefore that cost as well as the physical cost of undertaking the monitoring which will be inordinate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put his own words to the test because he has tabled page after page of amendments and that is his method of obtaining answers <e> <s> it is not ours <e> <s> i am not prepared to say that he is wrong but i am prepared to say that it is another way of doing it <e> <s> if the noble lord is inviting us to table a further amendments to the that we have already tabled we shall certainly consider it <e> <s> there are different ways of dealing with different situations <e> <s> the minister has done his best but his replies are certainly not acceptable to me or i believe to those outside the committee <e> <s> however he has done his best and we leave it at that <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with what the minister has said <e> <s> as he indicated the arguments that i have deployed have been rehearsed before <e> <s> with no disrespect to him the response is a matter of record too <e> <s> the ministers argument rests on two points an abhorrence of a restriction of trade and a belief in self-regulation <e> <s> self-regulation is another phrase for allowing either a body or individuals not to be regulated <e> <s> there is little evidence that when one leaves a body to self-regulation it experiences either the discipline or the penalties and consequences of it <e> <s> there needs to be a spur to action by the government <e>", "<cs> i shall need to consult my lawyer first perhaps i may have to see a doctor too <e> <s> the last thing that i should want to say <e>", "<cs> the noble lord chooses to make the matter farcical but the minister and i are in a majority over his view in that we take this matter very seriously <e> <s> the minister has deployed the argument that the route that i have suggested namely registration which would imply some form of discipline within the register is not acceptable <e> <s> i do not refer to self-regulation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not disappoint me <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> this is another bite at the same cherry <e> <s> we still hold the view that there is no challenge to the ultimate responsibility and superiority of decision-making of the secretary of state in these matters <e> <s> we simply believe that the secretary of state cannot possibly be technically as competent as the director <e> <s> i hope that the director will be a person who will demonstrate not only that he understands the water industry but that he has a feel for the thousand and one things that are required to make a manager into a good manager <e> <s> the secretary of state is primarily a politician and after serving in one department he may very well serve a stint in another and so on <e> <s> he cannot possibly be as closely in touch with the water industry as is the director <e>", "<cs> if it is the wish of the committee i shall proceed as quickly as possible <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord has said but amendment no <e> <s> g seeks to involve the views of local authorities earlier rather than later in the regulation-making processes <e>", "<cs> one cannot have fairer than that <e> <s> in effect in this instance we are being asked to do what is already being done at the present moment <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the minister has said and have consultations outside to see whether this is satisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as regards aquatic sports i remember reading my brief and the prevalence of the disease in canoeists was drawn to my attention <e> <s> of course in pursuing their sport they have in the main their mouth nose and eyes exposed to river water <e> <s> if that becomes polluted contaminated poisoned by urine they are at greater risk <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the minister has gone some way in understanding the case <e> <s> we are talking in terms of circumstances that we believe will arise although they may not do so <e> <s> to that extent it would be churlish not to accept what the minister has said which is that the problem is perceived it is doubted whether anything needs to be written on the face of the bill and there are provisions within the bill whereby special circumstances can be taken into account <e>", "<cs> the evidence is the advice that i have received from the local authority associations <e> <s> that may not be acceptable to the noble lord <e> <s> i was careful not to say that i have quantifiable evidence <e> <s> however the associations tell me that more chemicals are available and are now used in industry <e> <s> they must be transported on our roads and inevitably because of the road conditions accidents occur <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i confess that perhaps i started this sharpening of the debate <e> <s> i offer no apology <e> <s> the weapons at the hands of the opposition are very limited indeed <e> <s> at the moment we are not discussing what a future labour government will do we are discussing what it is that this government intend to do on the face of this bill <e> <s> we are looking for ways of setting out our stall reaffirming or reminding the committee what our policy is and why and how it has changed <e> <s> at the moment we are concerned to see how by amendment substitution addition or insertion words can be brought into the bill <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the water industry is now leaving public control and is going into private control <e> <s> that is happening under this bill <e> <s> it will be sold off and will be the province of the private investor <e> <s> i am saying that a labour government will take steps to return it to a form of public control <e>", "<cs> if half an answer is not sufficient and the minister wants to quote my honourable friend in another place whose views i respect he is entitled to do that <e> <s> i stand by what i said which does not contradict what my honourable friend said in another place <e>", "<cs> i believe that all of this is so much water under the bridge <e> <s> i think that we would all benefit and profit by reading not only what we have said but also the policy review <e> <s> i say that because if you want to see the future as it will be then it is written in that document <e> <s> it would certainly benefit <e>", "<cs> well i can only repeat what my noble friend said <e> <s> it is obvious that what a future labour government intend to do is a matter of great moment to the outgoing government who sit on the benches opposite <e> <s> as i have already said it is the job of an opposition to seek to expose points which arouse intense dislike <e>", "<cs> well frighten them off if you will <e> <s> in fact frighten is an even better word and i wish that i had thought of it myself <e> <s> we intend to frighten off future investors who are being induced to invest in the water industry by means of what the government have done <e> <s> they have resisted time after time the proposal to have laid upon the water industry what we believe to be perfectly legitimate protections both for the consumer and for the nation <e> <s> that has all been done for a purpose the purpose is to encourage the saleability of the industry <e>", "<cs> surely it is a simple question of whether we are talking about million or possibly million <e> <s> in other words we may have got the multiplication by wrong <e> <s> but is it the basic figure or is that figure capable of being multiplied <e>", "<cs> so is the minister confirming that it could be billion if in fact there were groups <e> <s> could he confirm that <e>", "<cs> we shall read very carefully what the minister has said when we look <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that there is no need for the amendment not only because it is not as comprehensive as it should be but also because even if it were more comprehensive the matter is already taken care of in the bill <e> <s> we say here that when the water quality objectives for the purposes of subsection are created the secretary of state should <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am always grateful for such acknowledgment <e> <s> i know that the minister is invariably right on questions of facts from the ministry <e> <s> however he has certainly resolved a puzzle in my mind <e>", "<cs> the noble earl not for the first time is in a daze <e> <s> of course i am very grateful to him for almost word for word reading out that part of my brief which i decided i had not time to read <e> <s> he certainly did not have my brief but the facts that he has are incontrovertible <e> <s> i understand as does the minister that this is an attempt by local authorities to use the bill to raise a point that concerns them very deeply <e> <s> i shall certainly not take any action on this clause today <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will appreciate that i attended all the debates and stayed until the small hours <e> <s> i still bear the scars <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him to deal with the question in this way which is surely directed towards the possibility of varying the tariffs in certain circumstances <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him that in our debates earlier this week he acknowledged that within the documentation and the model rules there will be scope for variation in tariffs <e> <s> can he say something about the freedom and flexibility of the new plcs in the light of their costs and circumstances <e> <s> what scope do they have for deciding separately and disparately according to their circumstances that they will vary the cost so that supplies of water laid on for the domestic user will be cheaper rather than dearer than those for other users <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for indicating that the members of the board have been named <e> <s> unfortunately i have missed the appointments <e> <s> can the noble earl tell us whether there are men or a mixture of men and women <e> <s> i do not doubt their integrity or their ability to do the job for which they have been appointed but it would be helpful to me later to study their backgrounds <e> <s> clearly there will be a biographical line or two about all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully and tried to pick holes in what the minister said <e> <s> but when he came to the name of fish representing water interests i gave up <e> <s> obviously sir hugh fish has a great contribution to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton who has taken great care in pointing out the conflict or dilemma between my new clause after clause and leaving clause in the bill <e> <s> he drew attention to those parts of the existing clause which if left in the bill would be substantial additions to the new clause <e> <s> he referred to the question of payment which we certainly accept is a proper part of the bill and part of the nexus of managing these affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed at what the minister has said <e> <s> he rests his case on the fact that what we have said is not new and that it is standard practice besides being normal <e> <s> i wonder when the minister and others will feel that it is proper to break away from precedent <e> <s> surely that is done after having listened to the arguments <e> <s> if the arguments have failed that is one aspect but the minister substantially rested his arguments on the questions of precedent custom and practice <e> <s> the minister certainly has not satisfied me <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say sticky fingers but i shall not go to the extremities <e> <s> i believe the case has been made in that the government have been invited to make a small relaxation from custom and practice but they have decided not to do so <e> <s> i intend to invite the house to express a view <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister for having caused a slight hiatus <e> <s> i shall check my correspondence and have discussions with those outside the house who have sought to give me advice on the matter <e> <s> we are talking about the trust deed and the protection that the trust deed will contain <e> <s> does the minister know of any unease among the trade unions about the arrangements that have been made <e> <s> i am expressing unease i have put down amendments at the behest of trade union members <e> <s> it is a proper thing to do <e> <s> i am asking the minister whether this unease has manifested itself in discussion with his officials <e>", "<cs> my lords that is more than a fair offer and i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment and it may be that i shall wish to return to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> however the offer made by the minister that he is willing either to listen to me or read what i may put in a letter in order to clarify any remaining doubt which could be removed to obviate cluttering up the programme at the next stage is one which i shall certainly take up <e> <s> in the circumstances therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my intention to withdraw the amendment but listening to the minister i must say that it all sounds grand clear and precise a body is required to be able to take a clear overall view <e> <s> in this amendment as in many others we are not doubting the governments intentions or integrity with words but the interpretation which could be placed upon them <e> <s> however the amendment has provided the minister with a further opportunity to defend his corner in respect of the intentions of the bill and the limited powers that this subsection which we were seeking to remove provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for saying that he will be able to elaborate on the thoughts that i have expressed when he examines what should be laid <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the best offer that i shall get tonight <e> <s> i realise that the hour is late <e> <s> i am grateful for small mercies and for the ministers words <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the purport of what i have suggested which is the automatic right is already covered in some other way under the guarantee scheme <e> <s> i am always willing to acknowledge that he and his advisers can see more in the words on paper than we see and i say that in no cavalier fashion <e> <s> i am always grateful to have my attention drawn to the fact that what i believe i want is not necessary <e> <s> is the minister telling me that what i want in this amendment is not necessary because it is achieved in some other way by another method <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for taking the necessary steps <e> <s> the fact that i might be trying to take two at once could mean that i come a cropper <e> <s> i do not believe that that would be an elegant posture in which to conclude todays proceedings at this time of night <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the minister has listened very carefully to my arguments because they were his arguments on the previous occasion <e> <s> now that i have used them he has three objections to them <e> <s> i suppose that if at third reading i were to try to meet the points which he has made this time he would find two or three more objections to the points which i have tried to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister can see the case for an exemption in respect of the supply of water to factories which is a public service <e> <s> a distinction is made with regard to factory owners so do not let us argue that there are no distinctions <e> <s> the minister makes a distinction for which he makes a case and everyone else is lumped in <e> <s> we are certainly mindful of the change in the circumstances of local authorities <e> <s> fire services are maintained by the public <e> <s> they are paid for by the public substantially by the central exchequer the taxpayers but they are also funded by the local people <e> <s> i can envisage as i know the minister can envisage many an area where the additional burden of providing the fire hydrants will turn out to be punitive for the existing payers <e> <s> i believe that the developers the undertakers are equally able to pass on the cost without it having to be borne by the public <e> <s> i do not think that the minister has given a satisfactory answer and i therefore intend to test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister because we are not apart on the central issue <e> <s> that is to oblige water undertakers to make available to their consumers information about the quality of the water <e> <s> however the minister said that by regulation he would oblige water undertakers to give information on the demand about where consumers can obtain the details but not the actual details <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i think that he has gone as far as he can <e> <s> i do not accept that the information will be in such detail that it cannot be included in the demand <e> <s> the government did not hesitate in forcing local authorities to give additional information in the past <e> <s> i believe that the customer is only going to be told where he can obtain the information <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge and understanding of the matter i accept entirely what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> she is aware that there are those outside the house who take a great interest int his matter who are very keen that nothing more than the minimum should be taken at this stage pending the major bill <e> <s> the minister will recall that in a sense the provision was <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down the arguments until about six months ago were that there was if not dispute doubt as to what should be included in the bill <e> <s> refreshing my memory on my feet my understanding is that the major objections to the thrust of the new legislation were clarified <e> <s> that is therefore out of the way and the government are simply saying that it is now a question of the management of parliamentary time <e> <s> there is no issue of substance but merely a question of finding time <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be an eminently sensible amendment <e> <s> anything that can be seen by local people to be giving them an entre into what will be a radically changed situation is to be welcomed <e> <s> i take note of what the minister and his colleages have said that there will be little change except improvement <e> <s> nevertheless there will be a great deal of apprehension and i believe that this amendment will go a long way to help to ease that apprehension out of the minds of a great many water users <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he say more about the powers of customer service committees before matters are passed higher up the chain to the director or to the secretary of state <e> <s> local people may persistently put forward evidence on which no action is taken <e> <s> the minister says that the director will be one stage removed from the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord should be encouraging the local committees to be vigilant and to use their opportunities to put evidence before those who are above them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that provides me with the reassurance i seek <e> <s> i accept that the minister believes what he has said should satisfy the point i am making <e> <s> is the minister saying that in the case of pipes which are the responsibility of the consumer any hurt which is suffered as a result of consuming water which went through those pipes where contamination was found will not result in a charge on the consumer <e> <s> however if the contamination occurs in pipes which are not the responsibility of the consumer is the minister saying that the undertaker will have to bear any costs that arise from that situation <e> <s> i hope the minister can state that that is the case as i cannot repeat it myself <e> <s> if he can confirm that that is the general gist of what he was saying i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are both agreed that we shall read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the answer is in the pipeline <e> <s> i shall just have to wait until i examine the pipe <e> <s> i shall pipe down and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister understand that there are situations where industrialists could be assisted more than it appears they are at present in order to ensure that the effluent which they discharge is not likely to cause the problems that the noble earl lord shannon is addressing <e> <s> the other day i attended a conference of abattoir owners <e> <s> they discharge effluent which is perhaps at times of a particularly obnoxious nature <e> <s> those abattoir owners form an essential and crucial sector of the community <e> <s> they are particularly concerned about their responsibilities as they play a part in the food chain <e> <s> their concern is that grants are made available by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food for a range of things <e> <s> they drew my attention to the grants which are available to farmers from maff for storage tanks anaerobic digesters treatment plants manure stores disposable facilities safety fencing and other matters <e> <s> i told the abattoir owners that i might have an opportunity to raise legitimately such concerns <e> <s> that opportunity has now arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may say that i spoke for a little longer than i might have done in order that his staff in the box could supply the magic words <e> <s> the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords even more importantly will the minister undertake not only to write to me but also to consult maff to see whether there is any possibility of assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the minister but i had to wait a long time before i could detect the premises upon which he rested his case <e> <s> there were two matters which i raised <e> <s> first there is the horrendous state of the sewers of the nation <e> <s> i cast no aspersions on who is responsible for it nonetheless they are in a horrendous state <e> <s> i also drew the attention of the minister to the very disturbing situation with regard to rodent infestation <e> <s> i waited to hear whether the minister was satisfied that those two matters would be dealt with vigorously and urgently in what is a situation of emergency <e> <s> the picture that i painted indeed shows an emergency situation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps members of the authority ought to visit this chamber more often to see the holes that the minister digs for himself <e> <s> if the minister is telling me that the north west water authority informs him that there is a shortage of holes into which the ministerial car can go i think that that is what he said then it flies in the face of the evidence that i have <e> <s> it may have been a flippant remark <e> <s> however perhaps i may inform whoever made it to the minister that i have the evidence which i shall send to him <e> <s> in the centre of manchester buses have collapsed into large holes that was four or five years ago <e> <s> perhaps the authority has solved the problem as the minister has implied <e> <s> however the evidence that i have received from the ama this week is that its survey indicates that per cent <e> <s> of the aim has been achieved <e> <s> one may have to be very careful where one looks for a hole in manchester <e> <s> i am told that there are still some there <e>", "<cs> my lords the act provides a right of appeal in the event of a proposed termination <e> <s> can the minister explain why that provision is not considered appropriate to be included in this bill <e> <s> the noble lord put this against the two imperatives which he set out at the beginning of his short speech <e> <s> surely in common justice never mind business or financial imperatives an authority which has satisfactorily undertaken a function is at least entitled to a period of grace when it is told that somebody else will undertake it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is saying that for the secretary of state to have drawn to his attention by an appeal the breaking of an arrangement which in the eyes of the authority might be damaging to the public and to the consumer will shackle the new plcs <e> <s> that is a strange concept <e> <s> we do not envisage the new privatised companies not being able to do what they want <e> <s> however in equity and justice local authorities should be able to draw attention to the breaking of an arrangement so that the secretary of state is able to take a view <e> <s> he may well decide that he does not want to be involved <e> <s> in that case should there be a tragedy under the new arrangements he will have washed his hands of it before it happens <e> <s> however there could be circumstances in which the secretary of state will ask the plc to reflect on what it wants to do <e> <s> can the minister say anything more helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said enough <e> <s> water and sewerage are unique <e> <s> public health is unique <e> <s> the noble lord indicated that the period of grace could be used by a plc to lay down what it was prepared to pay which could be far less than would be economical <e> <s> it could then say that if the authority was not prepared to provide a service whatever that might mean and however many corners might have to be cut it would voluntarily put itself outside the tendering arrangement <e> <s> the minister has said sufficient to indicate the genesis of this matter which is that the services will be provided as cheaply as possible and that on the margin public health will be at risk <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the minister will rest his case on the fact that he has taken the best available advice <e> <s> he will be advised to do things in a certain way <e> <s> i simply draw to his attention the fact that the advice which the government sought in the case of amersham the british airports authority british aerospace and so on resulted in the taxpayer being denied more than billion which went into the pockets of investors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls lips never moved that is brilliant <e>", "<cs> my lords this all sounds wonderful and if that is so i wonder why the employees in the industry are asking those of us on this side of the house to put forward this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will remember that at about in the morning when these matters were debated before the short recess i had the opportunity of moving an amendment of similar local content and interest <e> <s> my interest was the new river in hertfordshire which is well known to the minister <e> <s> it was a matter which he said was of such local interest that it would not be proper to deal with it in a bill of this nature <e> <s> i may be presaging the remarks of the minister who will reply on this subject <e> <s> he nods his head in which case it may be end of story <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that we on this side of the house wish to acknowledge the splendid work that he has achieved in seeking and imposing the ban on the import of ivory into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at once that the debate has been conducted in good spirit <e> <s> passionate views have been presented on both sides of the argument about the bill <e> <s> there has been no acrimony in any of the speeches because even those who have spoken with passion have at the same time sought to understand the view of those on the other side of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords that helpful intervention and the more helpful answer from the minister tells it all <e> <s> by declining to regret the progress we are being invited to discuss the nature of the bill overladden with the horror of hillsborough and perhaps without the benefit of lord justice taylors report <e> <s> i remind the noble lord lord mellish who is a friend that mr colin moynihan said that it is inconceivable that lord justice taylor will say that identity cards are not relevant <e> <s> how on earth can the minister say that it is inconceivable <e> <s> he has not heard the evidence <e> <s> he does not know the working <e> <s> as i reminded the house earlier the secretary of state mr ridley has said that lord justice taylor is an adviser and that he will advise the government <e> <s> he was then magnanimous enough to say that the government will listen to what he has to say <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> he did not say that if lord justice taylor came out with incontrovertible evidence the scheme should not be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords ministerial friend mr moynihan was sufficiently moved to say that he felt it inconceivable that this aspect would not be in the report <e> <s> we also have the words of mr ridley who said that the government would listen to what mr justice taylor had to say <e> <s> i accept what the minister is saying now that they will listen carefully to what is being said <e> <s> however what the minister has offered the house is that when the fma has produced a scheme and when the scheme has taken into account the governments views they having studied the report of lord justice taylor whose views they may or may not accept the house will then be invited on one motion without an opportunity for amendment in two debates of a general character to approve an action by the government <e> <s> that is what we are being invited to do in substitution for proper scrutiny by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene in the hope that the minister will deal with the point about oral hearings being part of the procedure where appropriate <e> <s> who will decide what is appropriate <e> <s> i am asking the noble lord lord harris whether he feels that the minister could help the house by dealing with that particular point <e> <s> i could not understand what the noble and learned lord tried to say from a sedentary position <e> <s> if the minister can tell us what is meant by appropriate and whether the accused person has the right to opt for an oral hearing i believe that that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite right that at earlier stages of the bill this was a matter of some concern <e> <s> i believe that he has gone some way with his ministerial colleagues to take our point <e> <s> however perhaps he will deal with the possibly tangential aspects of illness convenience and such other circumstances <e> <s> if there are problems of a person being able to keep to the five days will there be a procedure whereby that appeal request or excuse can be put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer about the medical side of the matter <e> <s> i shall not labour the point <e> <s> there could be other circumstances that make it impossible for the person to comply with that requirement <e> <s> i believe that the spirit of the ministers remarks is perfectly sensible and reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last opportunity for those who have followed the matter closely to say a few words <e> <s> very often those words are to wish the bill well and to express the hope that it has a successful passage through another place <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will understand that in view of the debate i am not in a position to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate the care and the diligence the minister has shown in doing his homework <e> <s> he will feel as we do that the people of northern ireland are entitled to be reminded of the manner in which the government care for the various matters that need to be dealt with <e> <s> we have a rundown of expenditure for northern ireland <e> <s> it is not a complete balance sheet because there is income in the form of taxes receipts and revenues to be taken into account <e> <s> however in this order we are dealing with expenditure of billions of pounds <e> <s> the minister was right to take minutes of the important time of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no need to apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin where the minister left off <e> <s> we are satisfied that the minister and his colleagues have carefully considered what he said because i know that he wants to satisfy interested bodies that they will be fully consulted <e> <s> he can take it from me that the last thing that we want to do is to allow the secretary of state to have a greater say in more matters than he already has <e> <s> we do not lightly make the secretary of state a referee in this or any other matters and referee is not a reference to a bill that is being debated in another place at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i only intend to take a minute or two of your lordships time <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord norrie has put forward an acceptable case most persuasively <e> <s> what are we faced with <e> <s> in previous debates the minister talked about bureaucratic nightmares which of course are the device and the last refuge of <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister rests his argument on the fact that the ncc will be consulted <e> <s> can the minister tell the house what are the nccs powers as regards consultation in these matters <e> <s> how long do they have to respond <e> <s> if consultation is to be meaningful there must be an opportunity for the ncc to consider whether it is competent to respond or whether it needs the views of others <e> <s> can the minister help us <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the ministers difficulty in responding to that point <e> <s> but the minister will understand that he is asking the house and the country to accept that the mere process of consultation with the ncc will be sufficient to satisfy anyone who is concerned <e> <s> the ncc itself may wish to have time for consultation <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister is now in a better position to give such an indication <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is very wise <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an indication of the interest that members on the labour benches take in these matters that we feel it right and proper to provide two speakers <e> <s> quite frankly i could not elaborate very helpfully on the remarks of my noble friend lord prys-davies who i believe gave a very sober assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the figures given by my noble friend lord dean of beswick are correct <e> <s> rents for property in london are in the region of to a week <e> <s> bearing in mind that the question is about how the governments action last year will help the homeless can the minister tell us how the homeless are expected to find rents of a week <e> <s> will he tell us a little more about how he intends to monitor the effects of last years legislation <e> <s> it is one thing to say that they intend to free the market it is another to produce figures which convince the homeless that they are being well looked after by the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to help the noble lord lord orr-ewing by giving the statistics for the production of nato forces submarines over the same period <e> <s> does the minister not agree with me that it is more important to look towards verified negotiated reductions of forces and to welcome positive moves both by president bush at the nato summit and by president gorbachev rather than entering into arguments about the rate at which soviet submarines and missiles are being built <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house certainly appreciate understand and approve what the minister has brought before us today <e> <s> both my noble friend lord prys-davies and i have been present on previous occasions when the whole anxious future for shorts which concerns the future of the people not just of belfast but of all northern ireland was the subject of great concern on the part of the minister and his ministerial colleagues <e> <s> i think he understands that we also share his anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for the care he took in doing justice to the orders <e> <s> i know that earlier in the evening he would have genuinely enjoyed a debate on the matters before us <e> <s> however because of the circumscription on our time tonight he and i will have to forgo some of that <e> <s> nevertheless we have responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i understand what the minister said namely that it is not a dispute in that there is an argument as to who owns the land or what should happen to it but rather confusion caused by the creation of succeeding authorities over the land <e> <s> i hope that that is a fair interpretation of what the minister said and on that basis i do not ask him to rise to his feet again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkin of roding persists in resting his argument on the integrity and professionalism of civil servants both local and national <e> <s> i believe that he has sought to cast a slur which is offensive to the overwhelming majority of those men and women who are proud to call themselves professionals in the service of both local and national government <e> <s> there may be individuals who do not act as the noble lord would wish but on the basis of his evidence and our evidence that this is not wholly a one-party issue illustrations can be seen of maladministration by political parties everywhere <e> <s> yet when one listens to the case put by members opposite it is always a labour left-wing inspired issue <e> <s> however if we are to assume that it is not i withdraw any inference that i drew from the imputations made by the noble lord lord jenkin we must have names and instances <e>", "<cs> as always i am grateful to the minister who has taken great care to be clear in what he says <e> <s> he may well be right in the light of events in his view that one needs or years after an understood ethos has been accepted and has been broken or is breaking down to reflect upon whether one can do it better in the future <e> <s> the noble lord rests his case upon the change of a council which may well have been operating its interpretation of a code of practice in one way and then when the opposition comes into power decides to interpret the code of practice in another way <e> <s> the same of course applies with a change of government <e>", "<cs> the minister has been helpful in his reply <e> <s> i do not think that there is a great deal of difference between the noble lord lord jenkin and noble lords on this side <e> <s> he said more than once that what we needed were clear statutory guidelines <e> <s> i asked for a clear voluntary code of practice <e> <s> however that may be as far as possible we want there to be no dubiety about codifying those activities which are acceptable and those which are not <e> <s> we argue that this should be conceived and brought together not merely by the secretary of state but by other people <e>", "<cs> i am sure that those outside the committee will be able to read what the minister has said as helpfully and usefully as we in the chamber have heard it <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> remembrance <e>", "<cs> the minister has been enormously helpful <e> <s> he gave the illustration of an officer joining an organisation which was campaigning on an issue <e> <s> if a political party also decided to join that organisation <e>", "<cs> again the minister has been helpful <e> <s> he says that it is all right if what is <e>", "<cs> in which case i shall save the time of the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness help me immediately <e> <s> the purport of her amendment is to move within the area of proscription two categories of people who are currently excluded heads and deputy heads <e> <s> however other teachers are not touched <e> <s> i see the noble baroness nods her head <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that explanation <e> <s> i believe that her case is outrageous <e> <s> she has made a vicious underhand attack on a group of public servants who do not deserve the apparent good will of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i must say that i am grateful to have the opportunity to accept her assurance that her motives were entirely pure <e> <s> although i had the impression that she was attacking the integrity of teachers i am pleased to hear that that was not part of her argument <e> <s> i completely accept what she says <e>", "<cs> the minister has taken the committee through the inconsistencies and what in my view are the stupidities of the application of the bill <e> <s> there are some individuals who work in a school namely the teachers and others who are doing important jobs <e> <s> they are not only teaching they are also having face to face discussions with parents and in many other ways doing important work <e> <s> and they are able to carry on their political activity should they so wish which we applaud <e> <s> but a caretaker is not able to do so <e> <s> nor are those who work in the schools meals service <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to hear that we shall be confined to the subheads as the minister said the four corners as i understand the illustration to mean <e> <s> i understand also that we shall be in possession of a lot more flesh on the bones by the time we reach the report stage in the overspill period <e> <s> i am happy to wait until then to see it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> why is it that the minister picks and chooses between civil service practice which he tells us is good sound and pure and yet when we say that what is good enough for the civil service should be good enough for local government he says that we should forget about that <e> <s> he says that what the government propose is better <e> <s> if that is so why does he put up with an inferior system for the civil service <e> <s> what is different <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister begins by saying that we can dismiss or forget what happens at westminster city council and that those of us who did not see the panorama programme last night or read about the matter in every newspaper this morning can forget that it happened <e> <s> in discussing local government and political interference or political judgments how on earth can we forget such lessons <e> <s> there is no doubt that members opposite believe that they are on a winner when they talk of political interference <e> <s> they talk of political interference from the left <e> <s> yet we have the very good illustration that will run and run not only of how westminster city council has been so very badly interfered with politically but also of many others <e>", "<cs> i rise with great pleasure to support the case made by my noble friend lord carter <e> <s> nothing more needs to be said about the substance of the amendments <e> <s> on second reading the minister said that a placement under a sheltered placement scheme is not an appointment to the service of a local authority <e> <s> my noble friend lord carter has pointed out the difficulties <e> <s> i hope that the minister recognises that disabled people already bear an enormous burden because of their physical incapacity <e> <s> if in addition they are of an age where they would normally expect to find work and be gainfully employed there might be problems i shall not say difficulties or disbarments <e>", "<cs> i shall try to help the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> both the noble lord lord renton and the noble baroness lady blatch will be very familiar with the word core because they supported the concept of the core curriculum <e> <s> members of the committee remember that term immediately now that i have reminded them of it <e> <s> while this may well be a modern manner in which to be precise i should say that the idea of a core curriculum as opposed to referring to matters within a curriculum and were the idea of core provisions is to give strength to a basic group of provisions which can be added to if in the light of experience one needs to expand on them <e> <s> that is the concept here <e> <s> the provisions here could very well be limited more precisely defined and then agreed upon <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the care and time that he has taken to <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the difficulty <e> <s> perhaps i may draw the ministers attention to an article in one of todays newspapers which does not concern allegations in a debate yesterday evening the noble baroness lady blatch was concerned about the manner in which certain headmistresses and deputies exercised political influence that was outwith what she considered to be the bounds of propriety in respect of their duties <e> <s> the newspaper article to which i referred states <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly be withdrawing the amendment in due course <e> <s> i share the view of my noble friend regarding the tenor of the ministers remarks and conduct in these matters <e> <s> these benches did not ask for this bill <e> <s> the ministers arguments on a second reading did not persuade us at all nor has the manner in which this issue has been debated <e> <s> the bill has been brought forward by the conservative party with the clear intention to deal with what it believes is the rottenness in the conduct of local government especially in labour-controlled areas <e>", "<cs> i am not likely to get a fairer offer than that between now and half past eight when the proceedings on the bill will terminate <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i can sense a genuine desire to seek agreement in a very sensitive area <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely interested in what the noble baroness lady blatch has been saying <e> <s> i have served on a local authority where in my time which perhaps dates me there was a clear understanding that council officers did not attend what the noble baroness has described as group meetings that is meetings which are restricted to members of one political group <e> <s> i appreciate the integrity of council officers who would be there to assist <e> <s> but can the noble baroness tell me whether the same officer attends the same groups or whether an officer could attend different groups in the same cycle for example and therefore could be privy to the political intelligence and the political opportunities which are created by each of the separate groups inside the council <e> <s> when i was a councillor a council officer would come to our group from time to time to explain the broad strategy of a development plan <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness can help us further <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the illegal bird killings which have occurred over the past eight years with only four successful prosecutions perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> what consideration has been given to the introduction of new measures that will prevent gamekeepers who have been convicted of an illegal bird killing from being re-employed in a similar capacity <e> <s> that is in line with the provisions which currently apply to falconers and taxidermists <e> <s> is the minister aware of the very real anxiety of the rspb <e> <s> it recognises that there are ample protective provisions but it is deeply concerned at the lack of enforcement and at ineffective deterrents <e>", "<cs> from the rspb <e>", "<cs> in my view noble lords opposite are downgrading the worth of this chamber in the decision-making process <e> <s> there are members of the chamber who like myself have served on a local authority who have served in another place and who now have the great privilege of serving in this chamber <e> <s> the amendment seeks to ensure that whatever the government feel is good for local authorities is good for both chambers <e> <s> whatever the government feel is right for the commons should also be standard and the benchmark for local government and for this place <e>", "<cs> i say with great respect that i made the point that we in this chamber do not award contracts <e> <s> however what we do which is equally important or more important than that is to set the framework in which contracts have to be sought <e> <s> we have just gone through a whole series of decisions which affect the ability of a local authority to contract out <e> <s> all of those matters have wide repercussions <e> <s> the chamber does not need me to go into the detail of that <e> <s> one reads regularly of the interlocking nature of business interests <e> <s> that exists and is real <e>", "<cs> i am conscious that i stand between the committee and pleasure <e> <s> therefore i shall not take as long as i might otherwise have taken <e> <s> this is a big issue <e> <s> the minister was quite right and fair to say that these amendments go to the heart of this part of the bill <e> <s> i make no apology for that <e> <s> what puzzles us is that by the whole range of measures and changes in the controls that the government exercised over local government before <e>", "<cs> i gather from the chorus of hear hear from the other side of the committee that what private enterprise does not want is competition and certainly not from municipal authorities <e> <s> most small local businesses want to become big local businesses and ultimately gobble up everyone else <e> <s> we do not want to provide unfair competition <e> <s> we want to provide what the minister himself wants which is flexibility for local government where it finds that there is a need to act quickly in order to protect the local environment <e>", "<cs> i am satisfied that it is the ministers intention that those activities will be covered by the bill but i shall need to look carefully at what he has said <e> <s> there is only a slight doubt in my mind as to whether all areas will be covered by local authorities which study the local situation to ensure that training facilities are available for the undertakings that we have in mind <e>", "<cs> i am heartened by what i believe is the ministers desire to assist an authority that genuinely wants to encourage employers to provide work for people <e> <s> he said that the general ability to do that would not be given but that there would be exceptions <e> <s> one of those exceptions was people who were unemployed immediately before becoming employed by an employer who is to receive the grant <e>", "<cs> will the minister give us the long list of bodies which are included in the phrase all quarters <e> <s> he says that the power has been welcomed in all quarters <e> <s> the night is young <e> <s> i believe that we can with profit listen to the list of bodies which i hope are very representative and authoritative that agree with what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord dormand of easington asks the noble lord in very persuasive tone to answer the question <e> <s> the minister did not answer the question <e> <s> i share the ministers support for initiatives that are designed to improve the local economy <e> <s> however when he spoke of the amendment which refers not only to the present bill but also widens the net to take into account all other economic initiatives covered in other bills the minister said that in that respect the clause was widely welcomed <e> <s> i have asked him which bodies widely welcome the neutering of their existing economic powers putting them into a straitjacket <e> <s> obviously the minister i say this with great respect and no disrespect speaks from a brief which indicates to him that what he has told the committee is widely welcomed <e> <s> there are people not a million miles away from here who have an obligation to support the minister and to tell the committee who those people are who are in favour of this straitjacketing of their current economic powers <e>", "<cs> i have in mind the difficulties of the minister <e> <s> he is the one who has confused the issues <e> <s> i have never said that local authorities do not widely welcome measures by central government which enable them to stimulate the local economy <e> <s> there is no dispute there <e> <s> but the minister runs that into my criticism that we are not disputing the support of local economic initiatives but the ministers intention in the bill to neuter currently held powers and put them into the straitjacket of this clause <e>", "<cs> the sense of what the minister has said is understood and accepted <e> <s> however will he take on board some of the anxieties of the national federation of housing associations <e> <s> i understand that assurances have been given by the secretary of state in respect of the powers of direction which would be used to exempt registered housing associations from the provisions of these clauses and that discussions are taking place <e> <s> nevertheless the federation is concerned <e>", "<cs> here comes the answer now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> those outside the committee will read what he has said <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies is the minister saying that although he resists the amendments what they seek to achieve is capable of being achieved by other means <e> <s> in other words in the order-making process if the orders that are made are made in such a way that they will meet the points that have been raised by my noble friend i imagine that she will be satisfied <e> <s> but what if what was a very reasonable case based upon real fears will not be achieved <e> <s> frankly it is nonsense for the minister to talk about the secretary of state having flexibility if a desire for that flexibility to be exercised sensibly and moderately is pointed out to him by a genuine case and he has to make out a case against it <e>", "<cs> can the minister say what kind of consultation took place at a later date on these matters <e> <s> i know that wide consultation took place earlier when the bill was conceived <e> <s> however the government have introduced these amendments at a late stage in your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> so people outside the committee will be seeing the amendments for the first time <e> <s> there has been no consultation and no explanation whereby everyone can understand that the government are doing them a favour <e> <s> after such people have read what the minister has said it is <e>", "<cs> on the basis of that offer which i understand to be genuine and sincere i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate very much the comments made by the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind that unless changes to the perimeter of london zoo are achieved by consensus they will not be worth having <e> <s> important as the zoo undoubtedly is the price for improvement should not be a diminishing of the open space of regents park an open space for the people of london <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the minister has listened with care as he always does to what is not only a reasonable but in our view an overwhelming case for the government to think again <e> <s> i hope that the government do not believe that when they put pen to paper and produce a bill in the first instance it cannot be improved <e> <s> i also hope that they will be one of those governments who recognise that some people outside the house are closer to a problem than they are <e> <s> those people see the impact upon their own activities of what the government intend to do more clearly than do the government <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can we be clear what he is offering the committee as regards this amendment <e> <s> is he saying that there is a category of bodies which the government will be happy to exempt namely members of the umbrella organisation to which he referred <e>", "<cs> is he saying that there could well be other bodies which on their merits would be exempted <e> <s> we are faced here with the ludicrous situation that hundreds if not thousands of bodies will believe that they ought to be exempted <e> <s> the minister is saying queue up one at a time make your case let us examine your credentials and your history and we may or may not exempt this that or the other one <e> <s> it is ludicrous time-wasting and unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my colleague the noble lord lord mcintosh and i were puzzled at how the government could reconcile what they said earlier and a possible resistance of the amendment <e> <s> what the noble lord has said is that the government have reflected on what they said earlier and in the light of what they have done in the bill they will in effect be revising the guidelines <e> <s> what the minister has said is that in the light of the intended revision there is no need for the amendment <e> <s> we entirely agree <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is as i believe the minister has said that there are circumstances in which funding other than by section for some activities ought properly to be given the benefit of the protections that we are seeking <e> <s> the minister will understand that we shall have to read very carefully what he has said <e> <s> we may have to come back at a later stage but what the minister has said sounds hopeful to us and we are grateful to him if that hope is well placed <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> steady on <e>", "<cs> shame <e> <s> disgraceful <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this stage of the bill as the committee is well aware is to clear away misunderstandings from outside the chamber <e> <s> we have brought to the committee the obvious misunderstandings of some very important people namely town clerks or chief executives and leaders of councils <e> <s> the fact that they have seen a threat to what they are doing because of the wording of the bill is sufficiently indicative of the requirement for it to be either tidied up or changed <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed in the ministers reply <e> <s> i agree that some matters ought not to be capable of being varied from one period to another <e> <s> the minister gave good illustrations but can he address himself to mine <e> <s> i referred to a situation in which there had been freed borrowing by the council with a need to react to the forces of the market so favoured and loved by the minister and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> the minister blithely says that councils are constantly having meetings <e> <s> he is inviting the local authority world to take on board with his approval the suggestion that where they are obliged to seek approval before and in anticipation of a need to exercise their stewardship over funds they must have full council meetings to give that approval <e> <s> they will look askance upon that suggestion <e> <s> they do not wish needlessly to call meetings <e>", "<cs> i am now satisfied in respect of that matter <e> <s> the minister is saying that when councils set those limits they should be set reasonably prudently and in the light of experience <e> <s> however the minister has also said that if they do not set wide enough limits then they will be obliged to call more frequent council meetings <e> <s> i suspect that in the future the minister or his successors will be told that councils will set their limits wide enough to avoid that because by and large councils do not like meetings purely for the sake of rubber stamping <e> <s> however i am grateful to the minister for his attempts to be helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed because the minister obviously anticipated the need to give a lengthy discourse <e> <s> he also appreciated the value which people outside this committee will attach to what he said <e> <s> that sounds to me eminently sensible in the light of experience <e> <s> i know that he will accept that his words need to be read and studied by those outside the committee <e>", "<cs> the minister has convinced me of the wisdom of not pressing the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for reminding us that under the three-year rolling programme one has considerable notice of what the revision is likely to be <e> <s> we are really talking about the current year <e> <s> that is the next financial year <e> <s> i am satisfied from what he has said that there are difficulties <e> <s> also one could very well cut off ones nose to spite ones face if one insisted on an arbitrary date and the consultations were going on <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply is disappointing <e> <s> he is saying that he and his colleagues and officials are willing to discuss the form of consultation with the local authorities <e> <s> the authorities believe that the best way to achieve that is to have these words on the face of the bill <e> <s> what is wrong with that <e> <s> it is a question of the chicken and the egg <e> <s> which comes first <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e> <s> i may have got hold of the wrong end of the stick <e> <s> if what the noble lord has said which will be read with care by those outside the chamber circumvents the need for the amendment that at least will be a service <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for that latter clarification <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has gone some way to explain to me why the amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> i only hope that those outside the chamber who will read the ministers words with care will be able to relate to what he has said is happening and will happen and that their fears will be allayed <e> <s> i think the minister should acknowledge that there is nothing more aggravating to a local authority than to be given as it were information as regards what it will or will not recieve without knowing fully the reasons <e>", "<cs> i admire the ingenuity of the noble lord lord diamond in having found <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is a diamond <e> <s> he is a gem rough as that gem may be <e>", "<cs> that still does not get rid of the fact that it is the governments intention to make assumptions about the rate of dispersal of council assets <e> <s> in a sense that will drive the council to dispose of assets when otherwise it may not have been inclined to do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister would consider an additional aspect <e> <s> the association of district councils of which i have the honour to be one of the vice presidents and there are many other members of it in the chamber <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl take if from me that i have no ama brief <e> <s> i shall be happy to listen to the minister reading his answer to the ama brief <e> <s> i shall then be able to decide what the ama would have wanted me to say if it had asked me to say it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the ministers helpful response <e> <s> with his deeper knowledge of those matters he perceives my point quickly and sympathetically namely that if the government want the use of underused land and want to house people at affordable rents a balance must be struck between what i call the economic imperatives for the government in the bill and their other considerations <e>", "<cs> i shall please the noble earl even more by begging leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that in the circumstances that i outlined there is or is not to be a notional cost to be taken into account by the local authority when looking at its capital receipts <e> <s> no money may have changed hands but account has to be taken of the fact that it has received shall we say million worth of goods something that it would have had to spend million on that is to say it has received something to the value of million but has not in fact spent that money <e> <s> if that is the situation does the minister not understand that this will be an inhibiting factor between local authorities and developers in proceeding with their business <e>", "<cs> we shall get no further with this matter <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for understanding what i was driving at although he stuck to his guns <e> <s> from my experience very often there are bitter arguments by unsuccessful applicants for development when they find out that the developer who obtained the planning permission may have received it because of his ability to satisfy the local authority in a number of ways that other applicants did not find necessary or were unwilling so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords members on this side of the house wish to take the opportunity to congratulate the minister who i believe will be taking on major responsibilities in another department perhaps as well as continuing his interest in this particular department <e> <s> however as is the fashion today it is hail and farewell <e> <s> i do not know but this may well be a valedictory opportunity for the minister <e> <s> nevertheless i congratulate him on what i sense to be a promotion which is well deserved <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am grateful to him for his helpfulness in the matter <e> <s> however he merely confirms what we think is a wrong situation <e> <s> everyone who serves on these bodies is a place-man or woman whose position is in the gift of the secretary of state <e> <s> the minister tells us that councillors are put there by the secretary of state <e> <s> i say that in london the councillors of greenwich southwark tower hamlets and newham are entitled to feel that they know best which men or women are entitled to represent their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must say that we on these benches wish to pay a very warm and generous tribute to my noble friend lady nicol for seizing the chance literally at the very last hour to present this house and a great many people outside the house with an opportunity to give the minister and his colleagues something yet again to think about during the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will also allow me to tell the house that in that same letter the trust also stated <e>", "<cs> that is a disappointing reply <e> <s> all that the minister said in the last seconds could happen <e> <s> there will be opportunities for local authorities to act recklessly if not fecklessly in managing an element of local finance <e> <s> the minister and his collegues have gone bananas <e> <s> they are saying to local government that if it is possible to tie authorities down they will do it <e> <s> local authorities of different political persuasions will recognise that the governments macro-economic imperatives apparently rest on ensuring that a local housing revenue account does not go into deficit <e> <s> the minister and his advisers are going overboard in saying that they do not trust local government <e> <s> if a local authority acts irresponsibly it will be seen by the local electorate <e> <s> local authorities are accountable <e> <s> if they mismanage misappropriate or misdirect their resources they will be taken to task <e> <s> the minister has not made out a good case <e> <s> he has confirmed our fear that they want to prevent good people in local government acting as they see fairly <e> <s> in the light of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think we have this one on the nod <e> <s> i hear laughter from the benches opposite <e> <s> what the minister has said appears to be satisfactory in the light of the genuine concerns of local authorities <e> <s> i accept his integrity absolutely <e> <s> we shall study carefully what he said and we may seek an opportunity to bring back the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for what he said and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but i am not satisfied <e> <s> perhaps i may pursue this point <e> <s> the minister has quite fairly dealt with the formula which will be used to allocate or distribute the global sums which the government consider it appropriate to spend under this heading <e> <s> but he has failed to take into account that that formula as part of its <e>", "<cs> the minister has failed to deal with my point <e> <s> i understand the difference between capital and revenue and that what we are dealing with here and certainly what the audit commission was dealing with is not the need for capital expenditure in that sense but the need for revenue expenditure <e> <s> although one may capitalise ones repairs the cost of doing so appears in ones revenue accounts <e>", "<cs> and i hear what the minister has to say <e> <s> he has done his best but it is not good enough and i intend to press the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> not for the first time the minister tells the committee that the amendments that we are discussing have come before us after consultations with the local authority associations <e> <s> he implies that consultation equals agreement <e> <s> it does nothing of the kind <e>", "<cs> i took careful note of the ministers statement that the government were not prepared to go back on their word <e> <s> the minister could have fooled me <e> <s> the proceedings are riddled with illustrations of where ministers have gone back on their words on a number of occasions and have justified it <e> <s> we are not asking the minister suddenly to give five authorities a gift <e> <s> these are the five authorities which the minister had decided were in urgent need of two things <e> <s> one was to be deprived of their power to carry out repairs and secondly the estates were so bad that they needed to be dealt with by what the minister at the time said was a better management tool <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment do i understand from the minister that he and his colleagues genuinely believe that one day a hat will be created which will be able to call upon the treasury for money <e> <s> does he really believe that in the light of all that has transpired during the past months one day a hat will be created <e>", "<cs> if that hat fits i suggest that the minister wears it <e> <s> i believe that the minister has made the best of a very bad case <e> <s> all the evidence shows that as in other instances in this one the government have been misguided in producing a policy which is not acceptable <e> <s> they cannot see the sense of deciding how best to look after the needs of <e>", "<cs> there is the voice of a genuinely aggrieved lambeth ratepayer <e> <s> the minister has said that the local authorities could very well find that they are the losers from this proposal <e> <s> however this amendment is put forward by a number of representatives of the local authority associations <e> <s> they recognise that genuine mistakes can come to light <e> <s> on the basis that they are genuine mistakes or miscalculations they could have been committed by either the department or an authority <e> <s> there is no dispute about that <e> <s> however the authorities would like a greater degree of certainty than merely at some time in the future <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> he alludes of course to the general contents of the bill for consultation to take place <e> <s> however subsection states that <e>", "<cs> we should be grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for his persistence in constantly bringing before the house the aggravation that is very widely felt by those who are deprived of their hard-earned money and who are distressed by the activities of those who dupe them and take them for a ride <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> obviously i misheard what the minister said <e>", "<cs> if i thought that there was a way in which one could give preferential treatment to council tenants i would fully support it <e> <s> it is not easy to be so even-handed that neither private nor council tenants do not on the margin get some advantage out of the system <e> <s> hypocritical is too strong a word <e> <s> in another place the ministers honourable friend mrs bottomley said that the government had made it abundantly clear that they expected local authorities to make proper provision to do all of those things that should be done <e> <s> the noble earl knows very well from listening to our debates last night that billions of pounds are required to put public housing right <e> <s> never in a month of sundays will councils have enough money to carry out that which we all say should be done <e>", "<cs> it would be helpful if the minister could tell the committee what has prompted the amendment <e> <s> is it the result of second thoughts within the department <e> <s> has some body individual or authority asked for the easement <e> <s> i understand what the effect of the amendment will be but i should be intrigued to learn how at this very late stage of the bill it has been concluded that this particular provision is needed to improve it <e>", "<cs> as a result of the ministers consultations with whom <e> <s> that was the first question that i asked <e> <s> the minister did not answer it which is surprising because he is a fair man <e> <s> what prompted the improvement in the interests of the tenants <e> <s> the minister tells us that the <e>", "<cs> will there be a mandatory duty laid on those who are the main source of dissemination of information to the disabled <e> <s> if it is a discretionary power some people are lethargic others are keen and there will be a disparate knowledge and take-up of the facility <e> <s> can the minister tell us what steps he has in mind to make sure that every disabled person has these easements drawn to his attention <e>", "<cs> on this side of the committee we fully appreciate that where there are finite resources and infinite demands for them hard choices have to be made <e> <s> however the minister should take on board the fact that where authorities are hard pressed the making of any contribution will enable a treasurer and council officers legitimately to say that they cannot afford this inducement <e> <s> if they cannot afford it thousands of homes will not be willing to find the other amounts required <e>", "<cs> i have only one question <e> <s> the minister concluded his remarks by saying that the proposals are entirely consistent with the provisions of the data protection act <e> <s> can the minister confirm that the registrar has confirmed that to be the case <e> <s> in other words is this an opinion or has it been confirmed <e> <s> when the matter was raised under for example the football spectators bill there was a need to be assured that confidentiality would be protected <e> <s> i know that the registrar was forthright on what needs to be done to protect the individual <e>", "<cs> i have every confidence that the minister will say helpful things concerning this amendment and i shall listen very carefully to what he has to say <e> <s> sadly when the issue was raised last year in connection with the local government finance bill which was the basis for the community charge the noble earl lord caithness gave two reasons why he was unable to <e>", "<cs> i understand what the minister has said <e> <s> however the national federation of housing associations is unhappy not at the intention of the subsection but at the way it will be carried out in practice <e> <s> that unhappiness was shown in the comments i made on behalf of the federation <e> <s> if the federation writes to the minister further expressing its disquiet at the situation will he agree to give further consideration to this matter <e> <s> i am not talking about consideration in committee or at the next stage of this bill <e> <s> if however as a responsible body the federation believes that some community charge officers are exceeding their authority and certainly the intention of the bill will the minister give an undertaking here that he is prepared to consider its comments without prejudice <e>", "<cs> the minister will have the letter on thursday <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must tell the noble lord lord mcintosh that that never happens to me <e> <s> the noble lord is always welcome in the chamber not just on this occasion <e>", "<cs> that is a refusal i cannot refuse <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hear what the minister says that it is there to provide a simple and flexible way to control charges in the future <e> <s> that is a simple and flexible way for the government to control charges in the future <e> <s> what about the government trusting local authorities to have some sense of responsibility and a sense of balance in these matters <e> <s> here we have a bill which we all understand is designed to turn another ratchet in tightening controls over local government <e> <s> but in some instances such as this the control on charges in the context of the community charge payer may be likely to cause severe problems <e>", "<cs> i accept the fairness with which the minister explained that what is proposed is not necessary <e> <s> he is not arguing against consultation but against consultation of this degree which he believes is covered at earlier stages of the legislation <e>", "<cs> may i say before we proceed that of course we recognise that the enormous pressure that the department and the ministers have been under has made this situation almost inevitable <e> <s> however i do not think that by any stretch of the imagination one could either look on the minister or me as little one or litte two <e> <s> it is all part of the ministers initial mistakes <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to the two amendments which were so ably introduced by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> he and i have discussed the need for this kind of improvement in our national arrangements over at least the past five years <e> <s> on the occasions we discussed civil defence we recognised that it often got bogged down in the wartime or peacetime and emergency controversy <e> <s> however i am delighted as i am sure the noble lord is that good progress is now being made <e> <s> we must separate civil defence with its military and wartime connotations from the need for the country to have better arrangements in place than exist at present <e> <s> although i shall seek to make the case for my amendments if they are not accepted the amendments of the noble lord would be very acceptable <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to state that he recognises that it is right to legislate on this matter <e> <s> we would rest content if the minister would agree to bring forward an amendment on report or allow us to bring forward better drafted amendments <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord lord renton is entitled to have the last word before we leave the debate so i simply wish to make my supplementary comments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful as is the noble lord lord renton for the tenor of the ministers response which is all important by giving a good or bad impression <e> <s> the minister has left a good impression not only that he understands but that he will take on board

that he is anxious to see a better standard of lighting in our streets <e> <s> i have had access to the report of the debate in another place where the minister for roads and traffic replied to my honourable friend ms walley the member of parliament for stoke-on-trent north <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to support the amendment moved so ably by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> i was surprised

shelter which it <e>", "<cs> the government may feel that there are not sufficient people involved to take particular note of the situation but i hope that the minister has taken on board all that the noble lord lord ross and myself have said <e> <s> if he cannot accept the amendments i should like to hear that the government are pursuing redress for people in these difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord in case he pursues that line <e> <s> i referred to the national consumer council which is quite distinct from the consumers association <e> <s> the noble lord may by all means be vituperative but perhaps he should be careful where he is aiming <e>", "<cs> i am grateful because the noble earl and his advisers have taken care <e> <s> however i share the committees unease <e> <s> the noble earl said that he recognises that there is a problem but that this is not the way to deal with it <e> <s> if he had gone on to say that the government have a better way of dealing with the problem which they are not able to reveal tonight or in this bill but that it is coming i would have been heartened <e> <s> i honestly thought that the noble earl had said <e>", "<cs> so what in effect the minister is saying is that there is a problem but that this is not the way to deal with it <e> <s> he has not even said that he is looking for another way of dealing with it <e> <s> i accept completely that he does not know whether it can be dealt with in another way <e> <s> can he say whether he and his advisers are looking to see whether there is another way <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord appreciate that if i had not moved my amendment he would not have had the chance to give us all that good news and information <e> <s> i shall study with great care what he has said <e> <s> he has perhaps encapsulated many good reasons why the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> his advisers take seriously the thrust of the amendment which seeks to make the government put their money where their mouth is in regard to consulting tenants and taking notice of what they have to say <e>", "<cs> by all means <e> <s> the problem is that when the properties were purchased from the council it was the council that said that the properties were satisfactory <e> <s> the latent defects which emerged were not known by the industry <e> <s> i am not talking about

defects resulted from the effect of water on the metal <e> <s> i do not blame anyone at that stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and i certainly do not want to press the amendment <e> <s>

easier and quicker for the noble baroness to obtain them <e> <s> i cannot help the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down she is on good ground when she expresses her disquiet and when she says she believes that the outcome of meetings which are to take place next week and which are to be based on the report of investigations may well be satisfactory to her <e> <s> however nothing we have said can anticipate what will be said <e> <s> we are dealing with mature adult political men and women the members of the ama <e> <s> we must leave it to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been most fair <e> <s> it will be rewarded because the final form of words will be more sensible and acceptable <e> <s> i am grateful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i followed carefully and appreciatively what the minister said <e> <s> accountability and responsibility have changed not only in local government but also in industry <e> <s> the minister may have a point <e> <s> we believe when we talk about a deputy that it is a person who deputises but there are people who are deputies but not necessarily the deputy <e> <s> i take that point <e> <s> there are people who are to all intents and purposes the number two or the next one in line but do not necessarily have the nomenclature of deputy legal adviser and so on <e> <s> i shall study what he said and see whether at a later stage it is advisable to come back <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> he is right and the noble baroness lady blatch is right we are seeking to extend to a category of public employee an exemption from having to jump through hoops stand up to measuring rods and prove ones innocence in daring as individuals to hold political views <e> <s> the noble lord has gone a long way to take into account not only the views of this side of the house but also the views of those at the sharp end <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot see why he is not prepared to give what in effect would be a blanket exemption for people in this limited category <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the minister said but i should like further clarification <e> <s> he referred quite rightly to the working party and indicated that it was of a mind to include in its recommendations the kind of move which this amendment seeks <e> <s> of course some elements cannot be left to local choice but other elements can <e>", "<cs> my lords before i withdraw the amendment is the minister saying that it is still part of an ongoing discussion or consultation <e> <s> he understands that it is academic as to whether i withdraw this or press it because at the end of the day what matters is the governments intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful for that clarification <e> <s> it has been a worthwhile seven minutes of the time of the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister has said in his last words was what i thought was the gravamen of my amendment <e> <s> if that is what he intends i shall not press the amendment

affairs of local government <e> <s> over the last few years they could have fooled me <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the noble lord has been helpful <e> <s> nevertheless i am still puzzled at what i believe is a contradiction between what was said on th july and his inability to accept our amendments nos <e> <s> and which give effect to that <e> <s> i repeat what the minister said on th july at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall not get any further <e> <s> i repeat that the ministers colleague said <e>", "<cs> my lords as my colleague the noble lord lord underhill says it is a move in the right direction <e> <s> whether it goes as far as we should like is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given me the assurances that my amendment seeks to protect namely that those in post on the date of royal assent who fulfil functions that would otherwise be caught by clause will be able to continue in post and will not be subject to the conditions <e> <s> i note that he was quite right and proper in using the royal assent date as the measuring rod but perhaps he will tell us a little more about what will happen to the person concerned if a council seeks to continue with the post but not the postholder after royal assent <e> <s> in other words the post will continue only the man or woman in the post will be replaced <e> <s> what will be the effect of the bill upon a person holding a job of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very good answer but it is not an answer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords to be helpful to the minister and i appreciate that i have not explained myself with my customary clarity the point that i want him to take on board is that we have not created a new post or even a new situation <e> <s> we have the same post with a new man or woman doing the same old job <e> <s> what will be the impact of the bill on the salary proscriptions and control of that man or woman <e> <s> it is a case of the same job but a new man or woman <e>", "<cs> my lords what about old post new person <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the minister would say that because what the noble baroness lady seear said is exactly what the minister said <e> <s> that is not my question <e> <s> when a man or woman leaves a post and the post must be filled it is a new situation <e> <s> but it is not a new post <e> <s> it is the old post <e> <s> it is the same

assurance <e> <s> the gravamen of my amendment is accepted <e> <s> i asked a question some minutes ago about the status of the new person in the same post <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the new person is subject to the new rules <e> <s> that is an answer and i appreciate the position <e> <s> i should have thought that if we are talking about the post and the functions involved in the post we should not be concerned about the man or woman carrying out those functions <e> <s> it is a matter of the protection of the post <e> <s> but the minister says that as soon as that man of woman has gone the new regime will be imposed upon that postholder <e> <s> that certainly is not to my liking <e> <s> the minister has satisifed me so far as concerns this amendment <e> <s> however i shall tell him for nothing that there are those outside the house who will read what he has said in explanation of the points raised and who will have some questions to ask <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be helpful for me to continue to make the point or to leave it there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down if there comes a point when the budget for councillors allowances is strained and the minister is looking for a means of easing the strain he might care to look at comparable jobs being done in a range of quangos where we are talking in terms of people who have enormous allowances thousands of pounds per year <e> <s> when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister because he has said a great deal in defence of the governments view which will repay careful study <e> <s> it is somewhat sad that when local authority associations which primarily represent the ministers political view ask him to listen to what they know will be the effect of the bill unless it is amended on those people whom he and the associations have primarily at heart from a political point of view we are not talking about anything other than that he is not prepared to listen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall but i was intrigued by the minister saying that the measure would be revised as and when circumstances indicated that that would be right <e> <s> but earlier the minister rested his case on the fact that the secretary of state would already have the power to vary it <e> <s> there is no guarantee that he will <e> <s> the fact that the secretary of state has the power does not mean that he will vary it unless there is some proscription in the bill <e> <s> for example the limit should perhaps be increased because of need to or <e> <s> the fact that the secretary of state has the power to do so does not mean that he will increase it <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to withdraw the amendment <e>

and is flexible and he and his officers are well aware of the needs <e> <s> he instanced the possibility of a local disaster of major economic proportions which can be dealt with quickly <e> <s> i am delighted as will be those outside the house to hear the minister say that in such circumstances not only can he act quickly but he will do so <e> <s> it would be hypocritical of him to tell the house that such things are possible when in the event they do not mature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept the ministers assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments were put down as a result of <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the minister has not only listened to what has been said but has taken it aboard <e> <s> otherwise he will have the book thrown at him speaking in the context of the library service <e> <s> it seems to me to be a most sensible suggestion <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the noble baroness lady david who made an excellent case <e> <s> at the end of it she was really wanting the minister to be helpful and was not at all being dogmatic in moving her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down his case has rested very heavily upon the fact that this could be the thin end of a very big wedge so that if this easement this kind of exemption was made the flood-gates would open <e> <s> can the minister tell the house how many comparable situations there are to the one which has been pleaded by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> if as i suspect they are very few indeed that can make the same case surely the minister would be quite safe in giving this exemption <e> <s> if there are literally dozens or hundreds of other cases surely that raises the basic question that the legislation itself is flawed because good cases are being kept out <e>", "<cs> if the minister is saying that local government is safe in his hands there are those outside the house who from bitter experience would take issue with that <e> <s> the minister was shrewd in saying you either trust me or you do not <e> <s> the minister knows that we on these benches convey to this chamber the substantial anxieties of people outside this house <e> <s> therefore this amendment owes its genesis to those in local government who have suggested the kind of amendment necessary and who are anxious for the minister to say a little more <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand that the amendment is accepted but that in interpreting it the government will go further by way of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful and will take the advice of the minister on this occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made out a case to show why the amendment is unacceptable to him <e> <s> it disappoints me but i know that those outside the house respect his integrity in these matters <e> <s> there will be a further opportunity to debate the issue at the meeting next week <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by that reply <e> <s> i did not take it that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was in any way denigrating the importance of proper accounting <e> <s> he felt that it was not for parliament to be involved in detail <e> <s> that is where i disagree <e> <s> the minister has told us that local authorities accounting bodies and <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is an error in the wording of the amendment but i moved the words notional rent and not national rent <e> <s> an error occurred in the printing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister might adopt the novel practice of listening to what i said and answering what i said without necessarily using the brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the information that he has given to the house <e> <s> we with others outside the house will read carefully what he has said <e> <s> i certainly shall not press this amendment to a division <e> <s> it is extraordinary that the government never make mistakes and are never guilty of leading people to believe wrongly that the assumptions they <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanations but he does a grave injustice to the overwhelming majority of authorities which are at the sharp end in managing the housing revenue account by using as a defence or a ploy for the legislation the idea that some authorities would deliberately set out to be high spending and thus earn larger subsidies in subsequent years <e> <s> the minister said that he could not believe that i would believe that that would happen <e> <s> he is correct <e> <s> i do not believe that there are many not that there are not some within authorities or more <e> <s> of course there are one or two which might deliberately try to do so <e> <s> how long does the minister think that they would get away with it or that someone who was so reckless and malevolent in his attitude towards legislation would deliberately seek to flaunt and challenge the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black <e> <s> the minister chides me for asking him to put some flesh on the bones of a hypothetical circumstance <e> <s> however the minister himself introduced that hypothetical circumstance when he said let us envisage the possibility that the ring fence will be tightened <e> <s> that is the hypothetical circumstance it may or may not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> perhaps we have common ground here <e> <s> is he saying that the amendment is unnecessary in the light of his assurance that councils will receive per cent <e> <s> of their expenditure on rent rebates <e> <s> if that is the situation there is no argument <e> <s> what i am asking is that if in any year the amount they pay out is less than the amount they get in from central government who is going to fund the difference <e> <s> if the minister is telling me that will never happen and that they will always get per cent <e> <s> of what they pay out i rest content <e> <s> however he is aware that whenever we speak on these matters we are briefed in the main by the local authority associations and it is they who are asking us to put the questions to the minister <e> <s> these people are not fools <e> <s> they are well experienced and they do not wish to waste the ministers time or cause him and his officers offence by asking what he might think to be needless questions <e> <s> they are genuine concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can assist us on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has done his best but revealed another nasty part of government policy when he said that he could see no objection to surpluses on the housing revenue account being used to subsidise other council tenants <e> <s> i find that offensive because it is a matter of some council tenants subsidising the needs of other council tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister but i am not satisfied <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the figure of <e> <s> i appreciate that he said that applications can be considered <e> <s> is he saying that if a case can be made out for clearance

no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not castigate the minister for taking minutes i castigated him for telling us in some detail at the end of minutes why one needed to exercise care to consult to examine to revise and ultimately to be sure before putting forward such a measure <e> <s> i simply pointed out that five hours ago this house was faced with a new bill in relation to the poll tax <e> <s> the argument that one needs to be careful when drawing up legislation goes out of the window when it suits the governments macro-economic policy on the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said i shall withdraw my amendment in favour of that of the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house appreciate very much the sense of the amendments <e> <s> we certainly think that they are sensible <e> <s> the great problem is enforcement <e> <s> the government are making provision in the bill for proper and better management in an area where there may be disaster after disaster <e> <s> those can be avoided if the government will just bear in mind that it is one thing to lay down duties and responsibilities but another to make sure that the people who have the function of carrying them out have the resources to do so <e> <s> i appreciate that that is not the function of the amendment or of the bill but it is a point that should be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister invites me to resist the temptation of my own amendment <e> <s> that is a difficult process at any time and certainly at twenty-five minutes past midnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful not only to the noble earl lord caithness for his assurances but also the minister and his advisers for giving effect to my suggestion although perhaps going on a different route to that which we proposed but securing the same purpose <e> <s> i assure the minister that the national federation of housing associations has asked me to convey to the minister that it is very grateful for the notice which has been taken of what it sees as a genuine concern <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for doing what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it that the minister is rejecting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at least we have clarification about that matter <e> <s> the minister and his advisers are clear that there can be no dubiety about what is meant <e> <s> we must wait to see what happens in practice <e> <s> i appreciate that the minister has taken the trouble to go over the ground again <e> <s> today it appeared to me to be a little clearer than on a previous occasion and i mean no disrespect to the noble lord lord reay <e> <s> i hope that people outside the house share my opinion that we have clarity if not clearance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his clear explanation of why he is unable to accept my amendment <e> <s> i seem to recall that the minister said that he had taken into account the views of a number of people and he listed them <e> <s> however he failed to say that he had taken into account the views of widdicombe which had recommended million which is something like or per cent <e> <s> more than the million <e> <s> and that followed an in-depth inquiry and face to face interviews with hundreds of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am most grateful but before i say so can the minister confirm perhaps with a nod of the head that broadly the view of the department is that the joint report dealing with the matter in this way that is the three categories is something which is approved in the thinking in the department and that the consultations will be to get the views of local authorities on the proposals <e> <s> the minister nods his head and i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords these benches very much hope that the minister will take on board the absence of political animus in this matter <e> <s> i submit that the stable from which the amendments come is impeccable <e> <s> the amendment has been moved and seconded by two colleagues who in other respects are very much political ladies <e> <s> they have spoken across party lines and certainly are motivated from a non-party viewpoint <e>", "<cs> my lords clause says in effect that the secretary of state can do what he likes <e> <s> he can approve <e> <s> he can disapprove <e> <s> he can look at all kinds of special circumstances <e> <s> one has to ask the minister why the government persist in trying to hobble local government from using its own initiative <e> <s> if as the minister said on the last occasion he envisages that the number of designated areas may be as low as or that is on the record

will be on the record <e> <s> that of course is the nub of the question <e> <s> however the noble lord lord renton has contradicted what the minister told the house and that too will be on the record

are looking at are the words that the government have injected into the bill <e> <s> this will provide us with the opportunity to seek clarification <e>", "<cs> or northampton town <e>", "<cs> my

in my amendment i also draw attention to another element in football which your lordships house may think is important that is the players <e> <s> i honestly believe that the principle that at the top table there should be someone who represents the views of supporters and players is sufficiently important for me to press this matter to a vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s>

the reason for this amendment <e> <s> he said that there is no question of the scheme being put into effect until it has been properly tested <e> <s> the minister could help the house by spelling out what he and his colleagues intend to do in order to satisfy themselves that the equipment has been properly tested <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wish to point out that he has alluded only to one set of circumstances <e> <s> i could list circumstances of a changed character and the minister knows that <e> <s> we wish to know over how long a period will the testing take place <e> <s> will it take place at large grounds and small grounds <e> <s> will the testing take place in conditions such as those at hillsborough which were not unique <e> <s> that is a ground built in a residential area with narrow roads for access <e> <s> we want the minister to bear in mind that it is for the public to be satisfied <e> <s> the minister knows for example that the scheme introduced at plymouth broke down as well as that at luton <e> <s> this kind of equipment is likely to break down now and again <e> <s> we want to know whether we can be satisfied by what will satisfy the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord said i wish to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this amendment is to seek clarification about responsibility <e> <s> i can do no better than to refer to the words of the noble lord lord harris who quoted the words of the minister in another place <e> <s> the variations on who is responsible make the mind boggle <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not intend to press this amendment <e> <s> but i must say to the noble lord lord renton that it is perfectly proper in the context of what is known as the id card scheme that we address ourselves to the kind of emergency which can arise only as a result of the operation of such a scheme <e> <s> of course if the noble lord says that we are giving undue prominence to one kind of emergency by so doing so be it that is the purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in pleading for the words which we seek to strike out the minister said that it could be that the case was quashed on a technicality <e> <s> the minister may very well believe as many people do that when someone is proved innocent after he has been found guilty he is still a villain and has a record and it is the kind of thing which he would do <e>", "<cs> a very good one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will help us in the way that the noble lord lord harris suggested <e> <s> he indicated and i agree that we are at one in wanting to deal with football-related offences which are in turn related to excessive drinking <e> <s> we can well understand how such offences may be football-related if they involve someone on his way to a match or during a match <e> <s> the football ground that i know best is tottenham hotspurs <e> <s> very often for at least art hour after a football match i see people between the ground and white hart lane railway station and seven sisters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he could deal with the circumstance that i outlined namely that of people who have been to a match and have left the ground stone cold sober <e> <s> subsequently they do not go home but decide to enjoy themselves in the vicinity of the football ground <e> <s> they take advantage of having friends who live nearby and go with them into a club or pub <e> <s> their connection with football has ceased to exist <e>

do not lose their football identity card but the person who has left the match whatever distance he is away from the ground has his card taken away from him <e> <s> he loses his card not because he has transgressed any rule but simply because like many others he has got drunk after having too much to drink <e> <s> that has nothing to do with the football match <e> <s> will the minister address that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> a number of aspects of the statement concern us <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly set them out and then ask a number of questions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he deal with the subject of the contractor and the competitive tender <e> <s> is he telling us as he read out in the statement that the contractor will be selected by competition and an invitation to tender <e> <s> are we putting out to competitive tender the safeguarding of security of that establishment <e> <s> what will be the criteria upon which such a tender will be awarded if it is not awarded on the lowest price <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house

the large high street retailer from the chamber of trade including the smaller retailers and from the co-operative sector <e> <s> i do not press the point aggressively <e> <s> however if those people who will have to pay have made their views as clear to him as they have to me why are they so angry and concerned at the impact of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the

done so with feeling and passion <e> <s> does the minister understand that there are a great many unsolved mysteries as to the future against the background that the government as the minister said in his closing words profess full support for the co-operative idea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister deal with the main thrust of the question <e> <s> were the germans made aware of the possibility of the arrangements that became known later at the time the european fighter project was being considered <e> <s> will he also tell the house what steps the government have taken to ensure the protection of the maximum number of jobs <e> <s> are the government concerned that in any such arrangements whereby there are new alignments of management it is inevitable that some job fall-out will take place <e> <s> what have they done to ensure that that is kept to the minimum <e>", "<cs> name them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not appreciate that the historic changes that have taken place in the political map of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating so clearly the statement which has just been made in another place

minister confirm that the prime minister was made aware of the matters which <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister is in effect washing his hands of his responsibility and says that this matter is the responsibility of the local authority will he say what monitoring steps the department takes to ensure that local authorities comply with the law <e> <s> the thrust of the question is the sad plight of the chronically sick and disabled <e> <s> what steps have the government taken to ensure that every local authority complies fully with its duty and responsibility to the chronically sick

michael mates chairman of the commons select committee on defence that servicemens lives could be put at risk because of a fall in security standards where the job of guarding military installations has been contracted out to private firms <e> <s> those are the views of the chairman of the defence select committee <e> <s> will the minister look at the observations of a <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not accept that the tone and tenor of his replies smack of complacency <e> <s> what has been demonstrated is that members from all sides of the house are saying that on a question of cutting costs the house would prefer and i believe that the country would prefer to feel that all our servicemen are adequately protected <e> <s> will the minister answer a direct question <e> <s> given all that he has said as to the safeguards for the employment of private firms why is it possible that at the royal marines barracks at deal and at other places there have been instances whereby private firms have employed people with criminal records <e> <s> that does not make sense and does not line up with what the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the whole house i begin by thanking the minister for what quite clearly is the great deal of preparation that he has undertaken in order to give the house a full and lucid explanation of what the bill is about <e> <s> i say to him and the house that for many of us especially those behind me on these benches the coal industry is more than just a subject for a piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that he is describing an aspiration and an ambition <e> <s> however as mentioned by the noble lord lord norrie myself and others the evidence from the council for the protection of rural england and from the planning officers in durham shows that in reality the operators of opencast coal mining are not only exceeding their licence and getting away with it but they are not fulfilling their obligations <e> <s> my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> do not remind us <e>", "<cs> a good labour speech <e>", "<cs> my lords when the prime minister has spoken on this matter she has referred to incorrect statements made by herself and other ministers which misled parliament but she has refused to tell us what those misleading statements were <e> <s> can the minister help us where the prime

concerned including the civilian population is assured about safety <e>", "<cs> keep going <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the current major changes in eastern europe in particular is the minister prepared to say a little more about the changed priorities of the government <e> <s> can the noble earl say when the government expect to announce any change at all in the existing defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however does he agree that post the taylor report the football industry is entering a phase in which the leadership of the government could be most important <e> <s> moreover can he tell us whether in implementing the reports recommendations the government will lay stress on the involvement of among others football club supporters who i believe can play a major part in this <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister understand that when over the next three years the water consumers in for instance the colne valley are faced with a per cent <e> <s> increase and those in the lee valley with a per cent <e> <s> increase they have to translate those increased costs for water into their wage applications with its impact on the inflation policy of the government <e> <s> does the minister understand that the government ought to tell the whole story to the consumers and come clean and make sure that every consumer understands that the cost of his water is being inflated as a direct result of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that two or three years ago the european parliament urged that a system of co-ordination be looked at within the ec <e> <s> can he tell us what steps the government have taken to encourage an ec-wide weather forecasting organisation <e> <s> further can he tell us what steps this country takes to alert other countries when bad weather which is affecting us is moving in their direction <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister understand that words and encouragement are not enough <e> <s> if the local authorities and the major waste disposal authorities have a large part to play it is essential that the government recognise that there needs to be government involvement in the market mechanism <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that literally billions of tonnes of paper could be salvaged and reused <e> <s> that paper is simply being thrown on the waste heap <e> <s> is this not another case of the government encouraging themselves to put their money where their mouth is <e>", "<cs> my lords the government rely upon the business efficiency of the industry and the beneficence of local authorities in subsidising collections <e> <s> can the government consider as a third possibility that in order to encourage recycling from the collection of paper they themselves should make grants or give assistance through the rate support grant to local authorities like cambridge <e> <s> those authorities may have spent a considerable amount of capital in order to do the governments job <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there are some circumstances where the proposed charge is very onerous for example where a person is not purchasing a second home but is for a period in possession of a second house because he cannot sell his first house due to market conditions <e> <s> such a person is in danger not only of paying exorbitant mortgage rates but also of being trounced as regards the poll tax <e> <s> is this not yet another example of the stupidity of the poll tax <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by expressing the sadness of my colleague the noble lord lord mcintosh who is unable to be with us this evening and who played a major part in the discussions on the bill at second reading <e>", "<cs> i am most impressed by what the minister has told us of the governments intentions in this matter but surely the minister and his colleagues should take a more positive attitude to the bill <e> <s> if the government want to see a timetable but not the timetable mentioned in the bill it is open to them to improve it here or at a later stage in another place <e> <s> the minister must understand that the purpose of the bill is to try to persuade the government to be more positive in their attitude than they have been in the past <e>", "<cs> the amendment makes good sense <e> <s> we are discussing legislation which deals not just with what we know but what might possibly happen <e> <s> the amendment is drafted to deal with that position <e> <s> with the reservation that my noble friend lord hatch put forward i believe that the amendment will strengthen the weapon that the bill gives to a future government <e> <s> it has my support <e>", "<cs> the minister has not satisfied me nor i believe the committee <e> <s> he says that the figures are uncertain but that at some date they will be made certain <e> <s> therefore in jibbing at a change of words by hanging on to may and rejecting shall he leaves open the possibility that when the figures are known the government may decide not to write off all the debts <e>", "<cs> the minister can take it from me that we accept the governments intention <e> <s> certainly what he has said on the record will be helpful <e> <s> however perhaps i may ask him this <e> <s> he said that it was not the intention to provide less money in the future than that which was provided in the past <e> <s> the minister knows all about inflation <e> <s> he knows all about the slight uncertainty that exists <e>", "<cs> the committee is grateful to the minister for his attempts to clarify what is quite clearly a conundrum <e> <s> statements are made by ministers in another place generally against the background of the commitment by the government and not least under the ec large combustion plant directive <e> <s> the government are committed to reduce the emissions mentioned in this amendment by these amounts per cent by per cent by and per cent by the year <e>", "<cs> i have no quarrel with the minister who has as usual tried to be helpful <e> <s> the minister and my noble friend lord dormand have mentioned the crux of the matter <e> <s> we are not arguing that there does not come a time when a pit must close <e> <s> we can argue about when one does so and the swiftness with which one does so once the balance sheet slips from the black into the red <e> <s> we are not arguing against restructuring the governments euphemism for closures these days <e> <s> we are not even arguing about the fact that there have been periods in the history of the british coalfields comparable to the current situation <e> <s> however one factor is present now that did not exist before <e> <s> the government are going to flog it off <e> <s> they intend to get out of the business of managing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i acknowledge the experience that the noble lord lord tryon brings to this debate <e> <s> that is of course valuable as is the experience of my noble friend lord dormand <e> <s> however our great concern quite frankly is the safety of the men <e> <s> we are not trying to make an ideological point <e> <s> we simply believe that the record and the remarks of the noble lord lord tryon show that very often it is not a case of the mine owner not wanting to provide better safety but of owners having to make judgments in the context of their balance sheets as regards replacing bits of machinery <e> <s> if those matters affect the balance sheet i fear that in those instances the lot of the miner is put at risk <e>", "<cs> the minister has tried to be helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister makes a case regarding a gap that can be filled by the addition <e> <s> will he tell us what effect that will have on the current total of opencast mining <e> <s> what will be the potential effect of the tenfold increase <e> <s> what has the <e>", "<cs> the minister makes a fair point that one wants to be even-handed <e> <s> to that extent the amendment may very well be defective <e> <s> however we are moving into a situation in which neither the coal board nor the private operator will be under the sovereignty of the government in respect of these matters <e> <s> it is left very much to the power and determination of the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw the amendment but i believe that the minister is far more sanguine than he is entitled to be according to the record <e> <s> i understand that in october mr alfred davies who is a deputy chief inspector of mines and whose views should be respected was reported to have said a number of sharp things when the inspectorate met the federation of small mines <e> <s> among other things he said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister acknowledge that we now have the experience of scotland for the past months to guide us on the way in which landlords will or will not treat their tenants <e> <s> will the minister confirm that it has been estimated by reputable sources that at least million has been garnered by unscrupulous landlords who have failed to act as the minister and his colleagues would wish them to do <e> <s> bearing in mind that for england the estimate has been that in excess of million will be lost will the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many type anti-submarine frigates have been ordered for the coming year <e> <s> bearing in mind the swiftly changing nature of the political scene throughout the world not least in eastern europe can he tell the house whether the government have any plans to review their defence commitments <e> <s> as one hopes that there is less need for defence jobs can he confirm that the government are considering alternative employment in those areas where defence jobs will be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for advising me of the amendment and sending me a background briefing <e> <s> we have no objection to the procedures <e> <s> i am hopeful that even at this later stage the government will have an open mind as regards ways in which the bill can be improved <e> <s> i shall later move amendments tabled in my name on the marshalled list and i hope that now that the noble viscount has thought fit to move his amendment they will have a better prospect of being accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords a week is certainly a long time in politics because only last monday the minister was strenuously but politely and firmly telling us that there was no need for the amendment which is substantially the amendment before us today <e> <s> of course it is remarkably chastening for there to be a vote against the government <e> <s> that indicates that the committee and those members of the committee who listened to the arguments and followed the matter closely wanted to lay an obligation of some sort on the government the coal board or the opencast operators <e> <s> it was felt that something had to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleagues sitting behind me are all fully paid up members because they have been landed in it more often than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i speak for many people outside this house as well as those in it when i express my gratitude to the minister and his advisers for taking this opportunity to speak so fully and helpfully to those concerned with this matter <e> <s> i understand from him that we can look forward to early legislation though he cannot quantify it or say precisely when it will take place <e> <s> i suppose that it will be as soon as possible and we shall have to settle for that <e>", "<cs> my lords we take on board what the minister said and have noted the concerns he expressed <e> <s> however article of the ec directive dated th july reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while the house can be grateful to the minister for the care and clarity with which he has introduced the bill i believe that the measure is a good example of the saying if at first you dont succeed try try and try again <e> <s> it is also sadly an example of a government hell-bent on privatising a publicly-owned service for purely doctrinal purposes <e> <s> to that end the government have twisted and fiddled the facts have kicked their public servants in a sensitive place and have ignored the security of the realm all to achieve two shabby aims <e> <s> first they wish to be seen to reduce the number of civil servants even if they are only moved sideways on to someone elses payroll or the dole <e> <s> secondly they wish to place the business now undertaken by the crown suppliers into the hands of those who will be anxious to assist the tory party in return for help from the tory government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i followed closely what the minister the noble lord said <e> <s> will he not take on board that after two independent inquiries into viability profitability and performance they were given a clean bill of health not only by the noble lord lord belstead but also by ministers in another place <e> <s> is that not an indication that when there has been a cool hard look at the performance of these bodies they have passed the test with flying colours <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will again give way <e> <s> does he believe that instead of having one central organisation the psa to have for instance mini-psas within each department is the best use of resources and is likely to be in the best interests of the taxpayer at the end of the day <e> <s> is he really saying that <e>", "<cs> no my lords twelve departments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ex-minister agree with me that the relevance of deal was that a private security firm was being used <e> <s> the government are keen on putting out contracts to the private sector <e> <s> in my view what happened at deal arose in part through a dereliction by the private sector <e>", "<cs> i take on board the noble lords point that he will deal with specific matters later <e> <s> does the minister not understand that he and his colleagues may take every precaution and be satisfied that the new employer intends to do all sorts of things <e> <s> however after day one of the tupe arrangements the employees are wholly at the mercy of the new employers <e> <s> if those new employers decide to change their methods and tactics what recourse is there after the employee has ceased to be protected by the state <e> <s> what protection does he have from a new employer who decides to change his conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case to which i have returned more than once that is the behaviour of a new employer after tupe becomes operable will the government not concede that no change should be made in the terms under which an employee is transferred out of the public sector into the private sector without proper consultation and agreement with the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly did not pose that one way in which one could adequately protect the interests of employees is for the government to accept a lower offer unless the minister is saying that by that device it would be possible for the new employer to accept conditions and liabilities that are acceptable to employees <e> <s> that would be right <e> <s> however the minister has failed to answer the point made by the noble viscount lord falkland that when the dockyards and ordnance factories were privatised the government with treasury approval guaranteed comparable pensions whereas they have not only failed but have refused to give comparable guarantees in this instance <e> <s> why <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful for the clarity with which the minister outlined the purpose of this instrument <e> <s> the minister stressed more than once that we are bringing scotland into line with england and wales <e> <s> one of his last remarks was that it ensures uniformity of approach <e> <s> if they are all of a piece can the minister tell the house why there needs to be two separate sets of regulations one set for england and wales and another for scotland <e> <s> we are not arguing on the principle of charges but on the means of giving effect to the principle <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give a reason for having two sets of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord touched very fairly on the <e>", "<cs> never <e> <s> that cannot be true <e>", "<cs> my lords at the request of my noble friend lord jenkins of putney i ask the government the following question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he tell us the rate of progress on the checks being carried out <e> <s> for example can he say whether per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of the vessels have been checked <e> <s> can he further tell us whether any progress is being made on monitoring the possible effect on and damage to the health of the submariners and those who work ashore <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to being satisfied that no illness or damage had manifested itself in the health of the submariners or those ashore <e> <s> can the minister take on board my question what steps are being taken to monitor the situation <e> <s> monitoring is a positive review arrangement it is not simply a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords once more i am grateful to the minister for the care that he has taken in preparing for the debate <e> <s> he has certainly satisfied me and i shall not press the amendment to a division <e> <s> however there are one or two points that i need to make <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friends lord dormand of easington and lord mason of barnsley said the bill is unwelcome <e> <s> we acknowledged at second reading that some aspects of it could bring some solace and comfort to those who will inevitably be made redundant and have their future damaged by this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate and acknowledge the protocol in these matters namely that this is not a party issue but a private bill <e> <s> nevertheless speaking from the front bench i am pleased warmly to welcome this bill and i wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene briefly <e> <s> i support the objective of the amendment <e> <s> there is a dilemma which i am sure that the noble lord lord hatch has taken on board and that is the practical politics of a parliamentary timetable in getting this bill or any bill through another place because that is where it starts from <e> <s> we are seeking to iron out difficulties when the real objective is to get some speeding up of the timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay the same kind of warm tribute to the noble lord lord northfield as have other contributors to this short debate <e> <s> he has given us the opportunity to discuss the matter <e> <s> nevertheless none of us will kid ourselves or anyone else that that which transpires from this debate will be of a major character <e> <s> however it provides a good opportunity for those who from various standpoints have some experience in planning matters and in local government to take part <e> <s> all of us have a deep interest in ensuring that our countryside is protected that our industry is expanded and that homes are provided for our people <e>", "<cs> well as we know the cliff is on the edge of the field <e> <s> however it is an environmentally sensitive subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain what the words have regard to mean <e>", "<cs> go on <e>", "<cs> my lords if there has been any meaningful change at the conference it must surely call for major consultation by the government with those who are the prime sources of pollution <e> <s> can the minister say what steps the government have taken to ensure that there is meaningful change in the practices of industrialists <e> <s> what effect will the changes have on the practices of local authorities <e> <s> have the views been sought of the main conservation bodies which have played a major part in encouraging the clean-up of the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to advise the minister that the question is wholly benign and not malignant <e> <s> does he share my view that since the terrible hillsborough disaster there has been a breath of fresh air in football in the form of those who are anxious to put right many of the aspects which people recognised were wrong <e> <s> can he tell us how his department intends to monitor the progress being made by those clubs that have in mind bringing together the local authorities the local youth clubs the local schools the local police and other bodies <e> <s> i ask this because unless it is someones job to prod and probe it is possible that in years time very little progress will have been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish is proud to be president of the millwall club <e> <s> he rightly takes credit from the fact that the club took an initiative which has been copied by a number of other clubs <e> <s> will the minister agree that sad to say over a period of time some clubs will take positive initiatives and some will not <e> <s> surely it is not beyond the wit of the department to find a means of checking up periodically through an agency or an association with which it works or directly <e> <s> clubs are left untouched by initiatives and quite frankly many still live in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the minister has told us about the way in which the minister for sport keeps in touch with the sports council <e> <s> however can he tell us whether an item either on the last agenda or the next relates to the sale of playing fields and sports facilities by schools and local authorities <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is a steady rise in the number of sports fields that are being disposed of very often in order to bring in income to help hard-pressed local authorities <e> <s> bearing in mind that one of the ultimate aims of a good community sports programme is that this country will do well at the next olympics can the minister tell us how energetic the government have been in helping manchester to get the slot for the next olympic games <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by echoing the words of my noble friend lord cledwyn and joining in the grateful thanks from these benches for the generous tributes that were paid to our dear departed colleague michael stewart <e> <s> it is typical of the debate and of the generosity and warmth of the house to a colleague who served the house and the nation well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that per cent <e> <s> of the acid in britains rain comes from sulphur and that we are the largest emitters of sulphur dioxide in europe <e> <s> the minister tells us that part of the programme to fulfil the prime ministers promise will depend on the import of low-sulphur coals <e> <s> however does he recall that in the past few years low-sulphur coal-producing mines in this country have been closed <e> <s> will he reflect before he further damages the british mining industry by importing such fuels <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join the commendations of the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington who has brought this worthy measure before the house <e> <s> my noble friend lord hatch explained at some length what he believes will help to persuade the government to support the bill in another place <e> <s> i should like to address the government much more briefly and i hope that they will listen equally carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords on this bright spring morning with such good news coming to us from lichfield in staffordshire will the minister and his colleagues reflect that it was the attitude to environmental matters which they adopted hitherto as much as the poll tax which brought the spectacular victory for labour yesterday <e> <s> will the minister tell the house what the government have in mind in terms of providing support for local authorities which are likely to be affected by the changes in the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there was a general welcome for the way in which football clubs have been assisted in order to enable them to put their grounds in order following the taylor report <e> <s> however one does not want to give with one hand and take away with the other <e> <s> like my noble friend lord dean i was pleasantly surprised to be told how minimal the addition is likely to be under the unified business rate by comparison with the old rating system <e> <s> will the minister at least inquire of such representative bodies as the ccpr the sports council and the football association whether they are as concerned as we are at the likely impact on their ability to improve and extend sport following the introduction of the unified business rate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the prison officers association and prison officers in general have been neither consulted nor informed about the recommendations despite the fact that alleged details of the recommendations have appeared in the media over the past few days <e> <s> is the minister aware that one of the alleged recommendations relates to the need for counselling and advice in countering psychological <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in view of the alleged leaks of alleged reports prison officers who are serving not only in crumlin road gaol but also in the maze and in other prisons are the subject of jokes by prisoners as to their need for psychological treatment <e> <s> i am sure that the minister understands that the atmosphere inside prisons in northern ireland is quite unique <e> <s> the prison officers are carrying out a dreadful job on behalf of society <e> <s> anything that can be done to give them aid comfort and weapons in their battle on our behalf ought to be treated seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not another illustration of the nonsense and inconsistency of the poll tax <e> <s> does the minister not understand that there are visiting forces that is americans and their families who hitherto paid rates and who in the future will not pay the poll tax yet there are gurkhas who will pay the poll tax <e> <s> does the minister not understand that the british people will not accept that the gallant gurkhas as the minister quite rightly described them should be punished and placed at a disadvantage compared with visiting american forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the government estimate that stocks of chemical weapons in russia amount to tonnes <e> <s> the americans have recently announced that they are satisfied that the total is between and tonnes the russians have announced that the total is tonnes <e> <s> can the minister give the governments latest estimate of the total stock of chemical weapons in russia <e> <s> it is no good talking in general terms the government must have an estimate <e> <s> can they also give an undertaking that after the chemical weapons convention this country will cease to produce binary chemical weapons even though others may not cease to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate that the minister in charge cannot visit every site <e> <s> however does he not as part of his responsibilities get around the country to make site inspections of all kinds of installations involving planning considerations <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will agree that there are not many sites which fall within this category which would inhibit the minister from visiting every site <e> <s> does the minister not agree that if the secretary of state were to visit a site he would not only be able the better to assess the report from the inspector but he would then be able to convince all concerned in the matter that when he finally gave his decision he would know what he was talking about <e>", "<cs> seconded <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great pleasure to participate in this debate <e> <s> i am sure that when the minister rises he can say truthfully that it has been a useful debate for him his <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak for myself and not for my noble friend lord mcintosh who as we all know is a stirrer <e>", "<cs> my lords i now move on <e> <s> my noble friend lord monkswell repeatedly used two words as the theme for his speech <e> <s> he was angry at a range of changes that had happened to the democratic fabric of this great city of manchester <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> he expressed pride in labours achievements and he is absolutely right in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was kind enough to tell the house how many council properties are vacant in the london area <e> <s> the minister knows that nationally per cent <e> <s> of local authority stock is empty <e> <s> government agencies have per cent <e> <s> of their stock empty <e> <s> how many government properties are empty in london <e> <s> the noble lord would not have come to the house armed only with figures for public authority empty properties would he <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are very well satisfied with the appearance of the code and i understand from our contacts with the local authority associations that they are satisfied that the code so far as it goes serves the purpose intended <e> <s> the minister is quite right in alluding in the history of these matters to the sad situation of some aspects of local government in the early s <e> <s> he also mentioned the widdicombe report <e> <s> i have read very carefully the report of proceedings in another place as the noble minister will no doubt understand <e> <s> many of the questions i would normally have raised have already been raised by my honourable friends in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope in fact i know that the bill will be given a second reading <e> <s> like the noble lord lord jenkin i shall rest content that detailed scrutiny of the bill will be carried out properly and carefully in a select committee of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting for the noble lord to mention the magic name bexley which he was kind enough to do before he finished <e> <s> the committee that will consider this bill will i am sure take careful note that the position with regard to bexley is wholly different <e> <s> at bexley there was a complete agreement <e> <s> there is no agreement in this case <e> <s> the london borough of greenwich approved the bexley bill <e> <s> the london borough of havering disapproves of the redbridge bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many small contractors are likely to be involved in the problems that he just mentioned <e> <s> can he also tell us how long it will be before the installation is finally in place and in running order <e> <s> will he bear m mind that such difficulties also arise over a range of economic tendering issues at both central and local government level where other industries are involved <e> <s> i am thinking especially of the building industry <e> <s> small businessmen are put at a disadvantage by having to wait for payment of their bills not just from large contractors but very often from local and central government sources <e>", "<cs> there is no such thing i as a free lunch <e>", "<cs> marvellous my lords <e> <s> the minister comes to the committee and says that because matters have already proceeded in accordance with the bill the committee is almost acting <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the care that he has taken to give me a full answer <e> <s> however in doing so he poses a number of questions <e> <s> he tells me that the government are on firm ground in respect of the cover or provisions of tupe in this matter <e> <s> we shall be coming head-on to what i maintain and hope to prove that <e>", "<cs>

this session <e> <s> i do not need the words other than as an <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister cannot on behalf of the government agree with a reasonable case that is that northern ireland is a special case <e> <s> the minister is saying that those elements of a special nature will be taken into account by the commissioning government department when it consults in detail with the psa <e>", "<cs> first i apologise as i should have made reference to the amendments additional to the one that i moved <e> <s> the minister was quite right to speak to the other two and i am grateful <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his remarks <e> <s> however if a potential purchaser considers these organisations are worth buying why on earth do the government not consider that it would be a good thing to keep them within the public domain <e> <s> the government appear to be following their doctrinaire philosophy of selling into the private domain as many public sector bodies as possible <e> <s> they wish to do that regardless of whether the public sector bodies are in the public domain because of the national interest or because of national security or other considerations <e>", "<cs> can the minister confirm that what i said was correct <e> <s> have the us government and the german government expressed reservations <e> <s> the minister made a fair point when he said that their reservations may be groundless <e> <s> however it would be helpful to the committee to know regardless of what the minister has said and of the governments interpretation of the situation whether those governments have as my papers tell me expressed reservations about the change <e>", "<cs> the minister has neatly sidestepped my question as to whether reservations have been raised <e> <s> the fact that discussions are taking place is one thing <e> <s> however the minister has told us that security will be the subject of negotiations which are now taking place <e> <s> the minister knows that civil servants are bound by commitments by the official secrets act and in many other ways which could very well be sidestepped or watered down if the people in charge were not bound in that way <e> <s> there will be thousands of civil servants members of the various trade unions concerned who hold in their heads as well as in their files priceless national secrets which they guard jealously and which are the property of the government <e> <s> those individuals have access to and are privy to a great deal of information which is priceless in the context of security <e>", "<cs> the minister relies very heavily on tupe <e> <s> he would be wise not do so because we intend to challenge it on a number of points in later amendments <e>", "<cs> we shall need to read what the minister said <e> <s> time and again it comes back to the fact that the government have failed to satisfy us or to satisfy the trade unions who represent many thousands of members with the explanations given <e> <s> i have quoted one individuals situation <e> <s> i shall be mentioning one other case before the debate ends this evening <e> <s> there are dozens of anxious <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his concluding remarks <e> <s> we are puzzled by the fact that those remarks and the bills provisions cease to have effect in respect of the new employer on day <e> <s> on day the employment is transferred no redundancy is paid and the employees are in the hands of employers who may not be good <e> <s> the minister will not be surprised to be told that not only are there bad employers but there are those who have fallen on hard times <e>", "<cs> the new employer would not have to deal with <e> <s> the minister has already gone through a range of ways in which the numbers likely to feel aggrieved or disadvantaged could be substantially reduced <e> <s> the trade union negotiators are realistic men and women <e> <s> they will not unnecessarily stand out for a benefit or an advantage for a handful of their members who it is felt are acting unreasonably <e> <s> however the minister should not equate someone who does not wish to be transferred or made redundant with being unreasonable <e> <s> we are not talking about the ministers livelihood or mine or that of any other member of the committee <e> <s> we are talking about people with responsibilities who have mortgage payments to meet <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the care he has taken in preparing himself but having listened very carefully to what he said it is very confusing <e> <s> the words that i used to describe what the trade unions want not broadly comparable but comparable not identical as far as possible but identical <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e>", "<cs> without wishing to give any offence i fear that the minister has been advised that because consultations have taken place or meetings have been arranged <e>", "<cs> i understand that <e> <s> of course governments have the absolute right in pursuit of their policy and politics to say this is what we intend to do <e> <s> there is no argument i am not arguing about that <e> <s> we are talking in terms of a realistic trade union negotiator recognising that the government have rights as well as anybody else <e> <s> he will look objectively at the package which he has to sell to his members <e> <s> i do not speak in a pejorative sense he has to avoid difficulties at a certain stage <e>", "<cs> i am once more grateful to the minister for the care he has taken <e> <s> hundreds of thousands if not millions of people are employed by the government <e> <s> a small group of highly trained and experienced people is referred to in this amendment <e> <s> i know that people sometimes fail to get a job because they are too well qualified <e> <s> we are talking here of people who want to stay in the public service and who recognise that there will not be a place for them in a slimmed-down psa <e>", "<cs> the words <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is not in favour of the affirmative resolution procedure during the lifetime of this government <e> <s> we shall see what his views are in a little while when the government changes <e> <s> i am certain that he will see a great deal of merit in inviting the government if they have nothing to hide to come before the house of their own volition <e>", "<cs> my lords it is more than years since the ramsar arrangements were made <e> <s> i understand that shortly there will be a comparable conference in switzerland <e> <s> what announcements does the minister intend to make at that conference to demonstrate to our european neighbours that we are fulfilling the obligations of the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government tell the house what fresh initiatives they have in mind to deal with these matters and how high a priority the government give to research into the resources which are being wasted and which are damaging to health <e> <s> does the minister have any statistics regarding the impact upon health in general caused by these emissions and particularly the costs to the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the signs of <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge that the minister is not prepared to recognise the concern of the trade unions <e> <s> he picked me up on my use of the word empire <e> <s> the minister knows that i referred to the public empire that is managed by the state <e> <s> the employees of that empire are proud of what they do <e> <s> however they recognise that this government no longer want to govern their particular part of the empire <e> <s> that is as plain as a pikestaff <e>", "<cs> my lords the government rest their case on producing pieces of legislation to eliminate what they consider to be lacunae and anomalies in existing legislation <e> <s> but it is that existing legislation which forms part of the contract between the government and the employees <e> <s> the burden of the employees argument is that there will be no meaningful consultations <e> <s> in general when the government speak of negotiation they do not mean negotiation with employees but with future employers <e> <s> once that has been done there exists a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> at committee stage he spoke to amendment no <e> <s> which sought to <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that this is the response <e> <s> i tell him that i do not recognise it in terms of the point which i made <e> <s> i am not an expert in these matters <e> <s> the minister is expert in reading a brief that he has helped to prepare which he said takes him to the point <e> <s> perhaps i may again ask the minister whether what he said he took a great deal of time to prepare is helpful to the point that i made or whether it is anodyne or even benign <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the sense of those remarks <e> <s> the minister is aware that between now and the third reading of the bill on friday there is not a long period during which it will be in order to table amendments <e> <s> i think it would be helpful to the minister if our discussions were to take place as quickly as possible in order to avoid a protracted third reading stage of the bill on friday <e> <s> that could very well happen if those whom i shall consult outside the house tell me that his response is not helpful <e> <s> however i accept that the minister sought to be helpful and i am grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting that the government and the minister have indicated that employees can rest assured that they have the protection of tupe <e> <s> perhaps i may read a letter to the house from a body called the training business group of great charles street birmingham <e> <s> it is addressed to a mr gallagher who is the national officer of the national union of civil and

i do not wish to be offensive <e> <s> in committee he took a great deal of care to present cogent arguments against the amendment <e> <s> however even if he repeats them i shall still find them unacceptable <e> <s> i agree that there is no purpose in doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister denies us this amendment on the basis that it would delay the sale <e> <s> that is absolutely right <e> <s> we want that sale to be delayed in order to establish a proper price for the assets sold and a proper price for the viability of the company <e> <s> what a terrible condition to be laid on a vendor <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with all other speakers in acknowledging that we have been well served by the inclusion of this item on the agenda today <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend lord monkswell not only on his timing but also on and i ask the house to accept this the reasonable way in which he put forward his views <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me one question <e> <s> given that it was the aspiration of president reagan and mr gorbachev at reykjavik to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of this century and given as i reminded the house the intentions of the russian leaders and the moves that president bush is now making will the minister accept at least the possibility that if not by the end of the century then shortly afterwards a position could be reached in which nuclear weapons could be totally eliminated <e> <s> is the minister really saying that despite that it would be the governments intention to continue to be one nation if not the only nation which retains nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to law enforcement agencies <e> <s> the question is expressed in terms of the armed forces <e> <s> can the minister confirm whether there has been any collaboration between the armed forces of various countries <e> <s> for instance have british armed forces personnel with special experience in the drug field given advice to other countries or taken advice from them <e> <s> will he bear in mind that while we are deeply concerned about the international aspect there is evidence to show that in this country drug

directive and have been reassured that it is to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that i shall make the most popular speech of the day because it is the one immediately preceding that of the minister who will reply to the debate and who will we hope give us many answers <e> <s> as with other noble lords and as the noble baroness lady robson said it is for me a privilege to take part in the debate <e> <s> however i also look upon it as a pleasure and an educational exercise <e> <s> i say that because one of the things which has emerged from the debate in which people will have spoken is the fact that i have been able to listen to many fellow peers for the first time <e> <s> i have appreciated as we often do the enormous width of interests which are represented in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take on board the fact that those who advocate complete deregulation of shopping on a sunday fly in the face of the opinion of the people of this country <e> <s> is he aware that although those people seek to use the device of making comparisons with the rest of europe other ec states overwhelmingly proscribe an ability to sell anything at any time on a sunday

will be grateful to the noble viscount for the clarity with which he has explained the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that we are able to conclude agreements only with countries which have legislation comparable to our own <e> <s> can he say with which countries the government would like to make arrangements but cannot because of the problem <e> <s> where there is a will there is a way <e> <s> i can understand that there are inhibitions barriers problems and difficulties <e> <s> are there countries which are as anxious as we are to try to deal with these evil men and women but which find that incompatibility of legislation inhibits an agreement <e> <s> are we working on ways to make amendments to each others legislation to enable it to happen <e> <s> i am not asking the minister to rise again to make further points <e> <s> perhaps he will write to me on that matter <e>", "<cs> they talk about nothing else in edmonton <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is surely aware of local concern and anxiety regarding health hazards <e> <s> he said that he and his colleagues are satisfied but what steps have they taken to reassure the public <e> <s> the minister mentioned an environmental impact study <e> <s> can he say when that is likely to be available and whether it will be widely published and consulted upon <e> <s> bearing in mind the enormous change in the strategic need for installations of this kind in the light of swiftly changing defence commitments are the government prepared to consider the strategic necessity for this blot upon the landscape <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in legislation already on the statute book provision is made for a registration scheme <e> <s> will he assure the house that if in the legislation he expects to be before this house later this year an amendment is carried against the government they will treat that amendment differently to the defeat they suffered in previous legislation and will carry out the will of parliament <e> <s> will the government also acknowledge that despite the defects in the effectiveness of northern ireland legislation the people of northern ireland almost unanimously are satisfied and delighted with the impact on the problem of stray dogs and violent dogs in northern ireland <e> <s> i ask the government to learn from the experience of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> it says it in the book <e>", "<cs> my lords i say from the labour front bench that we give the bill a warm welcome <e> <s> we wish it well <e> <s> this is the third day this week that i have been in the house at this time of night <e> <s> i have listened to about speeches -odd on monday -odd yesterday and -odd today <e> <s> on a number of occasions i heard members say that everything that they wanted to say had already been said but that there were one or two more things that they wished to say <e> <s> they then proceeded to speak <e>", "<cs> it was this week <e>", "<cs> my lords when under the defence review the government examine the commitments that they believe they have will they give thought to how to maximise what is known as the peace dividend <e> <s> when the government look at whatever scope for reduction there may be to what extent will they consider retraining those people who are presently employed in the armament and defence business <e>", "<cs> if the amendments appear to be too narrow the government rest on legislation which is too broad <e> <s> if the minister rests his case on the fact that the request will result in yet another piece of bureaucracy he can be assured that those who made it do not look upon it as such but as being essential in order to monitor the situation <e>", "<cs> i can assure the minister that i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> but i probably used words more appropriate to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall not start again because it was all good stuff and tomorrow members of the committee can read what i said <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment but the ministers response causes genuine puzzlement <e> <s> we do not simply want men and women to carry out functions we need to understand that resources are available to provide opportunities for developing a strategy and the means whereby the job can be carried out <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble earl <e> <s> we wonder why there is this exclusion which is why we have proposed the amendment to place that kind of waste under the control of some form of legislation <e> <s> it was specifically excluded and i am sure that the minister will tell us why as well as why that exclusion is not to the detriment of the consumer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for commenting on the illustrations that i gave <e> <s> if they are not caught by the definition of controlled waste they are controlled in some other way and under some other legislation <e> <s> so far so good <e> <s> the minister will understand that the overwhelming majority of farmers will be sensible and will set the best hygiene standards for their farm and neighbourhood <e> <s> however there will still be cases where the disposal of waste is not carried out as it should be <e> <s> fly tipping has been referred to <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> like the noble lord i am looking forward to hearing what the minister can say to reassure us <e> <s> the noble lord will understand that the definition of controlled waste specifically excludes waste from mines quarries and agricultural premises <e> <s> the minister has satisfied me in part that the disposal of such waste is already covered by the factories act and in other ways <e> <s> however it is because that waste is excluded from the definition of controlled waste that we are concerned not only about the manner in which it is disposed of but also the manner in which it is carried <e> <s> in the event of what i consider the double jeopardy of uncontrolled waste being carried by unlicensed carriers some of the safeguards that are contained in the control element will be missing <e>", "<cs> i shall do something that the minister did not do and read out the words of clause primarily for my own edification <e>", "<cs> the minister has made a good start <e> <s> he should keep it up <e> <s> that is eminently satisfactory to us <e> <s> i am grateful to him for drawing our attention not only to the words but also to the interpretation of those words in the context of the specific illustration that i gave <e> <s> i am very grateful to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he said that authorities would not be prohibited <e> <s> however we wish to see positive encouragement <e> <s> i believe that there is discouragement of incineration not least because of the capital cost of the equipment <e> <s> i should like the minister to say more <e> <s> i used the illustration of the north middlesex hospital <e> <s> however in many trade processes it is essential that waste be disposed of by incineration <e> <s> also in the context of the governments proposals there is a need to conserve energy <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that he has no view one way or the other as to whether incineration as a means of disposal for certain wastes is good or bad <e>

a last resort saving them from becoming ill as a result of obtaining if they want to imbibe drink which is far too strong for their condition <e> <s> i believe that the bill presents a powerful opportunity to reduce dependence on strong drink which sadly afflicts far to many people <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl ought also to remember that this is a matter of the utmost gravity <e>", "<cs> from these benches may i say that we are pleased that the not exactly hiccough but slight hesitation that might have occurred because of some dissatisfaction has been sorted out so amicably outside the house <e> <s> i am sure that this owes a great deal to the conciliatory attitude that the noble lord lord brougham and vaux has not just in this matter but in others <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> in a spirit of mutual understanding i am grateful for the minister saying that he would love to do what is asked but he cannot <e> <s> i am inclined to agree <e> <s> he knows the realities of the situation far better than i they are such that i fear what he has said is substantially correct <e> <s> he knows that very often the reason why matters reach the department is because of delays at a local level which in my experience could be obviated <e>", "<cs> i am intrigued by the ministers assertion that more frequently now than before elected councils disregard the advice of their officers <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why matters go to appeal <e> <s> in effect the minister is saying that if councils took the advice of their officers matters would not go to appeal that is to say that which is requested would be granted <e> <s> that is not my experience <e> <s> in general council officers look at these matters objectively <e> <s> in my view invariably local <e>", "<cs> i am surprised not only by what the minister has said but by the tone of what he has said <e> <s> i am talking about the time it takes to determine a matter that needs to be arbitrated upon <e> <s> i get the drift of the ministers temper <e> <s> i do not want to exacerbate it <e> <s> he has been as helpful as he can during the evening <e> <s> i shall try to help him over the next period of the committee stage by withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister is really saying that unless the information is requested it will not be published or provided <e> <s> i have joined in as i am sure the noble lord did before he became a minister in the very useful parliamentary exercise of tabling questions in order to elicit information <e>", "<cs> regarding the period during which appeals were determined can the minister tell us how many remain outstanding <e> <s> but if he does not have that information i can understand why and i am not making any imputations <e> <s> it is as important to be told how many appeals were submitted and remain outstanding as it is to be told how many have been determined <e>", "<cs> fifty-two outstanding appeals compared with the which were <e>", "<cs> as so often happens the concluding words of the minister indicated that the proposal had some merit but that it was not the way to do it <e> <s> the noble lord then went through quite reasonably and realistically what the position was <e> <s> he came up in the end with the way in which the burden of complaint in the amendment could be tackled <e>", "<cs> i am interested but it is difficult to steer the course i wish <e> <s> the problem is not that the minister or the ministry are doing something that is not laudable <e> <s> the question is how energetic positive and dynamic the ministry is in carrying out its remit <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the mover of the amendment will have something to say but i should say that i am grateful to the minister and to his aides for providing me with clear evidence of the will of the government to do something <e> <s> however i should tell the minister that it is a thankless task because there are millions of people outside the chamber who do not care tuppence about implementing the practices that the minister and many other responsible people want to see implemented <e> <s> i wish the minister well and wish him success in the governments initiatives including the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches certainly support the order <e> <s> my information is that not only from a community point of view but more importantly from a broadly political point of view there has been agreement and understanding that the manner in

have no objection to the order <e> <s> we welcome it and understand the reasons for it <e> <s> the minister took a quick canter over the course and told us why this order is necessary now <e>", "<cs>

available <e> <s> bearing in mind that many cuts made in the energy office fell on advertising and the develoment of energy surveys among managers will the minister say how he intends to realign those priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how much the nation spends on rd and what proportion of that total is spent on defence <e> <s> further can the minister estimate any necessary increase in rd in the redirection to civilian use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the bush administration have announced that they intend to seek a per cent <e> <s> reduction in their defence expenditure over the next five years <e> <s> when does he anticipate the defence review <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the

present crisis housing associations are being asked to accept a per cent <e> <s> slippage in their programmes <e> <s> what exactly does a per cent <e> <s> slippage mean in this context <e>", "<cs> now answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are more than people employed in the defence industry <e> <s> that means that there are over million people whose livelihoods are affected by employment in the industry <e> <s> surely he cannot simply say that we should leave the future of those individuals within the context of a national policy and strategy solely to market forces and the decisions taken in a dozen or boardrooms <e>", "<cs> yes yes yes <e>", "<cs> this is very absorbing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he will understand that i do not want to press the matter <e> <s> i was interested to hear that the survey had identified about active sites <e> <s> my information is that it uncovered <e> <s> the local authorities must be having a major blitz and getting rid of those sites by the yardfull <e> <s> whether there are to active sites from which noxious gases can escape there are grave anxieties <e>", "<cs> we on these benches

to tell the minister that in practice there are likely to be illustrations thrown up which will bring the application of the law into ridicule and disrepute <e> <s> at least we are on record as trying to prevent the government suffering that fate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be helpful in order to resolve this matter as amicably as possible for the house to adjourn for a period of say minutes <e> <s> i know that would delay this evenings business but if we continue as things stand at present there will be a great deal of animosity <e> <s> if we adjourn for minutes now it may save us a great deal of time in total <e> <s> i make that as a suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches give the measure a warm measure of support <e> <s> i assure your lordships that that was an accidental pun <e> <s> the manner in which the basis of the measure has been explained is certainly to the benefit of the house <e> <s> i cannot believe that anyone inside or outside the house would not wish to speed this measure into legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister began his remarks by resting on the fact that an independent authority is concerned with the tunnel <e> <s> the government and people of this country do not want to be other than deeply involved in safety matters <e> <s> does the minister recall a statement made by the government earlier this year to the effect that the health and safety executive had been invited to review safety procedures <e> <s> how far has that review gone <e> <s> how far is it intended to go <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind that the people of this country are not just concerned with safety as the tunnel is being built but they will be deeply interested in what the government have in mind to ensure that once the tunnel is built it is safe for travellers <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have no objection to the regulations and see their good sense in fulfilling our obligations as members of the ec <e> <s> they are much too full of technical detail for me to comment on them sensibly but having read them and listened to the minister i certainly understand that we seek to enhance the reputation of the british insurance industry which is great well-appreciated worldwide and very important to this country <e> <s> i also detected strands in the ministers speech which are designed to ensure that the security of the investor and the probity of the companies involved in the insurance market are given close attention <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i echo the words of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> the bill is eminently sensible and its drafting has been based upon experience <e> <s> indeed we have all had experience of these matters when knocking on peoples doors <e> <s> because they have registered once some people assume that that is all they need to do <e> <s> there is great irritation when you point out to them that they are not in fact registered and that they should have repeated the exercise <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord clinton-davis i am baffled as to what impediment to progress or the speed of the planning process would result if a local authority is given the right to state its case <e> <s> it does not necessarily follow that given the right to state a case the authority will wish to state it on every occasion <e> <s> the rules provide that the secretary of state will have the discretion to decide whether or not to provide a local authority with the opportunity to state a case <e> <s> that is all very well but this is a question of whether the man in marsham street knows better than the man in dudley town hall or any other town hall <e>", "<cs> that is a disappointing response <e> <s> the minister in effect is again saying that to use the clumsy phrase the men in marsham street know better than the people in the local town hall about the depth of feeling and anxiety of local councillors <e> <s> those who serve on local councils will no doubt take careful note <e> <s> this is not a tuppenny-hapenny affair <e> <s> a great deal of damage can be done to public confidence in the absence of the local authority of whatever political persuasion being given the opportunity to go back to the community and say at least i told the inspector or the man from the ministry what we the local representatives think <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the care that he took in stating his case and pointing out perhaps fairly that the amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> i am used to being told by ministers that my amendments are unnecessary and aggravatingly finding that they are unnecessary <e> <s> i do not doubt that again the minister is right <e>", "<cs> this amendment is supported by those of us on these benches <e> <s> i rise simply to say that the noble lord lord tordoff put the case very well <e> <s> there is little more that i can add <e>", "<cs> again i am sure that those outside the house will be obliged to the minister who said that the amendment is not necessary not least because he intends that the bill should do exactly what the amendment lays down <e> <s> i am sure that he understands the anxiety of people outside the house who wish to make sure that they are consulted <e> <s> the minister has not said that every body that thinks it ought to be consulted will be <e> <s> however i accept what he has said <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister means well but one is left with the impression that this provision is not the right vehicle for this matter <e> <s> everyone who has spoken acknowledges that <e> <s> however that will not prevent people outside and those who have spoken here tonight from taking any opportunity they can to draw attention to what they consider to be a potentially dangerous situation <e>", "<cs> i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has done his best but his reply was disappointing <e> <s> he made much of the varying levels of risk that could be attached to the release of gmos <e> <s> one of the releases that he said would be considered less risky than <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely not competent to argue the case but there are others who are and they have spoken in this debate on this and other aspects of the matter <e> <s> i spoke on the premise that the minister is well advised and the integrity of that advice is not in question <e> <s> but as the noble baroness lady white said earlier the minister must give peace of mind to the public <e> <s> the public become very concerned when they believe that what the minister calls a flexible approach might mean that there will be less rigour applied to some situations than to others for no reason other than that it is more costly time-consuming wearisome or whatever to do the job properly <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to take the ministers word that the bill already contains what the amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> however as he knows the association of metropolitan authorities and other bodies feel that it would be helpful to have the code of guidance referred to in amendments nos <e> <s> m and c written on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> that is the best offer we are going to get tonight <e> <s> i have looked at my supporters and they have nodded their heads <e> <s> in the circumstances we are prepared to accept the explanation it is a step in the right direction <e> <s> i listened carefully and noted that much of what the minister said is contained in amendment no <e> <s> n <e> <s> by inference he made copious references to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it would be pointless to try to make points because the minister has indicated that amendments will appear before us at a later stage <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise because the name of my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey is on the amendment <e> <s> the basic points have been covered very well by the noble lord lord mcnair <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the care he has taken in explaining why the provisions of the amendment are not necessary in the context of the bill <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said and may come back later <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i perceive that the minister and his advisers appreciate what i seek to <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady nicol and the labour benches i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord kimball on his success in piloting this useful bill through your lordships house in such a short time <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord montgomery on bringing forward what by any standard is a modest measure and for having spoken in such a persuasive manner <e> <s> noble lords who were present at the earlier stages of the bill will recall the assurance that he displayed in handling potentially difficult amendments <e> <s> his handling of the bill is much to the credit of himself and the promoters of the bill <e> <s> we are sure that it was done to the satisfaction of sir peter emery who sent the bill here from another place <e> <s> we congratulate the noble viscount on his stewardship of the bill while it has been before us in this house <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> the case had to be made <e> <s> it has generated a great deal of interest <e> <s> those outside this place will be grateful for all the comments but i know when i am beaten <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is a most disappointing response <e> <s> i appreciate that the night is long and i am as anxious to get away as the minister <e> <s> what he is saying is that he is satisfied that the work of the committee will be carried on properly that in his view its work is not likely to be of interest to the public and that members of the public who want to come along and listen to democracy in practice are being tiresome and irksome <e> <s> he is saying that these issues should be left to the committee the minister and his advisers <e> <s> i am sure that those outside this chamber who read what the government have said will be extremely disappointed <e> <s> i may very well come back to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i share the disappointment of the noble lord lord ross and i suspect of others who have spoken in this series of debates <e> <s> i do not doubt that the government recognise that grants such as we are discussing here are likely to be called for but they say that the method that we propose may not be right <e> <s> those people outside this place who read with great interest what the minister has said will have to decide whether the proposal is satisfactory <e> <s> the minister is saying that together they ought to be able to come to sensible arrangements <e> <s> we have sought to write on the face of the bill what we and they consider to be a sensible arrangement <e> <s> it is quite clear however that the minister and his advisers have a certain view <e> <s> i hope that when the country councils come up with an ad hoc arrangement which can provide a mechanism whereby they can do this the minister will not say that it is <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that we have no whip on the labour benches <e> <s> i am not giving a lead <e> <s> we are not even on a leash <e> <s> members on this side of the committee are free to listen to the arguments and come to their own conclusion as to whether the main new clause or the amendments are to their satisfaction <e>", "<cs> we will take that as read <e> <s> the debate has demonstrated that there are arguments and views that are passionately held on all sides of the committee <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord lord hailsham rose to his feet his first words were <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have come to expect our defence debates provide a constant reminder that in your lordships house are gathered noble lords representing a quite unique repository of talent and experience in every field and never more so than in the field of defence <e> <s> those like myself who have attended debates in recent years know that we have our regular performers <e> <s> their contributions enliven and illuminate our debates as they have done today <e> <s> noble lords always speak wisely and i do not undervalue any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am slightly confused about procedure <e> <s> when will it be in order for noble lords on this side of the house to comment on the discipline order <e> <s> is a separate motion to be put <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble earl is taking advice can he also tell us the number of recorded incidents when actions by officers non-commissioned officers or others led to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been advised about discipline/victimisation of homosexual and lesbian members of the armed forces although i have no precise information <e> <s> one can readily understand that it is comparatively easy to be discriminatory against people who one might or might not like <e> <s> is there a policy in respect of the treatment of individuals who are proud of their sexual orientation and who wish to be good servicemen and women <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the house would allow me to respond on behalf of all my noble friends <e> <s> we reciprocate the kind words that the noble lord lord denham has said on behalf of his colleagues and the whole house to those who serve us so well <e>", "<cs> my lords the house would normally have expected my noble friend lord underhill to be here and to respond and make a useful contribution to the debate <e> <s> regrettably he is not well and is unable to be here but he has asked me to say that having studied the matter which is complex and complicated but easily understood by him he is content
