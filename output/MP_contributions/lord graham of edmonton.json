["<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful each time the minister gives more information on the progress of overcoming the problems involved so that those outside may feel satisfied that the best is being made of a very bad job <e> <s> the minister must be aware that those outside have the greatest unease about the insurance aspect of this part of the bill as opposed to many others <e> <s> there is violent disagreement about certain other matters but there is unease and fear that there could be some if i were to use emotive words perhaps i might be out of order possibility that something dreadful might happen because the insurance side has not been got right <e> <s> this causes great unease outside the house <e> <s> the government have decided that this is the way they want to do it so theirs is the responsibility <e> <s> but the unease does exist and the minister will know that i am not carrying tales because he will understand that the great unease felt outside needs to be drawn constantly to the attention of the minister and his advisers to remind them that the quicker they are able to satisfy the interests outside that is everybody not just the party or association but the insurance industry as well then the better will be their lot in implementing the legislation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> at committee stage the minister was kind enough to invite the noble viscount lord hanworth and me to discuss the matter with him <e> <s> we had a very productive hour in his office during which we went over the ground <e> <s> although we were unable to persuade him and although he was unable to persuade us this does not alter the fact that there is understanding about the point we are making <e> <s> we are trying to find a form of words that will meet a situation which may not arise very often but of which we need to take account <e> <s> this is because of the size of and the wide range of attitudes in the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> this is a good idea whose time has not yet come <e> <s> it is quite clear from what was said by my good friend lord broxbourne and others that there is understanding as to what is sought to be achieved but that it is not necessary in the present circumstances <e> <s> i am aware of a meeting in december at the ministry when all the options were canvassed and there were some very strong views from a limited number of bodies which just said they would not participate they would not take part in a joint board arrangement they wanted to control their own affairs <e> <s> those voices were very powerful inside the ministry and they prevailed <e> <s> but as far as we are concerned on this side of the house we are satisfied that this matter will be kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful but i hope that the minister does not treat lightly the seriousness that the inter-departmental committee is a proper forum in which this matter could be discussed <e> <s> there is a host of problems and i do not wish him to get to his feet again but i hope he and his colleagues will in actual fact simply draw the attention of the inter-departmental committee to the debate on these matters in this house and another house and ask that they be seriously considered <e> <s> they are considered important by a lot of people outside this house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is to be moved by the noble lord lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this series of amendments is to take very careful account of the disparity which would exist between the estimates of the cost of the new system compared with the cost of the old system <e> <s> the minister and his advisers are well aware that attempts by a range of bodies with experience to calculate the cost in future have produced estimates ranging from twice to three times or four times the cost of the present service <e> <s> so let us make no mistake about it the ministry and those who are concerned are very sensitive about the fact that the new system will cost more and the government have sought to diminish that charge by increasing the cost of the public service <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> what the government are about is avoiding too much embarrassment in the future while at the same time moving towards a concept which i say to the minister i accept they indicated some time previously in which these are the kind of services which eventually will have to pay their way <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrases that the minister has used are again very revealing <e> <s> the noble lord says that time will be given to local authorities to adjust their resources <e> <s> what he really means is to increase their charges <e> <s> according to the government a time will come on a date not announced when they will bring forward this proposal <e> <s> if that fact is noted and charges are increased accordingly they say this will be all to the good <e> <s> the noble lord also indicated that all he was doing was to give local authorities freedom to fix their own charges <e> <s> but the house and others know what that freedom has meant in respect of school meals transport and other issues <e> <s> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> with the leave of the house so far as i am concerned the response of the minister has been quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord lord broxbourne has fairly raised the possibility that cross-subsidisation could be exercised by one authority to help to keep down the costs <e> <s> this is always possible <e> <s> in our view the amendment is a deliberate attempt to try to reduce what we consider will be alarm in the future when the disparity between local authority costs and the new system the amount will be punitive because of the need for the inspector to take out insurance is revealed as far too high <e> <s> in view of that i shall be pressing amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e>", "<cs> i should like again to support the good sense of those outside the committee who clearly have assisted my noble friend lord wallace in seeking to improve the bill at all stages <e> <s> of course there will be other stages after tonight and who knows <e> <s> when a wider audience looks at what we have done tonight there may be even more improvements on the way <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the intention of the clause <e> <s> it is quite clear that sometimes one does not get the words right <e> <s> but i am sure that the minister understands very well the agitation if not the anger of many people who want to maintain the existing acreage of allotments but who are aware of the fact that in this day and age when there is severe pressure from the government on authorities to find money from their own resources there will be authorities who will look with covetous eyes upon the possibility that by one means or another they will be able to produce a situation in which it can be said that there is no longer any need or demand for allotments and the land will be sold and the monies will be used to keep down general rating needs <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the value of this amendment <e> <s> i can understand the minister making noises that the department has enough on its hands <e> <s> reference was made during the second reading debate to the value of the thorpe report <e> <s> but again there is uncertainty over the precise extent of allotmenteers in the country <e> <s> in the local government planning and land act the government and this was without our blessing laid a whole range of additional duties on local government to provide a wide diversity of statistics and information <e> <s> to the extent that the government will claim the credit for opening the books and the doors of local authority activities we are saying as we said in another place and i remember saying it myself on the floor of the house that the use to which statistics can be put let alone the basic need for providing statistics on something which i repeat is part of a community is very sound and can be very valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the prime minister was an early champion of open government when she successfully piloted legislation to open up council meetings to the press and the public <e> <s> what is the difference between a council meeting which is concerned with the expenditure of local monies and a water authority <e> <s> is it not a fact that consumers whether they are industrial or domestic are entitled to see how more than million is being spent or wasted <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the convention and i did not wish to rise at all <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will understand that <e> <s> will the minister not take on board the enormous significance of the translation from temporary to permanent in this instance and not only that but that once a permanent permission has been granted it immediately provides the opportunity for consolidation and then after consolidation for expansion <e> <s> a crucial aspect is the recommendation or the indication by the inspector that a permanent permission should be given and from that has flowed a great deal <e>", "<cs> just you wait <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down has the minister any answers to the questions i asked during the debate or is it his intention to reply to them <e> <s> the minister might recall that i gave him notice of those questions earlier i understand the problems but i should like to know whether i am going to get answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say from this side of the house that we are grateful to the noble baroness for giving us yet another opportunity of looking at the vital subject of tenants rights <e> <s> we are sympathetic to the new clause <e> <s> the minister may be able to tell us that there is no need for it because written in the small print in the various other bits of the enactment there are matters that can take care of it <e> <s> i do not think that the house can listen too often to the disparity between what as we would call him <e> <s> a good landlord does and what even a good landlord tries to do but fails to do and the net sufferers are the poor people the people who are defenceless in trying <e>", "<cs> coercion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the noble lords persistence <e> <s> i have looked carefully at the reasons why the previous amendment was not acceptable to the government <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord evans of claughton read with care the words of the noble lord lord skelmersdale who said that he agreed with the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> if we can get a little more than agreement with that principle we shall i believe make some progress <e> <s> the government have quite fairly pointed <e>"]
