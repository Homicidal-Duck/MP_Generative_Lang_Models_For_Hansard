["<cs> my lords might i first thank the noble lords lord ross of marnock lord mackie of benshie and lord hughes for their generous comments and their welcome <e> <s> i can assure them that if they care to indulge in party political knockabout i shall try not to be tempted to follow their example <e> <s> but where they make criticisms of the government then i shall certainly defend my government in the knowledge that the steps which the government are taking and have taken over the last four years are the only realistic steps which could have been taken in order to try to recreate in this country the kind of success which we have almost forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i of course was mistaken in that but what i was not mistaken in was that the party of which he was a very loyal supporter formed the government at that time <e> <s> indeed the abatement in leading to a reduction in local authority expenditure was also associated with the party of which he was a loyal member <e> <s> so we must get these things in perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be none the worse for the information even if he did not mention it <e> <s> the noble lord also asked me about the regulations and i have to tell him that the regulations are subject to negative resolution of either house <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point that the noble lord has made i obviously would not agree with him but i realise the point he is making <e> <s> i think we have had a useful debate this evening <e> <s> we have discussed this order in some detail and i am grateful to noble lords who have participated in our debate <e> <s> i hope that we shall have the opportunity of many more debates in which we can exchange our views and ensure that the scottish people know full well that in the house of lords their interests are always well considered and that the right decisions are ultimately taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the welcome he has given this order and i am also appreciative of the fact that he indicated to me that he would not expect answers to the questions which he has posed at very short notice to the dispatch box <e> <s> i shall study the record very carefully and i shall ensure that the noble lord is given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i can assure him that i will make sure that he too receives a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a very good debate indeed <e> <s> it has been constructive and every speaker has had a real contribution to make <e> <s> initially i dealt with the principles which were raised by the noble lord lord byers but i omitted to answer two points which he raised <e> <s> the first has been touched upon by a number of speakers <e> <s> i would just say with regard to the question of the civil service and their attitude to the youth training schemes that my noble friend lord gowrie the minister responsible has had discussions with the civil service and progress is being made he has hopes for a satisfactory outcome soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try to be helpful to the noble lord but he will agree that he asked a great many questions and if i inadvertently mixed up other noble lords questions with his i apologise to him as i do to whichever noble lord i am depriving of an answer in his own right <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that if it is within my power to get the figures separated i shall do so and write to him in due course and try to be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that my noble friend has changed his mind <e> <s> i am delighted that he is able to be with us <e> <s> i thought that his examples of how the company with which he is connected has been so meticulous in furthering the interests of british industry show just what can be done when management takes a positive decision that it will try to be helpful to british industry <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend and his company on the excellent success achieved <e> <s> it is good to know of these examples where british industry can meet the challenge and be competitive with the best in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will have sensed as i have that the house would wish us to move on <e> <s> if he cares to write to me about any further point that he would like to raise i shall do my very best to give him an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is correct when he says that a certain attitude has developed among certain age groups <e> <s> this is part of the challenge <e> <s> we have to try to recreate a situation in which our industrial base can revive competitively so that these people can be included <e> <s> we must make an effort to produce jobs for both the young and the middle-aged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for supplementing my briefing <e> <s> i feel that it would be wrong of me to say any more at this stage <e> <s> i think the house feels that we should proceed and naturally the noble lord lord byers would like to wind up his debate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should explain to my noble friend that the cost of administration has now reached a figure in the region of million per year <e> <s> tenants of the land settlement estates are being offered a very substantial discount in order to encourage them to buy their holdings <e> <s> i think my noble friend was suggesting that because of the circumstances there might be a clawback but i should point out to him that any clawback or any pre-emption stipulation would have quite the opposite effect <e> <s> it would discourage sales when the governments objective is to dispose of all its leasehold and landlord units <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord has not quite understood the situation which is that so far as those holdings are concerned approximately three-quarters have been bought <e> <s> this represents some which is very satisfactory and means that the tenants have been taking advantage of the very attractive terms which the government have offered <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the figure i have given will assure the noble lord that many scots know a good bargain when they see one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must tell the noble baroness that i find my remit in dealing with the scottish office as much as i can master at the moment but i shall make inquiries on her behalf and write to her in due course <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the tenants have the right to sell the farms immediately <e> <s> there is no question of pre-emption <e> <s> however it must be remembered that the tenant sells a very substantial part of his own right to the holding when he sells and that is reflected in the price <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make fresh provision for scotland as regards the regulation of inshore sea fishing and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> almost exactly two years ago my noble friend lord mansfield introduced in this house a bill which became the civic government scotland act <e> <s> he said then that the bill marked the beginning of the end of the burgh police scotland acts and <e> <s> that corpus of law or at least a part of it has been kept alive by the legislative equivalent of a pacemaker because together with the remnants of another venerable statute the roads and bridges scotland act it provides the foundation of scottish roads law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate not only for their interesting and constructive contributions but for the welcome which they have given to the bill <e> <s> there will be things about which we shall wish to talk further but the principle is accepted on all sides of the house and for that i am very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would not go so far as to give the noble lord an absolute assurance because i do not feel qualified to do so <e> <s> what i can say is that there is certainly no new substantial law where there is a change in codification <e> <s> without consultation i would not care to commit myself to an absolute assurance i would rather check the matter first <e> <s> but i can give him the assurance that certainly no substantial new law is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i will do that with pleasure <e> <s> what i was really trying to do was to avoid a pitfall for myself where the change for instance of one word might slightly change the meaning <e> <s> i therefore did not want to commit myself but i will certainly write to the noble lord <e> <s> he also asked me what a special road was <e> <s> again his noble friend raised this question <e> <s> most special roads are motorways though not all <e> <s> the edinburgh outer city by-pass is also being built as a special road <e> <s> a special road is intended for limited classes of traffic <e> <s> in addition electricity boards or telecommunication boards have no automatic right to dig up these roads to lay apparatus <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason why they could not <e> <s> that is not one of the principal qualifications of the special road <e> <s> the noble lord asked as did others about public expenditure <e> <s> we believe that roads authorities will welcome the additional powers in the bill but they realise that they cannot escape the governments overriding need to control public expenditure <e> <s> as regards the extra powers in the bill we believe that local authorities will welcome them <e> <s> the noble lord also asked whether if a local authority missed a road from its original list this would have an effect <e> <s> if the original list ought to have included the road the local authority will be able simply to add it to their list <e> <s> there is no difficulty about that and perhaps it is inevitable that at some time there may be somewhere an error of some sort but it can be easily rectified <e>", "<cs> the government are not aware of any other local authority road projects in scotland which have the same significance for through traffic on the trunk roads <e> <s> if any are put forward which meet this test they will certainly be considered on their merits for financial assistance at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just coming to the western relief road if my noble friend will wait <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i now repeat an answer given in another place about the dispute at the stockport messenger newspaper group <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment delivered a statement which reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord dean of beswick and the noble lord lord rochester for the way in which they have responded to this statement and for doing their best to keep this unfortunate situation as one of regret and not trying to make too much political capital out of it <e> <s> i would however say to lord dean of beswick that the law has become involved only because of the intimidatory picketing which has taken place and indeed if this picketing were ended a settlement would be more easily achieved <e> <s> i strongly refute his suggestion that this has anything whatever to do with the legislation which the government have introduced <e> <s> indeed i would further say to him that those who break the law must first of all act within the law <e> <s> i am sure the whole house would agree with that sentiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord harris for his comment <e> <s> he is correct that the act changed nothing which previously referred to unlawful picketing <e> <s> so far as his second point is concerned it just could be i am being as charitable as i can be that british rail feels bound to ensure that ordinary passengers do not suffer because of the presence of pickets <e> <s> nevertheless i can only agree with the noble lord that if this special train is designed for the pure purpose of picketing then it is a very regrettable step <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that the noble lord is rather confused in his thinking on this issue <e> <s> i would certainly not agree that it is the same solidarity <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct and i am sure that he expresses the sentiments of the whole house when we condemn any form of violence on picket lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> what i said earlier was that i acknowledged that those who had spoken on behalf of other political parties in your lordships house had not sought to make particular political points out of it and that i appreciated <e> <s> but i entirely agree that the action itself is highly politically motivated <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that this is a very serious matter but i think it would be of little benefit for me to comment on a matter which is virtually for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that every effort will be made but i do not believe that this is a matter for government action <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept that <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord joins me in total condemnation of violence on picket lines <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful debate on this second reading <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords who decided to take part in the debate for the contributions they made <e> <s> i should particularly like to associate myself with those who have already congratulated the noble lord lord grimond on his maiden speech <e> <s> apart from anything else i welcome being joined by a near neighbour from the other place <e> <s> we represented seats not too far apart and shared many concerns for the area <e> <s> it was also a great privilege for me to take part in a debate to which the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would not try to deny that but at the same time i am sure that the noble lord would agree with me that it would be extremely difficult indeed it would be highly unlikely to be able to devise a bill which would <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am delighted to have an opportunity for the second time today to present to your lordships a bill which deals with one of my own direct responsibilities within the scottish office on this occasion tourism <e> <s> this is a subject which is of tremendous importance to scotland and to the scottish economy <e> <s> the governments election manifesto included a firm commitment to extend the powers of the scottish tourist board to include promotional activity overseas <e> <s> our belief in the importance of the tourist industry is reflected by our bringing forward the necessary legislation this session <e> <s> the tourism overseas promotion scotland bill before your lordships today gives effect to our commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords first it is my very pleasant duty for a second time today to associate myself with those who have congratulated a maiden speaker <e> <s> on this occasion it is a great pleasure to welcome the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove to the house of lords <e> <s> we hope he will participate frequently and not only in scottish matters though we are sure that scottish matters will feature largely in his interests <e> <s> i perhaps have a particular reason for welcoming the noble lord because his brother-in-law who is in another place was for many years my pair <e> <s> therefore i have a special affection towards his family <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that was a point i dealt with in my opening speech and that is correct <e> <s> i shall deal in a little more detail with the financial questions in a few minutes when i shall be dealing with another point relating to finance which the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i simply cannot answer that question off the top of my head but i will certainly be very happy to contact the chairman of the british tourist authority on behalf of the noble lord and when i have the information from him i shall be happy to forward it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should first point out to the noble lord that the chief valuers provisional estimate was based on the possible outcome in a situation most favourable to the sellers <e> <s> that situation did not prevail <e> <s> i have no evidence to suggest that a better price would have been obtained had different procedures been followed <e> <s> in view of the fact that the public accounts committee is examining the whole question at present it might be more beneficial if we were to wait until we have their report before we make a judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> it might be best if we waited until we see what the report contains before making a judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me who was responsible for taking the decision not to use private estate agents <e> <s> the decision was taken by the governing body of jordanhill college to which responsibility was given after the rationalisation took place and the decision to close hamilton collegewas realised <e> <s> it was for that body to decide who would be most fitted to carry out negotiations on its behalf <e> <s> it had every confidence in its solicitors and decided that that firm should act on its behalf <e> <s> the firm in question had experience of substantial property deals and was thought to be perfectly competent to act <e> <s> as to the final decision the noble lord knows only too well that the secretary of state is always made aware of the situation when such a sale takes place <e> <s> the secretary of state would not necessarily approve it but he decided not to hold up the sale <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that the property was advertised <e> <s> it was advertised in the press <e> <s> there were no fewer than brochures circulated to various interested people <e> <s> there was wide interest in the sale and <e> <s> after sifting there were about serious bidders <e> <s> in the long-term there were four final bids which came in for serious consideration <e> <s> so there is no question but that there was full advertising and that full opportunity was given to those who might be interested <e>", "<cs> my lords the solicitors who were acting on behalf of the governing body of jordanhill college advised the college on each step in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have earlier explained the situation was that the chief valuer made his provisional estimate on the basis of the possible outcome of a situation most favourable to the seller <e> <s> as it transpired at the time that the sale took place the situation was not necessarily most favourable to the seller <e> <s> therefore the original estimate and it was a very rough estimate by the chief valuer could not be held to be accurate in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i must advise the noble lord that that was not a ruling and the remit had been passed to the governing body of jordanhill college <e> <s> it was for them to decide <e> <s> they considered the possibility of employing outside agents but in view of the fact that they had every confidence in their firm of solicitors messrs wright johnston and mackenzie who in the past had carried out substantial conveyances of that kind they believed that they could get as good advice from their solicitors as they could from estate agents <e> <s> the noble lord will appreciate that the practice of selling property through the medium of solicitors rather than estate agents is one which has been commonplace in scotland for very many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the chief valuer gave his initial estimate of the price <e> <s> the noble lord must be reasonable with me on this point <e> <s> he gave his initial figure <e> <s> when he was asked a second time to comment in view of the fact that it was not a sellersmarket which he had anticipated in the first instance he declined to revise his figures <e>", "<cs> no my lords i certainly would not accept that scottish office management stands condemned <e> <s> i would rather save my judgment until we have the report of the public accounts committee and perhaps see what is its finding after <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct <e> <s> it was not advertised in the journals to which he referred <e> <s> nevertheless there was still a large number of interested persons and more than brochures were applied for and distributed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble viscount that the problem is not one of inadequate controls but rather of difficulty in enforcing the controls <e> <s> these are already more restrictive than is generally supposed <e> <s> for example a firearms certificate is needed for the purchase or possession of the more powerful air weapons and there are age restrictions on the purchase and use of all air weapons by youngsters <e> <s> at present the government have no immediate plans to change the existing regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> my attention has been drawn to what was said in the debate to which he has referred <e> <s> we recognise the concern about the adequacy of the controls on shotguns but the general link between armed crime and the private possession of firearms is not clear-cut <e> <s> we are not aware of any direct unambiguous evidence that tightening the controls would have a significant effect on crime levels <e> <s> as i said in my earlier reply the government at present have no proposals to change the existing regulations but we are of course constantly overseeing the situation and we shall take any necessary action if and when the occasion arises <e> <s> in the meantime no proposals are afoot <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that such literature has already been made available <e> <s> the leaflet <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter has been very exhaustively examined by successive governments over the years <e> <s> the evidence which has been available to them confirms my earlier remarks <e> <s> i cannot add to the answer which i gave earlier to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i attach importance to what the noble viscount has said but the evidence does not bear out his comments <e> <s> indeed very many of the cases on land of the kind to which he refers are the very types of case in which the greatest precautions are taken <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> i do not believe that his suggestion would be particularly advantageous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the best assurance which i can give to the noble viscount is that i shall study very carefully the record of our deliberations <e> <s> i cannot give him any further assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend is not suggesting for one moment that the chairman-designate is not of the highest repute and well able to carry out the job which is being entrusted to him as from st january <e> <s> mr mackenzie is a well respected hill sheep breeder <e> <s> he is thoroughly conversant with the highland hill habitat occupied by deer and having stalked himself he will be aware of the need to have regard for the competing interests of farmers foresters and deer forest owners <e> <s> i am confident that he will discharge his new duties very well indeed <e> <s> it may be of moderate advantage that he is in possession of a valid small firearms licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to respond to the noble lord <e> <s> i cannot compete with his wit <e>", "<cs> my lords since it was created in the red deer commission has been singularly fortunate in having a very distinguished group of chairmen who have all fulfilled extended periods of office <e> <s> i would take this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to the immediate past chairman who has given nine valuable years of service and who is widely respected <e> <s> he is also a farmer <e> <s> when he became chairman he had no specialist knowledge but he has proved that this is not a prerequisite for carrying out the job with great efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords one never knows what may lie ahead for mr mackenzie <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first apologise to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie because i had no intention of slighting him or his party i can assure him of that <e> <s> may i extend my warm congratulations to the noble lord who spoke for the official opposition on his first occasion at the dispatch box <e> <s> we all welcome very much what he had to say perhaps not exactly the words he chose but he did fulfil the objective of an opposition and that is to criticise and be constructive <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord for the part he played <e>", "<cs> to suggest my lords that no cuts can he made by local authorities is very far from reality <e> <s> cuts can be made and we will see that cuts will be made <e>", "<cs> yes and i say that because i am confident that local authorities will make cuts my lords <e> <s> indeed more than local authorities in scotland made substantial cuts over the past year and they have not found any great difficulty in doing so <e> <s> they have accepted the financial disciplines which local authorities have to accept in the same way that national authorities have to accept them <e>", "<cs> i cannot without notice give an answer to that question my lords i was saying that more than local authorities managed to make substantial cuts <e> <s> i do not believe that any of their ratepayers are worse off for those cuts in due course the ratepayers will probably be very much better off <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble and learned lord that i consider that the action which the government are taking confirms this government in their endeavour to be the champion of the ratepayers <e> <s> at the end of the day i genuinely believe that if local authority expenditure is disciplined and kept within reason the ratepayer must obviously be the beneficiary <e>", "<cs> my lords i answer the noble lord quite simply <e> <s> i do not accept that cuts cannot be made in local authority expenditure <e> <s> to suggest that local authorities have made all the possible cuts which they can is to my mind simply not accurate <e> <s> there are still many cuts which can be made and i believe that many local authorities will think very seriously about them and will find ways of making cuts to meet this <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that that is the case <e> <s> i think we must accept that there are occasions when it is necessary to make cuts <e> <s> it is not the case that local authorities are totally efficient in every way <e> <s> while i respect local authorities i do not think they are above criticism <e> <s> local authority expenditure has not fallen to the extent that it should have done <e> <s> indeed the th report of the commission on local authority accounts includes details of shortcomings in financial and tendering control procedures <e> <s> it concludes a great deal more but that is just one of its criticisms <e> <s> that is an area which i believe could be examined and possibly savings could come as a result <e> <s> that is only one and there are others <e> <s> i believe local authorities will find them and act upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not making that suggestion <e> <s> i believe there is still a reasonable amount of fat in local authority expenditure which can be cut off and saved <e> <s> i am confident that such savings can be made <e>", "<cs> this amendment would weaken the emphasis on the need for the scottish tourist board to obtain consent for its activities outside the united kingdom <e> <s> noble lords will recall our discussion at second reading of the policy underlying the requirement that the scottish tourist board should obtain the secretary of statess consent before it exercises its overseas promotion power <e> <s> i referred then to the broadly similar provision already applying to the scottish local authorities and to area tourist boards and i explained that through the consent procedure the secretary of state is able to ensure that there is no wasteful overlap or duplication of effort <e>", "<cs> i never cease to be amazed at the transformation which can come over a member of parliament whether in this place or the other place when he moves from one side to the other <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock who had a distinguished parliamentary career in another place was responsible for a great deal of scottish legislation <e> <s> he was noted as one who hounded the draftsmen in order to get bills exactly as he wanted them and rightly so <e> <s> i think that we can assume that any bill for which the noble lord was responsible received a very high degree of scrutiny <e> <s> therefore he will not be surprised that i have in front of me a copy of the highlands and islands development scotland act <e> <s> nor will he be surprised that in that act there is stated <e>", "<cs> the government are concerned to ensure that any overseas activities proposed by the scottish tourist board will complement the british tourist authoritys promotion efforts for great britain that there is no duplication of effort between the two bodies and that the overall great britain promotional effort by the british tourist authority remains properly coordinated <e> <s> this amendment would remove the <e>", "<cs> i cannot add a great deal to what i said initially when i replied to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> i will however try to clarify one or two points which may not be fully appreciated by the committee <e> <s> first the british tourist authority does not have to give its consent <e> <s> the words are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for the way in which he moved this amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for the very reasonable attitude which he takes to it <e> <s> the amendment would permit the scottish tourist board in certain circumstances to disregard the obligation imposed on it under subsection of clause to obtain the secretary of states consent before promoting scotland overseas <e>", "<cs> there is no likelihood of any rise in the number of civil servants overall <e> <s> whether there may from time to time be justification for a slight apportionment to bring them up to five or down to four will remain to be seen but it is not likely that there will be any major change <e> <s> the scottish tourist board itself considers that it will be able to carry out <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble and learned lord that we have been some considerable time on them and i do not feel that i can make any great further contribution <e> <s> but as a matter of courtesy i shall try to deal with the points which the noble lord lord howie of troon raised and which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie made <e> <s> i shall deal with lord mackies point first <e> <s> he said there might be a case where there could he outright disagreement <e> <s> of course if there was outright disagreement then the will of the secretary of state for scotland would be the deciding factor <e> <s> i explained earlier that the british tourist authority is consulted but the decision is not dependent on its consent <e> <s> the decision would ultimately be with the secretary of state for scotland <e>", "<cs> that may be so but i am afraid i cannot really accept the amendment as it is proposed nor indeed is the principle behind the amendment sound <e> <s> i do not think that we want to write into legislation anything which is not absolutely sound <e> <s> therefore i must with the greatest respect suggest that it would probably be better if this amendment were withdrawn <e> <s> i trust that the noble and learned lord might consider withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord has misunderstood the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> that is not what this amendment says <e> <s> it suggests that the scottish tourist board should not necessarily consult when it does not see the necessity for doing so <e>", "<cs> this amendment would impose on the british tourist authority a requirement to consult the scottish tourist board and obtain its consent to the btas promotions of scotland overseas <e> <s> i am grateful again to the noble lord lord carmichael for the way in which he presented his case but this amendment is fundamentally at odds with our intention as to how the british tourist authority and the scottish tourist board should exercise their overseas promotion powers <e> <s> i believe that approval of this amendment would be profoundly damaging to the cohesiveness of the act framework and to the coherence of the total british marketing effort abroad <e>", "<cs> yes i can confirm that if i might answer my noble friend before i deal with the point made by the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> it is correct that the chairman of the scottish tourist board is a member of the british tourist authority <e> <s> i indicated earlier that when the british tourist authority presents its programme for overseas promotion at the beginning of each year the chairmen of the various national tourist boards are in a position to hear exactly what is intended <e> <s> they can then report back to their own boards and thus hopefully conflicts are avoided <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his contribution <e> <s> i really cannot add i am afraid to what i have already said other than perhaps to say that the scottish tourist board itself is pleased with this measure <e> <s> it believes it to be more than reasonable <e> <s> the board itself has made no representations to me regarding the sort of amendment which noble lords are suggesting at the present moment <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting afternoon discussing these amendments <e> <s> now that we have reached the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i know that the committee would not wish me to dwell for too long on the matter but the noble lord lord ross of marnock has asked me two specific questions and i shall try to answer them for him <e> <s> each year with the approval of parliament the secretary of state allocates funds to the scottish tourist board <e> <s> the will be additional <e> <s> this sum is no part of the funding already provided by the british tourist authority <e> <s> in other words it is extra money and it will be for the secretary of state for scotland to decide from time to time what the allocation of funds to the scottish tourist board may be <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can answer my noble friend on that point by saying that we are very satisfied with the standards which have been attained and which are being attained <e> <s> it is also interesting to note that the percentage for which my noble friend asks ranges between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> which i believe by any standards is very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot accurately answer the noble lord on that point but i shall make the necessary inquiries and let him know <e> <s> however my advice is that the opportunities are available to everybody and it is hoped that they are being taken up by the ethnic minorities as well as by others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a very important point <e> <s> at present eight centres are sited in wales in scotland and the remainder are in england <e> <s> we are particularly anxious that the numbers should be increased and indeed there are arrangements at the present moment which indicate that the number will increase to about <e> <s> there is no scarcity of sponsors people are very anxious to be helpful in this matter <e> <s> the point which the noble lord has made about the siting of these centres will certainly be kept in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall do our utmost to ensure that this is so <e> <s> of course apart from the information technology centres the youth training schemes themselves are incorporating a measure of this instruction in the schemes which they are offering <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid that this is something which i cannot tell the noble lord at the moment but i shall certainly note it and let him have the information <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble baroness that there is a mixture <e> <s> indeed some of the money which has been made available through grant aid has been used to ensure that the standard and quality of those who are instructing is maintained <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord who opened for the opposition on the question whether clauses and shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove was very fair in what he said and the noble lord lord grimond also was constructive in his remarks <e> <s> i shall try to deal with the points raised but perhaps i may first say to the noble lord lord carmichael that i very carefully studied all that was said on second reading and the reason why i have not brought forward government amendments to these clauses is that quite frankly i did not see anything which i considered would improve on what the government intend in them <e> <s> the noble lord himself highlighted the point i want to make by asking me to assure your <e>", "<cs> i can understand the concern expressed by the noble lord but in fact the purpose is to seek to ensure that for the convenience of the fishermen they are taken to the nearest port <e> <s> we are very anxious about this and i believe that in moving this amendment we are ensuring that fishermen will be taken to the most convenient port <e> <s> no one wants them to be taken somewhere that is a long way from their normal route <e>", "<cs> i am bound to admit that i cannot answer that point until i have advice <e>", "<cs> i shall try to clarify the point a little <e> <s> the amendment makes it clear that in this case a sheriffs jurisdiction extends out with the bounds of his sheriffdom <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to encompass the waters covered by the bill in other words the sea adjacent to the coast and landward within the six-mile limit <e> <s> the amendment confers jurisdiction on any sheriff court to try offences under clauses or <e> <s> the noble lord lord hughes asked what the position would be if we did not include the amendment <e> <s> the reason for the amendment is that the jurisdiction would have been conferred only on specific sheriff courts but my advice is that because of the sea element it would be more realistic to confer jurisdiction on any sheriff court for the sake of convenience <e> <s> the offending skipper could then be dealt with at the most convenient sheriff court which might not necessarily be in the sheriffdom in a landward sense in which the offence was committed <e>", "<cs> my advice is that if the amendment does not go in in order to do what the bill intends the sheriff will not be able to try the offence because his existing jurisdiction is not out with his landward area <e> <s> that is why this specific jurisdiction is being sought to be given to the sheriff so that the offending skipper can be tried in any sheriff court <e>", "<cs> in clause the noble lord will find that the offence may be tried <e>", "<cs> it also specifies how the offence is to be tried <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i think it is right that we should be absolutely sure that the powers which we seek to give to the british sea fishery officers under the bill are necessary <e> <s> perhaps i may explain to the noble lord that the powers of british sea fishery officers require to be very widely based because the officers are dealing with immediate situations which arise at sea or in harbour where the commission of an offence could be easily obscured <e> <s> the detection of an offence and the collection of evidence can be frustrated unless the fishery officer is able to search a vessel examine its catch and its gear question the crew and take the vessel to port for further investigation or for detention <e> <s> he must also be able to seize fish if necessary and seize gear and documents for evidential purposes <e> <s> these powers may appear sweeping but they are necessary for adequate enforcement of the bills provisions <e> <s> the powers duplicate those currently available in other fisheries legislation <e>", "<cs> let us take the question of entering premises on shore in order to examine documents relating to fishing activities <e> <s> this ability and the power to search for documents is important if sufficient evidence to prove an offence is to be obtained <e> <s> a requirement first to obtain a search warrant would merely serve notice on the offender and provide time for the incriminating evidence to be removed <e> <s> existing united kingdom primary fisheries legislation does not contain a requirement for a search warrant to be obtained and it would be inappropriate to create such a requirement solely in relation to inshore fishing in scotland <e>", "<cs> i do not want to become involved with the noble lord in points about personalities but it would be a different matter if there was any question of an offence being committed <e> <s> if an offence were being committed by whosoever it may be personal logs or diaries would be legitimate evidence <e>", "<cs> no i do not think that he does <e> <s> the power of the fishery officer is restricted entirely to fishery matters <e>", "<cs> with respect i should perhaps explain that there is nothing new in what we are seeking to do <e> <s> we seek to include in this legislation the same provision as exists elsewhere so we are not seeking to do anything new <e> <s> as i have explained it was purely due to an oversight that this was not included in the original bill <e> <s> we are convinced that it is important and indeed that it is essential for the provision to appear so that under this legislation officers will be acting in the same way as they would act under other fishery legislation <e> <s> for that reason i would ask your lordships to accept the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is nitpicking a little <e> <s> the amendment provides a definition for the term master and it is referred to in several clauses of the bill <e> <s> the definition given is identical to that used elsewhere as i have already explained <e> <s> the master is the person who is presently in charge <e> <s> the term in charge of the boat is used principally to explain the function of the master the person who is at the helm the person who is in charge of the boat at that particular time <e> <s> if the master has to sleep and someone takes over for him then in the terms of this legislation for that period of time the person at the helm is deemed to be the master <e> <s> the term in charge is purely to clarify what the master would be doing <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the explanation is any better than the one i gave <e>", "<cs> i think i can best answer my noble friend by saying that it will be as soon as possible and certainly by the summer <e>", "<cs> i absolutely defend the draftsmen who prepared this bill <e> <s> certainly from my experience in another place i cannot on any occasion recall a bill where there were not a number of government amendments tidying up small matters of this sort which had been overlooked presumably in the anxiety of the draftsmen to make sure that all the major issues were properly covered <e> <s> i think that the draftsmen have done a very good job in this bill and i am glad that even at this late stage they have been sufficiently observant to note those small points and that we are now putting them right <e>", "<cs> no my lords i hope that this will not be the case <e> <s> there have been reductions in the manpower of the health and safety executive but these have been accompanied by measures to use resources more effectively <e> <s> i am happy to tell the noble lord that in fact shortly we shall be recruiting up to new factory inspectors and new agricultural inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord <e> <s> but of course the creation of inspectors will not absolutely guarantee that there will not be accidents <e> <s> everybody who is in the position of employing labour must emphasise to all those who are employed by them whether they be trainees or employees the necessity for observing every possible safety precaution during the execution of their duties <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can explain to the noble lord that where trainees have contracts of employment they are then covered by the general duties owed by employers to their employees under section of the health and safety at work act <e> <s> however under the majority of youth training schemes trainees will not have such contracts and they will therefore be employees within the meaning of the act as it stood before the introduction of the new <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if i misunderstood his original question <e> <s> but i would remind him that the whole area of legislation so far as employment is concerned is a very complex one and i would not care to comment on an area on which i had not been briefed since this question specifically refers to a particular act <e> <s> but i shall make the necessary inquiries and will let the noble lord know in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little doubt that those who read of our deliberations in this place will take note of what the noble lord said <e> <s> i can only confirm to him what i said previously that the health and safety executive are examining the whole area at the present moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the scale of the programme is looked at carefully in the context of the annual review of public expenditure <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that the limited purpose of this programme is kept very much in mind on those occasions <e> <s> as far as the noble lords second point is concerned <e> <s> i see no reason why the partnership between the private sector and the forestry commission should not continue in a harmonious way as it has done for so many years <e> <s> indeed i pay tribute to the very distinguished part which the noble lord played in that association when he was chairman of the forestry commission <e> <s> the difference is that we see the greater part of the programme being carried out by the private sector rather than by the public sector but i can give the noble lord the assurance that the government are still committed to a future planting programme by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the million will he paid into the consolidated fund in the traditional manner <e> <s> of course each year the government subsidise the forestry commission so that a certain amount of that money will be ploughed back <e> <s> how this is used must be for the discretion of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be right to say that the fear as far as the staff is concerned is always regarding future redundancies <e> <s> but if we look at the redundancies which have been declared by the forestry commission only a very few have been as a result of the disposal programme <e> <s> far and away the greater number of redundancies are as a result of the commissions constant endeavours to become more efficient and to develop more modern practices in the execution of their work <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are doing their very best and so are the commission to reassure the staff of the forestry commission <e> <s> i think that the fact that there have been so few redundancies as a result of the disposals programme is significant <e> <s> if the staff are still apprehensive then obviously the commission will do all they can to reassure them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the commissioners have guidelines to which they adhere when they decide upon which areas should be put up for sale <e> <s> certainly the aesthetic value is one which is taken into consideration so also is public access <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a list of the purchasers as the noble lady will appreciate but i can assure her that so far there have been no sales to foreign interests <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would not wish to mislead the noble lord <e> <s> what i said was that the scale of the programme is looked at very carefully in the context of the annual review of public expenditure <e> <s> i also said that the limited purpose of the programme is kept very much in mind <e> <s> i did not say that there would not be any further sales but i indicated that the limited nature is very much kept in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord no such guarantee but i can say to him that the forestry commission have entered into certain long-term contracts and it will be their objective to fulfil them <e> <s> that will also be taken into very careful consideration if and when any future sales are contemplated <e>", "<cs> ross of marnock is another <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that the noble lord is up to his usual form <e> <s> the day that he gets away from all these bills he will be a very sad man and it will be a great loss to scotland <e> <s> now i shall be nice to him <e> <s> i shall tell him exactly where the reference comes from <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord enjoys having the last word <e> <s> i will not deprive him of that <e> <s> i am being nice to myself and that is a nice thing to do occasionally as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove is not being wholly fair in his suggestion that everybody is concerned about the style of this bill <e> <s> that is not what i have found in scotland <e> <s> i have found that the bill has been received with a great deal of acclaim by those involved in the tourist industry <e> <s> the scottish tourist board is highly delighted with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i comment on some of the points that have been put to me by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> first he mentioned the stodart report on a number of occasions <e> <s> i should tell the house that the noble lord lord stodart has dropped me a note saying how sorry he was that he could not be with us today <e> <s> but of course the noble lord will recall that he has welcomed the bill and although it does not go so far as he would have liked and so far as he suggested in his report he has given the bill a warm welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may not have said that in so many words but he did imply that with them moving into the same premises and with one chairman it was a logical step ahead <e> <s> but what i am saying is that no decisions have been taken and the chairman is merely looking at this possibility nothing more <e> <s> the noble lord reiterated a number of arguments which we considered at committee stage some of which were deployed by him at the time <e> <s> but i must tell the noble lord that despite his silver tongue and his persuasive style i still believe that the bill would not be improved by amending it in the way that he suggests <e> <s> i therefore regret that on this occasion i cannot accept the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord ross and his noble friends <e>", "<cs> this amendment is intended to ensure that the scottish tourist board has a say in the scope and style of promotions which the british tourist authority undertakes on scotlands behalf <e> <s> i have no hesitation in saying that i subscribe to the underlying principle which the noble lord has in mind but the key point for the purposes of this discussion on this particular bill is that this amendment is technically unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for raising the matter <e> <s> i can confirm to him that the additional funds available were of course very welcome indeed <e> <s> perhaps i could explain to him however that funds for the arts councils are provided by my noble friend the minister for the arts <e> <s> resources for museums and galleries in scotland on the other hand are provided by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland who supports directly the national museums and galleries in edinburgh <e> <s> he has also quite exceptionally provided substantial funds to glasgow district council towards the construction of the burrell gallery <e> <s> in both cases the government have been able to provide some increases in overall funding at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks and of course i heartily endorse any complimentary remarks which he makes about the scottish people <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt those responsible for those matters will take note of the remarks of my noble friend and of course it is entirely for those who administer the galleries to make decisions on these aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> our debates have served a useful purpose in highlighting the policy intentions behind the governments proposals in this bill <e> <s> i believe that the bill will leave this house not simply with its provisions unamended but with the policy underlying them more clearly understood and i would hope widely endorsed <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should like to thank the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord taylor of gryfe for what they have said and for the welcome they have given to the measure we are taking in this bill <e> <s> i know it would be well nigh impossible for me ever to produce anything which will meet with the full approval of the noble lord lord ross of marnock so long as he occupies the position he currently occupies <e> <s> he takes his duty that of the critic of the government most seriously as he should <e> <s> where there is even mild criticism the noble lord will always make sure it is voiced <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment will be to place a statutory duty on my right honourable friend the secretary of state to consult representatives of the fishing industry before he may make any order under clause of the bill <e> <s> your lordships will be aware from my previous statements on the bill that i am not averse to the idea of consulting the fishing industry over the new regulatory regime to be established when the bill is <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall respond to the comments of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> perhaps i may take his last point first <e> <s> as regards the proposals which we have put forward regarding the nursery areas and static gear reserves we have invited comments and indeed we are receiving comments all the time from fishing associations groupings and from individual fishermen <e> <s> we are very pleased to have them <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords we had consultation at the very outset before the proposals were published when we were looking at areas in which we would be creating nursery reserves and static gear reserves <e> <s> to give one example as a result of representations from fishing organisations in the western isles to officials of the department of agriculture and fisheries for scotland we had a closer look at some of the areas which we were considering and they <e>", "<cs> i shall try to satisfy the noble lord lord ross of marnock the noble lord lord grimond and also my noble friend <e> <s> that may be a difficult task but i shall embark upon it and hope that i may be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords if this amendment is intended to enable the secretary of state to prohibit certain classes of vessels for example by groups according to size from fishing in a particular area it is unnecessary <e> <s> the power to do so already exists in the bill <e> <s> the secretary of state could prohibit vessels over say feet from fishing in a particular area by making an order prohibiting fishing by all vessels except those under say feet that is to say he would use the exception provision in the last line of clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock is not going to hear exactly the same speech again <e> <s> he is going to hear a variation on a common theme <e> <s> if the purpose of the amendment is to prevent the secretary of state establishing the static gear reserves which the government have proposed then i am afraid that it would not achieve that aim <e> <s> it is intended that the areas in question shall be closed only to mobile fishing gear <e> <s> they will remain open not only to fishermen using static gear such as pots or creels but also to passive methods of fishing such as drift nets <e> <s> to that extent they will not be areas for the exclusive use of static gear fishermen and will not therefore be caught by this proviso <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to help my noble friend in explaining the answer to the question which he posed to me <e> <s> but before i do so i should like to say that i know that it would not have been the wish of the noble lord lord ross to lead me down a path which it had not been my intention to travel <e> <s> therefore before i deal with this amendment i must say to the noble lord that we are examining the role of local advisory committees very carefully indeed in the context of quota management and the restructuring of the industry <e> <s> the final format of these committees has not yet been decided <e> <s> i would not however and i repeat i would not see them as statutory bodies but rather as local groupings of fishermen giving advice to the government <e> <s> i emphasised the question of the advisory committees i am sure that they have a very useful role to play but i certainly do not see them as statutory bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour not to complicate matters any further <e> <s> inadvertently i have already answered on the last amendment most of the points which my noble friend raised with me and i take note of what my noble friend added to the debate <e> <s> i shall certainly read the record very carefully to make sure that the various contributions relate to the appropriate amendments and that my replies are similarly blessed <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that this amendment reflects some of the concern which the noble lord lord grimond expressed during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i am sorry if i have not been able to convince him by letter that some of his worries are unfounded <e> <s> nevertheless i shall have another go this evening to see whether i cannot persuade him that this is so <e>", "<cs> my lords the programme is very satisfactory <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend lady elliot of harwood that the number of technology centres established is increasing <e> <s> we hope to increase the number ultimately to <e> <s> the centres are very well subscribed <e> <s> there is no scarcity of sponsorship and the young people who attend the centres are having very great success with a high percentage of them finding permanent employment as a result <e> <s> i may also say that even at the lesser centres if i may describe them in that way there is an obligation to include an element of technological instruction <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not directly related to the question and i cannot give the noble lord an answer at this time <e> <s> i shall however undertake to make myself fully conversant with that point and will write to the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which the noble lord lord hunt makes is a valid one <e> <s> at the present time youth training schemes cover a fairly wide range but we are never satisfied that they are perfect <e> <s> the government are always prepared to review the syllabus so far as they are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that the figure of centres which i gave is a united kingdom figure <e> <s> i can confirm also that some young people will be training in those technology centres in <e> <s> the government are committed to opening at least centres and have so far been established with a further centres at an advanced stage of development <e> <s> but the ultimate figure at which we are aiming is centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what the noble baroness has said that is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the schemes are open to everybody <e> <s> it is the governments hope that individuals from those groups will participate <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as training workshops are concerned about per cent <e> <s> of the existing network of training workshops have some microcomputer training facilities <e> <s> the msc with some financial assistance from the department of trade and industry is planning to equip workshops with a range of information technology facilities in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly the intention of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i made it clear earlier that the technology centres are to a large extent sponsored and there is no scarcity of sponsorship <e> <s> industry is very anxious to play its full part in the furtherance of the excellence of those centres and there seems no reason why any of the lesser schemes should suffer in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for keeping going long enough for me to get the little message that comes on these occasions <e> <s> the order is seen by the joint committee <e> <s> i apologise before i began to speak again i should have said by leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for their general welcome to the statement which i have made this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock acknowledged that the government have made a substantial investment and will be making a substantial investment this year so far as help to shipping services to the islands is concerned <e> <s> as i said in my initial statement the sum is million an increase in real terms of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very interested in what my noble friend lord mottistone has to say on that subject but i cannot give him any comparison at the moment <e> <s> i have no doubt those who read the reports of our deliberations will take note of what he said <e> <s> if they do not i shall remind them so that they can write to him <e> <s> but i must say that i find my responsibilities for the scottish islands just as much as i can cope with at one time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord shinwell for his generous remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i remember well the contribution which my noble friend made to the general administration of these services when he was secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> my noble friend is perfectly correct <e> <s> it would not have mattered how we tried to adjust an ret system the result would have been that any adjustment would have benefited some areas and disadvantaged others <e> <s> as the pattern changed in years to come we could foresee this happening over and over again <e> <s> it was one of the major reasons for the governments deciding not to proceed with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord donnet of balgay for his contribution <e> <s> he is not perhaps fully informed on this matter <e> <s> even at the outset considerable reservations were expressed about the whole concept of ret <e> <s> two of the bodies which the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords this must be a matter for each and every company to decide for itself but i have no doubt that the policy of caledonian macbrayne will be highlighted by what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords my stand on those matters when i was minister of state for energy is probably well known <e> <s> on many occasions i did my utmost to try to persuade people to place orders in british yards <e> <s> i shall certainly continue to do so provided always that the prices are competitive and that delivery is guaranteed <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments comment by way of a treasury minute will be prepared and delivered as soon as possible <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that my position is such that i cannot comment on his other questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock needs no coaching from any other noble lord as to how to make his points in the most appropriate way <e> <s> but the noble lord cannot expect me to be led down the path he seeks to lead me down <e> <s> i am not prepared to comment any more at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who have served in another place are trying to divert me from my brief <e> <s> on this occasion i can assure noble lords that i am not going to be diverted <e> <s> i am not prepared to make any comment <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenamara who is a very experienced parliamentarian is as

from the past a precedent for a firm date being agreed in advance <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on the noble lords comments and i am sure that it will be the governments intention to make their views known at the earliest date <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the seriousness of the matter to which the noble lord has made reference i am sure he will agree with me that it is better that the government consider very carefully their response before making it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider myself to be in a position to give guidance on such an important issue <e> <s> if we are to go by precedent it has always been accepted as the appropriate way of dealing with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the noble lords comment to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in ross and cromarty they did not like that of the party of the noble lord either <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful if short debate giving this bill a welcome to this house if not on all sides a welcome for what it <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is over a period not annually <e> <s> i gave a number of figures in my opening remarks which dealt with the number of houses which have been sold the number of transactions which had taken place <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross referred to <e> <s> in fact the figure is at the present moment and there are a great many inquiries at the rate of about a month which is interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will appreciate i do not have the exact figures before me but i shall certainly endeavour to make them available to him <e> <s> as one might expect in the rural areas generally there is perhaps a greater desire to own ones home than there has so far been in the cities <e> <s> this is a policy which we initiated

will wish to own their own homes <e> <s> certainly it is our intention to give them every encouragement <e>", "<cs> no my lords they are the actual figures of what is spent <e> <s> but notwithstanding the inflation which has taken place i think that the money which has been spent this year is very substantially ahead of inflation-adjusted figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord

member left office in the grant in aid to the board was million <e> <s> i am glad to be able to tell the noble lord that it is now million in and will be million in <e> <s> when income from loans repaid is added the boards expenditure in is likely to exceed million <e> <s> in addition to direct funding of the board the government of course channel very substantial additional sums into the boards area through rate support grant to local authorities through specific assistance to road transport and ferry operators and to agriculture fisheries and other bodies <e> <s> all this reflects our continuing awareness of the problems facing the highlands and islands and the importance of improving conditions there <e>", "<cs> in either event my lords the board is interested <e> <s> it has

move that the draft scheme laid before the house on th february be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross for the way in which he has moved this amendment <e> <s> i cannot agree with him of course and i think that the flaw in his argument is that he revealed the basic dislike of this party towards the whole principle of selling council houses <e> <s> i know that members of his party suggest that they are not against the principle but in every argument which has taken place either in another place or during the second reading debate here that weakness in argument has been revealed <e> <s> the noble lords party is basically opposed to this principle and of course naturally uses every means at its disposal for arguing that case <e> <s> in the case of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie his party is not opposed to the principle of selling council houses and in replying to this amendment i shall try to explain to him why we believe that the course we are following is desirable <e>", "<cs> i think that some of your lordships have been arguing a false case and i shall try to explain why i believe that is so <e> <s> i have sympathy with my noble friend lord selkirk who asked me why i thought the proposal was necessary and i have sympathy with other noble lords who suggested that the discount was too high <e> <s> but the level of discount reflects the fact that any house with a sitting tenant has a substantially lower value than one with vacant possession <e> <s> therefore anything which can be done to encourage a sitting tenant to take advantage of the opportunity which is available to him to purchase his house must ultimately be to the good and to the good of the local authority <e>", "<cs> if i may take the point raised by the noble lord first of all i would not agree that that is necessarily the case <e> <s> if i may answer his question the government obviously took advice on this matter before reaching a conclusion as to the desirable discounts to be offered <e> <s> but of course this could conceivably vary from one part of the country to another <e> <s> but nevertheless i would not agree with him that this was not realistic <e> <s> anybody who has owned property and has had that property occupied by tenants will appreciate that the value of that house is vastly reduced so far as a sale is concerned by the fact that it is occupied by a tenant <e> <s> therefore that must be reflected in the price which is offered <e> <s> as we see it we believe that we have got it just about right regarding discounts <e> <s> we feel that what we are doing here is an encouragement to a group of people for whom this per cent <e> <s> might be the difference between being able to make such a purchase and not <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier we believe that there are probably about people who conceivably could benefit by this decision and i think that it is the right decision in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> in that regard yes <e> <s> the particular group of people to whom i referred could be at a disadvantage but it is our hope that this amendment will not be accepted and that the people who stand to benefit will be enabled to do so <e>", "<cs> i am not going to start up any animosity between scotland and england if i can possibly prevent it <e> <s> but it has been a tradition that scotland on major issues and housing has always been considered one of those major issues has had its own legislation <e> <s> i am dealing with a scottish bill at the present moment and i was asked a question relating to an english bill which i answered as best i could <e> <s> however i would rather direct my attentions towards this tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland amendment bill <e>", "<cs> the improvement to the right to buy increasing the maximum discount to which tenants are entitled from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> will enable more tenants of long standing many of them nearing the end of their working lives or already perhaps in retirement to buy at prices which fairly reflect their tenancy record and the resources likely to be available to them <e>", "<cs> the point is that someone who is an early tenant should not be put at a tremendous disadvantage <e> <s> he or she should not have to think i cannot possibly purchase this house for or years <e> <s> it is reasonable that once someone becomes a local authority tenant and if the policy is to sell local authority houses that person should not be unfairly treated because he or she has been a tenant for only a short time <e> <s> it is equally important that a tenant who has been a tenant for a long time and who has been a good tenant should have terms offered to him or to her which reflect the quality of his or her tenancy <e>", "<cs> as i have already explained to the noble lord we do not consider it reasonable to put new tenants or relatively new tenants at a very great disadvantage <e> <s> they should be entitled to an incentive <e> <s> earlier the noble lord said that he had no objection to the sale of council houses and perhaps he has no objection in principle to the sale of council houses <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the noble lord must not put words into my mouth <e> <s> i was trying to explain that if a tenant has a good record he or she should have the opportunity to see the contribution which he or she has made by way of regularly keeping up with his or her rent and so making a valuable contribution reflected in the price which he or she will pay for the house <e> <s> that is all i said <e> <s> i shall not be drawn into the argument about whether or not a bad tenant should have the same privileges <e>", "<cs> all right <e> <s> i think that it is highly unlikely that a bad tenant would actually seek to purchase his house because most local authority experience is that the bad tenants are not the sort of people with a community spirit who might be tempted to purchase their own houses <e>", "<cs> i have to keep talking for a little while until i receive the answer to that from the box <e>", "<cs> in lieu of an answer from my advisers i can only repeat what i have already said to the noble lord lord ross i suggest that it is highly unlikely that a tenant of the type referred to by the noble lord would be in the position of seeking to purchase a house <e> <s> however i am sure that if we can keep this little debate going for a few more minutes i shall have the proper answer for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has considerable experience of local government and i am sure that he is able to put his own interpretation on what a bad tenant might be <e> <s> but i do not agree with his last comment that this is a socially divisive policy <e> <s> it is anything but a socially divisive policy <e> <s> although it is true to say as regards sales that the more popular houses have been the older houses and the houses in perhaps more desirable municipal areas they are by no means the only houses involved <e> <s> indeed in both glasgow and edinburgh in what one might not perhaps consider to be the most attractive municipal areas there are cases where houses have been purchased which is an encouraging sign <e> <s> there are people who are prepared to make purchases of those houses <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that for one moment <e> <s> i am suggesting that the type of tenant who is community spirited who is aware of the privilege which he has had in having a municipally-owned house for which he has paid rent is certainly the most likely person to wish to purchase that house <e> <s> two types of purchasers live in municipally-owned houses <e> <s> type a is the person who wishes to purchase the dwelling which he occupies <e> <s> type b uses his years as a tenant of a municipally-owned house and during those years he looks for and seeks to purchase a private dwelling outside <e> <s> both those categories of tenants are community-minded and are the type of tenants who are likely to purchase their houses <e> <s> i shall not attempt to define a bad tenant but we all have our own ideas of what bad tenants might be <e>", "<cs> i suppose that if the bad tenant can manage to raise the wherewithal to make the purchase he will benefit by the goodwill of the local authority and the fact that initially all tenants will be looked upon as good tenants <e> <s> however if he is a bad tenant it might be to the local authoritys great advantage if he does buy his house for it would relieve them of a great burden <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble and learned lord in that i think i failed to answer fully one of his earlier points <e> <s> as i now have the information for which he asked i shall try to give it to him <e> <s> his point which was a point also raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock was what contribution had the tenant of two years standing made particularly rent-wise <e> <s> one must accept that after two years the tenant has not made a major contribution by way of rental <e> <s> but the fact that a house has a sitting tenant reduces its market value by about per cent <e> <s> and even perhaps considerably more so that it really does not matter in that context how long the tenant has been a tenant the fact that he is a tenant of the house certainly reduces very substantially the value of the house <e> <s> i think that we <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord is unintentionally misrepresenting what i said <e> <s> he is using the analogy of the house in the private sector which is privately occupied and which is going to be <e>", "<cs> i accept part of what the noble lord says but it is surely reasonable whether we are talking about publicly-owned or privately-owned houses <e>", "<cs> whichever it is it is not unreasonable that the person who has been a tenant for or years should receive a special benefit <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is suggesting that they should receive no consideration because they have been good tenants <e>", "<cs> the valuation of the house with the sitting tenant remains as i said very much less than it would be without a sitting tenant but it is at the discretion of any government to suggest <e>", "<cs> very well the noble lord is not talking about any government <e> <s> let us go back to the private sector <e> <s> if the noble lord lord ross was a large landlord who had a great many houses which were all tenanted and he wanted to dispose of them would he not out of the goodness of his heart think it <e>", "<cs> i think we have dealt with this amendment in some depth <e> <s> i do not think i can agree to accept it <e> <s> i do not believe that it is desirable to accept it and i ask the noble lord lord carmichael whether he will consider withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord mackie and i am sorry i did not deal with that <e> <s> it seems that the answer to his mathematical conundrum has not been provided for me and i shall therefore write to the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to try to explain to the noble lord <e> <s> whether i shall be successful remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock is as charming as ever <e> <s> i shall try to answer <e>", "<cs> this does not deal with anybody else <e> <s> it deals specifically with the child of a tenant and the years spent as the child of the tenant <e> <s> it does not deal with anybody else in that situation <e>", "<cs> our intention in the bill is merely to replace the present discretion to count time spent as the child of the tenant by an obligation to do so <e> <s> we are not proposing to extend the categories of relatives who can qualify to include for example grandchildren nephews or nieces <e> <s> if one started to <e>", "<cs> the provisions are limited to humanitarian cases any child will benefit <e> <s> however i do not think the noble lord could benefit because he has had a break in tenancy and therefore he would not qualify <e>", "<cs> clause extends the list in section of the act of public bodies former tenancy of whose houses can be counted by tenants of district councils scottish special housing associations and new town houses towards the qualifying period for the right to buy and towards discount <e> <s> the basic principle upon which the list in section was originally constructed was that periods spent as tenants of local authorities and analogous bodies should be counted towards the benefits of the right to buy while periods as tenants of government departments and connected bodies should not <e> <s> during the passage of the act we accepted that there should be four exceptions to this general principle in respect of members of the armed forces and the prison service and of employees of the forestry commission and health boards <e> <s> these exceptions were made because tenants of these bodies are often required to occupy tied housing and in many cases are unable to arrange their own housing provision until they retire <e>", "<cs> whatever the merits of such a move might be it could not be embraced by this legislation <e> <s> i fear that it would require primary legislation of its own <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can help the noble lord with his question about how an occupant of a tied house will secure a local authority house <e> <s> such tenants will be allowed to apply for a local authority house in the normal way merely by putting their names on a waiting list <e> <s> the local authority is required to publish its allocations policy and it could not discriminate against former tenants of the public sector as long as they had been tenants of houses which will be added to the list about which we have been talking <e> <s> that will give them the protection which the noble lord seeks for them <e> <s> it will ensure that their period of tenancy in one of those houses will count as far as the local authority is concerned <e> <s> if they decided after the two-year period to purchase then their period of public sector tenancy would also count <e>", "<cs> though it may not be powerful enough to convince the noble lord i am afraid it is a fact <e> <s> the plain truth of the matter is that it would require primary legislation as i said in reply to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> in this legislation we are dealing with local authority housing in the public sector <e> <s> the noble lords lord mackie and lord howie have been referring to housing in the private sector <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie sugested that it would be a good thing to extend this provision to private sector housing <e> <s> i am not in a position to go into the merits of that argument <e> <s> perhaps it would be a very good thing <e> <s> i merely said that it would not be possible to do so in this particular legislation which deals with public sector housing <e> <s> that is the fact of the matter it would not be possible to achieve that change in this legislation <e> <s> it would require a new bill for primary legislation <e>", "<cs> this new clause is very sweeping in its effects <e> <s> it would not only remove the right to buy from most elderly tenants it would also remove the right from anyone who happened to live in a house which the authority could claim was ordinarily let to elderly persons <e> <s> as a result almost all one-apartment or two-apartment houses in scotland might be excluded from the right to buy <e>", "<cs> no i am replying to the amendment which the noble lord moved <e> <s> he moved it in his way i hope that he will let me reply in mine <e> <s> in addition when an authority receives an application to purchase from a tenant a house which has been specially adapted for elderly people it can as an <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross said himself that we must get used to the fact that he is no longer the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> he answers so well for me that i cannot improve on that answer if he is correct <e> <s> it is the local authority <e>", "<cs> the answer is that the sheltered housing is provided by local authorities <e>", "<cs> they can either build purpose-built sheltered accommodation or they can adapt existing houses suitable for old people <e> <s> but the concept of sheltered accommodation is housing which is purpose built in a complex with a warden and an alarm system <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i did try to cover that point when i was replying to the noble lord <e> <s> the council is able to make conditions which would enable them to have a pre-emption on the house when it was resold <e> <s> they have the right of pre-emption and the council can make that condition itself in the type of house which the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> but the complex type of house where there is a warden and an alarm system is already exempted <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that it seems wrong to deprive an elderly person of the right to purchase his or her home and is it not a reasonable safeguard to maintain the housing stock to include a right of pre-emption for the local authority to buy it back <e>", "<cs> houses such as the noble lord describes can be sold <e> <s> they come into the normal conditions <e> <s> if they have not been adapted if they are merely houses which are occupied by old persons then they can be sold in the normal way <e> <s> i do not want to go into the details again <e> <s> i have already described the two different types of either complex sheltered housing or adapted houses <e>", "<cs> i take the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> first of all most of the houses to which he refers are not public sector houses they are private sector houses <e> <s> i think that the majority of the type of houses he has in mind are perhaps cottages on farms or estates which over the years have been occupied by retired persons <e> <s> but if he has in mind houses owned by local authorities then the situation is as i have already described depending on whether the house has been specially adapted for old persons or whether it is merely a house which by custom has been used by old persons <e> <s> so i have already dealt with the three types of house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct in the second suggestion <e> <s> the house is bought back at the market value placed on it by the district valuer at the time of the purchase <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear from what has been said that at least some noble lords opposite are still labouring under the misapprehension that houses which are sold are in some way lost to the housing stock <e> <s> i have tried to make it as clear as i can on several occasions during our discussion that this simply is not the case <e> <s> if tenants were not allowed to buy their homes it does not mean that they would move away the great majority of them would continue to rent their homes often for a considerable number of years <e> <s> this is equally true whether the houses are in rural areas or in urban areas <e>", "<cs> i should like to try to deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> the act already does all that is necessary to safeguard against substantial numbers of former council houses in rural areas being sold as holiday or second homes <e>", "<cs> subsections and of section of the act enable the secretary of state to make an order permitting authorities to impose pre-emption conditions on sales of houses in rural areas provided that more than one-third of the council houses in the area have been sold and that an unreasonable proportion of the houses sold have been <e>", "<cs> i shall have to check on that point for my noble friend <e> <s> an area which has been designated a rural area within an islands or district council speaks for itself <e> <s> i shall have to seek information on whether actual designations have taken place <e> <s> once again i find that by speaking long enough the information has arrived <e> <s> areas as such have not been designated <e> <s> therefore when we refer to rural areas we are merely talking about country areas because no rural area as such has been designated <e>", "<cs> in the interests of brevity and to be in accord with others who have spoken i am tempted just to say that i do not agree and sit down <e> <s> but i hardly think that would be suitable and i should give your lordships the reasons why i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lords amendment seeks to deal with this matter by providing that a tenant who feels aggrieved by a decision of his council to refuse to sell his house may have recourse to the lands tribunal to have the decision reversed <e> <s> however this would add a further stage to the process and an additional complication which i believe is neither necessary nor appropriate to the relatively small number of cases which we expect to arise under this provision <e>", "<cs> the later stages of a sale once an offer to sell has been accepted and missives concluded are not regulated by the tenants rights act <e> <s> rather they are subject to the ordinary law of contract <e> <s> the legal remedy available to a tenant who considers that the district council is failing to complete the sale of his house within a reasonable time is therefore to raise an action of specific implement in the sheriff court requiring the district council to implement the contract enbodied in the missives <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment seeks to convert the proposed new section a of the act from a provision which will enable my right honourable friend the secretary of state to set up a right to repair scheme into a provision which will require him to set up such a scheme <e> <s> i appreciate that the purpose of this amendment is probing <e> <s> the government have made clear that it is their intention to introduce a scheme which will give secure tenants a right to carry out repairs which would otherwise be the responsibility of their landlord and to claim a payment from the landlord for having done so <e> <s> the commitment to introduce such a right was included in the governments manifesto at the general election last year <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is being less than fair <e> <s> we should have been very strongly criticised if we had not prepared regulations and agreed that there should be further consultation upon them <e> <s> i do not envisage that the draft regulations will be available before the early summer <e> <s> there will then be a period for further consultation <e> <s> we should then aim to lay the regulations before parliament in the autumn and the scheme could be brought into operation then <e> <s> or there might even be advantage in delaying its introduction until the beginning of the following financial year <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord that there will be further consultation <e> <s> i believe that it is better to deal with this matter without too much haste <e> <s> i trust that my explanation has satisfied the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me to explain what the government have in mind and i shall try to do so as briefly as i can <e> <s> under common law landlords are obliged to maintain their property in habitable or tenantable condition <e> <s> landlords may also have additional responsibilities with regard to repairs under the terms of their tenancy agreements with their tenants <e> <s> if a landlord fails to carry out a repair for which he is responsible after due notice from the tenant that the repair requires to be undertaken the tenant has a right at common law to withhold his rent until the repair has been completed unless such action is expressly excluded by the terms of his lease <e> <s> in appropriate circumstances the tenant can if he wishes carry out the repair himself and offset the cost against the rent retained <e>", "<cs> i am always a little apprehensive about arguing legal points with the noble lord but i have so often had it put to me both in this house and in another place that in legislation it is desirable <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has argued that the amendment would help poorer tenants and i certainly have some sympathy with this aim <e> <s> i believe however that there is an objection in principle to requiring the landlord to make payments direct to a contractor since it is the tenant who will be responsible for carrying out the repairs <e> <s> it seems to me only fair that if a tenant has undertaken to carry out a repair himself and is responsible for selecting and appointing a contractor and for supervising his work then the tenant should also be responsible for paying him <e> <s> the arrangements between a tenant and his contractor are a matter for them alone <e> <s> it is right that the landlords responsibility and therefore the payment should be to the tenant <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the amendment is designed to ensure that tenants have a clear idea of which repairs their landlord is responsible for and of whether they have the right to carry out a particular repair themselves under the new scheme <e> <s> it will of course be necessary to make clear in the regulations which repairs fall within the scope of the scheme and which do not <e> <s> it is our intention however to do this by means of broad descriptions of classes of repair which are excluded from the scheme rather than by means of a list of specific repairs for example the replacement of a door frame which are included <e> <s> the reasons for this are that there could be no guarantee that a specific list would be fully comprehensive and the nature of a specific repair can vary considerably according to the circumstances <e> <s> repair of a wall for example could cover anything from repairing a small hole in the roughcast to repairing a large crack caused by subsidence <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> he and i have exactly the same objective <e> <s> that is why we are determined to make it absolutely clear what can and what cannot be included <e> <s> but i remind him that this is an enabling power <e> <s> when they are produced the regulations will contain all the information which the noble lord lord carmichael seeks to have included <e> <s> but with respect it is unnecessary to include all this in the bill <e> <s> it will be included in the regulations <e> <s> i have tried to outline as clearly as i can how we are proceeding <e> <s> we are consulting as much as we possibly can <e> <s> we are waiting for observations on the consultation paper <e> <s> we shall take into account those observations and what has been said in another place and indeed here <e> <s> we seek to clarify the position beyond all doubt <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i think that i can help the noble lord <e> <s> landlords in scotland have a common law duty to keep their property in wind and watertight and in a tenantable and habitable condition <e> <s> in addition section of the housing scotland act requires landlords to keep the structure and exterior of their houses in good repair and to maintain in proper working order installations for the supply of gas electricity and water and for sanitation <e> <s> with these limited exceptions however the division of responsibility for repairs between the landlord and the tenant is entirely a matter for agreement between landlord and tenant <e> <s> practice varies considerably from district to district and even within districts where some tenants may be responsible for a particular type of repair while others are not <e> <s> some authorities for example exempt elderly or disabled tenants from responsibility for certain repairs <e> <s> it would not therefore be practical to attempt to list the repairs for which landlords are responsible in regulations which are to apply nationally <e> <s> tenants should be able to ascertain whether a particular repair is their responsibility or the responsibility of their landlord by reference to the terms of the written lease which their landlord is obliged to issue to them under section of the tenants rights act <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie had to say and to the contributions made by other noble lords <e> <s> however i do not accept that it would be appropriate to make the regulations setting up a right to repair subject to affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> generally speaking in recent years it has been the practice to restrict affirmative resolution procedure to cases where the powers are concerned with the alteration or definition of the extent of a statute or with the levying application or management of public money <e> <s> if too many instruments were made the subject of an affirmative resolution the purpose of delegating legislative power would be largely defeated by the time expended in directing the attention of your lordships house to the subordinate legislation <e>", "<cs> this new clause would require authorities to provide tenants with more and clearer information about their tenancies <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the aims of the amendment but i cannot accept that the administrative and financial burden for local authorities which would result from this amendment would be justified <e> <s> the act already requires authorities to provide tenants with a <e>", "<cs> as i explained at an earlier stage we shall have draft regulations by that time but i cannot give the noble lord any guarantee that we shall have the final regulations because when we produce the draft regulations we shall give an opportunity for further consultation <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would agree with that <e> <s> having received comments on the draft regulations we shall take those into account before producing the final regulations <e> <s> we shall therefore not have them within that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords comment but it still does not change my view that he is saying quite clearly however much he may try to disguise it that he is opposed to the additional discount which is being offered to council tenants who as i hope i shall be able to convince the house in due course have a very reasonable right to expect that they will be given such terms <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i shall try to deal with some of the points which have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove said that there is some difficulty over understanding exactly what is meant regarding the figure i mentioned of tenants <e> <s> i said that we estimated that the change to two years from three years will be of immediate benefit to some tenants who will be entitled to buy at the new basic discount of per cent <e> <s> i went on to say later that as i had indicated at committee stage we estimate that between and tenants will benefit from the overall increased discount if they choose to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have mentioned this point in connection with the comments of the noble lord lord carmichael because he asked at what discount the additional houses are to be sold to cover costs <e> <s> the authorities would require to sell an additional houses at the average discounted selling price <e> <s> that is the answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie is correct in respect of his figure of houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for moving his amendment so succinctly <e> <s> we have been round this course once already and have heard most of the arguments <e> <s> he rightly briefly refreshed our memories with the leading arguments that he has developed in the past <e> <s> i agree with him regarding the different types of housing <e> <s> there is sheltered housing in scotland and the basic feature of such housing is that it is provided with an alarm and a warden service <e> <s> sheltered housing may be built in a complex although that is not always the case <e> <s> i agree that there are not nearly enough sheltered housing complexes in scotland <e> <s> but sheltered housing has been excluded from the proposals from the outset <e> <s> it has never been the governments intention to sell sheltered housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am practising <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> i have not been persuaded by what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said <e> <s> but i do congratulate the noble lord on the ingenuity of the argument which he has advanced in support of his amendment <e> <s> i shall try to explain why i cannot accept the amendment and i hope that i may be able to convince the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house i should like to say that i did touch on that point but the noble lord may have missed it because i dealt with it along with a number of other matters <e> <s> local authorities are under the same obligation to house ex-tied tenants as any other applicant on their waiting list <e> <s> local authorities must publish their allocation policies and as far as we can see at present there is no particular reluctance on the part of the local authorities to house people because <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has explained that these amendments would provide that an islands council which wishes to refuse a request from for example a teacher to buy his house in a remote area should have to apply to the sheriff for permission to refuse to sell rather than to my right honourable friend the secretary of state as is proposed in the present clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could clear up a point with the noble lord he referred to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> are we discussing these together <e> <s> is that acceptable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not want to embark upon another amendment if we were not in fact talking about it at the same time <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> provides that the secretary of state shall make a scheme giving a secure tenant a right to carry out repairs and to be reimbursed <e> <s> it seeks to make the requirement to set up a scheme mandatory <e> <s> the present provision in the bill is by contrast an enabling power and it quite properly provides therefore that the secretary of state may make a scheme by regulations <e> <s> we believe that tenants should have this right as we made clear in our manifesto at the general election last june and we are at present consulting on the details of how such a scheme would operate <e> <s> but until we have worked out the details of the scheme it seems right that the power should be an enabling one <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the noble lord during the committee stage on almost all the points he has raised again during the report stage <e> <s> he knows as well as i do what the procedure is <e> <s> i explained it fully at that time but just to refresh his memory i shall tell him that consultations are taking place and have been taking place <e> <s> in due course drafting regulations will be compiled after account has been taken of the representations which are being made to the government rightly by the various bodies which are being consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very crafty <e> <s> he is always trying to get me to put a rope round my neck and i am not going to do that for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have the opportunity of seeing the draft regulations that assurance i can give him <e> <s> the last two amendments which the noble lord mentioned are those which he rightly says are drafting amendments <e> <s> i have looked at those amendments and i am sorry to tell the noble lord that i cannot accept them <e> <s> we had thought that a drafting amendment to the bill should be reasonably clear and easy to undertand much more so than in the case of many other bills we have to deal with very complex bills indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly entitled to his interpretation <e> <s> i have given my view in my opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and myself will be taking part in the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting if short debate on this amendment <e> <s> it would be quite wrong of me not to consider very carefully the contributions which have been made <e> <s> in doing so i should be absolutely frank with the house <e> <s> it would be wrong to suggest nobody has directly suggested this although it has been implied in certain ways that the government have not really considered this matter all that carefully <e> <s> let me remind the committee of what has happened <e> <s> the aim of this amendment is to set up a committee of inquiry into the scottish rating system <e> <s> after all the consideration that has been given to rates over recent years i believe that what is really needed and what is taking place in the bill is action <e> <s> it may not necessarily be action which commends itself to all parts of this committee but the government are trying to do something about the rating system <e>", "<cs> i do not accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the amendment we are debating calls for a committee of inquiry into the scottish rating system <e> <s> it does not specifically deal with the question of local income tax <e> <s> it might be significant if i turned <e>", "<cs> i shall not rule on the relative merit of what might be in order or out of order in your lordships committee <e> <s> that would be out of my province as well <e>", "<cs> by leave of the committee may i briefly say a few words <e> <s> it would be quite wrong of me to be so insensitive as not to appreciate the views which have been expressed in all parts of the committee regarding this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord ross of marnock would be equally reasonable in appreciating that i simply could not accept an amendment of this kind which binds the government to setting up any inquiry of this sort within six months <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord lord ross and to other noble lords who have participated in the debate that if he were prepared to withdraw his amendment i would take it back and discuss it with <e>", "<cs> i do not think i am going to be able to be as sympathetic to what the noble lord seeks to do in this amendment as i was in relation to the last one <e>", "<cs> i shall be surprised shall i put it that way <e> <s> if the committee feels about this amendment as it felt about the last amendment but whether or not that is so i am always reasonable and perfectly prepared to listen to what others have to say <e> <s> but at this stage i shall need a lot of convincing so far as this amendment is concerned <e>", "<cs> i shall try to deal with this point as quickly as i can because i do not believe that there is as much in this amendment as the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has suggested <e>", "<cs> by leave of the committee i shall try to anwer the last point made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> whether he intends to or not he is removing a flexibility with his amendment <e> <s> indeed the amendment might in fact make this useful reform on occasion unfair <e> <s> i urge the noble lord to consider that <e> <s> i am asking him to withdraw the amendment not because i have any vigorous objection to it but because i genuinely believe that if he removes these words there will be occasions where the provision could have an unfair effect <e> <s> i assume that his amendment is in any event a probing amendment <e> <s> i understood it to be so from the way he described it <e> <s> he would do more damage than good if he insisted on pursuing the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment would remove the discretion of the secretary of state in relating apportionment of the needs element of rate support grant to the actual and estimated expenditure of the local authority <e> <s> the point that i am trying to emphasise is that it would mean that the grant reduction would proceed automatically regardless of any special circumstances that there might be in the case of an individual authority <e> <s> that was why in an earlier intervention i said to the noble lord lord ross of marnock that there could be occasions where there would be unfairness if these words are removed <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i shall be able to convince the noble lord <e> <s> i will not be drawn on an argument about may or shall at this stage <e> <s> we are discussing the words in his opinion <e> <s> i believe that by removing those words we should be removing a flexibility and that could have unfortunate effects on the way that the act was interpreted in the future <e> <s> it is for that reason that i disagree <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord does not agree with me but i have my opinion and he has his <e> <s> i am sorry about that <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> by no means <e>", "<cs> it is not on those grounds that i have been arguing against this amendment <e> <s> i have clearly stated my case as to why i do not feel able to accept the amendment <e> <s> the reason is quite simple <e> <s> it is because it removes a flexibility from the secretary of state <e> <s> if we were to accept this amendment it is conceivable that the interpretation of this bill could have unfair and unintended results <e> <s> i do not think that it is the intention of noble lords on that side of the committee any more than it is the intention of noble lords on this side that that should be the case <e> <s> i do not believe the amendment improves the bill at all and for that reason i am not prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> i am not the lord advocate and nor am i the solicitor-general <e> <s> i am not competent to comment on what the result might be in a court of law <e>", "<cs> i am always willing to be reasonable and in golfing terms the noble lord is using up his bisques rather quickly <e> <s> but let me say this to him <e> <s> yes of course i will take it back <e> <s> i will look at this again without any commitment whatever because i am practically sure that the conclusion to which i will come will be the same as that which i have expressed today <e> <s> i shall certainly take it back and have a look at it <e> <s> if i find that my arguments are not as convincing as i believe them to be then we shall look at it again and see what we can do <e>", "<cs> before i answer the noble lord perhaps for the convenience of my noble friend lord drumalbyn i would read out what amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to do <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> i shall try again <e> <s> i doubt that i shall be able to satisfy the noble lord but let me try to deal with one or two of the points he has raised <e> <s> the amendments that he has tabled remove the clear comparison between expenditure and guidelines and replace it with a rather vague relationship based on what his amendment describes as reasonable and consistent expenditure <e> <s> again the term reasonable and consistent is arguable <e> <s> we were arguing a little earlier about the secretary of state in his opinion <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that reasonable and consistent gives just as much cause for argument and speculation as in his opinion would do <e> <s> the noble lord is not substituting anything more positive or easier to define for what is already in the bill <e> <s> the necessary expenditure of authorities in carrying out statutory duties is already provided for in legislation <e> <s> in arriving at the rate support grant settlement each year and particularly the level of relevant expenditure and grant the secretary of state is bound under section of the local government scotland act to take into consideration <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to require the secretary of state to submit the guidance he issues to local authorities on expenditure to the approval of the other place <e> <s> in practice the only guidance he issues are the current expenditure guidelines which are issued in the late autumn each year and indicate what level of expenditure for each authority is considered appropriate by the government <e> <s> these guidelines were first issued in when the party of which the noble lord was a member was in power <e> <s> i doubt whether there was any question of their being submitted to parliament for approval but if i am not correct i am sure the noble lord will very soon correct me <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can answer the noble lord <e> <s> there will not be an opportunity for the house to discuss the individual guidelines because the guidelines are discussed with each local authority and the forum for discussion of the whole concept of guidelines is cosla <e> <s> it is not intended that parliament should discuss those guidelines individually for the reason i explained <e> <s> the time factor is such that local government would be very upset if they thought there was to be a delay in order to allow parliament to discuss these matters at the very time when they want to get on with them <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to suggest to the noble lord that it is intended that the other place should discuss the guidelines <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may at the very outset reassure the noble lord lord carmichael that there are available budget guideline comparisons for i have a list of them here <e> <s> these have been available for some time and i can easiy ensure that the noble lord is given a copy of them <e> <s> there is no difficulty about that at all and i shall be very happy to let him have them in due course <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for answering my noble friend on that point <e> <s> the noble lord of course did not make it absolutely clear and his recollection of the other place is the same as mine that the times are agreed between the usual channels <e> <s> it is perfectly correct that an order can be discussed for an hour and a half but it does not mean that if there are a number of orders relating to similar subjects they cannot be taken together <e> <s> but if they are taken together they are taken together only after agreement has been reached through the usual channels <e> <s> therefore if the house decides that it shall not debate them altogether an hour and a half is allocated for each one <e> <s> it is purely for <e>", "<cs> i think that i should start replying to this debate by putting right two of the claims made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock when he made his opening speech <e> <s> the noble lord is extremely articulate and he is extremely impressive when he is on his feet but he is not always totally impartial <e> <s> therefore i think it only right that i should highlight on occasion some of the suggestions which he makes which might be acceptable by his standards and his beliefs but to which i would take exception <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy for what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie seeks to do <e> <s> there are difficulties which he has recognised <e> <s> i am grateful to him for moving his amendment as a <e>", "<cs> i cannot let the noble lord lord ross get away with that last remark <e> <s> the abatement of rates for industrial companies is certainly helpful but our concern is for ratepayers as a whole <e> <s> tackling the problem of high rates at source high expenditure reduction of corporation tax removal of the national insurance surcharge increases in the tax threshold on investment income the vat threshold all these are major matters which are helpful toall businesses <e>", "<cs> this amendment would restrict rate limitation to years in which the percentage of rate support grant had been reduced <e> <s> reductions in grant percentage have been used by all governments to put pressure on local authorities to reduce expenditure <e> <s> it is in these situations when expenditure is high that general limitation might well have to be used <e> <s> what i said when we were discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and applies equally to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore i am very sorry that i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i must ask the noble lord whether he will consider withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has pointed out this amendment proposes that before making a rate limitation order the secretary of state shall consult each authority affected by it <e> <s> the bill provides that an order may cover one or all three classes of local authorities regions districts and islands <e> <s> all authorities in the class or classes will be affected by the order whether they fix a rate in accord with the order or seek a derogation <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to give a lucid if not too long explanation which i hope may satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment would remove the provision under which an authority which failed to determine a rate in accordance with the rate limitation order would be deemed to have determined its rate in accordance with the maximum increase or minimum increase in the order whichever was appropriate <e> <s> this is intended to deal with the authority which decided to <e>", "<cs> the purpose and effect of the amendment which the noble lord seeks to move would be to remove the provision under which an authority which had failed to determine a rate in accordance with a general rate limitation order would be deemed to have determined a rate in accordance with the rate limit <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord can follow that <e> <s> i do not think i can make it any clearer but i shall try again <e> <s> it would remove the provision under which an authority which had failed to determine a rate in accordance with a general rate limitation order would be deemed to have determined a rate in accordance with the rate limit <e>", "<cs> i do not think we are in disagreement as to whether it is a maximum increase or a minimum decrease in the order whichever is appropriate <e> <s> this provision is to deal with the authority which decided to challenge the government at the expense of its ratepayers either by failing to set a rate in accord with the general limitation order and leaving it with inadequate income to provide essential services or by actually setting a rate involving an increase above the limit <e> <s> deeming a rate is designed to deal with authorities which do not comply <e> <s> therefore the only way that they can have a rate at all is for one to be deemed at the appropriate maximum or minimum <e>", "<cs> i am trying to explain to the noble lord what deeming a rate means <e> <s> if the authority does not fix a rate then the only way that a rate can be deemed is for one to be deemed at the appropriate maximum or minimum <e>", "<cs> that with respect to the noble lord is not actually the point <e> <s> the point is that deeming a rate is intended to deal with authorities which do not comply <e> <s> therefore the only way they can have a rate at all is for one to be deemed at the appropriate maximum or minimum rate <e> <s> if they comply they then make their own rate <e> <s> if they do not comply then one has to be deemed for them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain to the noble lord <e> <s> when a rate limit is set it is set either as a maximum increase or a minimum decrease <e> <s> it cannot be both <e> <s> it is set as one or the other <e>", "<cs> the amendment would prevent an authority being affected by a rate limitation order if its expenditure in the year to which the order applied was no more in real terms than it was the previous year <e> <s> leaving aside the question of definition of real terms on which the amendment is imprecise the government clearly cannot accept this limitation on the general rate control power and i should like to make one or two points about it <e>", "<cs> this amendment is intended to ensure that the consultation exercise with non-domestic ratepayers should proceed along a prescribed timetable as well as under a prescribed procedure <e> <s> the answer to this is simple procedure includes timetable <e> <s> we have already had discussions with the convention of scottish local authorities and the scottish business rates committee on the basis of a draft of a code of practice <e> <s> this draft code has a section headed procedure which includes the time-table <e>", "<cs> i can respond to the noble lord in that i mentioned that at the moment it is a draft code of practice <e> <s> it will not be finalised until the local authorities concerned have been fully consulted <e>", "<cs> clause introduces an important new right for non-domestic ratepayers who do not have a vote but pay more than per cent <e> <s> of the rates <e> <s> it will require them to be consulted before a <e>", "<cs> before dealing with this point perhaps i may put the noble lord lord ross of marnock at ease regarding the question of the code of practice which he raised with me <e> <s> i can confirm to him that there will be absolutely no problem about sending a draft of the code of practice to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have given it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment and for the opportunity it gives me to draw to the attention of your lordships committee the very generous contribution which the government currently make towards the rate rebates given by rating authorities under the rating disabled persons act <e> <s> under section of the local government planning and land act the secretary of state pays a grant to rating authorities equal to per cent <e> <s> of the aggregate amount of the rebates they are required to give under the act <e> <s> the balance of per cent <e> <s> of aggregate rebates which shows as a loss of local rating resources is taken into account in determining total rate support grant and in the distribution of resources element <e> <s> in the governments view there should be some direct financial interest by local authorities in the granting of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this point <e> <s> perhaps i should emphasise that the responsibility for determining entitlement to rebate and the amount of rebate rests with the rating authority <e> <s> the assessors function is to assist the rating authority by providing a certificate of the rateable value attributable to the parts of the lands and heritages qualifying for rebate <e> <s> almost certainly the rateable value attributed by the assessor to the qualifying parts will have been arrived at at least in part by a process of estimation <e> <s> but the basis of any estimates will not change in the same way that estimates of expenditure made before the beginning of a financial year change as the financial year progresses <e> <s> one attribution of rateable value and one related certificate should be sufficient in each case <e> <s> to avoid administrative difficulties it is important that it should be clear that these should be conclusive <e>", "<cs> i always find it difficult to convince the noble lord but probably i am not alone among ministers in that <e> <s> let me say this to him <e> <s> i tried to explain that the basis of any estimates will not change in the same way as estimates of expenditure made before the beginning of a financial year change as the financial year progresses <e> <s> one attribution of rateable value and one related certificate should be sufficient in each case <e> <s> to avoid administrative difficulties it is important that it should be clear that these should be conclusive but the fact that these are conclusive should not necessarily mean that they should not be appealed against <e> <s> it is conclusive <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord anything is conclusive until such time as an appeal is launched against it <e> <s> if there is no appeal against it it is conclusive <e> <s> if the ratepayer concerned considers that he is not being treated fairly he has the democratic right of appeal <e> <s> i really do not understand what objection the noble lord has to that <e> <s> that seems perfectly fair and democratic <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is correct <e> <s> this matter is very complicated and if he is agreeable i shall write to him in due course about it <e>", "<cs> i know that i speak for the whole of your lordships committee when i say how sorry we are that the noble lord lord ross of marnock will have to leave us soon <e> <s> i shall try to answer one or two of the points that he raised before he departs <e> <s> he made the point about rate contribution and suggested that this has always been part of housing finance <e> <s> the rate contribution meets the balance between expenditure and income but there is no right to make a rate contribution where authorities can reasonably be expected to balance their books without it <e> <s> in too many cases nowadays authorities are making contributions beyond what is justified by need <e> <s> i do not accept the noble lords suggestion that reductions in rate support grant are a relevant factor <e> <s> housing support grant is intended to meet the difference between what the authorities can reasonably expect to receive by way of income and what they might realistically be required to spend on their housing account <e> <s> where an authority can balance its books without exchequer subsidy that is without housing support grant i do not see why the ratepayer should be expected to step into the breach <e> <s> nor do i accept that it is unreasonable to expect some increase in rents <e> <s> average weekly rents in scotland are running at only about two-thirds of the level of average rents in england <e> <s> but the average wages of a scottish manual worker are now slightly ahead of those of his english counterpart <e> <s> i do not think this differential can be justified <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross has explained the purpose of this amendment and we <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for speaking in this debate on whether the clause shall stand part of the bill because it gives us an opportunity to put the case for what we are doing in the bill by the addition of this new clause <e> <s> the purpose of the clause which was added to the bill during its committee stage in another place is to require local authorities to include in their accounts a separate account for expenditure under section of the local government scotland act <e> <s> it may be that some noble lords are not completely aware of the contents of section of the act <e> <s> i shall just mention that that is the provision which enables authorities to spend up to the product of a tuppenny rate on expenditure which in their opinion is in the interests of the area and its inhabitants and for which statutory powers do not otherwise exist <e>", "<cs> clause represents what we consider to be a welcome extension of the existing public right to inspect local authorities accounts <e> <s> at present the scottish public may only see the abstract of their local authoritys accounts <e> <s> in england their counterparts may see all the supporting papers relating to those accounts <e> <s> clause extends to scotland the rights enjoyed in england for many years <e> <s> the effect of the noble lords amendment is to require anybody who wishes to inspect their local authoritys books to obtain the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> my right honourable friend will be flattered that the noble lord wishes to confer such power on the secretary of state but i am afraid i must disagree with him on this occasion and resist his amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i can confirm to the noble lord lord ross of marnock that there is a regulation-making power so far as this is concerned <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will bear with me i am almost sure that it will be a negative resolution <e> <s> but perhaps i may write to him and confirm that point <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall be able to reassure the noble lord lord carmichael on the points which he has raised <e> <s> but first lest i forget not that the noble lord lord ross of marnock could ever allow me to forget <e> <s> i can confirm that his recollection that the regulation-making powers are by negative resolution and my own recollection which was the same were correct and that they are by negative resolution <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord selkirk for raising that point but i would remind him that this is a facility which has been available in the past in england and i am not aware of any great difficulty which has been found as far as the english authorities are concerned <e> <s> while accepting that regrettably life being life there are busybodies around and we are all faced with them from time to time i think they are very much in the minority <e>", "<cs> certainly this has not been the experience elsewhere <e> <s> i think it is an added facility which the scottish public can now have so that they will be allowed to take copies if they so desire <e> <s> i think this is an improvement and that it will be operated by local authorities and used by the public with a reasonable attitude <e> <s> obviously a member of the public would not be allowed to be unreasonable and oppressive in demands but again this depends on the circumstances in each case <e> <s> however the -day period for inspection which is to be proposed for the regulations governing access will put a limit on the number of documents it would be possible to produce and inspect <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to my noble friend that there is already a right in the act to take copies of abstracts <e> <s> if some totally unreasonable person were to try to insist that he was provided with a wholly unreasonable number of copies every day of the week for a fortnight then i think the local authority would be not unreasonable in refusing to make this facility available <e> <s> as with many minor things this has to be interpreted with a degree of reasonableness by all concerned <e>", "<cs> i can appreciate the concern which has been expressed by noble lords and by the <e>", "<cs> i accept the point which the noble and learned lord makes <e> <s> however in the event of a serious dispute a decision will ultimately have to be taken somewhere <e> <s> the court would seem to be the appropriate place for that decision to be taken <e> <s> however when i look at the matter again i shall certainly bear in mind the noble and learned lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> most of the points he has made will be resolved at local level by local authorities <e> <s> i shall look again at the question but i must make it clear to the noble lord that i am taking the matter back without commitment <e> <s> i may find that i am unable to find a form of words which is preferable to that which already exists <e> <s> however i give the committee the assurance that i shall take the matter back and look at it in order to see whether the wording can be improved <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord is not objecting to this clause because i believe he would agree with me that it is extending to the public a right which they did not previously have in scotland and which they do have in england <e> <s> while i would agree with him that the fact this right exists in england is not necessarily a reason for legislating just so that we have everything the same in scotland as we have in england as this right is available in england i believe it is proper that we should be making it available in scotland <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord has a perfectly fair point <e> <s> again this would be a matter for each individual case to be decided <e> <s> there might be special circumstances in which a member of the public would have a justifiable interest in the costs in which a private tenant was involved in respect of a certain type of repair <e> <s> but the individual concerned the member of the public would have to be able to convince the authorities that he had a reasonable need to have that information <e> <s> it would then be decided at local level <e> <s> if it could not be decided at local level and there was a dispute it would have to be resolved by the court <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not think it is different from what i said earlier <e> <s> the noble lord has now reverted to the question of what type of person would have right of access <e> <s> the answer i gave earlier and which i repeat now is that the right of access would be the same as that which presently exists in england <e> <s> that is not only that a ratepayer or an elector has a right to examine and in this case take a copy of the papers which are there in support of the abstract of accounts but that any particular individual who wishes to seek more information about the accounts of a particular local authority has a right to go to the local <e>", "<cs> yes i will look at that again <e> <s> i take the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> presumably his argument would be that if an individual was not interested then he would not seek to look at the accounts anyway and therefore the word may be superfluous <e> <s> i will certainly examine this again <e> <s> if it is possible to improve the wording then we shall look into this at the next stage <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that i can be helpful to the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> scotland has had considerable success in attracting investment in the electronics industry <e> <s> this year has seen the announcement of investment of million in major expansions of national semiconductors and hewlett packard and the decision of shin-epsu handotai to establish a silicon manufacturing plant in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it has ever been suggested that investment in those industries started only recently <e> <s> what i am proud to say is that under the careful nurturing of this government the investment is continuing to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble lord that the package announced in the recent budget means that the reductions in capital allowances have allowed the government to reduce <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern of the noble countess on this matter but regrettably it is not possible to exterminate the grey squirrel which has successfully established itself in this country following widespread introductions at the end of the last century <e> <s> money for research is made available by the natural environment research council through its grants and studentships to universities <e> <s> the forestry commission the institute of terrestrial ecology and the nature conservancy council also undertake research on grey squirrel control methods damaging behaviour by grey squirrels and the interaction between grey and red squirrels <e> <s> unfortunately i do not have a note of the total amount which the noble countess asked for and perhaps i could write to her with that information in due course <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there is no doubt that under the forestry commissions forestry grants scheme higher grants are available for the planting of broad-leaved trees on suitable sites the <e>", "<cs> my lords my best information would be that the relationship between them is remote but the ultimate results are similar <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can tell the noble baroness that over the past five years the forestry commission and the private sector taken together have planted on average some hectares of broad-leaved trees per annum <e> <s> this figure covers both new planting and re-stocking <e> <s> in addition a large number of broad-leaved trees are being planted for amenity <e> <s> the forestry commissions recently published <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible to give a precise figure for the rates of grant paid by the forestry commission for planting under the older grants schemes <e> <s> the reason is that there was no difference between the grants available for broad-leaves and for conifers <e> <s> the amounts were not kept separate and therefore i cannot make an apportionment in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot help the noble marquess without notice of that question <e> <s> i shall certainly get the information for him and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords to take first the third point raised by my noble friend the answer is very soon <e> <s> as regards the first two questions dealing with the last financial year these are very detailed and since the information available to me at the moment is for the five-year period i am afraid i cannot help my noble friend <e> <s> but will let him have the information in due course <e> <s> the estimated amount of grant aid provided by the countryside commissions for broad-leaved planting is more than three times that provided by the forestry commission the countryside commissions being and the forestry commissions <e> <s> i shall let my noble friend have the detailed information he requests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friends knowledge is superior to mine on this occasion <e> <s> i shall have to make inquiries and let him know the answer to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as one of that species myself i take the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friends credit me with very much more knowledge than is at my fingertips <e> <s> i shall certainly make the necessary inquiries and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my answer was not acceptable to the noble lord <e> <s> i can assure him that our concern is every bit as great as his for those who work for british or for international organisations <e> <s> but the government believe that in general terms and conditions of employment including those relating to dress should be left to be agreed between employer and employee or their representatives without the intervention of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not aware of any circumstances in which the matter which the noble baroness has raised would be violated <e> <s> yes the situation is that if the employees refused to comply with the banks dress regulations and were dismissed for that refusal under the provisions of the employment protection legislation they would have the right to complain of unfair dismissal to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> the tribunal would then have to decide whether the employer has a fair reason for the dismissal and whether he had acted reasonably in all the circumstances in dismissing the person for that reason <e> <s> as far as the sex discrimination act is concerned if the ladies in question felt that they were being discriminated against they would have every right to go to an industrial tribunal and have their case dealt with in the way that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting thought <e> <s> the proposition has not arisen but the dress regulation is something which we genuinely believe is best left to the employer-employee relationship or to those representing them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the general intention is rather the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords there is absolutely no question of the bank being allowed to disregard the laws of this country <e> <s> the laws and procedures are there <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the procedures are clearly laid down and those who are involved have every right to follow them <e> <s> it is not a matter for government intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to intervene in this exchange <e> <s> i think we all listened with a great deal of appreciation to what the noble lord lord henderson said <e> <s> i would not presume to try to answer for the noble lord lord molloy on such occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful debate this morning <e> <s> during the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly not the impression that i intended to give <e> <s> i say in all sincerity that this government have done everything they reasonably can do to examine the whole rating system and to see if they can come up with something which would be an improvement and which would not create as many anomalies as it resolved <e> <s> we have to admit that we have not been able to do so and we have now produced a bill which we believe goes some way towards rectifying the wrongs <e> <s> we accept that it is not perfect <e> <s> but as i have explained we do not believe that we could have done anything better at this time nor do we believe that the setting up of yet another committee to look into the rating system of scotland is desirable <e> <s> for that reason i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little surprised to see a further attempt to amend this clause which has received very full consideration and is generally regarded as an improvement on the current <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment proposes that before making a rate limitation order the secretary of state shall consult each authority affected by it <e> <s> now all authorities will be affected by the order whether they fix a rate in accord with the order or seek a derogation <e> <s> consequently the amendment if carried would require the secretary of state to consult each and every authority before making the order <e> <s> this is clearly impracticable and completely at variance with the procedure accepted over many years for consultation on the rate support grant order which also affects every authority <e> <s> there is a well-established principle of collective consultation with the convention on matters that affect all authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must have an awful lot of thumbs because the secretary of state met cosla six times last year <e>", "<cs> this amendment has one simple but quite unacceptable purpose to remove the power to control rates <e> <s> our intention to take this power was clearly stated in our manifesto and in the white paper published in august of last year <e> <s> there was never any doubt about it and there was never any question about it <e> <s> so it was clearly spelt out in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the noble lord that it has not been considered by that body <e> <s> however we believe that it removes an anomaly which now exists and that it is in the long-term interest of those who occupy shopping malls in scotland <e>", "<cs> what in reality will happen my lords is that the facilities afforded by a mall will be considered when the individual assessments are made for the shops benefiting within that mall <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to deal with the points which your lordships have raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross asked me what check there will be <e> <s> the rating authority will decide <e> <s> it could be after application by a ratepayer <e> <s> the noble lord may also like to know when the relief will end <e> <s> the rating authority obviously would monitor the situation <e> <s> under section of the local government scotland act rates are not payable on lands and heritages unoccupied and unfurnished throughout the financial year or from the time of first entry in the valuation role <e> <s> where lands and heritages are unoccupied and unfurnished continuously for more than three months rates must be remitted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord ross of marnock for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue and also for giving me the opportunity to set out the governments position as i see it in relation to these problems <e> <s> i am sure too that i speak for everyone when i say how sorry we are that the noble lord will not be with us for the final stages of the bill <e> <s> we know of his eyesight problem <e> <s> all of us hope that the operation that he is to undergo will be per cent <e> <s> successful and that he will be back with us in the very near future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the contractors principle would have been applied in relation to the bowling club to which the noble baroness has referred <e> <s> of course that club would be affected by this legislation and could apply in that way <e> <s> when the appeal was being heard the club could cite other examples to prove or to try to indicate that its assessment was unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to answer my noble friends question when does new become old <e> <s> the revaluations would alter the situation from time to time but anything which is new would be assessed on the contractors principle pertaining to the value at that time <e> <s> as i was explaining to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie this covers the point made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> everywhere <e>", "<cs> i explained in considerable detail that we would not be prepared to accept the noble lords amendment because we take the view that we are going a considerable way towards what the noble lord seeks to do in the bill which is before your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord was quoting from the august white paper <e> <s> i too should like to quote from that white paper <e> <s> on page the last sentence in paragraph clearly states <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i think that i made the position clear when i said that so far as comparisons are concerned to provide a comparison in scotland there must be a let subject for comparison <e> <s> in cases in which there are no comparisons in scotland then there is encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it may appeal against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon <e> <s> i am already being corrected <e> <s> as regards the example which the noble lord lord mackie gave it cannot appeal against a contractors valuation in scotland <e> <s> but i shall await the advice which i hope to receive in a few minutes and will elaborate on the point for the noble lord lord mackie <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point i would not disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is hoped that the revaluation in scotland will take place in <e>", "<cs> my lords given the concern that has been expressed on this subject i hope noble lords will bear with me if i set out the position in some detail so as to explain clearly the governments attitude to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend will agree with me that when the assessment is made by the assessors various factors are taken into consideration <e> <s> if a hotel has ski-ing facilities or is located in an area which is extremely handy to the ski slopes then i think my noble friend can be fairly sure that that is taken into account in arriving at the actual valuation of the hotel <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with my noble friend and i can tell her that she can of course appeal <e>", "<cs> under this legislation and the grounds which she submits will certainly be considered in that appeal <e> <s> i should go so far as to suggest that i think under this legislation she would have a very much better chance of achieving her objective than she has had in the past <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i had many dealings with my noble friend lord lauderdale in my last job as an energy minister where his very great knowledge was often of use to me <e> <s> i am sorry that he could not be more helpful this afternoon <e> <s> nevertheless i shall answer his question <e> <s> the answer is i am afraid in the negative because i do not believe that it is right to take something back unless you genuinely believe that there is a possibility that you might be able to do something about it <e> <s> i am afraid with the greatest respect to the noble lady lady saltoun that i do not consider there is a likelihood that i would be able to do anything between now and third reading <e> <s> i have explained as fully as i can why it is not possible to do something <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for giving me the opportunity to say that the measure he proposes to introduce to ensure fairer valuation for rating for accommodation shared by unrelated adults is very substantially the same as the measures introduced by the government in the local government and planning scotland act and the valuation communal accommodation scotland order <e> <s> the order was approved by your lordships house on th march last <e> <s> the noble lord suggested to me that assessors were reluctant to implement that order <e> <s> it is true that like many such new orders it had certain teething troubles but we now have those sorted out and the provisions are being implemented largely as a result of advice taken from the scottish office <e> <s> i can give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> the order prescribes that the values of those lands and heritages <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that my information is that the teething troubles in implementing the order have now been largely resolved <e> <s> i shall look into the matter more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has raised again the question of providing more help by means of rate relief for small businesses <e> <s> the amendment now before us is a revised version of that which we had in committee but its scope is narrower than before <e> <s> as i made clear when we discussed this issue in committee the government are very sympathetic to small businesses and are aware of their importance in the economic life of the community <e> <s> in every sphere of the governments activities we have looked at ways of helping small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in little doubt that it would take a very much better man than me to convince the noble lord <e> <s> i have been trying for years to convince him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always realised the desire of the noble lord to seek learning and information and so i felt that any extra information that i was able to provide would be welcomed by him <e> <s> however i must ask your lordships to reject this amendment because it removes from the bill the necessary and just provisions which require valuation appeal committees and the lands tribunal for scotland to take into account the date as at which the values of the comparable english properties were fixed and substitutes totally inappropriate provisions requiring the valuation appeal committees and the lands tribunal for scotland to take into account in considering the valuation placed on a property the rate poundages in different areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the remarks of all noble lords opposite who have given such enthusiastic approval to the amendment which i have proposed <e> <s> it is good to know that they are grateful even for small mercies and of course we welcome their approval <e> <s> i should just very briefly say to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that i think i would weary the house if i were to reiterate what i said the last time that we discussed this matter when i listed i think very substantial contributions which the government made towards the wellbeing of small businesses <e> <s> i was sorry that i was not able to meet him on the amendments which he proposed in this bill but i think there were ample reasons for not doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause will go in its new place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this bill as has been enunciated all the way through is to help ratepayers by protecting them against local authorities planning high expenditure and setting high rates and by resolving valuation anomalies <e> <s> these are familiar words <e> <s> every member of the government speaking on this subject has been at pains to make clear the central intent of the bill <e> <s> it is not i repeat it is not about ending local government in scotland as claimed by some of its more histrionic critics <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> we have directed a good deal of attention to the valuation and rating relief measures in this bill <e> <s> we believe that these will make useful changes to a system which although basically sound has thrown up a number of areas where reform is merited <e> <s> in there will be an all-scotland revaluation <e> <s> difficult or contentious appeals may now by virtue of clauses and go straight to the lands tribunal for scotland which will ease the burden of valuation appeals committees <e> <s> in other clauses we have removed some of the anomalies which have given rise to problems for example caravans shopping malls reed beds and swinging moorings <e> <s> we have had thorough debates about the valuation of sports grounds and similar subjects <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> focuses on one particular restriction allowed for by these subsections namely that the electorate can be restricted by trade or occupation <e> <s> in detail the amendment seeks to extend this exemption so that trade unions could restrict seats on their executive not merely to members in a class determined by reference to trade or occupation but also to members in a class determined by reference to profession office employment grade status craft or calling <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> he is very easy to listen to and one always enjoys his contributions <e> <s> but perhaps on this occasion i could highlight the difficulty of having an academic looking after trade union affairs or speaking on behalf of trade unionists because they see problems where problems do not exist <e> <s> on this issue it really is the noble lord who has failed to understand the bill <e> <s> clause says that the word section includes any part of the union which is itself a trade union <e> <s> it does not say that section means a section which is itself a trade union <e> <s> the word includes is the key <e> <s> sections can be or cannot be trade unions <e> <s> the definition of section includes both <e>", "<cs> i shall very quickly answer the noble lord lord lloyd because i sense the feeling of the committee that there are other amendments which we are anxious to get on to and which are of major importance <e>", "<cs> but let me not neglect the duty of a minister to answer points <e> <s> i am grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord lloyd albeit rather late in the proceedings <e> <s> nevertheless i would reiterate to him that the word section covers both those parts of the union which are trade unions in their own right and those parts of the union which are not <e> <s> i tried to make that as clear as i possibly could and i reiterate it for the benefit of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have always operated on the belief that if you take something away you take it away with the genuine intention of seeing whether you can change it <e> <s> i do not believe that if i took this away i would come back with any different suggestion <e> <s> therefore i would be misleading the committee if i took it away so i suggest that the noble lord should negative this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton will agree that we have already discussed this matter in some detail under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it revolves around the difference between opportunity to vote and entitlement to vote <e> <s> therefore i shall try to deal with it fairly briefly <e> <s> i can best do so by describing just exactly what the bills provisions on entitlement to vote are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the amendment made in another place <e> <s> unfortunately the new clause inserted in the bill when this house gave the bill its third reading was drafted to refer to the ascertainment of gross annual value whereas moorings that are in valuation will be valued to net annual value by virtue of the act and reference should correctly be to this <e> <s> for that reason we have introduced the further amendment to substitute net for gross <e>", "<cs> at the outset i should like to say that i have considerable sympathy with the arguments which have been put forward by the noble lord lord rochester and i have listened very carefully to the support which he has received from the noble and learned lord lord denning my noble friend lord renton and the noble lord lord hankey <e> <s> let me deal with the whole issue which we are considering at the present moment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord rochester replies to the debate may i just correct the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> the bill does not do what the noble lord suggests that it might do <e> <s> it merely allows unions to restrict candidature through their own rules if that is what they wish to do <e> <s> the bill is entirely permissive in this repect it is not mandatory <e> <s> might i also say that i am glad to have the support for our view from the noble lord leading for the official opposition <e> <s> the occasions on which we find ourselves in agreement are relatively few and i am glad that on this occasion at least we are of like mind <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause makes clear that the bill does not require a ballot to be held where there is only one candidate at an election <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not being unreasonable in his request <e> <s> if he believes that there is some purpose in the amendment which the government have not seen and which i have been unable to see and if he cares to withdraw his amendment and then to discuss it with me or write to me in some detail i give an assurance to the noble lord that without commitment i shall have another look at the matter <e>", "<cs> i can quite appreciate why the noble lord lord wedderburn would feel strongly about clause because there are a certain number of issues on which he feels that matters have not yet been resolved <e> <s> but i think that my noble friend lord gowrie explained quite clearly the process which is taking place at the moment and how the government hope to set about what action they may take as a result of the success last thursday evening of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord howie of troon for moving his amendment so succinctly <e> <s> the whole committee knows of his particular interest in this subject <e> <s> i shall try to respond as constructively as i can to what he has said although i have little doubt that it will not be exactly in the terms he would wish to hear <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps clarify the position because it really is quite clear <e> <s> if a group inside a trade union meets the statutory definition of a trade union under the act then part i of the bill applies <e> <s> if it does not meet the definition then part i does not apply <e> <s> that to me seems to be a perfectly clear and simple proposition <e> <s> it is as straightforward as that <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mccarthy and his noble friends which is similar to an amendment considered and rejected at committee stage in another place would be to allow unions to provide themselves with immunity far in advance of the likely climax of negotiations by holding a ballot at a time when the prospect of industrial action was so far off as to be unreal to the members being asked to vote <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy has described to your lordships committee the meaning of his amendment <e> <s> he has described it as something which is fairly innocuous and which merely gives to the unions a right to retain their immunity <e> <s> but it would give to unions a right to retain their immunity irrespective of whether they ballot their members <e> <s> as such it is clearly designed to enable unions to frustrate the intentions of this part of the bill in the simplest way imaginable <e> <s> unions should always give proper strike notice <e> <s> what the amendment says in effect is that so long as they do so it is quite all right for them to ignore the views of their members <e>", "<cs> in view of the variety of circumstances which may apply in different industrial disputes the bill quite deliberately does not include a universal ballot question which must be asked in every situation <e> <s> clause however requires the ballot paper to include a question however framed asking members whether or not they are prepared to take strike or other industrial action which would involve them in breaches of their contracts of employment <e>", "<cs> on a simple logical basis i can see absolutely no reason why trade unions should be able to finance meetings of this sort in effect political caucus meetings because that is what they are <e> <s> there is no case for them being able to fund such meetings out of their own general funds <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i do not see the difference <e> <s> i do not agree the argument put forward by noble lords <e> <s> i do not think therefore that noble lords opposite can argue that paragraph <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment which the noble lord has moved would be to take all meetings at which party business is conducted out of the definition <e> <s> that i am not prepared to accept <e> <s> but in view of what he has said i shall agree to consider this matter further though i must make it clear that i cannot accept the amendment in its present form <e> <s> i am prepared to have another look at this <e>", "<cs> what i was suggesting to the noble lord was that i did not really see why it should be necessary or indeed why it would be right for a union to use union funds for the purpose of furthering an election of that sort and using those funds without necessarily having the full authority of its membership <e> <s> that was what i suggested to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn has as always given us a very interesting account of his reasons for supporting amendment no <e> <s> a but i think that many of your lordships would agree that everything he said merely confirmed that it is based on an entirely false analogy between trade unions and companies <e> <s> the proper analogy is not with companies but with unincorporated employers associations and they are correctly covered by clause of the present bill <e>", "<cs> i accept that the noble lord did not move the amendment but if he did not move it he certainly spoke to it <e> <s> i think he would agree that he did as did his noble friend last night when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> make reference to the subject <e> <s> i think i have got the messsage and the point he was making in any case and i shall do him the courtesy of trying to answer it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord if i answered most of the points in my earlier remarks when i was dealing with the previous amendment <e> <s> but i was somewhat misled by his noble friend when he referred to this amendment and i had not appreciated that it was the noble lords intention to move it later <e> <s> i apologise to him <e> <s> i shall not weary the committee by once again going through my brief with my answers to him <e> <s> but he raised some additional points and of course we shall look at them very carefully and read what he said <e> <s> indeed i suspect that it would be more appropriate for me to draw much of what he said to the attention of colleagues because it does not directly relate to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware of the very deep interest which my noble friend takes in these matters <e> <s> on this particular issue i can <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord john-mackie asked any of those who have recently purchased their holdings they would say that they were highly delighted at the opportunity so to do <e> <s> those holdings have long since fufilled the purpose for which they were originally acquired and they are an increasing financial liability <e> <s> i will remind the noble lord that the cost of administering those holdings now amounts to almost million per year <e> <s> the government made perfectly clear what their policy was in respect of this matter and it has been welcomed by those who have the opportunity to purchase <e>", "<cs> my lords i would with respect suggest to the noble lord that he is confusing the two issues <e> <s> there is a perfectly reasonable case for doing exactly what the government are doing <e> <s> i repeat what i said earlier the governments policy is highly welcomed by those who have the opportunity to purchase just as the governments policy of allowing council tenants who purchase their houses has been warmly applauded by all those who have availed themselves of that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to both noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord grimond for their comments on the statement <e> <s> i will begin by saying how glad we all are to see the noble lord lord ross of marnock with us <e> <s> today he sees through a glass darkly but we feel sure that before long he will be restored to full vision <e> <s> i believe that i speak for everyone on this side when i say how delighted we are that his illness does not appear to have affected his persistence in criticising any measures we put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble lord that when he is arguing with me he never ceases to bring in any factor which he thinks will improve his argument <e> <s> i reserve the right to do the same when i am replying to what he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lady for that comment <e> <s> i should have said that of course i shall make them available in the library for the benefit of any noble lords who wish to see them <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise of course that the noble lord is very concerned about the question of unemployment as are all of us <e> <s> his question related directly to long-term unemployment and it was with that in mind that i answered it <e> <s> but the noble lord like myself i have no doubt will be delighted at the announcement made by the secretary of state for employment today that over a quarter of a million more people are in employment at the present moment than a year ago and that this is the biggest turnaround since <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> i have no doubt that if they were really being honest with themselves many noble lords opposite would wholly agree with his sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble lord that the government care enough to insist on tackling the causes of the problem left unchecked for so many years <e> <s> government policies to set right the macro-economic framework are the only way to achieve sustainable growth in output and jobs <e> <s> we have also made substantial increases in special employment and training measures to help those worst affected <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord that we are spending nearly billion in total this year and are currently bringing direct help to about people <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise the very great concern of the right reverend prelate particularly in regard to his own area about the cause of unemployment <e> <s> i do not know that he has identified the answer adequately <e> <s> i think that we must be realistic in this matter <e> <s> as i said in my earlier statement i do not think there is any point in trying to create make-believe jobs <e> <s> i think that by following the policies which we are following and which are now giving every sign of a recovery we can best cope with the kind of problem which the right reverend prelate identifies <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it absolutely clear that the government have never pretended that they had any automatic solution to the question of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have gone through a period of considerable difficulty in unemployment <e> <s> we have developed our policies with the intention of improving the situation <e> <s> those policies are now beginning to take effect and i should have thought that noble lords opposite would have welcomed this improvement rather than cast doubts upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i take careful note of what my noble friend says and of course i shall pass on his views to those responsible for preparing the government programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond has rightly identified the purpose of the question which relates to the long-term unemployed <e> <s> help is available through the community programme which will provide temporary job opportunities for up to participants in a full year <e> <s> the secretary of state announced on th november that the programme would continue for a further two years until october on the basis of filled places <e> <s> apart from the community programme other of the governments employment and training measures provide help to the long-term unemployed <e> <s> thus for instance over a quarter of those who have benefited from the enterprise allowance scheme and over half of the participants in the voluntary projects programme are people who have been unemployed for over a year <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting observation but i wonder whether it might have far-reaching implications which would require a great deal of thought before any final decision could be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> i think it is quite wrong that we should allow the very serious question of unemployment to degenerate into a party political knockabout <e> <s> certainly we on this side of the house have no intention of following that course <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are doing a very great deal about it <e> <s> i think that the greatest contribution that could be made by the labour party in general and particularly in another place would be if they came out four-square behind those who want to work and condemned those who do not want to work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me what would be my definition of a make-believe job <e> <s> i would suggest that a make-believe job is a short-term job created by pumping money ridiculously in my view into sectors of the economy where jobs are going to be created thus making people believe that the jobs are of a long-term nature when in actual fact they will be of very short duration <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do the noble lord the courtesy of answering him though i think that comment is barely worthy of an answer <e> <s> i think i have identified the governments policies and their successes sufficiently this afternoon to enable him to grasp them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that i have never been more serious about anything but the national coal board did make clear to the conciliation service and the mining unions its readiness to give full weight to the advice of an independent advisory body appointed to consider disputed proposals under the colliery review procedure <e> <s> but it would be completely unreasonable for anybody to expect the board to relinquish its responsibility for managing the coal industry <e> <s> the staff of the national coal board are expert in the geological and mining engineering questions which affect the coal industry and they are dealing with them on a day-to-day basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really amazed at a parliamentarian with the experience of the noble lord making a statement of that sort from the dispatch box <e> <s> mr macgregor as chairman has made the miners the best offer in the industrys history a generous pay award a guaranteed job for those wishing to stay in the industry generous assistance for those transferring to other jobs or leaving the industry massive investment in the coal industrys future and an enterprise scheme to help bring new jobs to mining areas <e> <s> if mr scargill had the real interests of his miners at heart he would accept the boards remarkably good offer as other mining unions have already done and stop scare-mongering <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his observations which of course are accurate but it is no part of the governments intention to do other than give wholehearted support to the coal industry and indeed the steps which my honourable and right honourable friends have taken since have wholly committed them to this <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i could not disagree with anything that my noble friend has said <e> <s> i think his assessment of the situation is accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect the view of the noble baroness of course but i think that if she will do her research and read precisely what has been put on offer to the miners she will find that the statement which i have made this afternoon is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend will realise that those factors are well known to both sides who are negotiating <e> <s> the actual up-to-date figures are that producing faces have already been lost and a further faces are causing serious concern at collieries throughout the british coalfields <e> <s> this is a very serious situation and one which many working miners will be appalled about when they realise the potential consequences <e> <s> i am sure that everybody on this side and i am sure on both sides hopes that the negotiations which are taking place today can be concluded satisfactorily and that mr scargill will appreciate the benefit of what he is being offered set aside his political views and settle on the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made it absolutely clear that the national coal board is <e>", "<cs> my lords so far every move which has taken place towards a solution every move every concession has been made by the national coal board <e> <s> so far there is no evidence whatsoever that mr scargill is prepared to concede one iota <e> <s> therefore i reiterate to the noble lord that what he asks for in his question the national coal board is prepared to some degree to accede to <e> <s> it is prepared to take due note of advice of a body such as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> but i would reiterate that the ultimate management must be in the hands of those who manage and that is the national coal board <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the comments of my noble friend but to stick as closely as i can to the terms of the noble lords question i have indicated that the coal board would be prepared to take on board the view of any such body but that theirs must be the ultimate decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble lord that one union has already negotiated and reached a settlement on terms which it considers to be fair to both sides <e> <s> if the national union of mineworkers would adopt a similar approach the whole question of the strike would be resolved today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the attitude of mr scargill in this dispute and particularly of some of those from whom he has sought counsel makes it very difficult to keep personalities out of this <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal with the first question that the noble baroness put to me i would mention to her that revised guidelines based on the original proposals have been put to the consumer councils and these are now the subject of discussions between the councils and the electricity and gas industries <e> <s> she asked me whether in the event of the consumer councils being dissatisfied they had redress to the minister <e> <s> of course as a final resort they can appeal to the secretary of state if decisions are taken with which they do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested indeed to hear the noble lords comments <e> <s> i hesitate to take issue with anyone of his experience particularly in relation to the nationalised industries <e> <s> but there is a consumer council for each of the industries to which we have referred <e> <s> it is my belief that they do a valuable job <e> <s> indeed i think that they represent the public to a considerable extent in these matters <e> <s> i pay tribute to them for the contribution that they make <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the noble lord and with the point which he makes <e> <s> i should be reluctant to advise the industries concerned that they must follow to the letter the suggestion which he has made <e> <s> but i believe that the more contact which the general public have with the consumer councils representing the industries the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that the consumer councils have a very important input to make <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that in their response to the first report of the select committee on energy of the session on electricity and gas prices the government made clear that they agreed with the select committee that consumer councils should not have statutory powers to veto or delay tariff increases <e> <s> i go along with the noble lord in his suggestion that of course they should be consulted <e> <s> indeed in the vast majority of cases they are and should be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make it clear enough for the noble baroness but i thought i made it clear that decisions have not finally been taken on future tariffs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friends and i have always made it clear or tried to make it clear that the energy industries are designed in our view to run on long-term marginal cost <e> <s> this is simply the cost of supply on a continuing basis including replacement capital cost and a satisfactory return on capital employed <e> <s> that is the basis on which we endeavour to run our energy industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend is very penetrating in his questions to ministers but i really cannot be held responsible for speculative journalism <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy which the government have followed is to fix the efls with the rate of inflation in mind <e> <s> that is a policy which they will continue to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of course of the very great interest that the noble lord takes in these matters <e> <s> i would suggest to him however that the efforts being made in this field by the secretary of state for energy are very considerable <e> <s> in september he announced plans for the energy efficiency demonstration scheme to be expanded to a total of over projects at a cost to government of million <e> <s> this scheme is aimed at achieving million a year savings on fuel bills <e> <s> indeed it has already achieved its first target of stimulating million a year in savings and it is well on its way to reaching its december target of million a year in savings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> of course i agree with him that the contribution made to the whole power industry by nuclear power is significant and will continue to be so in the years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point that the noble lord has raised i am sure he appreciates that the amount of research and development funding for renewables is essentially less than that for nuclear power <e> <s> one of the reasons for this is that a great many of our renewable sources of energy have simply not yet reached a stage where they could absorb vast injections of funds whether from the private or the public sector <e> <s> nevertheless there is a continuing programme taking place of research into renewables <e> <s> when we look at what is happening in relation to various substitutes for example natural gas and gas liquefaction projects there is a considerable amount being done <e> <s> we shall benefit from those in due course in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the cegb obviously has an important part to play in research <e> <s> the amount that it spends on research is very largely in its own hands as to how it feels it should use the funds available to it for research <e> <s> there is certainly not any plan at the moment to divert from the department of energy to the cegb the responsibility for research that is presently being carried out by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord banks <e>", "<cs> my lords my position as an outsider is wholly confirmed i stand corrected <e> <s> i would never dream of arguing on such a point with one as knowledgeable about the clyde as the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> perhaps i had better not mention any more places in case i raise some more which do not have piers <e> <s> however i can assure your lordships that there are many more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> i must say to him that i would not wish to be drawn into argument or <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for the comments which they have made <e> <s> i shall try to answer briefly some of the points which they highlighted <e> <s> first of all my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland was kept fully in the picture as to the thinking of the secretary of state for education and when he decided to make his statement my right honourable friend was made aware of his intentions and the statement was made with the full authority and approval of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord grimond for his comments and of course he has hit upon a very sensitive issue <e> <s> it is true that there are many families in the land whose offspring for one reason or another do not make use of the facilities available at university and yet of course they contribute substantially to the funding of those facilities <e> <s> however we have to get the balance about right and i think that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education made a very courageous statement yesterday <e> <s> it is not easy for a minister to eat humble pie and i think that my right honourable friend made a very tasty meal of it <e> <s> he did very well and i think that we must all recognise and acknowledge that <e> <s> moreover the fact that he did so highlights the fact that despite what our critics may say the government do listen and do take notice of pressures from the back-benches and we must all recognise that <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would obviously not agree <e> <s> indeed with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord mackie i think that he really is being a little churlish this afternoon <e> <s> after all the secretary of state for education did respond to the pressures which were put upon him and the arguments which were placed before him and i think that we would be doing him less than justice if we did not acknowledge that <e> <s> i do not think i can really add further to what i have already said on this point but i would not agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly note the comments of the noble baroness in giving her support to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe in this matter <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friends will give special consideration to the views that have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the terms of the review are still under consideration <e> <s> i do not think that they have been finalised yet and therefore i felt it worth endorsing or having recorded any suggestions which were made by noble lords so that they could be considered in due course <e> <s> whether or not the review is to be as wide as the noble baroness suggests i am afraid i am not in a position to confirm <e> <s> but i shall certainly pass on the comments which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord drumalbyn for highlighting that point <e> <s> of course it is correct that in his initial statement yesterday the secretary of state for education and science indicated that my right honourable friend would be dealing specifically with scottish matters in due course <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the reference which the noble lord continually makes to this mistake <e> <s> it is a matter of judgment as to whether it was a mistake or not <e> <s> so far as the secretary of state for education and science is concerned in the light of the views expressed to him he has reassessed the position and made the necessary alterations <e> <s> so far as the secretary of state for scotland is concerned and the noble lord i am sure realises the position quite clearly it is a totally different situation <e> <s> we are talking about the scottish block the allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord stoddart of swindon and lord ezra for their comments on the statement i have just repeated <e> <s> i shall try to deal with as many of the points as i can <e> <s> first lord stoddart asked me about price what price was negotiated or on what price base did discussions take place <e> <s> i am sure he will appreciate that price is a matter of commercial confidentiality and a matter for the british gas corporation and the norwegians <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by my noble friend but i would suggest to him that in fact there would be a much greater danger of the potential of the united kingdom continental shelf as far as the supply of gas is concerned not being achieved if the sleipner deal were to go ahead than is likely to be the case now that the sleipner deal is not to go ahead <e> <s> i would suggest to him also that the bgc are not likely to have to cut back <e> <s> indeed there has been no suggestion of any likelihood of a cutback <e> <s> for some considerable period ahead the bgc source of supply is secured and it is probable that from our own continental shelf they would be able to make good any deficiency which occurs <e> <s> i believe that the decision not to go ahead will not in any way impair our relationships with the norwegian government <e> <s> it may well be that in the years ahead a further deal from some other norwegian gasfield may be mooted and that will be looked at and considered on its merits at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> in no way did i try to avoid this question i merely omitted to mention the question of export <e> <s> as my noble friend knows the landing requirement is still in existence and at the present moment there are no immediate plans to waive that but in the course of time as more gas is developed on the united kingdom continental shelf the situation regarding the question of export will be kept in mind <e> <s> but there are no plans at the moment to waive the landing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> if i may take the last one first i would merely repeat what i said earlier that there is no plan at the moment to waive the landing requirement <e> <s> i explained that this is something which will be considered in the light of circumstances as more gas becomes available but there are no plans at the moment to waive that requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of my noble friend <e> <s> i respect the technical competence of statoil but i am not prepared completely to accept its predictions without having them checked <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will accept that <e> <s> as for the timescale of the development of gas fields on the united kingdom continental shelf these could start being developed almost at any time <e> <s> as i indicated exploration has been extremely successful <e> <s> in a record number of wells was drilled <e> <s> that record was beaten in and this augurs for the development of these fields <e> <s> the lead-in time for the development of a gas field is not particularly long <e> <s> from the time that the discovery is made we should begin to see orders from such developments fairly quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement made by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to both noble lords for the comments which they have made on the statement <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble lord lord stoddart said when he expressed the concern and the reservations which the opposition have over what is happening <e> <s> but i am sure he will agree with me that there has not yet been very much time for them to consider the details of what is happening and i feel quite sure that when they have considered those details they will feel substantially more reassured <e>", "<cs> my lords while i answered the noble lord lord stoddart in the negative i am happy to be able to answer my noble friend lord lauderdale in the affirmative <e> <s> there is nothing in what we are doing which would in any way prejudice the very good relations which we have developed with our european partners in this matter <e> <s> i can confirm that to hint <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no implications so far as the status of dounreay is concerned <e> <s> the united kingdom atomic energy authority has proposed that the united kingdom should bid for the location of a fuel reprocessing plant at dounreay and a government statement will be made on this in due course <e> <s> no detailed comment can be made at the moment because the secretary of states role is also as a planning minister but to answer the question of the noble lord lord ross of marncck this will have no effect on the work at dounreay <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting and very useful debate <e> <s> i am encouraged by the number of noble lords who have participated <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that this bill has raised a great deal of enthusiasm in scotland <e> <s> during my period in <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment will ensure that there will be representation for the society of antiquaries on the board <e> <s> it will not give the society itself the right to appoint a fellow to the board <e> <s> i would suggest that the noble lord waits until he sees the amendment but i think he will find that it will go a long way towards achieving what he and his friends have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give way to the noble lord with pleasure <e> <s> we cannot win with the noble lord <e> <s> if we had sat back and waited until all those deliberations were completed he would then have accused us of wasting time and asked us why we were not getting on with it <e> <s> i give way to the noble lord with pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the noble lord should have stopped at the end of his first comment and allowed me to proceed because i was just coming to that very point <e> <s> however i shall deal with it now <e> <s> the title museum of scotland was one which was suggested by the williams committee <e> <s> however it has not been adopted in any way for formal purposes <e> <s> it will be for the museums advisory board to recommend whether separate titles are required for individual parts of the new museum structure <e> <s> as i have already indicated at the moment we regard the museum of scotland as a concept rather than as anything as concrete as the name of a particular part of the museums complex or even a particular building <e> <s> the advisory board will also be offering recommendations on exactly how that concept should be taken forward <e> <s> that is why i specifically mention the advisory board at this stage <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord the date for that <e> <s> i have given him the answer to the first question he asked me which was may of this year <e> <s> the noble lord lord grimond asked about trustees and what changes are expected at the royal botanic garden <e> <s> the establishment of trustees under the bill does not represent a policy to alter radically the excellent work carried out by the garden <e> <s> we are concerned primarily with an appropriate structure embodied in statute for the first time in the gardens history which is efficient and flexible and offers the garden more control over its own affairs <e> <s> we hope that this will lead to policy initiatives from the new board which reflect the areas of expertise and experience which trustees can contribute to the gardens continued development <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not attempt to argue with my noble friend <e> <s> of course he is right <e> <s> of course it is high time that something was done but as i explained to him earlier to try to get a general view which is acceptable to all those who would be affected by such legislation is difficult <e> <s> i believe that it is perhaps better to wait a little longer and get something which is acceptable rather than to proceed in a piecemeal fashion hoping for bits and pieces of parliamentary time which is unlikely suddenly to become available <e> <s> for that reason i hope that the noble viscount will feel able to withdraw the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we could go on about this for a very long time <e> <s> perhaps i could try to answer my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> the problems in those countries are quite different <e> <s> for example the canadians do not have the problem of imported fish to the extent that we do <e> <s> they have introduced dealer licensing and they have also introduced tagging <e> <s> if we were able to reach a consensus on both tagging and dealer licensing i believe that we could make progress but i think that that would be very difficult indeed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm to the noble lord the points which he asked me about <e> <s> my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer announced during his budget speech in another place that the government would be reviewing the fiscal treatment of incremental investment in existing fields <e> <s> it will of course be for the chancellor to announce the outcome of the review in due course <e> <s> the government keep in touch with techniques for enhanced oil recovery used in other countries though it must be noted that these techniques have so far been developed with the landward rather than the offshore production of oil in mind <e> <s> so far as offshore oil is concerned they are still in their early stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy will be delighted to think that there are many who still have confidence in the reserves or the potential reserves of the celtic sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend was perhaps being a little unfair on the government there <e> <s> after all the decisions which were taken in the chancellors budget of have led to the enormous increase in exploration in the north sea <e> <s> the point which he makes that further incentives should be given in some future budget will certainly be noted and i have no doubt that the chancellor is considering all these matters in preparing his budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will appreciate that is an extremely difficult question <e> <s> the department of energy at the present moment claim that we shall be self-sufficient in oil until the end of this decade although there is little doubt that we shall be taking oil from the north sea after the end of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat in the form of a statement the answer to a private notice question given by my right honourable friend the secretary of state of energy in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart and to the noble lord lord ezra for the comments they have made <e> <s> i think we are all agreed that this is a disastrous strike and that all those who have the best interests of the mining industry at heart are doing their utmost to try to ensure that it is resolved very quickly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made clear their endorsement of the cegbs proposal that the pressurised water reactor should be established as a valid option and that the next nuclear power station order should subject to the necessary consents and safety clearances be a pwr <e> <s> the cegbs case for building a pwr is being examined by the sizewell inquiry <e> <s> the inspector has heard evidence on alternative reactor systems and will no doubt take this into account in writing his report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord lauderdale for what he has said <e> <s> i would not necessarily agree that the inquiry has been wasteful because it was the governments intention at the very outset that it should be a wide-ranging inquiry so that a total debate on the subject could take place <e> <s> as i have already said the inspector at the inquiry has heard evidence on the merits of the agr system <e> <s> the government will have to see what conclusions he draws in his report and i think it would probably be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a subject which the noble baroness will appreciate has been discussed at length in many places <e> <s> however we live in a democracy and we observe the principles involved in doing so <e> <s> where a decision of such magnitude as this has to be taken i think the general view is that it would be difficult to imagine a more simplified system <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend lady airey has said <e> <s> i take the view that to place such an order would certainly not see the end of the british nuclear industry <e> <s> i think the british nuclear industry is in a healthy situation and will remain so <e> <s> i also think it important that we have a viable alternative to the agr and that is what government policy is at the moment <e> <s> at the present time we do not want to close options <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the difference of opinion to which the noble lord has rightly directed the attention of your lordships house between the sseb and the cegb merely highlights the necessity for keeping options open at the present moment <e> <s> where we have two bodies each of which has at its disposal expert opinion and that expert opinion is divided i think the best thing we can do at the moment is to wait until the inspector reports on the result of the inquiry and re-assess the situation then <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can give the noble earl the assurance that the government will approach the report of the inspector with the open mind which governments traditionally use on such occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the assurance that the central electricty generating board has made no final decision on what type of stations would follow sizewell b if it were approved and the board is taking measures to help ensure that the agr option is maintained at least until the end of the decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord bessborough whose knowledge on this subject i recognise <e> <s> would not he agree with me that it certainly would be very ill-advised for any government to pursue one policy without having identified all the potentials of another <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> i have studied the noble earls amendment and there is no reason as far as i can see why while answering the noble lord lord ross of marnock with his grouping of amendments i could not deal as the amendment of the noble earl lord perth relates to the same principle with amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> on behalf of the government i would have no objection to the noble earl speaking to his amendment at this time <e>", "<cs> i am glad that we have had this early opportunity to consider one of the fundamental points in the bill which is the title that has been chosen for the new national museums board <e> <s> as i explained during my opening remarks on second reading the title national museums of scotland which we have adopted was that which was specifically recommended to us by the museums advisory board <e> <s> the advisory board saw this as an extremely important point and therefore gave it thorough consideration very early in its deliberations <e> <s> it took account of a wide variety of possible titles including the retention of royal scottish museum to be applied to the whole of the new structure and the use of the titles scottish national museums and national museum of scotland which noble lords have suggested here today <e> <s> another possible variant was royal museum of scotland an attractive compromise based on one of the existing names but with a change of emphasis to reflect the nature of the two bodies being brought together <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord grimond said but it would be a very unusual step if we did not write the name of the new board into the bill which is creating them <e> <s> i can accept the noble lords wish to have a certain flexibility and there are areas within the bill in which this will be possible <e> <s> but in this instance we have to decide now what is to be the name of the new body <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord felt that i had made the case for accepting the recommendation of the advisory committee <e> <s> that really was the principal reason for our choosing this name <e> <s> there were a number of possibilities as i explained but if you set up an advisory committee and it strongly recommends a particular line especially on an issue such as the name we felt it right that we should take account of its recommendation <e> <s> i trust that noble lords might be prepared to withdraw their amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the name which we are adopting today will be the permanent name <e> <s> the concept of the museum of scotland is certainly very much in the forefront of our thinking <e> <s> but i would have to take advice before i could say whether that would need further legislation <e> <s> i cannot answer that question without referring it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friends for their late interventions <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what they have had to say and i think i can give them some reassurance <e> <s> i am glad that i did not try to answer my noble friend lord home without taking advice because i can now answer his query as well <e>", "<cs> the point raised by my noble friend lord eccles is well taken <e> <s> indeed later on in the bill we shall be discussing some of the points which he raised <e> <s> the question of the relationship between the national museums and the smaller museums within scotland will be discussed and indeed there are amendments down which cover that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her intervention <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not be called the museum of scotland nor is there any reason why it should not be called one of half a dozen other suggestions each and every one of which makes a lot of sense <e> <s> but the advisory committee which was set up advised the government that its choice of name was national museums of scotland and that is the name which has been given to the trustees but in due course the trustees themselves can call the museum the museum of scotland <e> <s> however it is not one museum that we are talking about it is an umbrella which will take in two museums initially and perhaps more museums <e> <s> that is why <e>", "<cs> principle which he is suggesting in his amendment anyway <e> <s> i believe that the recommendation of the advisory committee is the most satisfactory we have received <e> <s> i feel that while there are other things within the bill which we shall be discussing this afternoon which i may well be prepared to be persuaded to take away and look at again on the issue of the name being given to the trustees i have not heard anything this afternoon which convinces me that any of the other suggestions is better than what we are putting forward <e>", "<cs> i did explain before that under the bill as it stands now the trustees are being called the trustees of the national museums of scotland <e> <s> in due course if they care to call the whole umbrella the museum of scotland then they will be able to do that <e> <s> no legislation is required for that so they would continue to be trustees of the new concept as the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord perth has asked one or two more questions <e> <s> we have had such a prolonged exchange of views that i should really like to study <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove when introducing the amendment emphasised the importance of interpreting items in museum collections to the public <e> <s> this is now generally agreed to be an absolutely central part of the role of museums <e> <s> it was especially highlighted in the williams committee report <e> <s> the bill as it stands in clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first deal briefly with the point made by my noble friend lord kintore by saying that yes it would i can give an assurance to that effect <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> i should just like to be sure that we are both in the same game <e> <s> i understand that amendment no <e> <s> is being taken with this amendment <e> <s> is the noble lord speaking to amendment no <e> <s> as well <e>", "<cs> the exclusion of the words contained in lines to of clause subsection would have the effect that the national museums board could be empowered to make regulations or similar statutory orders on the secretary of states behalf <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will recognise that this would not be an appropriate function for the new board <e> <s> the inclusion of this subsection which is in exactly the same terms as provisions relating to the victoria and albert and science museums in the national heritage act is to allow the national museums to continue to operate the local museums purchase funds on behalf of the secretary of state <e> <s> these funds which are currently administered by the director of the royal scottish museum give valuable help to local authority and independent museums in scotland to enable them to purchase items for their collections <e> <s> the proposed amendment to clause is equally inappropriate for the royal botanic garden <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could point out to the noble lord something of which i am quite sure he is aware anyway but which there is no harm in going over again <e> <s> a number of situations might require the use of this power in the future <e> <s> for example the secretary of state may wish the board to include under its management an area of land gifted to him and suitable for the purpose or to participate in certain aspects of public education <e> <s> this is a power normally placed in legislation founding new fringe bodies which depend on exchequer funding <e> <s> for example it is also applicable in respect of the royal botanic garden at kew <e> <s> that is just one example where the secretary of state might require this power <e> <s> i think it is as well to remember that <e> <s> i would not agree with the noble lord that it is not necessary <e> <s> i think that it is necessary to have it in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord perth supported by the noble lord lord carmichael and the noble lord lord kirkhill and my noble friend lady elliot have appealed strongly on behalf of this amendment <e> <s> i appreciate the feeling which the noble earl expressed that the needs of these collections are especially strong at the present time <e> <s> the williams report not for the first time highlighted the extent to which the national museum of antiquities of scotlands collections have suffered from successive disappointments in the search for new accommodation <e> <s> they now form a powerful resource which except for the displays in the queen street museum and occasional special exhibitions are little known to the general public and in some cases are inaccessible even to scholars without a great deal of difficulty <e>", "<cs> the interesting if short debate which we have had on clause stand part highlights just what a productive afternoon we have had in discussing the amendments which related to the first two clauses <e>", "<cs> i think i made the position clear to the house <e> <s> this is an area to which we will give some further consideration bearing in mind what others have said <e>", "<cs> we have had a very useful debate on this subject <e> <s> it was debated at some length in another place and the amendments which have been put down in this house presumably drafted by the noble lord lord ross of marnock show an improvement at least on those which were put down in another place <e> <s> that is hardly surprising with his experience of drafting amendments <e> <s> but the sentiment behind the amendments shows an improvement as well because at least in the amendments which we are studying tonight the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord carmichael of kelvingrove recognise the important fact that national institutions should be able to charge for entry to the special exhibitions which from time to time they mount very often at considerable cost <e> <s> at least they recognise that those exhibitions should to some extent be expected to contribute to their costs <e> <s> that view was very forcefully expressed by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe by the noble earl lord perth and by my noble friends lady carnegy of lour and lord kintore <e>", "<cs> the noble lord sought an explanation for the necessity of including the words contained in clause <e>", "<cs> i thought i explained when i answered the noble lord but perhaps i could go over it again in case i missed anything <e> <s> subsection sets out for the purpose of clarity some of the specific powers which the board will have <e> <s> these are all <e>", "<cs> i can clearly see that the noble earl has in mind further safeguards <e> <s> i appreciate his concern on this matter but we believe that it is unjustified <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> the amendment draws attention to a power which did not appear among the generally parallel provisions made for the victoria and albert and science museums in the national heritage act <e> <s> clause gives the national museums board powers to dispose of an item in its collections under certain clear conditions <e> <s> either the item must be an exact duplicate of an item already in the collections or it must be one which the board considers for whatever reason to be unsuitable for retention in its collections and which can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of any of its users or it must be one which because of damage or deterioration has become useless for the boards collections <e> <s> a further alternative is that the item is to be disposed of to one of the national institutions listed in schedule to the national gallery and tate gallery act <e> <s> here subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock raised a further point which i did not answer <e> <s> he asked whether the recipient institutions could dispose of items <e> <s> suitable conditions could be applied to any disposal under this subsection <e> <s> that is one reason why here there is a need for the secretary of states approval <e> <s> that would be another reason which the noble earl lord perth might accept as the necessity for this <e> <s> as i explained earlier this is a new power and that is one of the principal reasons why we feel that the approval of the secretary of state should be sought <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee before the noble lord sits down may i say this <e> <s> the noble lord talks of conditions <e> <s> as an example if the board did not put in suitable conditions the secretary of state would not approve the proposal <e> <s> we do not need to spell out the matter completely <e> <s> it is covered by that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has suggested that the national museums should have greater flexibility in the use of any sums that they raise as a result of the decision to sell any of the items in their collections as provided under clause <e> <s> in particular he has made reference to property and to spending money on improvement of properties where the exhibits are displayed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has expressed his concern and his desire to have an additional safeguard here <e> <s> he therefore proposes that in all such cases the board should seek the specific approval of the secretary of state before making the loan <e> <s> we believe that this would be unnecessarily restrictive <e> <s> the conditions which clause applies are on exactly the same lines as those which have been applied in the legislation governing other national institutions for instance the national gallery and tate gallery act the imperial war museum act and the national heritage act <e> <s> i am not aware of any instance where there has been a complaint from a donor or his representatives that the statutes thus provide too great a power for the institutions boards to override their wishes <e> <s> here we are talking about loans not about outright disposals and it is surely right that after a certain length of time years is the period which has been accepted as reasonable the board should be able to exercise its own untramelled judgment over what constitutes a suitable loan <e> <s> i trust with that explanation that the noble lord might be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for so succinctly setting out his concerns over the amendments <e> <s> i am glad to explain our thinking behind the provisions <e> <s> i am unable to accept the amendments both because they would contradict the policy objectives of establishing trustee boards and because they do not reflect the proper role of the secretary of state <e> <s> without subsection which amendment no <e> <s> seeks to remove the trustees would be able to reduce the opening hours at inverleith gardens for reasons which may be eminently sensible from an operational point of view but which may act against the public interest <e>", "<cs> yes i can answer the question that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> it is because this is a public park given under strict conditions of public access that the secretary of states approval to admission charges is required <e>", "<cs> the same would apply <e> <s> certain hours are laid down for the opening of the park <e> <s> the secretary of states approval would be required if they were restricted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has in mind the intention that the board should be obliged to report the consequent effects in the reports that they make to the secretary of state and to parliament <e> <s> i do not for a moment think that the amendment is necessary to achieve that <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i explain again why we have taken the attitude that we have towards the reconstitution of the library board <e> <s> following local government reorganisation it was recognised that some amendment would be required to the act which provided for representation by the old local government organisations which have been superseded by the convention of scottish local authorities <e> <s> it was also desirable to amend the act in respect of the university representation since only the older scottish universities had a right to make appointments although in practice they have consulted the four younger universities before making <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> the grouping of the amendments were such that on two occasions today <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that we have had this opportunity to make clear the position of gaelic bodies under the bill <e> <s> first let me say for the clarification of any doubt that we are fully satisfied that the powers which are provided in clause are sufficient to enable grants to be given to bodies concerned with the promotion of the gaelic language and culture <e> <s> to that extent we take the view that neither of these amendments is necessary <e>", "<cs> we now come to the amendments which deal with the possible representation of various bodies among the trustees of the national museum and in particular the society of antiquaries of scotland <e> <s> in my opening remarks at second reading i indicated that it was the governments intention in recognition of the unique relationship between the society and the national museum of antiquities of scotland whose collections it founded and over which it presided for so many years to introduce an amendment to clarify in the bill the continuing involvement that we agree that the society should have in the working of the national museums <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to confirm for the noble lord lord grimond that i have pleasure in accepting his amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to us right that this area should be one of those to which attention should be given when trustees are chosen <e> <s> industrial relations in the widest sense play an important part in the work of any major organisation and the national museums are not likely to be an exception <e> <s> it may therefore be <e>", "<cs> i thought that it was too much to hope that the noble lord lord ross of marnock would let that one go <e> <s> i certainly give an answer to the noble earl and the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can certainly give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> there is no question of a cull taking place while my right honourable friend is still considering the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept the point which my noble friend makes and i can give him an assurance that there will be no undue delay in my right honourable friend reaching a conclusion on the report <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend hopes to make a statement within a matter of weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which the noble baroness has made will of course be taken into account before my right honourable friend reaches his conclusion <e> <s> however i would remind the noble baroness that the regular studies undertaken by the sea mammal research unit of the natural environment research council show that the population of seals in the scottish colonies has increased in recent years and is still increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords without checking my facts i should not like to go into detailed figures but i can assure the noble lord lord grimond that the increase in the scottish colonies is significant <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state will of course give all these matters consideration before he reaches a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> i think i can answer him satisfactorily <e> <s> yes the trustees will have the power to create a museum of scotland and within that museum of scotland there will be the royal scottish museum the national museum of antiquities of scotland and any other which they care to create <e> <s> the museum of scotland will virtually be the umbrella under which will be incorporated various other museums existing and perhaps to be formed in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak by leave of the house <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend lord selkirk was with us during the committee stage when we had considerable debates on these issues <e> <s> perhaps i may just clarify the position by saying that it will be entirely a matter for the trustees to decide upon any new name <e> <s> a museum of scotland that will be a matter for the trustees they certainly will have the power to create such a name if they so desire <e> <s> i think it is generally envisaged that that is what they will do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock has returned to the point which he made in committee <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ross i cannot think that any secretary of state would wish to direct the board to exercise functions of this kind and as the bill stands he cannot do so because the board is prevented from exercising such functions <e> <s> the noble lords amendment could in fact have a contrary effect <e> <s> if for example the secretary of state directed the board to look after a historic building owned by him the board might think that the best way to regulate matters was by by-law <e> <s> with the present provision it could not do so because by-laws are instruments of a legislative character <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill as presently drafted would prevent the new board exercising on behalf of the secretary of state any function of making regulations or other instruments of a legislative character <e> <s> this provision is precedented in the national heritage act in exactly the same wording in sections and and in similar wording in sections and <e> <s> it should also be noted that exactly the same wording is contained elsewhere in this bill in clause <e> <s> any change in this clause may suggest that it intends to achieve something different from these other provisions and may cast doubt on their meaning and that is not the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join others of your lordships in congratulating the noble earl lord perth on the amendment in the form of a new clause which he has tabled <e> <s> i am grateful to him also for acknowledging the assistance which he was given by the draftsmen and i am glad that their efforts met with his approval <e> <s> when the new board of trustees is set up it will have to decide how to organise the museums which will be in its care and it may decide that it would be appropriate to take aspects of the existing museums or all of them and give them the title museum of scotland <e> <s> i may say that i was most interested that my noble friend lord renton should take part in our proceedings because i know only too well his interest in scotland <e> <s> perhaps i can explain a little more to him as i go along <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord perth will also want to touch on what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the royal scottish museum will become a part of the new museum of scotland there is no doubt of that <e> <s> there is no question of a take-over here <e> <s> it is envisaged that the existing scottish museums and any other museums which may be formed within scotland will all become part of the new museum of scotland <e> <s> this is a concept which many of your lordships have had for a long time and none more so than the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> i commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a very good debate on this matter during the committee stage when the noble lord lord ross of marnock and indeed the noble lord lord grimond gave us the benefit of their views on this subject <e> <s> on that occasion we were also privileged to have the benefit of one of our distinguished and learned lords the noble and learned lord lord fraser <e> <s> i thought that the noble and learned lord explained very well the attitude of the advocates and how seriously they regarded their representation on this board <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what my noble friend has said on this subject <e> <s> with his experience on such matters i am reluctant to argue with him on such a point of detail <e> <s> the best i can do is to say to my noble friend that i shall read carefully and consider what he has said and <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which the noble earl lord perth has moved to the long title of the bill would have the effect of suggesting that in the main body of the bill itself we are including alternative titles for the new board of trustees themselves <e> <s> this whole subject raised great interest when it was debated in committee and it may be of assistance to your lordships if i go over the ground again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock is very adept at manoeuvring into the position from which he wants to fire but on this occasion i can assure him that he is not accurate in his supposition <e> <s> the million announced by the secretary of state for scotland as being available for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been secretary of state and should know the answer to these questions <e> <s> however it was some time ago i admit and in case he has forgotten let me assure him that the million to which i refer is being funded directly by the secretary of state and is not in peril in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will appreciate the funding of the scottish universities is through the university grants committee <e> <s> i have no doubt that the university of dundee will have made its suggestions available to that committee <e> <s> of course we have no jurisdiction over the findings of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point which obviously will have to be considered by the university grants committee <e> <s> i have no doubt that the points made by the university of dundee will be given due consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the noble lord <e> <s> the million to which i referred is being used and will be awarded by the secretary of state for scotland to the central institutions <e> <s> the universities come under a different funding <e> <s> they are funded by the university grants committee <e> <s> an announcement concerning distribution will be made later today by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect the very great experience of the noble lord in this matter <e> <s> i pay tribute to the work which he has done over the years in his efforts to encourage the industry to modernise <e> <s> i should tell him that since this government came to power they have invested no less than billion in the mining industry <e> <s> indeed the <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of the government is to ensure that the massive sums of money which have been invested in the coal industry offer a reasonable return on capital as soon as possible <e> <s> i find myself in complete agreement with much of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am sure that his views will be to the advantage of those in the national union of mineworkers with whom he has contact <e> <s> i think he should emphasise those points to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on employing that tactic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart and to the noble lord lord ezra for their comments on the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord lord stoddart should say that the opposition feel shocked by this decision <e> <s> i think that only reveals the fact that the opposition are still totally wedded to their old clause of nationalisation and any movement away from that is repulsive to them that is just as any movement away from it as far as this side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> i can tell him that it is the intention to place the british gas corporation firmly in the private sector <e> <s> i cannot at this stage tell him what percentage of shares it is intended to offer <e> <s> i think that i have partially answered already the second point that my noble friend raised <e> <s> i said that when the company is removed from the constraints and controls of government it will be free to exercise its rights as it sees fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> i answer him by saying yes i agree that there is a potential bonanza at present particularly in the southern basin of the north sea <e> <s> the action taken by the government in recent legislation has made that possible <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely correct in saying that <e> <s> many jobs will be created as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole intention of removing the british gas corporation from the constraints of government is to try to ensure that its <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> what he probably has in mind is the question of gas showrooms <e>", "<cs> i shall come to the other things that he may have in mind in a moment <e> <s> to deal with that point first i would remind my noble friend that considerable progress has already been made <e> <s> where showrooms have not been paying their way a number have been closed down <e> <s> it will be entirely for the new company to decide how to proceed on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the last point first <e> <s> i find it difficult enough to master the brief on an involved statement such as i have given this afternoon without diverting my attention to british telecom just at this moment but i have no doubt that the noble lord will have his own way in which to ascertain the figure <e> <s> however i would say that anybody who has sold shares in british telecom has probably sold them to his own satisfaction <e> <s> therefore that justifies the principle involved <e>", "<cs> my lords in any decision of this kind the government consider a variety of solutions <e> <s> i remind my noble friend that that was the case in this instance <e> <s> it would however be rather unwise to put at risk a distribution system which has evolved over many years to split up what has proved to be a successful method of distributing gas <e> <s> therefore the government took the view that it was more sensible to privatise the british gas corporation in its entirety <e> <s> i think that my noble friend will agree in due course that this was probably the best solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has it absolutely wrong <e> <s> far from making his case it makes my case <e> <s> it removes from the british gas corporation the inhibition of government interference and control <e> <s> the noble lord was a member of the party forming the government between and when chancellor healey increased the price of gas through his interference by per cent <e> <s> in one year and per cent <e> <s> in another year <e> <s> that was direct interference by government <e> <s> it has happened with a number of different governments and this will remove this inhibition from the british gas corporation <e> <s> it will give it the incentive that can only be achieved in the private sector and if the management is as good as everyone maintains it is then those employed in the industry will have a chance to benefit from it <e>", "<cs> i am giving no such promise my lords because it is not in my gift to give a promise <e> <s> the noble lord made my point when he suggested that this government increased gas prices <e> <s> that is further government interference which should be removed and will be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that that comment is not of the usual sophisticated class that we expect from the noble lord <e> <s> i think he could do better if he would like to try again <e>", "<cs> no my lords i thought that the noble lord could do better but i see he cannot <e> <s> the answer obviously is no <e> <s> the policies of this government are working and will be seen to work <e> <s> the noble lord and some of his friends talk about the next election <e> <s> his former leader once said that in politics a week was a long time but two and a half years in politics is an eternity <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to wait to see the future legislation <e> <s> i am sure the noble earl would not wish me to anticipate it but it is the intention as i said when i repeated the statement the other day that private capital should be introduced in as large a measure as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his suggestion <e> <s> i have no doubt that in due course the new company will look at this <e> <s> of course the legislation which we introduced in enables there to be competition as far as the supply of gas is concerned in areas which do not already possess gas <e> <s> i have no doubt that the new company will build upon this <e>", "<cs> my lords i really should not be tempted along these lines because this has nothing to do with the question <e> <s> but i will say to the noble lord that the policies in regard to unemployment will be seen to be effective in due course <e> <s> but nobody can imagine that the problem of unemployment can be solved at a stroke <e> <s> it will take time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy is keeping the closest contact with sir denis rooke <e> <s> i have little doubt that they will reach an amicable decision in due time <e> <s> but at the end of the day as my noble friend will appreciate it is for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord is being completely fair <e> <s> what i would suggest is that he has put forward only one of a host of reasons for privatising the gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his partial welcome to my answer <e> <s> perhaps i may say to him that although the eec regulation does not come into effect until october in fact there will be a reduction after st december of approximately per cent <e> <s> in the contamination and pollution of the atmosphere due to the reduction of lead in petrol after that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her comments but i should explain that this is something which cannot be placed at the feet of the oil industry <e> <s> the oil industry could bring in lead-free petrol very much quicker but the difficulty is that so few cars would be able to operate on such petrol that it simply would not be an economic proposition <e> <s> the motor industry operates virtually on a european basis and therefore we must move in conjuction with our european partners in this matter <e> <s> but i can assure the noble baroness that the delay is not the fault of the oil industry and indeed this government would welcome an earlier introduction if sufficient vehicles were able to use the petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be haunting me these days <e> <s> no i certainly am not saying that not by any means <e> <s> what i was pointing out to the noble baroness was that the car industry is virtually on a european basis <e> <s> in other words cars are made to operate in all parts of europe indeed they are built in various parts of europe are often assembled in other parts and are sold in different parts <e> <s> so we must move on in conjunction with our partners in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not really a question of lagging behind <e> <s> the only people we are lagging behind are the japanese because japanese cars are the only ones which could reasonably use lead-free petrol at the present time <e> <s> one cannot make these changes suddenly <e> <s> they have to be made gradually <e> <s> if one tried to make the changes too suddenly a great many vehicles would not be able to use the petrol <e> <s> it is a gradual process <e> <s> the european date is certainly further ahead then we should have wished but there is no reason at all why we cannot introduce the change earlier <e> <s> as i mentioned previously as from st december there will be a per cent <e> <s> reduction in lead content <e> <s> that is a very major contribution in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the suggestion of the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that we are dragging our feet <e> <s> i think that we are moving forward very reasonably particularly in this country <e> <s> perhaps within the community as a whole we are not moving as quickly as we should like to see the community moving but we have at least agreed a document which has given a positive date of october <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord mackie of benshie for the enthusiastic welcome they have given to the statement that i read <e> <s> i think really that both find themselves in great difficulty <e> <s> there is precious little that you can say against a government who want to give million to people who have been very harshly treated by the rating system <e> <s> indeed i would say to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that some of his friends in another place were calling for aid to help those people who were being very severely penalised as a result of revaluation <e> <s> the figure that they suggested was million or million <e> <s> and here we are having made a decision that the figure which we are going to make available is in the region of million <e> <s> i am not really surprised therefore that neither noble lord had any penetrating questions to ask on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> with respect the noble lord has i think forgotten the point <e> <s> he certainly knows it because he did this job himself once <e> <s> he will appreciate that the situation so far as revaluation is concerned is quite different in scotland to that which exists in england <e> <s> indeed the secretary of state would have been required to come back to parliament not to have a revaluation <e> <s> but the secretary of state took the decision that as long as the system is as it is it was right that properties should be revalued <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the spokesman in another place for the party which the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord kirkhill represent was emphatic in his remarks that he entirely agreed with the secretary of state as did the other parties in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his questions <e> <s> my noble friend asked me about the balance between the benefits to domestic and commercial rates <e> <s> i cannot give him an exact figure for that but he is right in his assumption <e> <s> i would assume that there would be a balance in favour of commercial rather than domestic rates <e> <s> there is no doubt that there will be benefits for certain domestic sectors as well but the balance would certainly be in favour of the commercial rather than the domestic ratepayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord grimond for his intervention <e> <s> the noble lord is right of course it is the taxpayer <e> <s> governments have no money <e> <s> any money that governments have they take from the taxpayer and that is why this government have been so prudent in the way in which they have spent money since <e> <s> they are frequently criticised for being tight with money and for not being very forthcoming in distributing money <e> <s> but on this occasion we are distributing money where we think that the present rating system has caused an injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boothby for his generous remarks and i would say that the government are doing just exactly what he suggests they should be doing <e> <s> they are looking and will be looking at a variety of possibilities <e> <s> i would go along with the noble lord in what he has suggested about the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> in fact i am not at all sure that there was not a revaluation during the period when he was secretary of state but if there was not i am quite sure that he will very soon tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord howie of troon has made an interesting suggestion but i would not become too enthusiastic over it because at present the actual average domestic rate contributions when one takes rates and water added together show that the average in england and wales is and the average in scotland is <e> <s> it is not as big a difference as one might have expected <e>", "<cs> my lords the revaluation has shown an average increase of on domestic properties and on commercial properties <e> <s> as regards the poundage it is very difficult to give exact figures as to how the whole question of revaluation and rating is made up but about one-third of the increase is attributable to revaluation inflation and other matters for which central government are responsible and about two-thirds is attributable to local authority decisions reflected in rate poundage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael must have misunderstood me <e> <s> i did not say never again <e> <s> i said that what the secretary of state announced today were measures for the current year <e> <s> in the statement the secretary of state indicated that he would look again at the situation for <e> <s> i certainly did not say never again <e> <s> it would be wrong if that were the impression that was given <e> <s> i do not know what others may have said but i certainly did not say that and the secretary of state did not say that <e> <s> i want to make the record clear on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord that figure off the top of my head <e> <s> what i can remind him of is that his countrymen and my countrymen will not be found deficient in their knowledge of mental arithmetic if there is something to be gained in a rebate at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that the noble and learned lord cannot get away with that one <e> <s> if he looks he will see how long we have been talking about this statement so that will not wash <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is as dedicated to the continuation of the united kingdom as i am and he will appreciate that scotland is subject to the ruling of the european court in the same way as is the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> therefore although there are only per cent <e> <s> of scottish children affected by this bill it is important we include scotland in order that we comply with the ruling of the court <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is playing with words a little but he raised this matter under an earlier clause stand part debate <e> <s> my noble friend gave him the assurance that what he had said would be very carefully read so that it could be considered at a later stage <e> <s> i do not think i would wish to add anything further to that which my noble friend said at that time <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that the noble and learned lord was unconscious <e> <s> i am suggesting that i took from his remarks that he agreed with the noble lord lord ross of marnock that it would be preferable to have included in the legislation that which i suggested <e> <s> but if i misunderstood the noble and learned lord i unreservedly apologise to him <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble and learned lord said and i am sorry i did not note that at the time he spoke to the amendment <e> <s> the position in scotland is of course very much different from that in other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> there has been substantial progress with regard to the policy of voluntary elimination as i have described already so much so that only a small percentage of pupils in scotland will be affected by this legislation <e> <s> but unless and until the process of voluntary abolition is completed we must ensure that in those areas where pupils are still liable to receive corporal punishment there must be respect for the philosophical views of parents who are opposed to its use <e>", "<cs> my lords not surprisingly when i was minister of state for energy in another place one thing that i always did was to read there the energy debates which took place in your lordships house <e> <s> indeed if i may deal briefly with the last speech first it is little gems of contributions such as we have been given this afternoon by the noble lord lord energlyn that made that very much worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the comments of both noble lords <e> <s> obviously i am not a department of energy minister at the present time <e> <s> therefore i cannot give the kind of assurance which the noble lord requests <e> <s> but what i can say is that the government certainly indicate the confidence which they have in the coal industry by the amount of money which they are prepared to invest in it at the present moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware miners who were dismissed and not reinstated are free to appeal to industrial tribunals and indeed some of them have already done so <e> <s> i would not wish to comment on individual cases but my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state said during the debate on this bill in another place that if there were any specific cases which were drawn to his attention he would of course <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful debate constructive until the last speaker but i shall come a little later to what the last speaker had to say <e> <s> first of all i should like to reply to the serious part of the debate and to the serious points which were put to me by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> as i explained in my opening speech the government in setting a threshold of three times the old valuation were mitigating some of the most adverse effects of revaluation <e> <s> we are not nullifying or neutralising revaluation <e> <s> that is certainly not the purpose of this bill <e> <s> nor again are we seeking to spread thinly some meagre relief over every ratepayer whose share of the rate burden has increased from revaluation <e> <s> the new rebates are designed to meet the extreme cases on which revaluation is most harsh in its effect <e> <s> using a multiplier of extends protection to those who have been hardest hit without entirely wiping out the intended effect of redistributing the rate burden <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to find such an occasion i have to admit <e> <s> the noble lord suggested that the borrowing costs of local authorities while they waited for reimbursement would be quite considerable <e> <s> the government will consider making some early payment to the rating authorities in advance of audited claims <e> <s> the noble lord also asked as did the noble lord lord kirkhill about the situation next year <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware decisions on rate support grant and on the domestic relief element of the rate support grant are taken in the autumn each year <e> <s> obviously the noble lord would not expect me to pre-empt these decisions <e> <s> but i would remind him that the bill is drafted as an enabling measure by order and that can be applied in any year <e> <s> there is no question of there not being the power to apply it in future <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill which we are discussing tonight is not a one-year bill and it would be possible for the government to deal with any problems which arise in future years in the same way that they are dealing with the problem this year <e> <s> but obviously i cannot pre-empt decisions which are taken on such issues in the autumn of each year <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord off the top of my head but i shall certainly make a point of finding out <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord with that information for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lord lord ross of marnock could tell the noble lord <e> <s> there is very little about the rating system <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the letter to which the noble and learned lord refers <e> <s> i think that many other noble lords have received a similar letter <e> <s> i am studying it at the present moment and in due course i shall be sending a suitable reply to <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords concern that this question has come on on a friday morning but i can assure him that it is as great a pleasure to answer him on a friday as it is on any other day <e> <s> perhaps i may tell him that one of the aspects which has to be borne in mind is the general cost and the current estimates suggest that synthetic crude oil from united kingdom coal would cost about dollars per barrel while substitute natural gas would cost about p per therm at the conversion plant site <e> <s> those are significant factors but that does not mean that both the national coal board and the british gas corporation have not made considerable progress with their research <e> <s> indeed the government fully supported the original design studies for a larger -tonne per day coal liquefaction pilot plant but process uncertainties dictated a more modest pace of development <e> <s> however the government are still interested and will still support the national coal board on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i defer to the very great experience of the noble lord and i am sure that we are all well aware of his great knowledge on this subject <e> <s> as regards advanced power generation the national coal board british gas the cegb and the department of energy are collaborating in two engineering studies of low-pollution power generation based on advanced coal gasification and pressurised fluid-bed combustion technologies <e> <s> these studies including estimates of generation economics will be completed in mid- <e> <s> so we are making some progress <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that significant advance has been made in south africa in this technology <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i shall wish to check my facts on this but my recollection from my own days as a minister at the department of energy is that we were in the lead as regards those researches <e> <s> i think that we are ahead of our common market partners but i shall check that and perhaps i may let the noble viscount know <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> these objectives are important and the coal board at the present moment is following the lines which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> there is a great deal of research and development taking place but we must keep this in perspective <e> <s> part of this perspective must be that at the present moment it would not be economical to suggest that coal synthetically treated as the noble lord suggests would be in any way competitive with what is already available <e> <s> that is part of the equation <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that there would be no reason why such a mission could not be sent <e> <s> whether one would be sent might be a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the views expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> it might be that there could be private sector interests which might be interested in exploring the possibilities of south african technology <e>", "<cs> it is not often that one has the privilege of being able to congratulate a speaker on his maiden speech and on his first appearance on the front bench in successive weeks <e> <s> i am happy to do so on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the chamber <e> <s> the powers in the bill are designed to meet a very real situation in the current year <e> <s> in proposing the second reading i described that situation <e> <s> as i made clear then it has developed as the outcome of revaluation has unfolded <e> <s> the situation that we currently face could also include the various measures introduced by the secretary of state in the rate support grant settlement for not least of these being the increase in domestic element <e>", "<cs> i shall try not to weary the committee by reiterating what i said a little earlier when replying to the initial group of amendments moved by the noble lord from the opposition front bench <e> <s> i would only point out that where amendments nos <e> <s> and are concerned the proposed discretionary powers in the bill to make orders is for any year and is not time-limited <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and would cut off the order-making power at the next revaluation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first of all refer to the bill <e> <s> the noble lord will notice that on the first page of the bill below <e>", "<cs> i have said so three times <e>", "<cs> i shall <e>", "<cs> we have had a fine old-fashioned political knockabout this evening <e> <s> the opposition have been in their element <e> <s> they have had a whale of a time but they have not made very much of it <e> <s> their arguments have been weak <e> <s> their facts have been wanting in some areas <e> <s> in my replies i propose to try to make them see the folly of their ways in criticising the government for what by any standards has been a great gesture on the part of the government to try to help those who have been most adversely affected by revaluation <e>", "<cs> i knew that i should not have given way to the noble lord <e> <s> he finds it impossible to intervene without making a speech <e> <s> we become so accustomed to his speeches that he tends to become a little tedious at times <e> <s> the noble lord has given his own answer to his own question <e> <s> i have no intention of being drawn into an argument with him <e> <s> i reiterate what i said before <e> <s> the record of his government is that of the chancellor going cap in hand to the international monetary fund and being told to do what the present government have done on a voluntary basis and in so doing they have managed to keep inflation down <e> <s> if his government had acted a little earlier when inflation was running at per cent <e> <s> they might have had some success <e> <s> so please do not give us this <e> <s> it will not wash we are not accepting it <e> <s> i shall come back to the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> there were other noble lords taking part in the debate <e> <s> they are every bit as worthy of some recognition as the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> i accept that the noble lord is making his points sincerely <e> <s> i do not happen to agree with them <e> <s> it is the politics of the situation on the scottish scene because members of the opposition are making sure that the general public have this million firmly in their mind and in no way are they going to let that million be removed <e> <s> but the basic fact is that the million figure is nearer the actual estimate on a muliplier of three <e> <s> had the figures worked out at million the members of the opposition would have been demanding that the government be as good as their word and come up with the extra <e> <s> when it works out at rather less then i do not think their argument is very strong <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked about this particular question <e> <s> i can tell him that subsection imposes a new duty upon the secretary of state to reimburse rating authorities out of voted money for the full amount of the rebates granted under the bill <e> <s> the bill does not contain any power to reimburse any expenses by the rating authorities of any other kind including administrative costs or interest costs of extra borrowing to cover delays in cash flow <e> <s> subsection of the bill allows the secretary of state flexibility as to how the actual reimbursement is made to the rating authorities and deals with what conditions they will have to satisfy to be reimbursed <e>", "<cs> yes they have <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for his advice and help <e> <s> he is always extremely generous in that way and i am sure we are all deeply aware of his great knowledge of the subject certainly so far as scottish legislation is concerned <e> <s> he has been around for so long that he has practically invented most of it and certainly he is an authority on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and to the noble lord lord grimond for the comments which they have made on the statement which i have repeated <e> <s> perhaps i may first of all take the initial point which the noble lord lord grimond made and say to him that i was as appalled as he was when i saw the scottish press this morning <e> <s> i am afraid that however governments try to avoid information reaching the press that is not always possible <e> <s> however certainly so far as the government are concerned there was no question of the governments giving information to the press before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the only further answer that i would give to the noble lord <e> <s> lord carmichael is that i think it will be obvious to him despite some criticisms levelled in certain quarters at my right honourable friend that the policy of restraint of local government expenditure is being applied across the board and fairly whether the councils are labour conservative alliance or independent-controlled <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can assure the noble lord that i shall pass on his comments to the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> i can also assure him as i did initially that there was no question of these figures being revealed from government sources <e> <s> when a leak of this sort occurs i can assure the noble lord that the department involved is even more upset than those who raise the matter on the floor of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend explained in another place the governments proposals are under consideration <e> <s> it is too early to say when we will be in a position to publish them <e> <s> i can reiterate the assurance which i gave the noble lord that there will be ample opportunity afforded to both houses of parliament to discuss them in due course <e> <s> it would be a mistake to pre-empt what the legislation might contain <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> i hope that i have been able adequately to explain to the noble lord who tabled this question that it is the intention of the government to have full opportunity for discussion in both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which i am answering refers to gas and i fear that i might be out of order particularly with my noble friend the chief whip if i included other matters in this question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is always very charming in the way that she puts her questions <e> <s> i shall make sure that her views are conveyed to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot give the noble lord an assurance of that sort <e> <s> i am sure he would not really expect me to do so <e> <s> all i can do is assure him that i shall convey his remarks to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not give the noble lord the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> he will see that my answer to his original question when he studies it in <e>", "<cs> my lords even in my most generous frame of mind it would be difficult for me to answer briefly that conglomeration of questions <e> <s> indeed they are far removed from the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble lord has asked me a hypothetical question <e> <s> all i can say is that if and when such a thought were to enter the mind of the government then the noble lord and those noble lords who are interested will be given ample warning <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there has ever been any difficulty about parliament having the opportunity to discuss energy policy <e> <s> energy has been a popular subject in both houses and has received a fair share of their attention <e> <s> the government cannot be held responsible for journalistic speculation and it is not unusual for articles to appear in the press giving particular views as to the amount of generation which we might have by the end of the decade or the end of the century from nuclear power or from any other source of power <e> <s> the government cannot be held responsible for these speculations <e> <s> i have stated in my answer that much will depend on the outcome of the sizewell inquiry <e> <s> the inspector at the inquiry has heard evidence on the merits for example of the agr system <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see what conclusions he draws in his report in due course <e> <s> it would he inappropriate for me to comment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend is aware the inquiry closed on th march <e> <s> the timing of the report is a matter for the inspector <e> <s> however the inspector has informed my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy that he hopes to be able to deliver his main recommendations before the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made clear their endorsement of the cegbs proposal that the pressurised water reactor should be established as a valid option for the united kingdom and that the next nuclear power station order should subject to the necessary clearance consents and safety <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be nonsensical as the noble earl suggests but it has not been made by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that this supplementary question goes rather wide of the question which has been tabled <e> <s> i feel that when one is answering from the dispatch box one must draw the line somewhere <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to put down a question to that effect i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ezra rightly points out coal plays a major role in the generation of electricity and will continue to do so for many years <e> <s> however it is prudent for the country to have a range of supply options and i do not think that that has ever been brought home quite so forcefully and forcibly as it was earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government would be sad if agr technology were to die <e> <s> the government are open minded on the question of the agr <e> <s> as i indicated earlier the government believe that a range of options must be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really does speak as though there were some great secret plot <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure him that there is no secret plot and that we shall continue to give as forthright and as forthcoming answers to his questions as we always do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very happy to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> indeed i have already suggested that it is the governments intention to keep a range of options open and we certainly shall <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pressurised water reactor <e>", "<cs> i think it would be only right that i should point out to the noble viscount that this amendment is defective as it assumes wrongly that there is provision in the bill for a meeting to take place <e> <s> this provision does not exist and under the compulsion theme of the bill it would be necessary to specify that a meeting should take place <e>", "<cs> i am of course perfectly happy to discuss this with the noble viscount at any time <e> <s> however i would question his reference to some other stage <e> <s> at this stage in the proceedings i doubt very much whether it would be advisable to have any further stage <e> <s> i think that if we have a committee stage of this bill that will be about the sum and substance of it <e> <s> but that is not in my hands <e> <s> it is in the hands of the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> with respect lord chairman you looked at me <e> <s> i made no comment <e> <s> i am not in any way taking part in this <e>", "<cs> i must make it clear that the government have very considerable reservations about this amendment both on the principle and on technical grounds <e> <s> on the principle we do not think it is desirable for the government to be involved in the constitution of fishery boards as is proposed in the amendment <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord lansdowne has very considerable experience in these matters but on this issue i would have doubt as to whether he proposes to follow the best the present system whereby the secretary of state is removed from this area of activity seems to me to be quite satisfactory and i see no good ground for changing it <e> <s> on the technical points the clause is defective <e> <s> there is no reference to the length of tenure of appointments <e> <s> if there was no leased net fishery operation in a particular district no anglers could be appointed and this would be an unreasonable restriction on angling representation <e>", "<cs> i do not oppose this new clause but i think it is probably right that i should point out <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly answer the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> i rather resent his suggestion that the two front benches have come together to try to kill the bill <e> <s> if this bill is going to be killed it will be killed by one person only and that is the noble viscount through his sheer thrawn attitude <e> <s> when the bill was introduced initially for second reading it was made abundantly clear to the noble viscount that the government could not accept it that if the noble viscount cared to proceed to a committee stage that was entirely a matter for him <e> <s> he proceeded to a committee stage <e>", "<cs> no i am certainly not saying that <e> <s> the noble viscount makes a valid point <e> <s> what i pointed out at an early stage was that the government did not consider that the bill could by amendment be brought into such a state as would make it worthwhile for the government to take it up <e> <s> i also explained quite clearly that because we had a very full discussion at second reading many points were raised of which i took note <e> <s> in due course and at a time when the government find it possible to introduce legislation of their own the points raised by various members of this committee will certainly be considered in the preparation of that legislation <e> <s> thus there is absolutely no question of the government trying to kill this bill <e> <s> that is not the case at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tryon who has been extremely helpful in our discussions this evening <e> <s> i am sure that he will appreciate that at this stage it simply is not possible for me to give an indication of when the government might be likely to introduce legislation <e> <s> i can assure him that there is very great competition as is always the case in every government for parliamentary time <e> <s> however the question of the fishing industry and salmon in particular is being very carefully considered by the government <e> <s> more than that i cannot say nor would i wish to give any indication of when legislation might come forward <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for drawing my attention to that <e> <s> i was in fact aware of the norwegian project to which he referred but i am bound to say that we are rather sceptical of the figures produced by the norwegians with regard to that <e> <s> we think that they are rather over-optimistic <e> <s> however i can assure the noble viscount that we would certainly not set aside any new ideas if they were seen to be genuinely cost-effective <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give my noble friend an exact answer to that <e> <s> what i can tell him as i said a little earlier is that we are not satisfied that the figures at present being projected by the norwegians are realistic <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i can confirm to my noble friend that we are very interested in a number of projects concerning wind energy <e> <s> indeed my figures tell me that we can expect post the year that for large production turbines there will be a cost per kilowatt hour of something between p and p which is a competitive price <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the research about which we are talking today is under particular threat <e> <s> but of course research and what transpires from research must always ensure that the funds available are directed to where they are likely to produce the best results <e> <s> that is why we are discontinuing our major research in the area about which the question was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> over the past five years the government have invested in excess of million on alternative sources of energy and of course about million of that investment was on wave power <e> <s> that investment was not wasted because we learned a great deal from it but the conclusion is that the money can now be better spent developing other alternative sources <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> that principle would also apply of course to solar heat generation <e>", "<cs> my lords if i judge the mood of the house correctly i think that the noble lord is perhaps straying a little from the question <e> <s> if i may return to wave power i would advise him that the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reiterate that we have been doing so <e> <s> while we can certainly produce energy from wind power at the figure that the noble lord suggests we are extremely sceptical as to the future of wave power <e> <s> but as i indicated earlier we certainly would not cast aside any new ideas which showed a reasonable prospect of being cost-effective <e>", "<cs> the cameras have gone away <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a short if very informed debate <e> <s> i am most appreciative of those of your lordships house who have seen fit to wait after the cameras have switched off to get down to the really important business of the house <e> <s> like my noble friend lord lauderdale i feel rather sorry that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for their remarks in connection with this report and for the constructive attitude they have adopted <e> <s> i can quite appreciate the first point which the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i can give her that assurance <e> <s> i can assure her that everybody connected with glenochil is very much aware of what has happened <e> <s> they are all relieved that the report is as it is and that the staff and those most directly concerned with looking after those young people are completely exonerated from any blame for what has happened <e> <s> that in itself is significant and i am sure it will give confidence both to those who work there and those who have youngsters there <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble lords lord stoddart of swindon and lord lloyd of kilgerran have said <e> <s> however i would point out that it would be unusual for legislation to provide that the chairman of a public body had to be a full-time appointment <e> <s> clause of the bill provides the government with a desirable level of flexibility for finding the most suitable people to fill positions on the agencys board <e>", "<cs> i am interested that this amendment has evoked such useful interventions from my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord lauderdale <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am surprised that the noble lord lord stoddart has attached as much importance to this as he appears to have done because we must remember that central to all our thinking on these amendments must be a consideration of the size and the role of the new oil and pipelines agency <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly say a word or two about the contribution from the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i apologise to him most sincerely if he was not given a list of the groupings beforehand <e> <s> that was an oversight which we will ensure does not happen again <e> <s> i am very sorry indeed <e> <s> it is appropriate that we discuss these amendments together as the noble lord lord stoddart has suggested and the real assurance which noble lords on all sides seek from me concerns the dedication of those who will be appointed to this board <e>", "<cs> i can straightaway assure my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that i shall have to reject this amendment <e> <s> i can appreciate the concern which the noble lord lord lloyd has expressed but i cannot accept the substance of his amendment <e> <s> i must ask the committee to give the government the flexibility which they need to appoint and to reappoint the people who are most suitable <e> <s> certainly we shall always need fresh blood of that there is no doubt but there is nothing particularly desirable in a rapid turnover of board members <e> <s> we shall need to retain members who have a proven record of good service to the agency and its employees and long experience <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord stoddart of swindon for moving their amendments succinctly and for explaining what they have in mind <e> <s> i will first deal with the amendments of the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> if they were accepted it would not be possible for the posts of chairman and chief executive of the agency to be occupied by the same person <e> <s> the governments flexibility for choosing an appropriate board structure for the agency would therefore be considerably reduced <e> <s> i can satisfy the substance of the noble lords point because the government do not as he suggested intend to combine the posts of chairman and chief executive when the agency is first established <e> <s> as i have explained we intend to appoint mr george dunkerley as chairman and mr kenneth vaughan as chief executive <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to satisfy noble lords opposite with what i have to say <e> <s> the government recognise the legitimate concerns of those who have been affected by the proposed abolition of bnoc <e> <s> the minister of state for energy made clear to parliament as long ago as st april that it was the responsibility of the corporations management to make any arrangements about redundancies <e> <s> i understand that the corporation has taken this important task very seriously <e> <s> by early may the board of bnoc had proposed a package of terms to be available to those staff being made redundant <e> <s> i believe that these terms are in line with those available from oil companies when other redundancies have been necessary in the industry <e>", "<cs> i think i understand the concern of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that the agency might delegate a major chunk of its responsibilities to a single person but i do not think that that would be likely to happen for the simple reason that i do not believe that the agencys board would allow it to happen <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give just two examples to the noble lord for instance a substantial mistake in the name of an appointee or an appointment made by somebody who was not authorised to make such an appointment <e> <s> those are two examples which come to mind <e>", "<cs> my initial reaction is that this is a matter for the board to determine and it would perhaps be less than helpful to tie its hands too much beforehand <e> <s> i give the noble lord the assurance that i shall discuss this with my officials and get their reactions to what he has suggested without any commitment <e> <s> it is a valid point and i am perfectly prepared to look at it <e>", "<cs> i think we have had a very useful debate on this group of amendments <e> <s> i should say right away that i am most grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for dealing so effectively with the highly political points which were raised by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> indeed he dealt with them so effectively that i shall be able to deal with the substance of the amendments without touching on the political points which the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran spoke to first of all because there are some points he raised on which i think i can help him and set his mind at ease <e> <s> when i was minister of state at the department of energy i took a particularly close interest in the welfare of these small companies <e> <s> i have certainly not forgotten that concern today <e> <s> over four months ago when the abolition of bnoc was first announced it was perhaps not surprising that some of those small companies to which the noble lord referred were rather apprehensive about what the future might hold for them <e> <s> they were a bit afraid that they were perhaps going to have difficulty in finding a market <e>", "<cs> certainly not without the secretary of states authority <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could start my reply to this series of amendments by dealing with the point about which my noble friend lord lauderdale asked me and which was touched upon by the noble lord lord stoddart who quoted from some of the long and laborious speeches which i made through the middle of the night in the committee stage of another bill <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord stoddart that what i said about participation agreements at that time still stands today and i can assure my noble friend lord lauderdale that we expect only minor changes as far as participation agreements are concerned <e> <s> these would relate for example to assignments of licences and the fact that participation oil will not normally be lifted in future <e>", "<cs> yes the participation agreement is something which we have always found in the past to be something which is not negotiated quickly <e> <s> such agreements normally take quite some time to negotiate and the annexe b application time would be the start of that negotiation it might then take some time to be concluded <e>", "<cs> what i can do is simply to remind the noble lord that the participation agreements which have been negotiated have been negotiated freely by successive governments of both political persuasions and that they have been found to be satisfactory both to government and to the companies concerned <e> <s> as far as the implementation of their provisions is concerned we see no difficulty in this <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord lloyd will forgive me if before i deal with his amendment i amplify what i said to him when he asked me about participation agreements being reactivated <e> <s> i have been advised that there is something more which i should add <e> <s> participation agreements can be reactivated generally at between six and months notice <e> <s> however united kingdom stocks are ample to cover that lead-in time in minor crises <e> <s> and in major crises we can of course use our energy act powers <e> <s> perhaps i could deal with the amendment which the noble lord has just moved <e> <s> i think the noble lord quite reasonably asked me at second reading <e>", "<cs> yes i did <e>", "<cs> the stocks available for a minor crisis are perfectly adequate <e> <s> and if the crisis were to be more than a minor one we then have the powers of the energy act which we can use to take whatever steps we require <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this is something which frequently occurs within the terminology of the oil industry <e> <s> the reason for referring to a minor crisis as opposed to a major crisis is that there are certain levels of crises which trigger various mechanisms such as the international energy agency mechanism or the mechanism of the energy act <e> <s> therefore what we describe as minor crisis is one which is a situation of shortage but not of acute shortage <e>", "<cs> i can appreciate the concern of noble lords in seeking to discuss the problems of the united kingdom refinery industry naturally the government keep a close watch on developments in our refinery industry <e> <s> united kingdom refinery capacity continues to exceed normal demand by some per cent <e> <s> it is of course desirable that capacity in the united kingdom should be sufficient to meet our own demands but at the same time economic <e>", "<cs> by comparison with some of the amendments we have been discussing recently amendment no <e> <s> is reasonably light <e> <s> successive governments have found that productive and frank discussions between them and the nationalised industries have been best served if they were not conducted in the full glare of publicity <e> <s> successive oppositions have for their part always expressed the wish that public sector business should be conducted completely in public <e> <s> that was no doubt done so that they could take full political advantage of any disagreements between the government and the nationalised industries <e> <s> at least that would seem the logical reason for such a line <e> <s> i can therefore appreciate why noble lords have tabled amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> this is by no means the first time that i have been involved in this argument <e> <s> we have argued the question of security of supply over and over again in another place <e> <s> it was one of the principal arguments throughout the debates which we had on the petroleum and submarine pipelines bill which later became an act in and it has featured in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> although the noble lord may be new to our energy debates i am sure that the contributions which he has made during our deliberations today have been constructive and very welcomed by all of us <e> <s> he has put me in rather a difficult position <e> <s> i have made the governments position perfectly clear <e> <s> i certainly could not go along with what has been proposed this afternoon but that does not mean that he and the noble lord lord stoddart could not withdraw their amendment think about it again and at a later stage bring back something which after consideration they believe is a little more appropriate <e>", "<cs> in most circumstances i should feel greatly inhibited in replying to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran on a subject in which he is a renowned expert but i can i am happy to say tell him that bnocs position as far as intellectual property is concerned is straightforward <e> <s> when this bill was being prepared the department of energy asked bnoc what intellectual property it expected to possess at the transfer date <e> <s> the corporation had a number of research agreements prior to the britoil split but all of these were subsequently vested in britoil <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it the question which we are discussing is what have already spelled out <e> <s> the question is who is to set the framework for any such supplementary trading and in the view of the government that must be the responsibility of the secretary of state because he is the person who is accountable to parliament <e> <s> however sympathetic one might be to what the noble lord suggests i do not see that one can reasonably get round that point <e> <s> this must be the responsibility of the secretary of state and the secretary of state is the person who is accountable to parliament <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think perhaps it would help the noble lord if i just reiterate what i said a little earlier which is that the agency will have to exercise its commercial acumen in making the best <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i have tried to explain this several times and i am not terribly convinced that noble lords opposite really want to understand my explanation <e> <s> they are hooked on this amendment which they are trying to persuade me to accept but i must make it absolutely clear to them that the government believe that what they seek to do can be met within the existing framework of the bill and that their amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i can be reasonably brief on this point because the underlying issues were fully discussed during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> this amendment would enable government to use the agency as a vehicle for agreements of some kind to ensure security of supply of oil products <e> <s> quite simply i have to say that the government are as always most grateful for the offer of additional weapons for their armoury <e> <s> but quite frankly i see no need of or use for this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart has a knack of suggesting to the house that i really mean a certain thing when that is not really what i mean at all <e> <s> therefore i shall try if i possibly can to explain precisely what i do mean in answering the noble lords proposal that we accept his amendment <e> <s> i am sure that it will be a source of sadness to him to learn even at this early stage that i am unable to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can probably satisfy the noble lord in what he seeks in this amendment <e> <s> the position of those affected by the proposed abolition of bnoc has been fully discussed both in the other place and in our debate at committee stage <e> <s> i made clear then the principles on which it was right for redundancy compensation to be payable and the circumstances in which such payments would be unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord stoddart has rightly pointed out in committee the amendment was moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i undertook to consider without commitment and that is exactly what i have done <e> <s> what i undertook to do was consider the suggestion made by the noble lord that this paragraph might be amended to limit the scope to which the functions of the agency could be delegated to its employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord bessborough for giving us the opportunity to have this short debate this evening <e> <s> we know of course of his great experience in this subject <e> <s> we know of his great knowledge of his enthusiasm for and his dedication to the subject <e> <s> we are grateful to him for introducing the debate this evening in his usual distinguished style <e> <s> i should like to offer him my personal congratulations for retaining the enormous amount of knowledge which he has acquired over so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course aware of the system of external financial limits which the government operate <e> <s> however i should tell him that discussions on external financial limits are met by actions across the range of industrys activities and not simply worked through to prices <e> <s> if the past is anything to go by it is significant that domestic electricity prices have risen by only about per cent <e> <s> in total over the last three years whereas under the previous labour government they rose on average by per cent <e> <s> every four months <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think i should point out to the noble baroness that the increase in domestic gas prices in was below the rate of inflation then and the increase implemented from st february is less than the present rate of inflation and includes a continued freeze on standing charges <e> <s> in real terms the price of gas to the home is still about the same as it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness must be fair in her comments as i am sure she means to be <e> <s> she will be aware that the industries have means of consultation and discussion with the government and the ultimate decision must obviously be with the industry <e> <s> because this government are able to boast of low increases in both electricty and gas prices compared with their predecessor that is no reason to cast aspersions on the way in which those were achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the authorities to which the noble lord refers have to take account of the cost of producing what they sell in deciding what they are going to charge for it <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me to give assurances which are not in my gift and therefore he will not expect me to acquiesce <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has considerable experience in this matter as we all know to our cost <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him of what i said to the noble lord lord grimond that external <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord although he probably knows the answer anyway should refer this to the treasury ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that on this occasion the noble baroness is wrong <e> <s> these matters are resolved after discussion between the industry concerned and the government and an arrangement is reached in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to water i would certainly not argue with the noble baroness <e> <s> i suggest that if she is aware of a matter affecting water authorities she should put down a question to the department of the environment and my noble friend lord elton will deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> these corporations and authorities do require to earn a reasonable return on capital <e> <s> for example the profits of the industries expressed as a percentage of their assets are not excessive about per cent <e> <s> for british gas and about per cent <e> <s> for the electricity supply industry <e> <s> but we must bear in mind that we are talking about public investment of something in the region of billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond must have misunderstood what i said <e> <s> i thought i made it perfectly clear that on the subject of water i would not argue with the noble baroness because that is not something which comes within my remit and i suggested that that was a matter for the department of the environment and that my noble friend would deal with it <e> <s> if on the other hand i in any way suggested that the noble baroness was wilfully trying to mislead us then of course i wholly withdraw what i said <e> <s> that was not my intention <e> <s> i merely wished to say that i wholly disagreed with her and that as far as energy subjects were concerned i believed that she was in error <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord lord grimond that the government will continue in their dealings with those services and in their discussions with them on prices exactly as they have done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords no decisions have so far been taken for the future <e> <s> however with regard to the mineworkers redundancy payments scheme my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy has indicated that when this scheme runs out in march he will present proposals for a replacement scheme to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer my noble friend on that point <e> <s> the coal industry made extraordinary losses in requiring government support of billion within which deficit grant accounted for nearly million <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will just consider the happenings of the past week he will see that it is not only the government who have been disappointed in the inept leadership of the national union of mineworkers <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord lord lloyd that the figure which i gave in my original answer includes an amount for that purpose as it relates to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not being realistic if he does not imagine that capital investment in an industry which has had the problems suffered by the coal industry over the past months would not be subject to close scrutiny and a degree of criticism <e> <s> however i say to the noble lord that the level of government grant and the extent of the investment programme in the industry are clear proof of the governments commitment to the future of the coal industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord stoddart for his very kind remarks which he has made about the way i have tried to handle the proceedings during the progress of this <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful debate on the occasion of the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and to the noble viscount lord thurso for the constructive approach they have taken to this bill from their respective front benches <e> <s> i will do my best to answer some of the questions they raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the assurance to the noble lord as far as the lifetime of this parliament is concerned but no minister and no government is in a position to commit successors <e> <s> therefore i can merely reiterate what has been said by energy ministers elsewhere that the government have no plans for the privatisation of the atomic energy authority <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> with respect i cannot do so because these are obviously matters which will be negotiated between the authority and the department <e> <s> it is not for me at this stage to assess what might be the margin the authority would look for in a contract with one of its customers <e> <s> we are interested in what the authority can achieve at the end of the day in its accountability what its bottom line is at the end of its financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that when contracts of such a nature are being discussed the authority is bound to have a figure in mind <e> <s> however that figure is not one which it would necessarily publicise because on certain matters where it is giving advice such information might be useful elsewhere <e> <s> therefore i would hot think that the authority would necessarily wish to make known the figure on which it is working <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has asked about the valuation and revaluation of assets <e> <s> the authority is carrying out a full-scale asset revaluation exercise <e> <s> all its assets are being revalued to current cost so that the assets shown on the opening balance sheet of the trading fund will represent as realistically as possible their current value to the business <e> <s> does that satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not completely agree with the noble lords figures though his opening figure of million was not too different from mine <e> <s> it seems likely that the opening capital employed will be around million that is million of fixed assets and million of net current assets <e> <s> the exact figures will not be known until the st march balance sheet is produced <e> <s> within this the breakdown will be approximately a commencing capital debt of million a revaluation reserve of million a general reserve of million and insurance provision of million <e> <s> however as i explained these are at this stage approximate figures which we obviously cannot finalise until the st march balance sheet is produced <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i think that we should all like to see a trend towards coal instead of oil but i must point out to my noble friend that the capital cost of conversion of stations to coal firing is very high indeed <e> <s> for example the estimated cost of converting two modern megawatt units in the isle of grain station is about million at march prices <e> <s> so my noble friend will realise the difficulties which the cegb is up against <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> seventeen per cent <e> <s> of the supply to the grid is already from nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct <e> <s> but in the view of the cegb which must be the judge in such matters it is still not economic to proceed in the way that he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises an interesting point but i cannot give him a specific answer other than to say that that must be for the judgment of the cegb <e> <s> it is however worth recalling that in a normal year oil-fired stations in england and wales account for only to per cent <e> <s> of electricity generated by the cegb and some oil burn is necessary to meet the demand at peak periods and to maintain a balanced output from the national grid <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree with the noble lord on that issue <e> <s> the figure that i quoted was million for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is asking rather a lot to expect a minister to answer every detailed question which springs to the fertile mind of the noble lord at question time <e> <s> i shall try to elicit the information and perhaps i may drop him a note <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her generous remarks <e> <s> i would pay tribute to the leading role that she takes on behalf of the consumer <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot be specific in answering her final point <e> <s> the best that i can tell her is that legislation will be forthcoming as soon as parliamentary time permits <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> indeed that is one of the reasons why the government decided that the particular offence referred to earlier should not be a new special offence one of the reasons being that this would require access to private property which always causes great difficulty <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first say how much i appreciate what the noble viscount and the noble lord have said about my efforts to amplify in my letters to them my comments when winding up the second reading debate on this bill <e> <s> i appreciate their remarks very much indeed <e>", "<cs> the operations of the ordnance factories and the mint are a very differrent exercise from the operation of this authority indeed in a great many ways <e> <s> the financial structure of those concerns are such that the requirements ultimately are <e>", "<cs> it is not really my role to act as an oxford dictionary but the way in which i use the word cyclical is that for example in the case of the mint there are overseas earnings which can vary substantially <e> <s> again in the royal dockyard that is a factor which can affect the amount of income and indeed the size of the profits ultimately made <e> <s> therefore they can be cyclical meaning that they will come not in an even form but in cycles <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> i consider that i am establishing my argument rather than destroying it <e> <s> perhaps i am destroying his argument <e> <s> as regards the cyclical effect and the atomic energy authority i do not consider that it applies because in the case of dounreay which the noble viscount mentioned the authority has a much steadier series of contracts <e> <s> it has contracts with the central electricity generating board bnfl and the department of energy <e> <s> it is not the same as the shipbuilding industry which may fluctuate <e> <s> when an authority has a series of customers such as those i have mentioned the flow of business is likely to be much more even than the up-and-down type of cyclical flow which is more likely in an industry such as shipbuilding <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is looking a very long way into the future of dounreay <e> <s> i think he may have forgotten that any initial plant at dounreay will be a demonstration plant <e> <s> any commercial operation will follow much later <e> <s> i referred to business not being cyclical and this is supported by the fact that there will be research contracts which will tend to keep the flow of work even <e> <s> we are perhaps making a mountain out of a molehill <e> <s> i do not think that the noble viscount has a point on this issue and i cannot accept his argument <e>", "<cs> the government are opposed to this amendment on the grounds quite simply that it is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord sat down a moment or two too soon <e> <s> the point that he made is relevant <e> <s> the answer is that the per cent is not a surcharge it is profit before interest <e> <s> the aea only has to pay interest out of that profit <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> a financial target of per cent <e> <s> return on average capital employed assessed on a current cost basis will be set for the first three years <e> <s> the opening capital employed is likely to be million <e>", "<cs> i shall answer that one right away <e> <s> target profit is what we have been talking about <e> <s> as we would be told at school i am sure that noble lords are not doing their best to understand what is quite a simple philosophy <e> <s> the problem may be that i am not a very good teacher <e> <s> let me put it this way <e> <s> the object of the exercise is to earn per cent on million and pay nlf rate on million <e> <s> the authority does not have to pay the per cent to anyone <e> <s> that is just its target profit <e> <s> money to the exchequer will come in the form of interest on the commencing debt and on new loans and in any payments under clause <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a moment in an effort to be helpful <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned certainly if it were for the convenience of the committee we would have no objection whatever to discussing amendment no <e> <s> now if that would be helpful to the noble lord <e> <s> we could discuss amendments nos <e> <s> and and grouped together <e> <s> in other words we could move up amendment no <e> <s> to include it in the group comprising amendments nos <e> <s> and which we are discussing if that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill sets an initial borrowing limit for the authority of million <e> <s> in setting this level we have taken account of the expected level of commencing debt of about million and the need for new borrowing to finance <e>", "<cs> it is standard practice to require treasury approval of the terms and conditions of nlf loans <e> <s> this is not an onerous procedure but a sensible safeguard for ensuring that the treasurys expertise in these matters is available to the sponsoring department of the industry <e> <s> it also enables the government to take an over-view of the total resource requirements of the public sector <e> <s> this is an important aspect of macro-economic policy and the government are therefore opposed to such an amendment <e>", "<cs> certainly the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon was correct when he suggested that i have a real concern to ensure that employees of the authority and indeed employees of any other body in similar circumstances are made to feel part of the whole unit and are consulted about their future <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned this is paramount in our view on this matter as well <e> <s> perhaps i may tell your lordships that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has had no indication that authority employees are opposed to the proposed arrangements although they have asked for reassurances on particular points <e> <s> i am happy to be able to tell the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and the noble lord lord ezra who was also concerned about this point that they have received those assurances which they themselves sought <e>", "<cs> i believe that i indicated but i shall do so again that the unions are currently having discussions about the consultation procedures they will use when the trading fund is in operation <e> <s> in my view it would be quite wrong for the government to impose a particular form by dictating that certain documents should be handed over <e> <s> i take the view that the authority regards the workforce as highly responsible <e> <s> the relations between the workforce and management are extremely good <e> <s> these people are having their own discussions at the moment <e> <s> i cannot see that it is for the benefit of those discussions for the <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the noble viscount must realise that these discussions are taking place now <e> <s> therefore neither i nor anybody else can answer that question <e> <s> they are having discussions as to how they should proceed <e> <s> i believe it is a mistake for us to interfere at this stage in such matters <e> <s> it is better to leave it to them to decide <e> <s> the bill is in its very early stages <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd is as always persuasive but i am afraid i am not prepared to accede to his request <e> <s> i have explained as best i can that discussions are taking place between the authority and the trade unions involved <e> <s> i have little doubt that they will be able to resolve this matter <e>", "<cs> i would agree entirely with what the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon has said and also what the noble viscount has said about the desirability of making information available <e> <s> indeed the example which the noble viscount lord thurso has given about the dounreay project is an excellent one <e> <s> however of course the vast amount of information which comes from dounreay does not come from the kind of suggestion which is made here in this amendment <e> <s> the information which comes from dounreay comes very largely from mr blumfield the director and his very efficient public relations staff who keep the general public fully informed about everything which is going on at dounreay <e> <s> the noble viscount lord thurso and i may not have much in common politically but we have a great deal in common in our admiration of the success story of dounreay over the past years <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for his efforts to be helpful to me <e> <s> indeed it is very reassuring to know that at heart i have his support on this bill if not on anything else <e> <s> may i say however that i am afraid that i am not able to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can respond very much further <e> <s> i have indicated to the noble lord that i agree it is undesirable that members of companies which are principal customers or contractors should serve on the aea board <e> <s> indeed i have given him the assurance that the secretary of state has absolutely no intention of appointing any such person <e> <s> but we believe it would be wrong to write that so specifically in the bill <e> <s> it is conceivable at some future time that there might be a particular person with very special abilities who would be of great use as a member of the authority and who might have a conflict of interest at a later time <e> <s> if such a person became involved the procedure is clearly laid down in the act that he would declare an interest and would take no part in the discussion on that particular issue <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to the noble lord lord stoddart in his submission and also to the noble lord lord ezra who spoke in support of the new clause <e> <s> but i am afraid that i must oppose this new clause because to the extent that it does not simply duplicate existing powers it would lead to an undesirable increase in the authoritys non-nuclear powers <e> <s> this could be to the detriment of other energy bodies and of the private sector generally <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that i cannot accept that suggestion <e> <s> i have gone to considerable lengths to try to explain to the committee why this new clause is simply not necessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart knows full well that if i did not see a genuine hope of incorporating his new clause i would not be likely to say that i would take it away and look at it <e> <s> i think it is deceiving the committee to suggest just for the sake of it being a nice thing to do that one will take something away and look at it <e> <s> if one suggests that one is going to take something away and look at it one genuinely should have in ones mind a desire to try to incorporate it <e> <s> practically all of what is being asked in this new clause is already available in existing legislation and therefore i feel that it would be wasting the time of the committee to suggest that i would take <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot accept this amendment which is meant to refer to the atomic energy miscellaneous provisions act and not <e> <s> there is a misprint regarding that <e> <s> i am sure it is the act that is meant <e>", "<cs> let me say at the outset that the existing statutory provisions would not in practice permit the piecemeal privatisation of the atomic energy authority <e> <s> they certainly envisage the authority being able to hive off particular parts of their business but not to the extent of undermining their ability to carry out their statutory functions <e> <s> for example it would not be possible for the secretary of state to require the authority by means of a section direction under the act to set up major subsidiaries with the express purpose of selling them off for example the harwell research establishment <e> <s> that would be an improper use of the secretary of states powers of direction <e> <s> the scope of the existing powers is therefore limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the forestry modification of felling restrictions regulations a copy of which was laid before your lordships house on nd october be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for the comments which he has made and i shall try briefly to deal with some of the points which he raised <e> <s> he raised the question of christmas trees which is very appropriate at this time of year <e> <s> these regulations would not apply to the normal commercial use of christmas trees <e> <s> felling for christmas tree purposes would not normally be included <e> <s> the noble lord asked me when the cubic metres regulation came into being <e> <s> it has been in existence since <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that he would not do so <e> <s> the new quantities allowed for felling will also apply to selling <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is covered by the explanation i gave to the noble lord earlier <e> <s> if he plans ahead and is able to describe to the commission in advance what his requirements will be then of course he can have a licence for up to two years or up to five years if it is within a forestry commission grant scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank most warmly the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and the noble viscount lord thurso for their generous remarks and also for the constructive approach they have taken throughout the stages of this piece of legislation <e> <s> i particularly appreciate their reference to courtesy on my part <e> <s> but in my political career i have found that courtesy is generally a two-way function and so i am grateful to them for their courtesy throughout our deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the security for private road works scotland regulations a copy of which was laid before your lordships house on th november be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for his words and for the welcome he has given to this order <e> <s> i think i can assure him on the point he raised <e> <s> provision is made to ensure that the security will be enough to cover the cost of constructing the road to a satisfactory standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the points that my noble friend has made <e> <s> i recognise that in his previous incarnation as a secretary of state himself he was not without experience in dealing with reporters <e> <s> i can give him the assurance that the secretary of state for energy has made absolutely certain that any assistance requested by the reporter has been made available to him <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has set out the virtues of sir frank and the desirability of having persons of his calibre looking after inquiries much more effectively than i could hope to do <e> <s> i am sure he recognises that my noble friend lord campbell of croy in no way was offering criticism of sir frank but was merely asking whether i could ensure that there will be no unnecessary delays <e> <s> happily i am able to do so <e> <s> also i am grateful to my noble friend lord broxbourne for saying what he did about sir frank layfield <e>", "<cs> my lords where an inquiry of the complexity of that which we are now discussing takes place it is very difficult to put a terminal point on the delivery of the report <e> <s> however on this occasion the reporter indicated that he hoped to deliver the report by the end of last year <e> <s> he said subsequently that it would probably be the spring of before he was able to do so <e> <s> we must accept that this is a massive operation and therefore we cannot be too dictatorial as to when we shall finally receive the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry included evidence that outlined the qualities and the potential of the agr <e> <s> we shall have to wait to see what comments sir frank layfield has to make about that evidence <e> <s> even assuming that sizewell were to go ahead it does not by any manner of means rule out agr orders for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i hope that i was able to indicate that the secretary of state for energy is ensuring that such assistance is available <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord answers to the questions he has asked for the simple reason that i am not aware of any anticipated delay <e> <s> we are all realistic enough to appreciate that a task of the magnitude of that which has been placed before sir frank layfield must be very carefully considered by him <e> <s> i have no indication that there is likely to be any further delay beyond the spring of this year <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord the answer to his second question but perhaps i may make the necessary inquiries and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend the duke of portland for advising me earlier today that he was going to ask that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the noble viscount in his frustration <e> <s> this is something which various departments share with him from time to time <e> <s> however i should point out to him that from the outset it was the intention of the government that the sizewell inquiry should be a wide-ranging one and therefore it is not surprising that consideration has taken time and is taking time <e> <s> on the general point made by the noble viscount about the future of the system of public inquiries i have no doubt that those who are responsible for considering these matters will carefully take note of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken note of what the noble lord said and not being a member of the cabinet i will not comment on it <e> <s> however i have no doubt whatever that the decision reached by my right honourable friends is a unanimous one on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that at the present moment it might be better if i were to say that i am prepared to stand by the general acceptance of collective responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the salmon bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had an excellent debate <e> <s> i am most encouraged by the number of those of your lordships house who have <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> equally i apologise to all the others among your lordships whose names i have not mentioned and who did raise the subject <e> <s> my noble friend lord home of the hirsel certainly raised it <e> <s> it was a point too raised by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> in doing so he asked me whether there was agreement with the northumbrian and yorkshire water authorities on the measures to restrict the north-east fishery announced by my right honourable friend on th november <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> we are working with the authorities to bring in these measures as soon as possible <e> <s> we hope that some will apply to the coming season if the statutory procedures can be completed in time <e> <s> i would confirm in response to questions from several noble lords and particularly my noble friend lord home that it is intended to ensure that the licensee is present when the net is fished <e> <s> the licensee will have to be present <e> <s> that will be a requirement of the licence <e> <s> secondly night fishing by drift nets will be banned <e> <s> thirdly it is intended to standardise weekly closed times on the longest time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble ladys suggestion would find a good deal of favour in the house <e> <s> i suggest to her that she might consider tabling an amendment to that effect at committee stage when we could have a fuller discussion on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern expressed by the noble lord <e> <s> i can tell him that the secretary of state for energy is in touch with the bodies on the progress of the discussions <e> <s> although the department is not directly involved in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my answer made it clear that at present the ncb and the cegb are in consultation as to how they might achieve a system whereby heavy industrial users and i emphasise that it is very large industrial users may be able to obtain their power supplies more cheaply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the circumstances surrounding the closure of the invergordon smelter <e> <s> indeed it was in my former constituency and i was very involved in the discussion that took place <e> <s> but the situation there was slightly different in that the company entered into a complex and complicated agreement at the outset <e> <s> it was all tied up with power stations which at the time were not built <e> <s> in effect it was the hunterston power station <e> <s> the point that the noble lord has raised is not directly relevant to the question but the talks are taking place so that large industrial users may plan ahead and one hopes obtain electricity at a cheaper rate because of the high volume that they use <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made it clear that the secretary of state for energy is keeping close contact with the two bodies concerned in the talks <e> <s> they will be well aware of his view during their discussions <e> <s> the definitive position of the government cannot be established until an agreement is reached and we are made aware of it <e> <s> electricity prices generally in this country compare well with those elsewhere in europe except in france where the consumer benefits very much from low-cost nuclear generation <e> <s> however large industrial users particularly those with high load factors or those not able to join the electricity industrys consumer contracted load scheme continue to pay more for their electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give no such assurance but i am sure that that point is very much in the minds of those negotiating on behalf of the ncb and the cegb <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is not within my power to give the noble lord such an assurance <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty over this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord burton had indicated that he wished to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> in moving his amendment no <e> <s> b is he still wishing to oppose clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> if he is i really feel i must reply to him setting out just why i think he is not following the best course by pursuing this matter and why i think that clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> would my noble friend clarify the position for me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in that case i must confess to being disappointed to say the least of it at the attitude which he has taken <e> <s> as i said in both my speeches on second reading i am aware that the bill does not do everything about salmon <e> <s> i make no real apology for this <e> <s> as i have explained parliamentary time is a very scarce commodity and i have been under pressure for a number of years to substitute action for words as regards salmon legislation affecting scotland <e> <s> from this we concluded that the most practicable course was to produce a bill which concentrated on the main issues and i think that the general reception in the chamber and outside has confirmed that this approach has been welcomed <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord burton was the only member of the house to speak who wholly condemned the bill then and i think that the response from others is indicative that it really has been welcomed substantially by most people <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord onslow for what he has said and also to my noble friend lord home for his comments at this stage <e> <s> i say to the noble viscount lord thurso that certainly i had no intention to do other than praise him and his bill at second reading <e> <s> it was perhaps when he went a little beyond second reading that we were not thinking quite along the same lines <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for his support of this clause at this stage <e> <s> however i would remind the noble lord lord ross of marnock that despite his criticism of this clause there was only one amendment tabled to it and we accepted that amendment <e> <s> so i should have thought that the clause was now with the aid of the noble lord lord ross of marnock in a perfectly acceptable state <e>", "<cs> as we proceed through the bill the points which the noble lord has been raising about the secretary of state and so on can be discussed <e>", "<cs> there are more <e>", "<cs> i have already explained to the noble lord that on the voluntary principle there will be scope for amalgamation of existing boards or the creation of new boards <e>", "<cs> this clause deals with the areas of districts <e> <s> they will be abolished when they are replaced by a district designated by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could remind the committee that the bill already allows for an increase in the number of board members albeit by co-option of anglers and netsmen <e> <s> i understand the concern of the noble viscount but the situation which he describes of some rivers with no direct representation on boards already occurs in some large districts without obvious difficulties <e> <s> there are many ways of seeking the views of persons interested in the activities of boards and there is nothing in this bill to prevent a board from inviting additional representatives to sit in on board meetings as indeed some boards do at present <e>", "<cs> without hesitation and i hope that what i have to say will not be too much for the noble lord lord ross of marnock i am happy to accept the first amendment and i am grateful to noble lords for their suggestion <e> <s> with regard to the second amendment while i agree fully with the proposition that it is not only salmon fishery proprietors and through them district salmon fishery boards who have an interest in salmon fishing it is the proprietors who will have to meet directly the consequences of amalgamations of districts <e> <s> i have not found any convincing reasons for giving anglers a right to apply for a designation order <e> <s> such a right should in my view be the prerogative of boards or failing a board proprietors given the financial input of the latter <e>", "<cs> i was by no means clear why of all the information to be supplied to my right honourable friend in relation to the making of a designation order the noble lord lord ross of marnock should feel that proposals about the annual close times are undesirable or unnecessary <e> <s> the annual close time and the period within which it will be permitted to fish by rod and line will still have to be prescribed under clause <e> <s> it seems to me unreasonable to seek to so deprive him of such information objections and representations about such important matters regarding the management of salmon fisheries <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything between us here <e> <s> the noble lord has himself recognised the importance of this matter and he indicated that he was probing for information <e> <s> i have tried to explain why we think it is necessary and advantageous to have the annual close times made known <e> <s> it seems to me rather strange that in view of the other information which has to be made available this information should be excluded which is what would happen if the amendment were carried <e>", "<cs> the noble lord himself explained that the effect of this amendment would be to relieve those applying for a designation order of the need to state for the proposed district the proposed dates of the annual close time and the period within which it would be <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> there could be different close times for two different rivers <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord ross of marnock perhaps i may once more try to explain why the proposals for annual close times have to be included <e> <s> they are included as part of a comprehensive procedure for designating a new district and schedule allows the opportunity for representations and/or objections by local interests <e> <s> in view of that explanation which i think has been fairly full perhaps the noble lord will consider withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord burton for raising this matter because it gives me an opportunity to clearly define proprietor <e> <s> this came up at second reading when we were talking about the question of time-share part-owners <e> <s> proprietor is defined in the bill as meaning <e>", "<cs> i do not have at hand the necessary information for the noble lord <e> <s> i give him the undertaking that i shall have a further look at that <e> <s> if there is any further amendment needed then i can consider it for report stage <e>", "<cs> i fully understand why the noble lord lord burton has tabled these amendments but i think they are unnecessary and restrictive <e> <s> clause gives my right honourable and learned friend discretion as to whom he should consult before making regulations <e> <s> he could i am sure consult district salmon fishery boards on a purely local matter but where the matter is one of general application it might be more appropriate for him to consult the association of district salmon fishery boards rather than each individual board <e> <s> the noble lords amendments would request him to consult each board individually <e> <s> i cannot accept that proposition <e> <s> therefore in view of what i have said i wonder whether my noble friend will withdraw his amendments <e>", "<cs> i concede the principle of this amendment <e> <s> it is indeed appropriate that smolts be protected from being drawn into water-works fish farms etc <e> <s> in the s this was provided for at mills indirectly by requiring that the mill lades be drained periodically to let the smolts back to the river <e> <s> that is obviously not sensible these days nor is it workable in relation to other sorts of abstraction <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord burton for his suggestion in this amendment <e> <s> i have myself been concerned in relation to the lack of definition of lawful methods of operation of nets and indeed this point was made by several noble lords at second reading <e> <s> to remedy this i have tabled a new clause which allows my right honourable and learned friend to define permitted fishing methods by order <e> <s> if acceptable to your lordships this new power would be included appropriately i am advised in the salmon and freshwater fisheries scotland act <e> <s> the amendments tabled by my noble friend lord burton would therefore be unnecessary and could be seen as giving less comprehensive powers <e> <s> having seen the proposed government amendment i hope that the noble lord lord burton will be prepared to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble viscount lord thurso will agree that in answering this i deal also with amendment no <e> <s> which is in his name and is directly related <e>", "<cs> before i answer the points that have been raised in the amendment of the noble viscount lord thurso perhaps i may apologise to my noble friend lord onslow for omitting to give him an answer to the question he asked me when we were discussing the last amendment <e> <s> he asked whether amendment no <e> <s> would not be covered by the new clause that i have tabled <e> <s> very briefly the answer is no <e> <s> this is because the new clause will relate to the methods of fishing but not rod and line <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i can only answer my noble friend by saying that my advisers assure me that in fact the crown estate commissioners have to give permission where estuaries are concerned <e>", "<cs> i have noted the point the noble earl has made and i shall think about this matter <e>", "<cs> if i may directly return to the amendment about the delegation to the fisheries boards boards do not cover all of scotland so it would <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is asking me to do something i am not at all happy about doing because i think sufficient laws are already available <e> <s> the planning procedures are there and fish farmers are subject to the planning procedures <e> <s> if i really thought i could come back with an amendment which would satisfy the noble viscount i would willingly take this away but i doubt very much whether that is possible <e> <s> therefore if i were to take it away it would be purely a case of doing that and looking at it but i could almost give a guarantee now that i would be coming back with the same answer <e> <s> i do not think that is a particularly good thing to do <e>", "<cs> what i was going to say to the noble viscount was that i do not want him to carry on too long because if it is the feeling of the committee that i am being unreasonable of course i will take it back and look at it again <e> <s> i must make is absolutely clear that i do not envisage a possibility of my being able to come forward with a suitable amendment but i give the committee an assurance that i will take it away study it carefully and discuss it with my advisers to see whether i can possibly meet what the noble viscount seeks <e>", "<cs> i can understand the reasoning behind the amendment and i have noted that its effect on the weekly close time could be similar to that of the restriction in clause on the alteration of the annual close time <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment and i am advised that it is technically acceptable <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble viscount for bringing this matter to the attention of your lordships and i am happy to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i am very happy to take these amendments as the noble viscount suggests <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend viscount ridley realised just how much interest he would arouse in the amendment no <e> <s> that he tabled <e> <s> in fact the interest is such that at this time we are dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and and at some time during the last minutes all those amendments have been touched upon by one or other of your lordships <e>", "<cs> no that is not quite what i am saying <e> <s> i shall try to explain to my noble friend <e> <s> what i said was that i thought it would be wrong for us at this stage and in this legislation to pre-empt the conclusions of the drought review but of course if at some future time legislation is required then it will be up to the respective departments concerned to decide whether or not such legislation should be introduced <e> <s> i am not suggesting for one moment that the conclusions of the review will necessarily have to be implemented in this way <e> <s> i am merely saying that it would be wrong for us to pre-empt those conclusions <e>", "<cs> yes i am advised that the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food have an input into the review and have every right to make their views known to those who are considering the matter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend tabled a manuscript amendment which i have not had a great deal of time to consider <e> <s> i would however say to him that the powers to make regulations under clause of the bill are already extended to the whole of the river tweed district including that part in england by clause as it stands <e> <s> indeed the amendment proposed by my noble friend would restrict that application because in describing the tweed in the amendment he omits to include that part which was added by by-law under the salmon fisheries scotland act <e> <s> given this explanation and the fact that his amendment would not achieve what he seeks he may perhaps consider withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> the mistake is mine <e> <s> my noble friend was of course speaking on the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> i take note of what he says <e> <s> we shall look forward to hearing from him at at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i dealt with part of this amendment when i spoke after the noble earl had spoken on the question that clause stand part <e> <s> i can perhaps reiterate the relevant parts which are that the powers to make regulations under clause of the bill are already extended to the whole of the river tweed district including that part in england by clause as it stands <e> <s> in view of what i have said and in view of the fact that the amendment proposed by my noble friend restricts that application since it does not include that part which was added by by-law under the salmon <e>", "<cs> as the noble marquess explained he tabled this amendment not very long before we started our deliberations <e> <s> i have not had time to consider it and nor have my advisers had time to give me the appropriate advice <e> <s> therefore i shall willingly take it away <e> <s> i shall carefully read what my noble friend has said and i shall consider it before we reach the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps it may be easier if i actually explain the amendment so that everyone can appreciate the wording <e> <s> it has been drawn to our attention by the district boards association that the words <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord burton has pointed out this amendment seeks to ensure that members of the association of proprietors who inherit the liabilities and assets of a defunct district board share in such liabilities and assets in the same proportion in which they contribute to the fishery assessment <e> <s> this seems in principle an attractive suggestion and i am grateful to my noble friend for moving it <e> <s> i am willing to undertake to give the proposal detailed consideration and i hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment on that assurance <e>", "<cs> it may seem strange to some to make provision for a salmon fishery board for a district which has no salmon in its waters <e> <s> this provision is simply a re-enactment of part of section of the salmon fisheries scotland act which is being repealed by this bill <e> <s> more importantly however i think it would be imprudent not to allow a board to be formed in anticipation of salmon being introduced into inland waters or returning there <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend because he has really answered the noble lord lord ross of marnock for me <e> <s> this is a re-enactment <e> <s> it would seem to us to be imprudent not to allow a board to be formed in anticipation of salmon being introduced into inland waters or returning there <e> <s> as my noble friend suggested it could be that restocking would be going to take place and it might be desirable that a board be created <e> <s> it seems to us that it is not unreasonable to have this re-enactment for the purposes i have suggested <e>", "<cs> i think i have said all i need say <e> <s> i agree with what the noble viscount lord thurso has just said <e> <s> i see no reason for deleting this <e> <s> it is a provision that we should retain <e>", "<cs> obviously i cannot give the noble lord the figures he requires <e> <s> but in any event whether it has been used or not is no reason to suspect that it might not be used at some future time <e> <s> it is not doing anybody any harm and i see little point in removing it <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to enable the secretary of state to authorise a district salmon fishery board to exercise the powers of a board in an adjoining district if no board has been formed for that district or no application has been made to the sheriff to form a board for that adjoining district <e>", "<cs> district boards will have power to impose a fishery assessment under clause <e> <s> it is therefore wholly appropriate that they should have the powers to recover arrears such as are provided in clause <e> <s> whether the power to recover arrears of fishery assessment may be extended to include arrears of interest without boards first being given a specific power to charge interest is a question i should like to consider further <e> <s> in the circumstances i should be grateful if my noble friend would consider withdrawing his amendment so that i can give it further consideration <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with district salmon fishery boards which are essentially voluntary bodies with elected members <e> <s> it is right that those boards should be able to borrow for the purpose of carrying out their functions and that the proprietors of the fishings in the district who will have to pay off those borrowings should have a decisive say when the amount of the borrowings will exceed a certain amount namely twice the amount of the fishing assessment collected in the previous months <e> <s> the bill provides for this and i see no reason at all for superimposing my right honourable friends consent in this day and age <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will agree to withdraw their amendment in view of what i have said <e>", "<cs> no i shall not do that <e> <s> i shall give the noble lord the answer <e> <s> it is not the answer he wants <e> <s> it would be most unlikely that i should be able to do that <e> <s> the answer that i give him is that in our view the four-fifths arrangement should be an adequate safeguard <e> <s> in any event there is no guarantee at all that the secretary of state would be able to safeguard the small man which was the example that the noble lord gave <e> <s> therefore we consider that his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> we consider that there is adequate protection with the four-fifths arrangement <e> <s> i am sorry that on this occasion i cannot be as generous to the noble lord as i was earlier this afternoon to the noble lord but perhaps he will consider withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> the unrestricted power in clause would not prevent a board from paying travelling expenses or a subsistence allowance where they were satisfied that they were necessarily for the purposes expressed in that clause <e> <s> the amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i deal also with amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of my noble friend lord ridley <e>", "<cs> we have in fact spoken to amendment no <e> <s> already <e> <s> perhaps i may deal briefly with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i explained on second reading this wording is in the same form as a similar provision in the act <e> <s> the words by <e>", "<cs> i am of course prepared to accept my noble friends wishes on this matter <e> <s> obviously he and i have been given a different form of groupings <e> <s> i understand that my noble friend wishes to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has been dealt with and when we reach amendments nos <e> <s> and we can of course deal with them separately <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly try to be helpful to the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> the plain fact is that a great many of the amendments were tabled so late that my department had the greatest difficulty in being able to prepare for the debate this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord was not guilty in that respect but a great many amendments were tabled late and we also had manuscript amendments which were tabled at a late stage <e> <s> therefore it is extremely difficult for my advisers always to be able to get matters co-ordinated as they would wish <e>", "<cs> i think that it is a very good idea and i do not see any reason at all why we should not have another think all round <e> <s> my noble friend the duke of atholl has not moved his amendment so there is ample scope for a little bit of thought <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what has been said during the debate and of course i shall bear in mind all the points that have been made but since my noble friend has not moved his amendment there is no need to deliberate further upon it <e>", "<cs> i already have in effect moved amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in answering this short debate i should like to make sure that i am answering all the amendments which we are including <e> <s> perhaps i may just read them out amendment no <e> <s> is the amendment which has been moved together with which we are considering amendment no <e> <s> viscount ridleys amendment amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble viscount lord thurso and also lord thursos amendments nos <e> <s> <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> yes amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> appears on the surface to be of little apparent consequence as there is unlikely to be much if any difference in practice between co-option by the board and appointment to a board <e> <s> the amendment however is one of several tabled by the noble viscount with the intention of altering the whole way in which representatives of anglers and tenant netsmen will obtain membership of a board <e> <s> as i have explained already the arrangement proposed in the bill co-option by the board is the best approach and i regret that i am unable to accept amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i must make the point clear to the noble viscount <e> <s> i have not conceded the point about election rather than co-option <e> <s> i made that clear when i said that i could not accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am absolutely prepared to consider the balance between co-optees anglers and netsmen <e> <s> i am also prepared to have discussions or to arrange for my advisers to have discussions with the noble viscount on any of the other points which he wishes to discuss <e> <s> i explained earlier on amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord ridley that i was prepared to consider it again if my noble friend would withdraw his amendment <e> <s> i make that quite clear <e> <s> i am not <e>", "<cs> as i explained at second reading this wording is in the same form as a similar provision in the act <e> <s> the words by agreement are included now to underline the fact that boards do not have compulsory purchase powers <e> <s> the removal of these words would have little effect on the interpretation of this clause since boards would not be enabled to carry out compulsory purchases without specific powers to do so <e>", "<cs> i can fully understand the thoughts and the intention behind this amendment <e> <s> there is however already an efficient mechanism for dealing with salmon found in the circumstances that the noble lord describes <e> <s> it is provided under part iv of the civic government scotland act and allows for the finding of such property to be reported to one of a number of persons including the police and permits the chief constable to make such arrangements as he sees fit for disposal of the fish <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with what the noble viscount is seeking to achieve and i can see that unregulated stocking could do considerable harm <e> <s> however i believe that this amendment goes too far <e> <s> for example it seems to me to be unreasonable to require angling clubs which regularly stock with brown trout or rainbow trout to seek the consent of a salmon board and i am not attracted to the idea of the secretary of states role where no board exists <e> <s> if the noble viscount will be prepared to withdraw his amendment i am prepared to look further into this and to bring forward an amendment at a later stage which i think will go a long way towards meeting the objectives mentioned by noble lords this evening <e>", "<cs> i simply cannot answer my noble friend on that point <e> <s> of course we will take everything into account when we are considering the matter and i am offering to take it back and look at it <e> <s> surely that is reasonable <e>", "<cs> the amendment would provide that only a paid official of such an association would be barred <e> <s> i concede the principle of this amendment but in fact i have decided to go further <e> <s> i intend to table at a later stage an amendment which will wholly remove the bar on officials of angling associations whether paid or not <e> <s> this picks up a point made by the noble viscount lord thurso at <e>", "<cs> i can answer the noble lord immediately so far as that point is concerned <e> <s> i have given a number of undertakings and perhaps it would be for the convenience of the noble lord if i were to write to him tomorrow and set out the points that i have undertaken to look at again <e>", "<cs> i shall cover that point when i write to the noble lord <e> <s> i have given an assurance that i will outline the points that i intend to consider again and i shall include that one <e>", "<cs> i think i have already indicated to the noble lord and to the committee but i shall confirm it by letter to the noble lord that i shall be looking carefully at the question of equal co-option of numbers of anglers and tenant netsmen <e> <s> i shall be looking at the question of officials of angling associations not being barred from co-option <e>", "<cs> i shall do better than that <e> <s> i shall put a copy of the letter in the library <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for her explanation of this amendment but i hope that i can convince her that it is not necessary <e> <s> i consider that the use of the word may in this clause is preferable and necessary since it allows a necessary flexibility in the order and it may not in practice be felt necessary or desirable to provide for all elements set out in the clause <e> <s> despite what the noble lady has said i see no advantage in her pressing this amendment and i hope that she will be prepared to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> this amendment appears to start from a false premise namely that the secretary of state appoints all water bailiffs <e> <s> in fact water bailiffs are appointed by district boards although under section of the act the secretary of state has powers to appoint persons for enforcement purposes to cover areas where there are no boards in existence <e>", "<cs> persuasive as the noble lord is the secretary of state simply does not have the necessary local knowledge to appoint bailiffs <e> <s> it is much better to leave it to the boards which possess the necessary local knowledge and know the people who might be suitable <e> <s> i am afraid that what the noble lord says does not convince me and i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that anyone who has sat through our discussions today could say that i have been anything other than sympathetic towards the amendments that have been moved <e> <s> i have taken a good many back to look at again <e> <s> i have accepted a good many <e> <s> i am bound to say to the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord carmichael that this is one which i cannot take back because i do not see myself being able to come forward with what they seek <e> <s> there is of course no reason why they cannot withdraw the amendment think about it a little longer and perhaps come forward with something themselves that might be worthy of consideration at a later stage <e>", "<cs> in answer to my noble friend let me say that officials of local authorities the police and the water bailiffs all have the power to examine the books <e>", "<cs> i think that i can deal fairly briefly and fairly fully with the points raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock who made rather a meal of it as usual <e> <s> i shall try to answer his questions <e> <s> we are talking about enabling powers <e> <s> the whole clause extends existing powers under the civic government scotland act to licensing of salmon dealing and gives additional powers <e> <s> there will be full consultation on the exercise of the power including discussions with cosla chief constables and others <e> <s> a further safeguard is the fact that the order will be subject to parliamentary procedure <e>", "<cs> whether we see it here or not is a matter for the usual channels to decide <e> <s> the negative procedure is the normal way of proceeding and that is what is selected for the bill <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows perfectly well that we are talking about enabling powers <e> <s> we are not talking about the actual dealer licensing scheme <e> <s> the dealer licensing scheme is still being worked out and of course nobody can tell him at this precise moment the answers to all these nitty points that he is raising <e> <s> the noble lord himself knows that he is the prize nit-picker of all time <e> <s> he is asking lots of little questions to which he knows perfectly well he cannot be given the answer just now because what we are talking about is the enabling power within this bill to introduce a dealer licensing scheme at a future date <e> <s> a dealer licensing scheme is not yet completed so i cannot possibly give him the answers for which he is asking <e> <s> he knows that as well as i do <e>", "<cs> perhaps the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord perth for his intervention <e> <s> indeed to some extent he has stolen my thunder because i was about to tell the noble lord lord ross of marnock that i had been misinformed <e>

of marnock <e> <s> i am sure this will help him to sleep very much better after his long day <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the depth of feeling which exists in aberdeen over the proposals in the strategy paper but i must point out to the noble lord that the paper has been widely interpreted as announcing the closure of the macaulay institute <e> <s> nothing could be further from the truth <e> <s> the paper suggests that consideration at or close to the hill farming research organisation at bush estate edinburgh may and i repeat may prove to be the more productive option and a study will be carried out into the feasibility of achieving this <e> <s> the benefits and the traditions of the macaulay institute are fully acknowledged and the feasibility study will take all aspects of the merger into account <e> <s> i should emphasise that the merger has been widely welcomed on all sides including within the macaulay institute but not surprisingly the bone of contention is the location of the new macaulay <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord john-mackie that the future of the macaulay institute properties and premises will be one of the considerations given attention by the feasibility study <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a fair point <e> <s> however perhaps i may remind him that we need to develop research programmes which both respond to and anticipate the changing circumstances in which agriculture is practised and in particular the relationship between agriculture and the environment <e> <s> in this we have had full regard to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord lord ross of marnock whose interest in agriculture i fully appreciate from his former incarnation as secretary of state for scotland that the study has already begun <e> <s> two meetings have been held of the steering committee which is chaired by an official of the department of agriculture and fisheries in scotland and comprises the directors of the macaulay the hfro and the scri and the director general of cosac together with the departments scientific adviser dr raven <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think it is amazing at all and i have little doubt that if the decision were that the activities presently carried out at bush estate in edinburgh were to be moved to aberdeen we would have had similar representations from edinburgh <e>", "<cs> my lords that point will be undoubtedly taken into consideration by those examining in the feasibility study <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comment and i can confirm to him that i am fully aware of the feeling in the highlands of scotland regarding this matter although it is not all in the one direction <e> <s> however as an aside perhaps i may suggest to him that as a result of the improvements which have been made on the a northwards one can now be in the highlands of scotland as quickly from edinburgh as one can on the a from aberdeen <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for his comments and to the noble viscount for giving the view of the alliance parties <e> <s> i did not expect either of them to give the statement a word of welcome indeed it is their duty as the opposition to pick holes in it as much as they can <e> <s> the noble lord said that we had been here before when i heard his speech i too realised that <e> <s> it was the speech that we hear from time to time a general resume of what the press says a general condemnation of the government and a further rehearsal of what we have done in the past <e> <s> what he failed to say is that while we may have been here before we have never followed this route which is precisely what we were condemned for not doing in the past <e>", "<cs> oh yes my lords <e> <s> we gave a pledge that we should find something to replace the present rating system <e> <s> we did not come up with anything and for that were taken to task vigorously during the last election campaign <e> <s> we have looked again at the situation and have come up with a scheme that we believe is better and more fair than the present system and which will benefit a great many people <e> <s> it is strange if the noble lord or the noble viscount can defend a scheme under which a poor widowed pensioner pays the same amount if she happens to live in a similar house to a married couple with three sons all of whom are working <e> <s> i am sure that they do not really believe that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made his speech and he asked one or two questions which i shall try to answer <e> <s> he is a pensioner and appears to be happy with the situation but i assure him that plenty of single pensioners in not nearly such comfortable circumstances will be a lot happier <e>", "<cs> my lords it means that there could conceivably be a wide range of taxation within scotland <e> <s> i hardly imagine that that would be popular <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present moment million scots have the vote <e> <s> i want to develop this because this was a point that was raised <e> <s> about million are householders and thus liable to pay rates <e> <s> the other million are not billed directly and do not personally have to make any payment to their local authority <e> <s> a proportion of those are spouses of ratepayers but many of them and the bulk of the other members of ratepayers households may have little idea of the cost of local services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend who of course had great experience of the whole question of rates when he was secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> yes i can confirm to him that it is the governments intention to legislate in the forthcoming session of parliament the session as the noble lord lord ross of marnock said that will start presumably in november this year <e> <s> we envisage that from the end of the passing of the legislation there would be a phasing-in period of three years <e> <s> i can confirm that also to my noble friend <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier the government have not just suddenly started thinking about this <e> <s> the government have been thinking about it for many years <e> <s> they have not proceeded until now because there have always been difficulties and objections to the solutions which

but the noble lord is perfectly correct <e> <s> there will be a great deal of effort needed from the end of the period of consultation and during the period when representations are being considered by the government before a bill can be finalised <e> <s> i have little doubt however that the scottish office with its usual keenness to get on with the job and having some excellent draftsmen available to it will produce something in plenty of time for us to see it go through during the next session of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should first like to join others of your lordships who have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given way to the noble lord and i see that i should not have given way to him at all <e> <s> he is the one who is sensitive <e> <s> if one cannot make criticism of his contribution it is a funny old house <e> <s> but i shall not follow that path and i shall perhaps refer to one or two of his points in the course of my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has seen it at least because i think it is a useful publication <e> <s> i have some doubts as to whether he has made a case to justify an annual publication of the kind he has in mind in view of all the information which is already available but i undertake to pass on to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy the suggestion which the noble lord has made and no doubt energy ministers will look at it and give it consideration <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i read out again the amendments to be considered with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they are amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i can help my noble friend <e> <s> if he looks at the amendments that have been grouped with amendment no <e> <s> he will find that they all relate to the new clause that has been tabled <e> <s> that is why they have been grouped in that way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct in thinking that such is the case <e> <s> i may add that his noble friend lord thurso has apologised to me for not being present today and i quite understand the reasons for his absence <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first deal with the point raised by the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> of course i have sympathy with her in the problem she outlined but this is not a scottish office matter <e> <s> however i have no doubt that my noble friends will have taken note of the point she made <e> <s> i think it is significant although she is not entirely happy with the wording of clause that the new offence will apply in england and wales as well as in scotland <e> <s> on her second point i think her noble friend lord moran has dealt with that <e> <s> there will be an opportunity to discuss it a little later in the bill <e>", "<cs> i should not like to argue too much with my noble friend on the technicalities of this point <e> <s> the order has been laid as monofilament net <e> <s> my information is that despite what my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes i take the point from my noble friend lord massereene and i shall certainly find out the position for him and write to him in due course because i do not have the information myself <e>", "<cs> i accept the principle of the issues raised by amendments nos <e> <s> a and b in the names of the noble earl lord haig and the noble lord lord burton respectively that forfeiture of vehicles and boats under part i or section of the act could take place at the discretion of the court whether cases are taken on indictment or by summary procedure <e> <s> this would remove the present limitation to cases on indictment in the act and would bring that act into line with the provisions of the criminal procedure scotland act where the general power of forfeiture is not restricted to solemn procedure <e> <s> the amendments tabled by the noble lords are not entirely appropriate in drafting terms and i therefore felt it better to bring forward my own amendment to cover the point <e> <s> in view of that perhaps noble lords would agree to withdraw their amendments <e>", "<cs> i accept fully that the burden of satisfying my right honourable friend that the consent has been obtained of all proprietors of salmon fisheries likely to be affected in a district might and probably will be an onerous one <e> <s> nevertheless i am satisfied that any act or omission in contravention of any enactment should be exempted only if such consent is demonstrated <e> <s> it would not be right to exempt unlawful acts or omissions without such consent if individual proprietors fisheries were likely to be adversely affected <e> <s> this if a quantifiable loss could be shown to have resulted might give rise to claims for damages or for compensation <e> <s> i can understand what my noble friend seeks to do but i cannot accept his amendment for the reasons that i have outlined <e> <s> i wonder whether he will consider withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> i cannot give my noble friend an assurance that i shall be able to bring back something which will wholly satisfy him <e> <s> i am however prepared to take this matter away and to have another look at it without commitment if my noble friend would consider withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord and my noble friend lord burton the assurance that they seek <e> <s> we shall look at both of those points before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot accept the noble lords amendment <e> <s> my noble friend has given certain assurances that matters will be looked at again <e> <s> but if i may say so the noble lord is putting the cart before the horse here and therefore i am afraid that i cannot agree to change the long title at this stage <e> <s> my noble friend has given an assurance for the earlier request which the noble lord made but i am afraid that i cannot accept an amendment to change the long title at this stage <e>", "<cs> i can answer my noble friend <e> <s> i am advised that the change of the long title would be consequential if the earlier changes which were requested were made so that it could be done in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords in my initial reply to the noble lord i said that at this juncture it was too soon to be clear whether recent lower trends in oil prices will persist or how sterling oil prices will react <e> <s> we can go no further than that <e> <s> this may not be a situation which will last for a very long time <e> <s> as we have experienced in the past the price of oil can rise just as quickly as it can fall <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point which my noble friend makes and it does re-emphasise what i have said <e> <s> as we have found in years gone by i am afraid oil prices can rise as quickly as they can fall <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is not quite correct in what he says <e> <s> on many occasions in recent years the oil companies have taken a collective decision that prices would rise but those prices did not stabilise and in a reasonably short time there was a price war which resulted in prices coming down again <e> <s> so far as the present situation goes my information is that there has been a drop in the price of petrol at the pumps and if oil were to drop to dollars a barrel i do not think there is any doubt but that we should see a very substantial drop at the pumps <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point the noble baroness has made <e> <s> i think what will happen if the oil prices continue to remain low is that we shall see this reflected in the price charged for the fuel oil to which my noble friend refers just as in the price at the pumps <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has not been following closely what i said <e> <s> i said nothing of the sort <e> <s> i said that the price of gas would be a matter for the british gas corporation and a lot would depend on whether the drop in oil prices was reflected and passed on to the main suppliers of whom the gas corporation would be one <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must suggest to the noble lord that he is not being completely fair <e> <s> he referred to the statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy on th january <e> <s> now followed very closely upon and of course until june the party of which he is a member had been in office for some considerable time <e> <s> my right honourable friend found it necessary to make his statement as to how the price of gas was to be treated because our predecessors had not faced up to the problem <e> <s> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy which was followed was followed for a period of three years in order to re-establish the position whch had been lost during the time in which the party of the noble lord was in power and the situation was not faced up to <e>", "<cs> my lords on a previous occasion i think i have paid tribute to the work of the noble baroness and her concern for the consumer but sometimes when dealing with a situation which has got very much out of hand it is necessary to take steps which are unpopular at the time in order to achieve the proper results in the longer term <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not giving the noble lord any such assurance <e> <s> i made it absolutely clear that this must be a matter for the british gas corporation and if he has any doubt about that i suggest he writes to the chairman of that corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern which the noble lord expresses in view of the present world oil surplus <e> <s> but i think the noble lord should bear in mind that it is to everybodys advantage that the levels of oil production are determined by producers <e> <s> arbitrary cuts in production would damage investment confidence and our prospects for oil production in the s and beyond <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot take the point which the noble baroness seeks to make because there is no question of the government not having an oil policy <e> <s> i have already this afternoon stated twice that the government believe that it is in the best interests nationally that the production of oil should be left to those who have made the investment and are producing the oil rather than for government to interfere <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept the first point which my noble friend has made <e> <s> however as far as the second point is concerned i am sure that he would not expect me to follow him down this route <e> <s> this must be a matter for the chancellor of the exchequers judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first point i would say to the noble lord that if the creation of more than jobs of them onshore and the remainder offshore is the result of not having a policy then perhaps we should dispense with a few more policies <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often is the case my noble friend has summed up the situation very well indeed <e> <s> of course i agree with him entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i certainly would be hesitant to become involved in an argument with the right reverend prelate about where the moral responsibility in various aspects of life lies <e> <s> however as far as the oil industry is concerned i am satisfied that if we were to hold back as some would suggest now the effect on the investment in the north sea and the consequent result on jobs in which i know the right reverend prelate is very interested would be very serious indeed <e> <s> to hold back at this stage on production and to take away the incentive of the oil industry to make investment in the north sea would be very serious <e> <s> it would have exactly the effect which the right reverend prelate would not wish it to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be reluctant to spell out precisely what is being done with some of the oil revenue but it would be quite wrong to suggest that it was all being used for one purpose <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that much of the help that is given to industry comes from the treasury and of course if the treasury did not have access to oil revenues it might not be possible to be as generous as has been the case in many instances <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i do not think that the noble lord and i acknowledge his close involvement in the oil industry through his other interests is comparing like with like <e> <s> the requirement for self-sufficiency for example by norway so far as concerns their oil production can in no way be compared with that which this country requires and nor can the extent of the reserves nor the areas for which they are being explored and exploited <e> <s> therefore i would not accept the point that the noble lord seeks to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that without notice i cannot give the noble lord figures in answer to the question that he has put to me <e> <s> however i can certainly guarantee to him that the attitude of this government since and particularly since the chancellor of the exchequers budget in has had a very good effect on the continued investment by the oil industry in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not go into figures with the noble lord lord barnett because he has had such intimate contact with the treasury and the industry over the years that i know that he will know the figures <e> <s> regarding his reference to selling less for more or selling more for less perhaps i may say this <e> <s> it is a fact that a good many of the fields in production in the north sea at the present moment despite the low oil price at this time were decided upon when the oil price was substantially lower than it is today <e> <s> i go back to my first point that if we were to follow what many noble lords have suggested today we would be inhibiting rather than stimulating further investment in the north sea with all the ill effects that that would have <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always followed the policy of keeping close contact with those countries <e> <s> those contacts are of course unofficial since we are not members of opec but i have no doubt that that policy is still being pursued <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that there has been quite a substantial fall in the price of petrol at the pumps <e> <s> and i have little doubt that this will continue <e> <s> if the price of oil continues at its present level it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that there may yet be another price war and it is only the motorist who can benefit from such a situation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i shall try to do so as briefly as i can <e> <s> oil production has been more or less stabilised for about two years <e> <s> the oil price has dropped very suddenly within the past few months <e> <s> there is no guarantee that the oil price will remain low and at that level <e> <s> if we were to institute production cuts there would undoubtedly be many fields in which production would fall away considerably <e> <s> it might be very difficult for those fields to get back up to their present production and that might have inhibiting effects on companies in the future <e> <s> for those reasons i do not take the noble lords point <e> <s> we do not know how long the oil price will be down <e> <s> we saw what happened in and what happened again in and the price can rocket up just as easily as it can tumble down <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have cows in the oil fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the point that the noble lord seeks to make is relevant here because there is always an argument as to the speed at which oil is depleted and the speed at which production is allowed to advance <e> <s> at the present moment we are doing all that we can to ensure that the jobs which have been created in the north sea will not end when our own north sea oil production ceases <e> <s> we are trying to export our technology to the best of our ability and it is to be hoped that many of those who have learned their skills in the north sea will be able to use them in due course in other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would push the seaward limits of some salmon fishery districts far out to sea because the base line referred to in the fisheries limits act goes around the outside of the outer hebrides <e> <s> it is not appropriate that district boards should have responsibilities and duties in for example the whole of the minch <e> <s> i do however take the point that low-water mark is not very precise <e> <s> the term mean low water springs might perhaps be better given that it is delineated on the ordnance survey maps <e>", "<cs> my lords from the note which was given to me earlier i understand that we are also considering amendment no <e> <s> along with this amendment <e> <s> in case there has been any complication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> schedule provides standard rules for the election and co-option of members of district salmon fishery boards <e> <s> the noble viscount lord thurso has discussed his proposals with my officials following committee and i am sure that he had a useful discussion with them <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the rules in the schedule are complicated enough without as the noble lord has suggested making them variable for different districts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what i tried to explain earlier was that there was nothing in <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i could just point out that this is a general power for the whole schedule and is a standard provision <e> <s> what the noble viscount lord thurso seeks to do is to vary individual elements virtually on an <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i could just answer the noble lord lord burton <e> <s> this can apply but there is a discretion to exempt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord biddulph for outlining his thinking behind this amendment and i would say that my <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i may very briefly deal with the two points which have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord burton suggested that if it was not possible to include the amendment in this bill we should come back to the house with another bill to do so <e> <s> obviously i cannot give an answer to that but i should have thought that the suggestion i made could be helpful <e> <s> i said that we could have a separate exercise and that i would be glad to organise a meeting with officials and with the appropriate bodies such as the association of district boards although it need not be restricted to that association and others could be included in order to discuss this matter more fully <e> <s> there is no reason why in due course that might not lead to further legislation but certainly i would not be in a position to give any guarantee on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> with his wealth of experience in scottish office matters he may well have come across difficulties in regard to this issue <e> <s> i think that he is probably correct the second half of the amendment would be every bit as difficult to accommodate as the first <e> <s> however i think i made it clear that i would not be considering accepting either part of the amendment and of course the second part could equally well be included in the discussions which i have proposed <e> <s> with that suggestion i wonder whether the noble lord would consider withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious that the subject of control of baits and lures interests a good many of your lordships and i agreed to look again at whether it would be possible to provide appropriately in the bill for the sort of control that seems to be desired <e> <s> one of the points to be considered particularly carefully is the type of control and the arrangements for introducing and enforcing it <e> <s> i think this is what my noble friend lord home has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious that a number of your lordships spoke in general support of the reasoning behind the amendment tabled by the noble viscount lord thurso at committee <e> <s> for this reason i agreed to take the point away for further study although i think i made it quite clear at the time that i did not feel i would be able to come back with an amendment to the bill which would satisfy the noble viscount and others <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i say how grateful i am to the noble earl lord perth for drawing our attention to that point which i shall answer in a moment <e> <s> i do not think i should get involved in a discussion about the crown commissioners with two people so knowledgeable about their functions as the noble earl lord perth and the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> but i think the points have been well made and i have no doubt that my noble friend lord burton has taken them on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer that question without a little reference but i shall keep talking until the advice arrives and i shall then give it to my noble friend <e> <s> i am quite sure that i shall get useful information in a moment <e> <s> perhaps i may write to my noble friend <e> <s> it appears that he has bowled a googly which has fooled not only me but the box as well <e> <s> i shall let my noble friend know in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is for the convenience of the house to discuss along with amendment no <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no particular reason why we chose to give the role of a board to two proprietors in a district where there is no board although there is clearly a loose tie with the provision in schedule to the bill that it takes at least two proprietors in a district to set in motion the procedures for creating a board <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be able to explain this matter to my noble friend even if the noble lord lord ross of marnock is not with us at present to make his contribution <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> relates to a number of other amendments all of which are designed to remove the association of proprietors whose committee may become a district board from the bill <e> <s> i appreciate that the structure we have created is complex but i hope to be able to persuade noble lords that it serves a very real purpose <e> <s> existing district boards constituted under the and acts enjoy a somewhat doubtful legal status and their powers are limited to what statute provides for them <e> <s> in the new structure we expect a board in its character as a committee of a voluntary association to avail itself of the common law powers appropriate to such a body as well as the additional powers given to the board in the bill <e> <s> likewise the underlying scheme allows for ease of transfer between boards where districts amalgamate and also removes any possible vacuum that might arise when a board lapses <e> <s> it is important therefore that the board retains its capacities as the committee of a voluntary association and the bill has been carefully drafted with that in mind <e> <s> i hope that explanation will satisfy my noble friend <e>", "<cs> by leave my lords i dealt with this amendment when dealing with amendment no <e> <s> and i think it has been covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand the thought and the reason behind this amendment <e> <s> it seems very reasonable that boards should have a means of communicating with the fishery interests they represent and that their accounts should be prepared annually <e> <s> indeed i understand that a great many boards already have regular meetings and that some publish annual reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i sense that there is a genuine concern about this matter <e> <s> in view of what has been said i take the point that the noble earl lord perth has made <e> <s> i was perfectly prepared to discuss the matter with the association of district boards <e> <s> if it is the general wish that we should go further than that then i shall without commitment take this back have a look at it again and perhaps return to it at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the concern of my noble friend regarding this question that district board rates should be applied to all fisheries in the district equally <e> <s> i can see that the use of the words rate or rates would give rise to the impression that differential rates were envisaged <e> <s> the purpose of using rate or rates is to ensure that a board can impose a supplementary rate or a special rate in addition to any regular assessment if it so decided <e> <s> the possibility of this being interpreted as allowing differential rates was anticipated <e> <s> that is why the word uniform was inserted in the clause immediately before the words rate or rates to make sure that the assessments could not discriminate between fisheries of different sorts <e> <s> i am assured that the subsection as drafted has that effect <e> <s> i hope therefore that with that explanation my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at the outset i can point out to my noble friend lord burton that his amendment is defective inasmuch as there is no specification of rate of interest and there is no indication of when interest would be due <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to my noble friend for moving the amendment and thus keeping the interesting suggestion before us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made reference to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> at this stage we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all i can say is that i have noted what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for this amendment <e> <s> it gives me this opportunity to assure your lordships house that district boards will under this bill be able to carry out research and meet the expenses of it from their funds provided that the research is relevant to the good management of the stocks and their district <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will see that i have tabled a number of amendments relating to co-option <e> <s> i think that these enable us to see the general idea rather more clearly <e> <s> i have looked again at the proposals of the noble viscount lord thurso for election of angling and tenant netsmen representatives other than co-option but i remain of the view that co-option is the best course <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of clause is to give a district salmon fishery board power to take action at its own hand for the purposes specified therein <e> <s> examples of the kind of action it might take under clause are given in clause <e> <s> in addition under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord has argued forcefully in support of this amendment i must point out that clause of the bill already allows a district salmon fishery board to sue or be sued in the name of its clerk <e> <s> the bill places no restriction on the types of action which a clerk may raise on behalf of a board <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may very briefly answer the noble lady <e> <s> i certainly should not be happy about the involvement of the secretary of state in the appointment of the chairman of every district board <e> <s> indeed i can think of many reasons why that would not be desirable <e> <s> of course the points which the noble lady has made are perfectly justified <e> <s> there is always a difficulty where there are conflicting interests <e> <s> however i believe that the solution which we have spelled out in the bill is the fairest we could have chosen <e> <s> i certainly should be unhappy about the secretary of state being directly involved in the appointment of a chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that it is for the convenience of the house that i deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly prepared to go along with that <e> <s> the noble lord did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see that removing the words which the noble lords wish to remove will achieve very much but neither do i see that their retention is necessary <e> <s> i am therefore disposed to accept the amendment on the basis that those such as fish farmers who may be excepted specifically in terms of the clause may still be excepted following the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord carmichael has said <e> <s> i know he feels very strongly about this matter but with regard to the powers of entry and search for water bailiffs in connection with the dealer licensing scheme i would make the point to him that the power is purely permissive and will like all other such powers be subject to discussion with interested organisations including csla <e> <s> the order which will introduce the dealer licensing scheme will in terms of the civic government act be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> that should be sufficient safeguard for the proper consideration of the rights of those who are likely to be affected by powers of entry and search <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord ross of marnock on two points which he raised <e> <s> first on the existing powers in the civic government act which he spoke about constables and local authority officers will have powers under the act the bill allows <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have sympathy with my noble friend lord home <e> <s> on the other hand i am bound to say that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate went into considerable detail at committee stage in order to try to persuade those of your lordships who needed persuading of the merit of the wording in the bill <e> <s> in addition i understand that he went to a considerable amount of trouble to meet outside this chamber certain noble lords who still held reservations about the point we are now debating <e> <s> again i understand that he failed to persuade those noble lords of the merit of the wording in the bill although i believe he felt that he had made progress <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to clarify one point to the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> i can assure him that there is absolutely no question of a threat <e> <s> what i said expressed a purely personal feeling that if the amendments are withdrawn they will not be tabled again <e> <s> we are talking about scottish law and about the position in scotland to which my noble friend lord home also referred and indicated that as regards scotland he is of a mind to take the advice of the lord advocate <e> <s> i hope that that is the advice which prevails <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in some doubt as to why the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble lord lord carmichael should not wish my right honourable and learned friend to have the power to prescribe the fees which the licensing authorities may charge <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend a new one <e> <s> this power will be exercised only after consultation with cosla and others <e> <s> it is primarily aimed at ensuring that there is not too wide a variation of fees over the country <e> <s> there is certainly no intention to prescribe fees which are unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have obviously not had the opportunity to contact my noble and learned friend the lord advocate since we rose for the dinner break <e> <s> however on his behalf i am perfectly prepared to tell my noble friend that between now and the third reading of this bill an opportunity will be given for my noble and learned friend the lord advocate to meet with those most directly concerned <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that my noble and learned friend will be prepared to acquiesce in that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is the intention of my noble and learned friend to be here at third reading <e> <s> my noble friend will appreciate that i cannot give an absolute assurance but as far as i know it is my noble and learned friends intention to be here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord burton raised this matter during the committee stage and my noble and learned friend the lord advocate suggested that he might take it back so that we could discuss it and see if we could come forward with a reasonable solution <e> <s> since the committee stage we have been looking at this but have not yet reached a conclusion <e> <s> as noble lords will appreciate new powers of search have to be very carefully considered and i hope therefore that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment on the assurance that i still have his proposal under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene at this moment <e> <s> my noble friend has already spoken three times and this is the report stage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord who moved his amendment and then in winding up asked a great many further questions of my noble friend simply cannot expect an answer tonight <e> <s> there is a further stage of the bill in this house when we have the third reading and it would be an abuse of the house if my noble friend were to participate again <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will understand the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong to suggest that this amendment is acceptable <e> <s> if it were made a person who unintentionally committed any of the offences created in section of the act could be found guilty by the court and convicted <e> <s> he might simply be wading through a river disturbing spawning beds in the process without any intention of doing so and he would still he guilty <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will agree that this would be quite wrong <e> <s> in any event the amendment is technically defective since it is drafted so as to affect section of the act rather than section <e> <s> i am afraid therefore that i cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall bring joy to my noble friends heart <e> <s> this amendment corrects a mistake in the drafting of paragraph of the schedule and i am happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it this is a reasonable and apparently straightforward amendment <e> <s> it does however raise some interesting points <e> <s> first the two distances three miles for the district boundary one mile for the offence of fishing for salmon without permission are set out for quite different purposes <e> <s> there is no underlying reason why they should be the same <e> <s> secondly the one mile of section of the act derives from a provision made in the s when fishing for salmon beyond one mile was not envisaged or thought possible <e> <s> we now know differently <e> <s> but provision has been made to prohibit the use in scotland of those methods which could be used in the area not covered by the act prohibition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord burton for these suggestions although i should like to consider further what is proposed and to look carefully at the drafting of the necessary amendments <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that i am sympathetic to the purpose of these proposals <e> <s> on that assurance perhaps the noble lord would be prepared to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly not wish to rule out the inclusion of a provison to this effect in the bill but i am concerned that the noble lords amendment may not be the right way to go about it <e> <s> the best i can say is that i assure the noble lord that i am entirely in sympathy with what he proposes <e> <s> it is obviously desirable if scientific matters which are not in dispute can be dealt with in this way and could be advantageous in terms of time and costs to both scientists and the courts <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to withdraw his amendment to allow time to consider how the intention can best be achieved and to look carefully at the provisons to which this proposal should be applied <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will withdraw his amendment on that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon for his acceptance of the commons amendment and for the way in which he welcomed it <e> <s> i am always slightly apprehensive when i hear that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has been in touch with my private office particularly when it is on a subject such as this on which he is an acknowledged expert <e> <s> i am appreciative of the fact that he took the trouble to advise me of the two points he wished to raise so that i might have the opportunity of having them examined and having an answer prepared for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can be a little more helpful to my noble friend lord burton and the noble viscount lord thurso in connection with this amendment <e> <s> during the report stage i indicated that i was sympathetic and that certainly remains the position <e> <s> my officials will be meeting with the scottish anglers national association on th march which is the earliest date that could be arranged <e> <s> thereafter i would hope to reach a conclusion <e> <s> the present amendment would not in fact achieve what noble lords have in mind <e> <s> it would allow of a single set of fixed rules on a national basis but not the local variations which were described as being necessary <e> <s> on this explanation and with the assurance which i have given i trust that my noble friend will be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand fully why my noble friend has moved this amendment and i am very sorry that i cannot yet either accept his amendment or table an alternative <e> <s> this in no sense reflects lack of interest in the point but indicates that the matter is not as straightforward as may appear at first sight <e> <s> as i indicated at report stage we have to consider for example the need to have a power to impose an interest charge before there can be a power to recover arrears of interest <e> <s> because of this and the uncertainty about the meaning of subscription in this context my noble friends amendment is defective <e> <s> i can however give the noble lord the assurance that i am sympathetic to the principle of what he has in mind and hope that it will be possible to produce an acceptable form of words <e> <s> i trust that in view of this he will be prepared to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock asked me about a definition of the word adjoining <e> <s> i cannot give him a more accurate description than that which i am sure he and i would agree upon <e> <s> the vehicle must be parked on private land adjoining water <e> <s> my interpretation of that is alongside such water <e> <s> my interpretation of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords the words are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like particularly to thank the noble viscount lord thurso the noble lady lady saltoun the noble earl lord perth and the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for what they have said this evening <e> <s> indeed i should like to express my thanks to all members of your lordships house who have participated in all stages of this bill <e> <s> the bill has not been without its controversy and indeed from a ministers point of view it has been an experience worth having to find most of the controversy on ones own side <e> <s> one expects to be criticised from the other side of the house indeed i am indebted to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for his sympathy on occasion which i have appreciated very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer that quite briefly inasmuch as the department is satisfied that those measures are working effectively <e> <s> my noble friend will recall that as a result of the offshore safety report by the burgoyne committee in the department of energy appointed an inspector on part-time duties to monitor the safety regimes needed and offered industry-wide offshore <e> <s> that inspector is an assessor for the offshore petroleum industry training board and also for the mechanical and electrical engineering training board both of which he supervises <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are doing their utmost to encourage postgraduate courses in those subjects <e> <s> indeed there is an added incentive <e> <s> it may be of interest to my noble friend to <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of education and science has made known on many occasions the facilities that exist for engineering students and through that medium the government have expressed themselves in the hope that more students will select engineering for their professional career <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the tribute which the noble lord has paid to my right honourable friend and i shall certainly convey it to him <e> <s> however i must say that i think we should look at the situation in the knowledge that the disposals policy is from time to time reviewed <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean that there will always be a change at the end of any review <e> <s> however i think that the government would be rather unwise not to carry on a continuing review of many of their policies and that we seek to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is a former minister of state in the ministry of agricul <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what my noble friend says and of course he will be aware that part of the present forestry policy which the government have been pursuing is that planting should be increased in the private sector and reduced by the forestry commission in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i take careful note of what the noble lord has said but it is not in accordance with my information <e> <s> public rights of way are not affected by a change of ownership <e> <s> so far as concerns public access we have no reason to believe that those parts of the forestry commission estate which have been sold have led to difficulties in regard to public access <e> <s> indeed before the sales take place the forestry commission itself goes to some trouble to discuss with potential buyers the desirability of continuing access <e> <s> so far as i am aware there have been no major difficulties in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that large areas of land have been sold by the forestry commission indiscriminately <e> <s> as at st january this year just over hectares of plantation and <e>", "<cs> my lords when more than one minister has responsibility in a particular area there obviously has to be a leader somewhere <e> <s> as per cent of the forestry estate is in scotland it is not unreasonable that the lead should be with the secretary of state for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that point and it is well known by the commission <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is a fact but of course it does not really bear on the question regarding the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand what the noble lord is getting at <e> <s> the money which was received has gone to the treasury and it is not the treasurys custom to hypothecate for any particular purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy was clearly enunciated by my right honourable friend in his statement of th november and the selling of forestry lands has been done in accordance with the best discretion of the forestry commission itself <e> <s> the fact that these lands were surplus to their requirements is i think sufficient reason that they should be disposed <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the second point the noble lord raised i think i indicated that where disposals have taken place the forestry commission have gone to considerable efforts to ensure that access will be continued <e> <s> so far as the first point is concerned if the government were at some future time to decide upon any major change to the policy already enunciated in november then of course parliament would be informed in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very useful debate <e> <s> the fact that our discussions have not been over-prolonged reflects the very close consideration which the bill has received in another place where for example its provisions were examined for over hours in committee sittings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> i shall make that clear <e> <s> i have already mentioned tonight some types of houses <e> <s> i shall however make sure that a complete list is prepared for my noble friend and made available at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about money that is available for rebuilding by authorities or associations in due course when the opportunity presents itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the money is available as i understand the position to the authority to be used in accordance with its own priorities whether building new homes or modernising older properties <e> <s> the sums involved since run into hundreds of millions of pounds <e>", "<cs> my lords my retort to that would be that the noble lord selects his government papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord and i could continue for a very long time and still not agree at the end of the day <e> <s> the figures which i gave perhaps put the problem in perspective a little more accurately <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have had a useful and interesting debate <e> <s> as i indicated when i moved the second reading of the bill the role of the secretary of state for scotland on occasions such as this is entirely formal <e> <s> therefore i shall not engage in the usual wind-up speech which one gives on the second reading of a bill <e> <s> however there are two points to which i should like to return <e> <s> first there was the point initially raised by the noble lord lord carmichael which was followed by the noble lord lord ross of marnock about the new method of funding which the region is to adopt <e> <s> it is not really for me to describe or defend the method which is to be used <e> <s> that is a matter for lothian regional council <e>", "<cs> my lords it is correct that the french have made substantial advances with the production of nuclear power and that the majority of their power generation now comes from that source <e> <s> my noble friend is also correct that the cost at which they can now export electricity through the link to us is some per cent <e> <s> less than that already available to the central electricity generating board from other sources <e>", "<cs> my lords that is something which i cannot answer <e> <s> the negotiations which have taken place between edf and the cegb are commercially confidential <e> <s> they are to the advantage of the cegb but i am not in a position to say whether the prices are being subsidised by the french <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point which i have little doubt is being considered but there are technical difficulties of which the noble earl will be aware <e> <s> however i have noted what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness this is not a matter for the british government or the french government <e> <s> it is a matter for the utilities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised at the attitude of some noble lords opposite <e> <s> the cegb has been able to negotiate a highly advantageous commercial transaction but all sorts of doubts now appear to be placed upon it <e> <s> i can say to the noble lord lord stoddart that for the present link a two-year period has been negotiated in which the french will supply electricity to this country <e> <s> no arrangements have been made beyond that <e> <s> the link is designed so that of course electricity can be imported or exported <e> <s> beyond the two-year period no negotiations have so far taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct and that is precisely why i emphasised that the link is designed for the import or export of electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all most anxious to be reasonable <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that as time passes and we come toward the end of the two-year period that would be an appropriate time to re-assess the situation and arrange future commercial contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i agree with him because he has stated a fact which cannot be refuted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend the assurance that as soon as the report of the sizewell inquiry is received the secretary of state for energy will make it a top priority to consider it carefully and a decision will be reached as soon as is reasonably possible <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the production of energy this country has been singularly fortunate over the years in that our resources of fossil fuels have been very great indeed <e> <s> france has not had that advantage consequently minds have been concentrated and it has moved ahead with its nuclear power programme very much more quickly than anybody else in europe with the consequent benefits to its industry which are now becoming apparent <e> <s> however there is no question of the government not pursuing our own advancement in the energy field <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that that point will be well noted by those who are responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point which my noble friend has made very well <e> <s> i do not think that i can improve on his choice of words <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps best to look forward rather than back and we cannot make reasonable progress until we have the result of the sizewell inquiry <e> <s> but everything reasonable is being done to ensure that the result of the inquiry will be given to the government as soon as possible and when it is given a decision will be taken in all haste <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to detain the house because if i sense the mood correctly there are other matters to which your lordships would wish to proceed <e> <s> let me briefly say that i agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock inasmuch as the noble earl lord perth made a mistake in fact he made two <e> <s> when he was enunciating those who were opposed to this measure he failed to put the other side of the case and to say that strong representations have been received by the regional council on behalf of the transport and general workers union which strongly supports it <e>", "<cs> my lords the tgwu strongly supports what the regional council seeks to do <e> <s> the financial situation is a matter entirely for lothian regional council <e> <s> it has been discussed with the government and the government are in sympathy with what the council seeks to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for framing his question in the way that he did <e> <s> i cannot give that information without reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to deal with those points in due course <e> <s> i will try to answer some of the questions that were raised and i assure my noble friend that i will return to the matter that he has mentioned <e>", "<cs> we have had a very long debate <e> <s> the noble lord will have several days in which to give us his views <e> <s> there is an important statement to follow and i believe that the committee would want me to bring this debate to a conclusion <e> <s> i mean no discourtesy to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to learn that i cannot accept this amendment nor am i persuaded by any of the arguments <e> <s> the procedure which we have set out in the bill for appointing the director general of gas supply follows a well established precedent and as the noble lord lord bruce of donington indicated that is not in dispute <e> <s> both the director general of fair trading and the director-general of oftel must be appointed by the secretary of state and those are but two examples <e> <s> the list is long <e> <s> the procedure is well tried and it has been found to be satisfactory <e> <s> scores of government appointments are made in this way <e> <s> it would be entirely unnecessary and i believe inappropriate to single out the appointment of the director for consultation with committees from either house of parliament <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble baroness i do not think that it is totally different <e> <s> i am pointing out that there is ample <e>", "<cs> i am happy to do so <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his contribution and for making the suggestion <e> <s> whatever department is making an appointment anybody who has had experience of government will confirm that these appointments are not made generally speaking without a considerable amount of consultation among ministers <e> <s> it is not a case of ministers just selecting chums and appointing them at random <e> <s> there is a great deal of consideration given to appointments because appointments of this sort are going to attract a considerable amount of public attention and if the government get it wrong the government will be subject to a considerable amount of criticism <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the noble lord is very persuasive and he was one of the nicest commissars that we could have had <e> <s> but he has not succeeded in persuading me that he has built upon the point made by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> he was equally persuasive on this but i cannot accept that a select committee of either house for that matter is in a better position to give advice to the secretary of state on an appointment of this nature <e> <s> they are not necessarily in a better position than the secretary of state and his advisers <e>", "<cs> no i should not dream of giving way on this because i do not think there is a valid point <e> <s> there is no reason whatever why a select committee if it feels so inclined on a particular appointment cannot make the secretary of state aware of its views <e> <s> but it is quite wrong for us to write that into legislation <e> <s> a select committee has the perfect right if it chooses to use it and it would be perfectly in order to make that view known to the secretary of state <e> <s> but i am not happy about writing it into legislation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord must have misheard me <e> <s> i did not for one moment suggest that the select committees of this house were political in any way quite the contrary <e> <s> when his noble friend sitting behind him spoke he acknowledged that <e> <s> he said that they were very proud of being non-political <e> <s> i think i used the phrase above politics <e> <s> i am afraid the noble lord has it wrong <e> <s> i did not say that so i do not know why he will not accept the point <e> <s> i certainly did not say it <e>", "<cs> they might <e>", "<cs> he said six <e>", "<cs> i am always prepared to help with a filibuster <e> <s> if i heard the noble lord correctly he suggested that the committee might need six sittings to come to such a decision but i thought that that was rather at variance with the noble lords own view <e> <s> no doubt he will clarify that point <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and i accept that as he himself said he plucked out the figure of six but he has now plucked out the figure of <e> <s> if one of the serious arguments for this is that there would not be delays i have suggested that it would lead to delays <e> <s> really the noble lord is making my case for me <e>", "<cs> we have had another fairly in-depth discussion on this matter <e> <s> i do not think i would volunteer to act as arbiter between the noble lords lord diamond and lord whaddon <e> <s> i do not think either was able to convince the other and neither has been able to convince me <e>", "<cs> i did not suggest that the noble baroness did not make a balanced speech and had not considered both angles <e> <s> i was particularly attracted to the benefits she will not be surprised to hear <e> <s> however as i was saying a new approach is needed in order to protect the consumer properly <e> <s> that is what we are providing under the bill <e>", "<cs> i withdraw that <e> <s> of course i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not mean to misrepresent him in any way and if that is the correct fact then i withdraw <e> <s> he used the argument to support the fact that here was a select committee which had come to a conclusion with which i did not agree nor i think did a great many other people support it <e> <s> nuclear power has made a very significant contribution to energy in this country <e> <s> indeed that element of the governments energy policy which included nuclear power has contributed substantially to it so i did not find that a very convincing argument for using the select committee system for the purpose which is suggested by the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> it is of course his pleasure whether he withdraws the amendment and comes back at a later stage or not but i must make the record clear <e> <s> what i said was that if he sought to force the amendment then i would have to oppose it <e> <s> i did not suggest to him to take it back and look at it again because that would give the impression to the other side that i was prepared to look at this again myself <e> <s> i am not prepared to look at it again <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to bring it back in another form that of course is his pleasure and we shall consider it at that time <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can deal with that last point first <e> <s> the bill does not apply to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has lost none of the persuasive technique for which he is well known but what he manages to disguise to some extent is that the amendment which he is proposing strikes at the very heart of this bill <e> <s> there is no question in this amendment of trying to improve the bill in any way <e> <s> this is a wrecking amendment which strikes at the very heart of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is misquoting me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords on all sides who have participated in the debate on this the first of our amendments <e> <s> i shall try to deal with the individual points that have been made and to explain where there has obviously been some considerable misunderstanding <e> <s> for example the noble lord lord jacques and we are delighted that he is intervening in a scottish debate obviously misunderstood the situation because of course the tenants of housing associations in england and wales have had the right to buy since <e>", "<cs> i shall come back to the noble lords point in a moment <e> <s> if i have misunderstood him i shall put that right <e> <s> i should like to deal first with the points raised by my noble friends lord selkirk and lady elliot <e> <s> they complained about the complicated nature of the bill <e> <s> i am sorry that the bill is not as clear as they would like it to be <e> <s> that is almost inevitable when a bill amends two existing acts the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act and the housing associations act <e> <s> we hope that some consolidation will be possible before too long <e> <s> in the meantime we have made available in the library and elsewhere notes on clauses and we have reprinted the act in its most up-to-date form <e> <s> i hope that that has been of some help <e> <s> we have also gone out of our way when we have been asked to explain points specifically to members of your lordships house and i greatly appreciate what my noble friend lord selkirk said at the beginning of his remarks about the letters that i sent to him <e> <s> i hope that they have been helpful <e>", "<cs> i do not accept why and a great many of the housing association tenants will not accept why <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made his case forcefully and i shall reply in my own way <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock makes his speeches in his way and i shall make mine in my way <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe made that suggestion and i am sure that that is not what he basically has in mind <e> <s> the effect of his remarks is that he is discriminating against those tenants as are other noble lords opposite <e> <s> the official opposition will do everything in their power to try to wreck the bill <e> <s> that is perfectly fair but let us not have any doubt as to what they are seeking to do <e> <s> they would dearly like to take the right away from everybody or perhaps the noble lord lord ross would but his party would not <e> <s> his party has come round substantially to accepting the principle of house sales <e> <s> it is something that it totally condemned a few years ago but not now <e> <s> we now hear a different note <e> <s> that is a change which is at least a change in the right direction <e> <s> let us hope that it moves some more in other ways in due course <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend is is being wholly fair <e> <s> he has stated that he is in favour of the principle of tenants of council houses having the right to purchase their houses and yet he is saying that he is prepared to deprive housing association tenants from having the same right <e> <s> if they are among the less well off they will not be seeking to buy their houses <e> <s> it is those who have prospered and who have gathered together some money who would like to purchase their houses <e> <s> is my noble friend suggesting that they should be deprived of the right which is available perhaps a few streets away to council house tenants <e> <s> that seems a strange argument to me <e> <s> my noble friend asked me a specific question <e> <s> i reiterate what i said when i answered his question <e> <s> by public funding i mean that if they have never had any public money the right to buy does not apply <e> <s> as regards land being made available to them cheaply i cannot answer that question without notice but i shall certainly come back to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is not being quite fair on this <e> <s> i have answered his question clearly <e>", "<cs> i accept what my noble friend says and there is no question of the substantial rented area being put at risk <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend the housing associations are still growing and new associations are being set up even now <e> <s> i shall move on to the next point which i want to raise <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord cannot accept it but he will have a full opportunity to discuss this matter a little later because there are other amendments which deal with this point <e> <s> nevertheless even if we do not agree i am glad that the noble lord has seen fit to participate in scottish business <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for allowing my attention to wander momentarily during his intervention <e> <s> i assure him that i fully appreciate the points that he was making in support of the noble lord lord carmichael <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord that figure off the top of my head <e> <s> i am afraid that two-thirds is the best i can do for him tonight but i shall get the figures for him drop him a note and let him know what they are <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly provide that and when i write to the noble lord lord carmichael i shall make sure that the noble lord lord mackie receives a copy <e> <s> but i think we are talking of relatively small numbers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raised one or two points that i should answer <e> <s> he spoke about the per cent <e> <s> and the per cent <e> <s> those figures refer to discount repayment requirements not to discount itself <e> <s> he spoke about sales at discount being at the expense of the landlord <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> the so-called cost floor provisions which we shall no doubt discuss on clause provide that discount is restricted if the sale price will not be sufficient to cover the outstanding debt on the house <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be able to answer the noble lords query <e> <s> section <e>", "<cs> the brass neck of the noble lord really takes some beating <e> <s> i have no intention of apologising but i shall carefully read the record and if i have made any mistake of course i shall acknowledge it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would be to deny particular groups of tenants the same discount entitlement as is available to kindred tenants living in similar properties built after <e> <s> i have listened carefuly to the arguments put by the noble lord i have to say that i consider them unacceptable <e> <s> the noble lord has pointed out that the majority of such flats will be owned by housing associations <e> <s>

of house would qualify for extra discount <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord morton that amendment no <e> <s> deals with clause <e> <s> it is a mistake on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> clause enables the secretary of state to issue directions to local authorities and other landlords concerning the conditions which they may include in future offers to sell under the right to buy <e>

would be concerned if there were evidence that this was happening on a wide scale and the clause will give the power to take action to remedy such abuse saving considerable inconvenience for both purchasers and the lands tribunal <e>", "<cs> clause gives the secretary of state power to assist tenants or purchasers who may be involved in legal action against their landlords on matters concerning the right to buy but only if the case has special features for example because it raises a question of principle and it is in the public interest that the tenant should be given assistance

already given to him <e> <s> i am not suggesting anything about the noble lords intelligence he did this job and i remember him doing it very well indeed so he must not feel so sensitive <e> <s> if he feels sensitive he should sit here for a while <e>", "<cs> this provision could allow the secretary of state to assist in cases that do not give rise to issues of principle but have other considerations <e> <s> it is not only issues of principle <e> <s> it could apply where other considerations occur <e> <s> i have already spelt out <e>", "<cs> at last <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way but this is the point that we had earlier <e> <s> this is part of an agreed grouping <e> <s> this amendment has already been spoken to with an earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> subsection lists the type of assistance that the secretary of state may give <e> <s> we envisage that this would most likely take the form of financial assistance but provision is made so that the secretary of state may give assistance in the form of arranging for legal representation for the applicant possibly in the form of advice which could be advice from his own department <e> <s> it seemed to us sensible that the forms of assistance which might be given should be drawn fairly widely <e>", "<cs> clause gives the secretary of state a power to require information from public landlords where it is necessary in relation to the exercise of his power under part i of the act that is under the right to buy <e> <s> this power is necessary in consequence of clauses and of this bill <e> <s> clause of the bill gives the secretary of state power to give assistance to tenants involved in court proceedings <e> <s> however before deciding whether it would be appropriate to exercise this power it may well be that the secretary of state will require to obtain certain information from the landlord <e> <s> clause of the bill provides that the secretary of state may give directions as to conditions included in offers to sell <e> <s> again it may be necessary for the secretary of state to obtain information from landlords concerning such offers in order to decide whether it would be appropriate to issue directions <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> as he pointed out he is quite sure that the secretary of state has other powers which he could use <e>", "<cs> if a named person cannot comply because he genuinely does not know he cannot be in default of the statutory requirement <e>", "<cs> the point which the noble lords lord hughes and lord morton have made is open to question <e> <s> there is no power against an individual <e> <s> the power would be against the authority <e>", "<cs> i think i might come in at this stage because what i have to say on this amendment may be helpful to the committee at this late hour and save time in dealing with this amendment <e> <s> the excellent work done by the housing associations which operate as charities in scotland is recognised on all sides of the committee and it has been suggested that this work might be impaired by the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment one or two points were raised which perhaps i may answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor asked me about housing associations which are registered with the charity commissioners in england <e> <s> housing associations which are registered with the charity commissioners in england will be exempt from the right to buy in scotland to ensure that each single association is treated in the same way both north and south of the border <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord perth asks for the date to be done away with and for all charities to be exempt <e> <s> i am afraid that this cannot be done <e> <s> to make such a broad exemption would open the way to what would be no more than a device to avoid the right to buy provisions <e> <s> the whole objective of the legislation is to make sure that the right to buy provisions are extended to tenants of housing associations in the same way that they are and have been available to local government tenants <e> <s> we have been talking about that matter all evening <e>", "<cs> not to my knowledge hut i could not answer that question without checking my facts <e> <s> however this is something to which we can return at a later date <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must not put words in my mouth <e> <s> he asked me a question to which i am not able to give him the answer at the present moment <e> <s> i have said to the noble lord that we can return to this when we are discussing the matter at a later date <e> <s> in the meantime i shall try to find out the situation for him <e>", "<cs> i feel that i have been very fair to the committee tonight <e> <s> i have made a very reasonable proposition <e> <s> i wonder whether it is worth making concessions at all <e> <s> i sometimes think that it is better to put ones head down and drive on because when one makes a concession all that happens is that people come back and say that is not enough we want twice as much again <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of doing that anyway the noble lord will be glad to hear <e> <s> i have made a suggestion <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton has withdrawn his amendments <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl lord perth will agree to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> we shall table our amendment in plenty of time <e> <s> the house will have an opportunity of studying it and of consulting about it and we can return to it at a later stage <e> <s> i am not prepared to accept the guidance of the noble lord lord ross of marnock on this occasion <e> <s> we shall deal with the matter in our amendment <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to our proposal in the bill that certain housing association schemes providing neighbourhood support for people with special needs should be excluded from the right to buy <e> <s> during the passage of the bill in another place there was concern about the effect of the right to buy on housing associations providing houses for people with special needs <e> <s> while we believe that the existing safeguards in the act relating to special needs housing for the elderly and disabled are working satisfactorily and they will be extended to cover housing associations by this bill we accepted that there was one type of scheme which is unique to the housing association movement and which would not be covered by the present provisions <e> <s> these are schemes which provide care and support in the community for groups such as ex-offenders and the mentally disabled <e>", "<cs> i am always happy to oblige the noble lord <e> <s> i dealt with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i dealt with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> we were not talking to amendment no <e> <s> as it was not in order <e> <s> the noble lord wanted me to say a word or two about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> our proposal is to exempt a housing association type of scheme which deals with people with special needs in a unique way through neighbourhood support <e> <s> the words being a landlord so mentioned mean a landlord who is a registered housing association <e> <s> they have the effect therefore of confining the exemption to schemes of the type specified where the landlord is a housing association <e> <s> this is because such developments are unique to the housing association movement <e>", "<cs> i am glad to be able to assure the noble lord that his concern that adopted children may be disadvantaged is unfounded and that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the adoption scotland act provides in section that children who have been the subject of an adoption order are to be treated for all purposes as if they were legitimate children <e> <s> it is unnecessary therefore to make any further provision in the new section a of the act inserted by paragraph of schedule to this bill <e> <s> the adoption act already ensures that an adopted child has the same rights as the natural child of a tenant <e> <s> in the light of this explanation i hope the noble lord will agree to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for explaining his reasons for tabling this amendment which as he has explained would increase the range of circumstances in which a community-based housing association could grant a tenancy to a voluntary officer committee member or a close relative of one <e> <s> in considering the previous amendment mention was made that the allocation of publicly funded housing is an area which is wide open to accusations justified or otherwise of injustice and preferential treatment whether the authority concerned is a housing association or another housing body <e> <s> housing associations are particularly susceptible to such accusations since there is a connection between the authority granting the tenancy and the individual receiving it <e>", "<cs> the appointments are ultimately all approved by the treasury <e> <s> they cannot be made without the authority of the treasury <e>", "<cs> obviously appointments are made by the director general <e> <s> i hope within the next few moments to be made aware of the answer to the question that the noble lord has asked <e> <s> yes they are civil service commissioner appointees but perhaps i can get full particulars for the noble lord and communicate with him <e> <s> as i was saying if the director general considers that the best way to fulfil his functions and duties under the bill is to appoint certain staff to particular posts with certain specifications this he can do <e> <s> if he wants to call upon <e>", "<cs> may i just carry on for the moment <e> <s> the noble lord will be speaking again <e> <s> as regards the various titles which were suggested for different directors or whatever they may be as laid down in the amendment the director has the power to appoint deputies <e> <s> he can call them deputy directors or deputy director generals <e> <s> in military terms he can give them as many pips as he likes <e> <s> it is entirely up to him <e> <s> therefore i cannot accept that the concern of the noble lord lord diamond about the director acting on his own is justified <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the noble lord does not sincerely hold that view but i am trying to persuade him that his fear in this regard is not justified <e>", "<cs> the committee may not be aware that five years is a standard period for public appointments of this kind <e> <s> the director general of fair trading and the director-general of oftel both have five years as the statutory maximum length of their terms of appointment as do nationalised industry board members and members of similar bodies <e> <s> there is no obligation that an appointment be for the full five years but the period is designed to enable the post-holder to build up expertise in the subject and to provide a level of continuity <e> <s> a shorter term would be destabilising both for the industry and the staff of ofgas <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the intention behind the tabling of this amendment namely that sufficient notice should be given by an outgoing director to enable a new one to be found and for continuity of his office to be assured <e> <s> that is a perfectly reasonable aspiration and one which we share <e>", "<cs> i think we are all of the same mind but we take the view that the terms on which the director is appointed should deal with this matter <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that it would be a mistake to write this into the legislation because there could be many different reasons for resignation <e> <s> it would be a pity completely to tie the hands of everybody for ever more by enshrining it in legislation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a constructive suggestion but with respect i still think it would be better to have this included in the terms of appointment of the director rather than have it referred to in the legislation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for illustrating much <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps i made a mistake on the previous amendment by agreeing to take it back <e> <s> that seems to have given noble lords on the opposite benches the idea that they have an easy pushover here and that <e>", "<cs> and that i am going to weaken on issues which are very much more clearly defined <e> <s> i think i should put them out of pain right at the start by telling them that i have no intention of accepting the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i realise this is a subject which was debated at considerable length in another place and i welcome the opportunity of putting on record the governments position <e> <s> i know the noble lord lord diamond in his persuasive way gave the committee the option of going for a number of possibilities when he explained what his amendment seeks to do but i do not think that he has come up with anything that i would be persuaded by and i shall now try to set out our position <e>", "<cs> i think we have to take the definition of those words in the dictionary and work from there <e> <s> i think that difference of opinion is something quite different and i would not care to comment further than that <e>", "<cs> i am always in favour of the involvement of parliament but there is no point in involving parliament where parliament has no need to be involved <e> <s> i see no advantage whatsoever in involving parliament in this amendment any more <e>", "<cs> i confirm that it is correct that the director general could have recourse to the courts <e> <s> the grounds would be a matter for his judgment if he disagreed with the reasons given for his dismissal by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> the director general of supply is a statutory office created by clause of the bill <e> <s> the person who is for the time being appointed to that office by the secretary of state is given considerable independence in the discharge of his functions under the bill <e> <s> the main terms of his appointment are laid down by the bill itself and the only grounds on which such a person can be removed from that office are <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly try to answer the questions of the noble lord <e> <s> i did not really require his sarcastic comments to bring me to my feet to do that <e> <s> he has been a minister himself and no doubt has had to refer to his box on many occasions in his life <e> <s> i have read of some of his performances as chief secretary to the treasury and i can tell him that i certainly would not have been happy with his answers on occasion <e> <s> nevertheless i shall do him the courtesy which his seniority merits and i shall certainly try to answer the points that he has raised with me <e>", "<cs> i should imagine that the noble lord as a chartered accountant has probably much more idea of the answer to that question than i have at this moment <e> <s> i cannot possibly supply him with the answer <e> <s> it has nothing whatever to do with this amendment <e> <s> there will be amendments a little later probably much later at the rate we are going which will deal with this subject and we can have that matter clarified at that time <e> <s> the troops will have to be very quick indeed they have been jolly quick and so i can say that different rules apply for tax purposes than for employment law <e> <s> i shall try to elucidate a little further on that reply in due course but i suggest that this is what the box normally calls a holding answer <e>", "<cs> we have spent nearly two days talking about clause <e> <s> we have had a wide variety of reasons given in support of many amendments and groups of amendments <e> <s> we shall all probably remember the first clause of the bill as the diamond clause <e> <s> it has given the noble lord lord diamond the opportunity to prove if proof were even needed his political virility <e> <s> the noble lord has done so with acclaim <e> <s> i hope that it has not tired him out too much <e> <s> there is a long way to go <e> <s> so far as i can see looking at the faces across from me i do not believe that his performance has been greeted with much enthusiasm on the opposition side <e> <s> as ministers however we appreciate the amount of research and hard work that have gone into the contributions that the noble lord has made <e> <s> it was a pity i thought that the noble lord spoiled it with the clause stand part debate when he gave us a resum in great detail of all the things he had done during the past two days <e>", "<cs> this is another probing amendment and i am happy to try to help noble lords by trying to answer some of the queries which they have raised <e>", "<cs> no i certainly cannot do so <e> <s> the noble lord seems to expect ministers and their advisers to have at ready hand an enormous amount of information <e> <s> i shall certainly seek to get the information for the noble lord and to make it available to him <e> <s> however i am afraid that i cannot provide him with that information at the drop of a hat <e> <s> i am doing my best to be helpful to the noble lord in explaining <e>", "<cs> i think if the noble lord passed on speedily to anything it would be an accident <e> <s> however i take his word that his intention is good <e>", "<cs> i am not accepting that criticism from the noble lord <e> <s> i made suggestions as to one or two of the possibilities under which paragraph <e>", "<cs> i do not think any of us would really be surprised to see this amendment following the debate on the earlier amendments to clause on th april but we have already established in the <e>", "<cs> i am interested in the noble lords participation in our debate <e> <s> i remind him that that was not the only reason that i gave for rejecting the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that he has been present throughout our proceedings and therefore he would not have heard the various arguments that i deployed on different occasions when we were discussing amendments similar to this one <e> <s> i do not take issue with him <e> <s> i agree that the house of commons is overworked but much of that is self-inflicted just as to a large extent our work here is self-inflicted when we spend nearly two days discussing clause of a bill <e> <s> but that is a matter for the committee <e>", "<cs> i shall give way to the noble lord in a moment <e> <s> there are so many members of this house who are former members of another place and i believe that it is the only thing they understand <e> <s> it is the way that we were brought up <e> <s> if we have to resort to such tactics now and again to discipline ourselves to argue our case more succinctly it is no bad thing <e> <s> i am glad to see the noble lord lord diamond nodding his head <e> <s> i always find him persuasive in his argument but on this occasion i do not <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge what the noble lord has said <e> <s> thirty all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that those who take an interest in energy matters would agree with me that there are many pitfalls involved in energy forecasting <e> <s> however i believe that a country such as ours which is rich in energy availability being able to call on oil gas coal and nuclear power must remain self-sufficient or nearly so for some considerable time in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i ma take the first point that the noble lord raised <e> <s> i anticipated that he would agree with my remarks about information being made available from country to country in the event of nuclear mishaps or nuclear disasters <e> <s> i am grateful to have his support on that matter <e> <s> with regard to the implications for our energy policy we shall wait and shall assess very carefully whatever report is made known by the russians as to the causes of the accident <e> <s> i would point out that there is no direct implication so far as our nuclear industry is concerned for the simple reason that the type of reactor involved is not a type that is used in this country <e> <s> in addition to that our safety requirements with regard to the nuclear industry and the construction of reactors are much more stringent <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> his experience in these matters is readily available to the house and we always appreciate his views <e> <s> however i think that the coal industry is on an upward curve of success <e> <s> since the disastrous miners strike there has been a complete change of attitude within the industry and happily production is now on the increase <e> <s> the reports and the outlook for the future are healthy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that that was one of the troubles with the labour government <e> <s> they never maximised the potential of the various energy industries <e> <s> we believe that there is healthy competition among the energy industries and that can only be good for the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be silly to hide the fact that there is always an element of risk and to be complacent <e> <s> it is precisely for those reasons that energy policy in connection with the safety of the nuclear industry which has been wholly supported by successive governments in this country is of such a high standard <e> <s> although we should never dare to suggest that there could not be an accident in this country we do everything conceivable to ensure that such an accident if it did happen would be minimised <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the coal industry is revising and has revised a great many of its plans and is now embarking upon a policy which we hope will enable it to compete in the energy world <e> <s> as far as the price of oil is concerned whether it be dollars or dollars a barrel it must be achieved without the government interfering <e> <s> it will be taken care of by the market <e> <s> as far as depletion is concerned if the price falls to dollars or even less the companies themselves will regulate the amount of production in which they engage <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble baroness has said and to what the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord ezra have contributed to this short debate but i really do not think that they have been able to overcome experience <e> <s> it is quite clear that the proof is here with oftel <e> <s> the numbers in oftel have doubled since they were originally envisaged without any inhibition by the treasury <e> <s> the treasury obviously take a realistic view <e> <s> we have made it absolutely clear and indeed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has an interesting technique of trying to suggest that the views that he holds so passionately are shared by many noble lords on this side <e> <s> i am sorry to disillusion him <e> <s> i am afraid that it is a fallacy that cannot go uncommented upon or uncorrected <e> <s> the noble lord must not suggest that there is nothing between us as to whether the bill is necessary <e> <s> my noble friends on this side are firmly convinced that the bill is necessary <e> <s> that is why it has been given wholehearted support in another place and why it is being given wholehearted support here <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord said and i agree with him that at present it is very difficult to make predictions in the energy field <e> <s> it would be a very dangerous prediction to forecast the price of oil in six months time <e> <s> the noble lord is correct about that <e> <s> however we have been through all this before <e> <s> the price of oil can rise as quicky as it can fall we found that in and again in <e>", "<cs> i thank both noble lords who have spoken for tabling these two similar <e>", "<cs> i always have the greatest regard for the views expressed by the noble viscount lord hanworth who is normally very constructive and forward-looking in his attitudes <e> <s> however i must say that i am rather disappointed tonight and i am saddened that he takes such a gloomy view of what is envisaged <e> <s> perhaps i have not fully understood the policy of his party but i thought they were in favour of wider share ownership and of encouraging those who are employed in an industry to be able to participate in shareholdings and to feel part of <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount says that is a different matter but it is not without a relationship to what we are talking about <e> <s> however the noble viscount has his own view on that <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden really took a much more <e>", "<cs> conservative view the noble lord has answered for me <e> <s> indeed it is a much more conservative view because it is the essence of what this government have been seeking to do for seven years and what we all hope they will continue to do for another seven years <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne and the noble lord lord harris had to say <e> <s> i know that my noble friend has held strong views on this matter for a long time and he and i have discussed it from time to time <e> <s> i must confess that i was impressed but not surprised when i saw the new clause that had been tabled <e> <s> however i must tell them that we too have done a certain amount of homework <e> <s> we spotted as my noble friend confirmed that the new clause is based on section of the transport act which permitted the transfer of the operations of the national bus company to the private sector as separate undertakings <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must be fair <e> <s> sir denis rooke has not come out publicly and said that he agrees with every conceivable thing that the government seek to do but he has said that in his view they have proceeded with the privatisation measure in the way most acceptable to the industry <e> <s> that is a certain commendation which i am not too bashful to accept <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kirkhill for speaking to his amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept the correction that the noble lord has rightly made <e> <s> but perhaps he agrees with me that there will be an opportunity when we reach clause to examine in more detail the obligations upon public suppliers that are spelt out there <e>", "<cs> my notes indicate that amendment no <e> <s> b is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> perhaps it would be for the convenience of noble lords if i dealt with it in my reply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying that point <e> <s> perhaps it would assist if i explained what the purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> i certainly would not in any way wish to suggest that we were not giving full consideration to what was being said even at this late hour <e> <s> i am sure we would all agree that we were a little slow during the first two days of our deliberations and perhaps it is not unreasonable that we should try to make up a little of that time now <e> <s> it is really not all that late yet and i think that we are all feeling quite fresh it seems a pity not to make a little progress if we can <e>", "<cs> well i cannot deal with that point immediately but perhaps i can return to it if the noble lord cares to withdraw his amendment and we move on <e> <s> when i have the information i shall certainly make it available to him <e> <s> lo and behold the information seems to have arrived from the box and i can now impart it to the noble lord <e> <s> the efficiency duty is set out in clause <e>", "<cs> one of the governments aims in privatising british gas is to create an environment where market forces can control and shape the nature of the industry within the overall framework of regulations set out in the bill <e> <s> that is one of the keynotes of the governments approach to energy issues generally <e> <s> we do not accept the oppositions belief that ministers and civil servants can sit down and work out a grand plan in which all the industries are allocated a role and that all they have to do is to carry it out according to the rules laid down <e> <s> real life is not like that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows the governments commitment to energy efficiency <e> <s> it has been widely publicised and widely practised <e> <s> the noble lord cited combined heat and power as an example of high efficiency use of gas <e> <s> the government fully accept this but believe that the market will be a better guide to the best use of gas rather than the kind of administrative rule which the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is being extremely unfair <e> <s> he is being unfair to other fuels <e> <s> he is highlighting gas <e> <s> the noble lord does not say to me is it realistic is the best way to move forward to burn coal in power stations <e> <s> there are those who would argue that to burn coal in power stations is contributing a degree of pollution which could well be avoided <e> <s> therefore the noble lord has a personal prejudice against nuclear power <e> <s> i have heard him talk on energy subjects for a sufficient length of time for me to detect that he has an inbuilt prejudice against nuclear power <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to amend one of the subsidiary duties of the secretary of state and director so as to require them to protect consumers from unfair discrimination on a regional or geographical basis <e> <s> the bill already contains substantial protections for such consumers <e> <s> the primary duty of the secretary of state and the director under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that a particular association with one permanent employee would have a great deal of scope for cutting its overheads <e> <s> however there are other associations with rather more who would have scope <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i make one or two comments on points made since i last spoke <e> <s> i fully appreciate the great interest that my noble friend lord selkirk has always taken in housing associations <e> <s> i know that on this issue he speaks from the heart <e> <s> but that does not change the position <e> <s> he probably inadvertently is seeking to deprive genuine people who might wish to own their own homes of that right <e> <s> this is already available to those who live in local authority houses perhaps in the next street and it seems to me outrageous that people in this house of all places should try to deprive those who seek to own their own homes of the right to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all reassure the noble lord lord carmichael that of course anything i said was not in any way intended personally <e> <s> i was generalising because it comes across <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i may deal with those points <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael asked me about the definition of essential workers <e> <s> essential workers are not defined as such but schedule to the act as amended by the bill excluded many houses required for operational purposes which in essence is the same thing <e> <s> my noble friend lord selkirk asked me about long leases and he is correct in saying that they are relatively rare <e> <s> central region is i believe trying to issue long leases to between and tenants <e> <s> my noble friend also asked me about the provision <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues perhaps he will clear up a point for me <e> <s> my list indicates that we are considering amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be aware that the allocation of publicly-funded housing is an area that is wide open to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i indicated to my noble friend that there had been abuse in england but that there had not been abuse in scotland <e> <s> my noble friend heard me correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord carmichael and i am afraid that i do not find his arguments convincing <e> <s> when noble lords have heard what i have to say i think that they will agree with me <e> <s> i also listened very carefully to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe who is certainly not without experience in these matters and again i think that some of the points he made are worth commenting upon <e> <s> i shall do so in a moment or two <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie used all his powers of persuasion even to the extent of suggesting that i make good an earlier error and accept this amendment and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones also used all his legal techniques to try and persuade me <e> <s> i can tell noble lords that i am not beyond being persuaded on this issue which is causing a great deal of anxiety to many people <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i take the point which the noble and learned lord made <e> <s> as noble lords may be aware the matter was raised when the bill had its report stage in another place early in march <e> <s> it is also a matter which i understand is of some concern to shelter which has been in correspondence with us on the point <e> <s> when the matter was raised with us two months ago we indicated that we wished to take it away for further consideration and advice <e> <s> in the interim we have been looking closely at the implications of the judgment and we shall be writing shortly to shelter to let it know of our conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly give a detailed reply if that is the wish of the house <e> <s> however perhaps i may first deal with one or two of the points raised by the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> with this amendment we enter a field in which emotions have run high <e> <s> noble lords have spoken both here and in committee in terms which imply that the present <e>", "<cs> my lords in this bill we are extending security of tenure and the right to buy to tenants of regional authorities including police and fire authorities <e> <s> when this bill had its report stage in another place however concern was expressed on behalf of the highlands and islands fire board that our proposals to exclude houses required for the purpose of a fire authority might still not be sufficient to enable the board to refuse applications by certain officers in locations where the board felt it would be difficult to make available suitable replacement housing <e> <s> i may say that this was the first we had heard of these anxieties but we undertook to look into them carefully to see whether any further amendment to the bill was needed <e>", "<cs> my lords what a pleasure it is to see my old friend lord cromartie with us and to have a question on the north of scotland hydroelectric board which i know holds a place of such affection for him <e> <s> the government are of course constantly faced with competing claims for scarce resources and given the constraints on public <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord that anwer without notice but obviously the debt is a borrowing debt and the proportion of profits which goes towards the reduction of borrowing debt must in the long term be in the best interests of those who are within the north boards area <e>", "<cs> my lords originally the debt would have been a treasury debt <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no plans to do so at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course aware that nalgo held a ballot in march among its british gas members proposing that they take industrial action against our proposal to return british gas to the private sector <e> <s> the members voted against industrial action <e> <s> i applaud their good sense for they must recognise that privatisation will be good for the industry and good for those working in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the action taken so far as the nalgo ballot was concerned and the silence from nalgo since then spoke volumes in themselves <e>", "<cs> might i ask the noble viscount about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult even after three years to get used to the procedures in your lordships house and committee <e> <s> i understood that the groupings of amendments had been agreed by the usual channels <e> <s> perhaps that is not the case <e> <s> while i am delighted that the noble viscount has included a very substantial list of consequential amendments when he announced that list it came as news to me <e> <s> i had not realised that we were also including those amendments <e> <s> but i am happy to have them dealt with in that way <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that the supply of gas has no concern at all with the appliances <e> <s> what i was suggesting was that the terms of this amendment deal principally with appliances as opposed to the supply of gas and that there are already ways in which this is taken care of <e> <s> i think i did my best to spell those out for the benefit of the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the noble lord is getting a little away from the subject we are discussing <e> <s> the noble viscounts amendment clearly says <e>", "<cs> the sale of appliances not use <e>", "<cs> it is correct of course that we discussed this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> the other night <e> <s> indeed the noble viscount at that time indicated it was not his intention to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> as i recall on th may at col he said <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness one has only to consider forms of home central heating to find that there is very considerable competition between fuels <e> <s> it is not uncommon to hear of a householder changing completely from one fuel to another because he feels that the second fuel might be more economical for his needs <e>", "<cs> i have already dealt in some detail with the amendment proposed by the noble viscount <e> <s> i respect his view but i am afraid that i disagree with him on this issue <e> <s> he has said that he may wish to return to this at a later date <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perhaps trying to dissociate himself from that suggestion and i am very glad if he is but the government do not agree with that and it will always be best to allow market forces <e>", "<cs> i was going to deal with the noble lords noble friend first <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble lord thought that i was mischief-making <e> <s> that certainly did not enter into my thinking <e> <s> nevertheless i am glad that he has reaffirmed that he is one of them which is good to know <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble lord must be patient <e> <s> he may not agree with what i am saying but i believe that this bill will be for the benefit of british gas in the long term and for the benefit of its consumers in the long term <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is quite what the noble baroness was saying <e> <s> the point i was making in arguing with the noble baroness is that until now the british gas corporation has been very much subject to the views of ministers which it will not be once it is privatised <e> <s> indeed that applies to any industry in which energy ministers treasury ministers or any other ministers are involved <e> <s> i feel that this is a good move <e> <s> it is a move in the right direction to relieve the british gas corporation from the constraints of ministerial discipline and to let it operate entirely on its own <e>", "<cs> perhaps but not under this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount certainly did not give us very much to go on about this amendment and i think he is probably as short of notes on it as i am <e> <s> as i explained a little earlier in the list which i was given the amendment was grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and a and i therefore think that during the discussion on those two amendments we pretty well covered what i imagine the noble viscount had in mind in tabling amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> so rather than weary the committee by going over the arguments again i think that perhaps the noble viscount may be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be right to accept it for several reasons and i shall try to explain to the committee why i cannot do so <e>", "<cs> it is useful i believe to have a discussion of this sort <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lords who tabled the amendment for giving us the opportunity <e> <s> i should like to reassure noble lords that british gas has no plans to change its regional structure <e> <s> i can give my noble friend lord sanderson the assurance he seeks regarding regional chairmen <e>", "<cs> this will have to be a matter for the new bgc plc but the present arrangements are working very well and i can see no reason why they would wish to change them <e> <s> certainly what they would not wish to do i am quite sure is to engage upon a process of centralisation such as the noble lord lord taylor suggested because that would not be in the best interests of the new privatised corporation <e> <s> however ultimately that decision must be for the new corporation <e>", "<cs> i shall go a little further if that is what the noble lord seeks me to do <e> <s> i shall tell him that british gas corporation has told us that it is its intention to keep the regions <e> <s> however ultimately at the end of the day obviously when a company is being privatised it must be for the new bgc plc to shoulder that responsibility <e> <s> but certainly it is its intention to have the regions exactly as my noble friend lady macleod asked me <e> <s> however i think it a mistake to write this into legisaltion <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord and noble baroness have said since i gave my original wind-up to this discussion but i have said that there is no intention to change the present structure <e> <s> the centralised management of british gas has been in place since and during the last years there has been none of the centralising tendencies which noble lords have feared and which have been mentioned tonight <e> <s> i see no reason why <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks why not <e> <s> i know that it is within his philosophy to tie everything up in such a way that it would be strangled before it ever got off the ground that is labour philosophy <e> <s> that is how they work and i am not likely to be persuaded by any of his suggestions so far as this is concerned <e> <s> i am listening to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe who has seen the folly of his ways and has moved elsewhere from the rigid clause attitude of the party opposite <e> <s> mind you i do not know whether he is very much better off where he is but at least he thinks he is better off for the time being <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has a happy knack of making just the right remark at the right time and of course i accept what she tells the committee <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i did not mean from ministers i meant that as a constituency member of parliament it was very easy to raise regional matters within the region and they were always resolved there <e>", "<cs> i recognise that in general the noble lords are opposed to the introduction of competition into the gas supply business and that their view of the notification provisions introduced under the <e>", "<cs> no i shall not give way i have only just started <e> <s> i shall give way in a moment <e> <s> i have just started my remarks <e> <s> as i was saying their view of the notification provisions introduced under the oil and gas enterprise act has not changed <e>", "<cs> yes that is a very good point but i think that on reflection the noble lord will agree that it is covered by what i said under clause <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord bruce of donington would listen he would hear answers but he frequently closes his ears to anything which he does not particularly want to hear <e> <s> i have answered the noble lord lord williams in detail already <e> <s> perhaps when the noble lord reads the record he will find out that i did <e>", "<cs> and it is wrong of the noble lord to suggest that every take-over is of dubious merit because that is not the case <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord advises people from time to time about the merit of a take-over <e> <s> i am sure that his advice is always good and is taken <e> <s> i do not always take what he says about take-overs as being gospel <e>", "<cs> i am not the one who is short-circuiting it is the noble lord <e> <s> this amendment deals with clause <e> <s> we have moved on from clause and i referred to clause only because there is a relationship between them <e>", "<cs> this would be the secretary of state and the director and they will use their own means as they see fit to examine and explore the financial status of a company <e> <s> however i am not going to give the noble lord that assurance in the middle of an exchange across the floor during the committee stage of a bill <e> <s> i am too long in the tooth for that <e>", "<cs> yes presumably is a term of speech in some matters <e> <s> the secretary of state and the director would examine the situation in the case of a group and i used the term as explanation that presumably they would investigate thoroughly <e> <s> the director particularly will be very interested <e> <s> but i am not going to give any assurances without consideration certainly not <e>", "<cs> i shall try to explain the position to the noble lord as best i can <e> <s> the bill makes no specific provision for consultation on the question of whether or not to accept a notification or to invalidate a notification because the required rate has not been achieved but it is open to the secretary of state to consult the director where he thinks it will be helpful to him to have the directors view on any matter arising under the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the government as were their predecessors are very proud of the safety record that we have achieved in this country <e> <s> we are confident of the efficiency of the safety systems at united kingdom reactors <e> <s> we would of course be prepared to explain these if requested to do so by an international body <e> <s> any international safety inspectorate could operate only on the basis of internationally agreed safety standards <e> <s> these have yet to be established <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has hit on a very important point <e> <s> of course it is now for local authorities to consider very carefully what precautions they have taken so far as civil defence for example is concerned and to satisfy themselves that what they have done is adequate and if not to try to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the question <e> <s> indeed it would be quite wrong for me to make any comment on pwr after the very intensive inquiry which has taken place and until we have had the opportunity of hearing the conclusions of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords a set of guidelines was announced by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for energy at that time which became known as the moore guidelines <e> <s> more recently because of public concern my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment has said in another place that he has given instructions within his department that ministers should be told of all incidents involving release of radioactivity however small so that they can decide whether they are sufficiently important to be made public <e> <s> i would agree with my noble friend that there is a tendency within the media to highlight incidents connected with the nuclear industry to a very much greater extent than seems to be the practice in connection with other industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the noble lords suggestion to my noble friend <e> <s> i think i would have been more convinced by mr gorbachevs suggestion had he and his government been more forthcoming in the very early stages about what actually happened <e> <s> this was not one might say leading from the front <e> <s> however any suggestion of that sort coming from mr gorbachev obviously must be taken seriously <e> <s> we are as anxious as our partners in the west that the dangers of nuclear power shall be readily observed by everyone and the necessary action taken to prevent accidents <e> <s> we should like to see all countries adopt safety standards comparable with our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little doubt that the local authorities concerned and indeed those who live in the areas for which they are responsible will have taken very much to heart the fact that civil defence cannot be ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made clear as i am sure the noble lord will appreciate that the government will continue to seek for the safest possible standards to be observed in the further development of the nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very much aware of my noble friends great interest in this subject <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that there is a widespread belief that the establishment of international nuclear safety standards would be of value <e> <s> but choosing the correct approach is a complex task that may take some time <e> <s> i can however give my noble friend the assurance that we shall actively participate in international discussions on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the noble lord <e> <s> my recollection of the situation was that it was only after the swedish authorities as a result of their very effective monitoring had questioned what had happened within the soviet union with regard to this very major accident that the information became as free-flowing as it ultimately did <e> <s> however i would certainly agree with the noble lord that the situation between the soviets and this country with regard to exchange of information on nuclear power seems to be improving <e> <s> we wholeheartedly welcome this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised a very interesting point which i am sure will be followed up <e> <s> i myself visited the soviet union in with a trade mission <e> <s> as i recall there were many british companies who were only too anxious to export to the soviet union <e> <s> i suspect that this is still the case but it is a particularly difficult market to penetrate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> certainly with regard to our nuclear industry in this country we are extremely willing to make incidents known <e> <s> i think that it was my noble friend who suggested a little earlier that some of the incidents were so trivial that it was hardly worth making them known <e> <s> but certainly with regard to any serious matter we would not hesitate to make information available <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken careful note of what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> i have already said that i shall draw the attention of my noble friend to the views expressed in this house <e> <s> i am sure that he will take due note <e>", "<cs> i have nothing that i can usefully add to what i have said already to the noble lord <e> <s> the effect of his amendments would be to require an authorisation under clause to be granted by order <e> <s> that order would be required to be approved by both houses of parliament <e> <s> the amendments mirror very much amendments nos <e> <s> and which sought to impose the same requirement on authorisations granted under clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is yet again seeking to stamp his what i might call doctrinal view on to the bill by making statutory provision for gas to be directed to premium use <e> <s> such a proposal which we have consistently argued against in another place runs completely counter to the governments policy of giving free rein to market forces <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord will agree that this government have always made it absolutely clear that they do not support administrative controls on the use of gas <e> <s> it is far better to leave such matters to be determined by market forces <e> <s> i explained that position earlier and i simply cannot accept an amendment which seeks to impose such controls <e> <s> there is no case for imposing such controls and i am afraid that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised that the noble lord is laughing at the doctrine <e> <s> that is his choice of a joke and not mine <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot accept the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington becomes even more persuasive when he is brief but in tabling amendment no <e> <s> he and his noble friend may have overlooked the fact that the conditions which need to be attached to clause authorisations are extremely limited in character <e> <s> this is because in the main supplies under clause authorisations will be on a one-to-one basis with the terms of supply freely negotiated between the two parties <e> <s> thus it would be quite inappropriate to direct that prices must be published <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that i cannot explain any further because that is the end of my briefing <e> <s> but i shall certainly write to the noble lord with a further explanation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i made a facetious remark that was obviously wasted on the noble lord <e> <s> if not able to give him a detailed answer i took the most courteous action that i could think of <e> <s> this was my suggestion that i would write to the noble lord and perhaps elaborate a little more <e> <s> i did not expect the kind of abuse that the noble lord has thrown across the floor at me <e> <s> i shall return such abuse with my usual courtesy and i reiterate that i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and undefeated <e>", "<cs> the amendment has a similar theme to those tabled by my noble friend lady gardner <e> <s> they draw our attention to the changes in arbitration arrangements which have been included under the bill as a result of the new structure for regulation which has been adopted with a regulatory body ofgas headed by a director general of gas supply <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the customer would be disadvantaged in any way by the procedure that i have set out <e> <s> certainly there are powers under clause <e> <s> i tried in my explanation to relate how those powers were connected with other clauses in the bill and the various functions of the director of ofgas in this connection <e> <s> the noble lord would perhaps prefer to study what the record reveals before deciding what he wishes to do further <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord is correct to some extent <e> <s> under clause the provisional order procedure is a quick way to deal with urgent cases when the customer might be damaged <e> <s> the noble lord is perfectly correct <e> <s> the amendment which his noble friend has moved is dealing on a broader front than that dealt with by clause <e> <s> clause is a provisional order procedure <e> <s> it is a quick way to deal with urgent cases <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord diamond has said <e> <s> perhaps the committee will bear with me if i go into a little detail in my reply because it may save us time later if i explain fully the position <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the question that the noble lord asks refers directly to the amendment that the noble lord lord diamond has put down <e> <s> what it refers to is something directly within the noble lords own profession <e> <s> the kind of information that he seeks would depend largely on the kind of audit that is carried out and the kind of docket that is given <e> <s> the figure that the noble lord quoted to me may contain other items <e> <s> i cannot guarantee that the figure that the noble lord has picked out of the accounts of the british gas corporation is restricted solely to the relevance of this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord knows only too well in a set of accounts you cannot specifically say of a miscellaneous group of figures that they are isolated to one particular issue <e> <s> they may include a number of different items <e>", "<cs> i certainly call supply it <e> <s> the answer is simple <e> <s> the answer is no <e> <s> you cannot give any guarantee <e> <s> good gracious the noble lord is much more acquainted with reading balance sheets than i am but when he picks at random <e>", "<cs> selected item or a selected group of items as he has done i cannot give any guarantee that that is the only thing which is included in those figures <e> <s> no the answer is no <e>", "<cs> i can give a guarantee about the formula inasmuch as it is set out in the appropriate part of the bill <e> <s> i cannot give a guarantee about a set of figures which the noble lord produces in that way <e> <s> the noble lord has picked some figures out of the annual accounts <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes i shall look into this further and find out exactly what it contains but i could not possibly give him the guarantee that he seeks at this time <e> <s> with the greatest respect it is substantially wide of the amendment which the noble lord moved <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has chosen one set of figures out of the hundreds of figures which would be available to him in the annual report <e> <s> i have said that i will look into this and that i shall let him know what is included in those figures <e>", "<cs> i did not notice whether the noble lord mentioned it but i think we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> along with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my apologies <e> <s> i appear to be looking at a different list <e>", "<cs> in any event i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment which gives me the opportunity to discuss the role of the gas consumers council in relation to a public gas suppliers tariffs <e>", "<cs> first of all i take issue with the noble lord lord diamond on this matter <e> <s> he was by way of scolding me a little and with the greatest respect i would remind him that he put down this amendment only yesterday afternoon so it was really a very late thought which gave very little time for consultation by the department concerned <e> <s> therefore i think that it is a little unfair of him to be rather tetchy in his remarks <e>", "<cs> first day back after the recess or not in any event it was still a very short time for the department to have an opportunity of studying it <e> <s> i was grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes who was her usual constructive self and i agree entirely with her that there is a wide range of issues on which the consumers council should be consulted and on which having been consulted it can be of very great assistance <e>", "<cs> all right <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce asked me about clause and different areas different cases and different prices is really what he had in mind <e> <s> this is dealt with by amendment no <e> <s> which we shall debate later <e> <s> the wording permits different tariffs so long as they do not conflict with the non-discrimination provisions in clause or clause <e> <s> but that is something that we shall come to when we discuss amendment no <e> <s> a little later <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct <e> <s> there is no reason why there should not be consultation <e> <s> the director can consult the consumer council on any issue <e> <s> it is highly likely that he will frequently consult the consumer council but that does not mean to say we need necessarily write that into the bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord has moved this amendment because it gives us an opportunity to talk about the method of charge to consumers and the question of discrimination <e> <s> let me say at once that i am fully and strongly in favour of ensuring equality between consumers as far as possible <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware there is already a duty on the secretary of state and the director in respect of protection of consumers interests and there is an avoidance of undue preference duty on public gas suppliers in clause in respect of the supply of gas and in clause in respect of the fixing of tariffs <e> <s> it is the effect of the amendment on this latter undue preference duty which causes me most difficulty <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to remove the existing provision in clause which allows tariffs to vary in different areas cases and circumstances <e> <s> i would have thought that there could be certain areas of the country where it would be very expensive to provide gas and that even if there was a supplier prepared to provide gas this could rule out any possibility of supply to those areas <e>", "<cs> the arrangments for fixing tariffs under clause of the bill are similar in every respect to those under section of the act <e> <s> the provisions do of course permit tariffs to be framed to reflect different areas cases and circumstances <e> <s> but british gas has chosen to apply a uniform charge for each therm of gas supplied to credit meter customers but to vary the standing charge to reflect the cost of supply on a regional basis <e>", "<cs> we have already discussed the question of the consumers council and we shall have further opportunities to discuss the duty of the council when we deal with amendments to clause <e> <s> we shall have opportunities to discuss the power of the council when we deal with clause <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> indeed when i answered the noble lord lord diamond earlier i said that there was nothing to prevent the director from taking whatever advice he wished but that i was not prepared to see that written into the bill <e>", "<cs> no my response had nothing to do with clause <e> <s> i was responding to the questions that were asked of me and i related them to clauses and which deal with the council <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> that is obviously correct <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i had no objection to the amendments not being grouped <e> <s> i know that this amendment was tabled before the other amendment and i am perfectly happy with that <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely clear <e> <s> there is no confusion about it <e> <s> the noble baroness is perfectly correct and i am happy for it to be on the record <e> <s> there is no confusion about it at all <e> <s> the confusion would come in if we were to accept this amendment and confused the role of the director with that of the consumer council <e> <s> the two must be kept absolutely separate <e>", "<cs> i certainly have not been misleading the committee but the noble lord has been trying not trying i apologise he has inadvertently been confusing the committee <e> <s> in fact he is tying us all in knots <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at clause he will see on page at line <e>", "<cs> i have already answered the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes i have already given the noble lord a full answer <e>", "<cs> in proposing this amendment the noble viscount raises the important question of the basis for setting tariffs <e> <s> condition of the draft authorisation will set a maximum price by means of a pricing formula <e> <s> that formula relates changes in tariffs to changes in the actual cost of gas and the rate of inflation less the efficiency factor x it has been designed to control tariffs in a fair and reasonable manner <e> <s> it also ensures that british gas has a strong incentive to cut the costs which are within its control and that customers benefit from the expected efficiency savings <e>", "<cs> the supplier must set the tariff according to the provisions of clause and the enforcement of this obligation is dealt with by clause <e> <s> that is the relationship between clauses and and between the supplier and the director <e>", "<cs> we have debated standing charges on earlier amendments and we have explained that we believe the right approach is to prevent standing charges rising faster than inflation <e> <s> this is the requirement set out in condition of the authorisation and i note that the noble lords amendment takes the same approach <e> <s> my noble friend agreed to reconsider the wording of the condition so that the obligation may be framed in a more direct way which avoids the use of the phrase best endeavours <e> <s> the phrase may have a strong legal compulsion but i accept that it rings oddly to the lay reader and i am of course anxious to avoid any misunderstanding when we agree on the substance <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the director cannot change the formula <e> <s> the formula can only be changed if the authorisation were changed <e>", "<cs> not by the director <e> <s> the director cannot change the formula <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first clarify the question of the modification of the formula about which the noble lord lord bruce of donington asked me <e> <s> i said that the director could not change the formula alone <e> <s> i am advised that the director can take steps to introduce a better form of control <e> <s> the procedures for that are set out in clauses to of the bill <e> <s> if he wishes to amend the authorisation he can do so with the agreement of a supplier under clause and if that agreement is not forthcoming he may refer a modification to the mmc under clause which can lead to a modification under clause <e> <s> it is only right to make that clear <e> <s> i indicated that he could not do it alone <e> <s> that would be the procedure he would have to follow if he wished to change the authorisation <e>", "<cs> i think that i made it perfectly clear <e> <s> the director cannot suddenly say <e> <s> i the director will change the formula and here i am doing it <e> <s> if the director wants to change the formula there is a distinct procedure which he has to follow in order to achieve that <e>", "<cs> i can understand the desire for greater transparency in the contract market <e> <s> however by their nature contract market customers are largely able to look after themselves <e> <s> they are free to negotiate with their suppliers the terms of supply including prices <e> <s> clause places restrictions on disclosure of information including the need to obtain the consent of the business concerned in respect of information relating to the affairs of that business <e>", "<cs> i thought i indicated that i could not accept this amendment <e> <s> i understand perfectly well what the noble lord seeks to do and i think i understand why he seeks to do it <e> <s> from what i have said he will gather that we consider that there are difficulties about it <e> <s> we believe that the competition law will cover the situation and perhaps when he has had a chance to read what i have said he might think again about it <e> <s> if he wants to pursue it on another occasion he will have the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> i happily give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> i think that i already made the situation absolutely clear when i fully explained to the noble lord that if i had inadvertently misled the committee in any way then i apologise <e> <s> i do not think that i need say more than that <e> <s> i think that the committee knows me well enough to know that i certainly would never willingly dream of misleading your lordships <e>", "<cs> if i inadvertently did so then of course i apologise <e> <s> i took the very first opportunity the next time i was on my feet to put the record straight <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for what he has said <e> <s> with regard to clause we have dealt at some length with that <e> <s> we have discussed a good many groups of amendments on the issue and i am not certainly not prepared to take the clause away <e> <s> the question will be put to the committee shortly whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i shall certainly advise my noble friends to vote in favour but if noble lords opposite feel they must oppose it then that must be their judgment <e>", "<cs> i can assure the committee that we share a common desire to provide for suitable protection for the consumer <e> <s> it may be that sometimes we part company on the best approach to achieve such protection <e> <s> this amendment exemplifies this difference of approach <e>", "<cs> i refer briefly to the point raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> the extra sums collected from prepayment customers are much smaller than the noble lord imagines <e> <s> they are only about a year with normal consumption <e> <s> some people pay less <e> <s> the charge only attempts to cover the extra costs associated with emptying such meters <e> <s> it is not nearly as large as the noble lord suggested <e>", "<cs> no we are on amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first correct the noble lord lord bruce about the meters <e> <s> in the case of british gas meters are lent free of charge <e> <s> the amendment would have no effect on british gas <e> <s> i am aware that by the amendment noble lords are seeking to ensure that protection for the consumer is in no way diminished <e> <s> i was interested to hear after the noble lord moved his amendment that there are two contrary points of view from each side of the chamber <e> <s> in no way do i suggest that the view expressed by the noble lord lord graham was not as important as the view expressed by my noble friend but i pay particular attention to what my noble friend says on this subject because of her wide experience in such matters <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> i am happy to do so <e> <s> all british gas meters whether pre-payment or credit are on loan free of charge <e> <s> they are not rented to customers by the bgc <e> <s> the bill covers loans or letting because these could both be possibilities in future <e> <s> british gas has no intention of changing its present policy <e>", "<cs> i must make this clear <e> <s> i said that the bill covered both possibilities because they could be possibilities in future <e> <s> i concluded my remarks by saying that british gas has advised that it has no intention of changing its policy at the moment <e>", "<cs> i think that we should bear in mind that condition of the authorisation which noble lords are attempting to insert into the bill forms an important part of the improved arrangements that we are proposing for the protection of the interests of gas consumers <e> <s> condition requires british gas to provide to the council the background information that it needs on the way that british gas runs its business in addition british gas will have to provide information on charges to its policies and on any changes to gas prices <e> <s> under the gas act such information is of course available to the existing councils and we are ensuring that this situation continues <e> <s> we are however going beyond this in our proposals in the draft <e> <s> this will require british gas to meet any reasonable request from the council for information on complaints relating to the supply of gas through pipes made to the council or referred to it by the director under clause of the bill so that the council can properly investigate these complaints and come to an informed conclusion <e> <s> the information power covers not only complaints from domestic and other tariff customers but also from industrial contract consumers <e> <s> i do not want to discuss clause in detail now <e> <s> it is a matter for debate later but i want to point out that because of the information power in condition of the draft authorisation complaints will be fully investigated and assessed <e> <s> the new council will therefore have far greater information powers than the existing councils in this important area <e>", "<cs> we have already had a substantive debate on an earlier amendment amendment za where i made plain my concern about the oppositions desire to tie the hands of british gas in the way in which it measures the quantity of gas used by a consumer <e>", "<cs> the government are of course fully aware of how unpopular disconnection powers are and how they tend to cause irritation all round <e> <s> disconnection is a last resort <e> <s> it is not a course that any energy body seeks to take lightly <e>", "<cs> obviously i cannot give the noble lord an absolute assurance <e> <s> it will be an issue for the british gas corporation to resolve itself <e> <s> i have sufficient confidence in the corporation to feel sure that it has no intention of removing that requirement from the authorisation <e>", "<cs> i think that the best i car do is to repeat what i said earlier because the noble lord may not have picked it up <e> <s> the amendment seeks involvement of the courts in the question of disconnection <e> <s> this system suffers from one of the disadvantages which i have already outlined <e> <s> the time taken to bring a case before the courts whether for a recovery of a debt or for disconnection itself would mean that the debt to the supplier continued to increase without any certainty as to when it might be fully recovered <e> <s> in addition there would be a considerable burden on the courts themselves <e> <s> there is already court involvement in a significant number of cases <e> <s> where a defaulting customer refuses a supplier entry for the purposes of disconnection the supplier must apply for a magistrates warrant under the terms of the rights of entry gas and electricity boards act <e> <s> before granting a warrant a magistrate must be satisfied that access is reasonably required that a right of entry exists and that the requirements of the enactment conferring the right such as the requirement to give notice under paragraph of schedule to this bill have been complied with <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord diamond pointed out we have already had a substantial debate on disconnection matters under amendment no <e> <s> d which was also tabled by the noble lords lord bruce and lord stoddart <e> <s> the theme of these amendments is similar and it is rather unfair that they should seek to have two bites at the cherry in this way <e>", "<cs> i tried to deal with that very point which the noble lord lord ezra has raised in my concluding remarks <e> <s> i explained the intention of the british gas corporation which will be by far and away the largest supplier of gas and which in the eye and the mind of the public will still be the principal distributor of gas but we do not consider it necessary and we do not believe there is any real justification for imposing such an obligation on any public gas supplier <e> <s> we believe that in the case of the statutory obligation it is not reasonable to write this into the legislation <e> <s> it is of course in the best interests of any gas supplier to ensure safety and indeed the british gas corporation have publicly stated that after privatisation they will carry on just as before <e> <s> but we do not believe it is necessary to write it into the legislation itself <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is very well aware that i simply could not give any such <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could go over that part of the answer which i originally gave and which i think covers this point <e> <s> i said that we saw no justification in imposing such an obligation on a public gas supplier <e> <s> i went on to say that while british gas at present carry out minutes of repair work free of charge and have publicly stated they will continue to do so we do not consider that the statutory obligation on a public gas supplier should be to do more than prevent gas from escaping <e> <s> that certainly is a statutory obligation <e> <s> therefore it must be a matter for the consumer to make such arrangements as he considers appropriate to have any necessary repair made which of course may involve the public gas supplier or any other competent gas fitter as the customer thinks fit <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is necessarily the case that the consumer should be completely relieved of any responsibility <e> <s> it may not in fact be the actual supply which is contributing to the leakage <e> <s> the first minutes of free work will enable the british gas corporation to determine what is the cause of the trouble <e> <s> if it is something to do with the distribution system which is their responsibility then the consumer would not be expected to pay <e> <s> but it could conceivably be something which is not directly related to the distribution system <e>", "<cs> if i may first deal with the point made about an appliance this may be something which is far removed from british gas and something with which they have had nothing at all to do <e> <s> they are obliged to carry out work free of charge to make safe a gas escape <e> <s> this work must be done free of charge whether it takes minutes or longer if it is directly connected with the distribution system for which british gas have responsibility <e> <s> work on the supply must be done free of charge by british gas <e>", "<cs> no the consumer is not liable to have to pay if the problem is in the distribution system <e> <s> if it arises from an appliance or something relating to an appliance then obviously at a certain time that would become the responsibility of the consumer just as it is with anything else which is bought from british gas or from any other supplier <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness because i think as she so often does she has helped me in my case by highlighting just how difficult and in appropriate it would actually be to write into the legislation what this amendment seeks to do <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord is correct <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that in an example such as the noble baroness has given if that situation was occurring in more than one flat and if the first leak was repaired and the smell of gas had not been removed then another flat would have been examined and then another and another <e> <s> of course that is a different exercise each time <e> <s> ultimately if the work within the flat was of a nature that required more than half an hours work then the responsibility would not be the corporations <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord is using rather emotive language here <e>", "<cs> yes indeed he is <e> <s> in this respect nobody is more concerned about the protection of human life than the government and the suggestion that the government are casting this aside as something which is of little importance is totally wrong <e> <s> in my earlier remarks i pointed out that <e>", "<cs> what i said was that the obligation in the bill is to deal with escapes of gas in the distribution system free <e>", "<cs> the obligation in paragraph of schedule must be carried out free <e> <s> it is a statutory obligation which must be dealt with without the supplier making any charge <e>", "<cs> the provisions of the bill are carried forward virtually unchanged from the act <e> <s> no reference is made there to the extent to which charges arise <e> <s> however where a statutory obligation arises that is to prevent escapes <e> <s> it may be the simple <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord he is not correct <e> <s> when a statutory obligation is placed on a body that body cannot charge for the carrying out of the obligation <e> <s> this is implicit in the interpretation of any statutory duty <e> <s> this is implicit <e>", "<cs> i have tried to make this as plain as i can but i am afraid the noble lord is not correct <e> <s> when a statutory obligation is placed on a body that body cannot charge for the carrying out of the obligation <e> <s> that statutory obligation is carried forward <e> <s> i have explained already that the requirements of the act if the noble lord will listen to me for a moment instead of his front bench <e>", "<cs> from here yes <e> <s> the act has been carried forward and therefore anybody who supplies gas has to comply with those obligations <e> <s> when a statutory obligation is placed on a body it simply cannot charge for it <e> <s> it is a statutory obligation <e> <s> i am not going back to the question of the half-hour <e> <s> that is a separate point altogether and i have already answered the noble baroness <e> <s> but may i just repeat for the benefit of the noble lord that work on the distribution system must be done free by british gas <e> <s> it is only work on its own appliances for which there may be payment <e> <s> indeed even on those appliances in the early days the days of guarantee the payment would be avoided but thereafter that would not continue forever <e>", "<cs> there is really little more that i can say <e> <s> i can but reiterate that it is only where specific provision is made for payment that such payment is allowed <e> <s> so i think that the point about payment is clearly dealt with <e>", "<cs> i think we have had a short but useful debate on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond said that he hoped i would take the amendment away and consider it and i find myself feeling a little inhibited <e> <s> throughout the course of this bill i have been accused of being intransigent and of not being prepared to take points away for consideration but the first time that i offer to do this i have the offer thrown back in my face <e> <s> so i am hardly in the mood for taking away amendments <e> <s> nevertheless i can assure the noble lord that in my reply i shall consider very carefully what he and others have said <e>", "<cs> because the authorisation is something which is prepared and given to any company which will supply gas but it is not in statute <e> <s> it still has very full effect but it is not actually written <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord i think we are getting into the semantics of the problem <e> <s> if it is not necessary to mention it at all it is not necessary to have it as an amendment <e> <s> however when i gave way to the noble lord i was pointing out that under condition of british gass draft authorisation making safe will be free of charge though customers may be liable for the cost of repairs associated with an escape <e> <s> this is only fair given that one of the improvements that we have effected in the bill is to extend the obligation to prevent escapes to the customers side of the meter this was commented on by my noble friend lord sanderson as an escape may equally arise from a defective appliance as from a defective pipe <e>", "<cs> i refer the noble lord to condition of the authorisation which deals with emergency services <e> <s> paragraph line states that the supplier shall by appropriate means secure that adequate publicity is given of the ways in which it can he contacted for the purpose of reporting such escapes <e> <s> i think that was the point about which he was anxious <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord i do not think that the average consumer would be reading the bill <e> <s> it is entirely up to the supplier to make sure that he conforms with the requirement of his authorisation in order to publicise the methods that can be used to contact him <e> <s> i am not suggesting that people will not read the bill but the sort of people who will read it will be informed people connected with the industry or with various concerned associations <e> <s> with respect i doubt whether the example that the noble lord chose is a good one <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> on this occasion i am not prepared to take this back <e> <s> we have had a useful debate <e> <s> i think that i have won the arguments <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord or his friends have put forward sufficiently strong arguments to make me either accept the amendment or to do as i offered to do last time to no avail <e> <s> it was thrown back in my face when i generously offered to take the amendment away <e>", "<cs> no not at the moment <e> <s> let me just finish what i have to say <e> <s> i do not feel that the arguments are strong enough for me to do that <e> <s> in my ministerial career i have specifically avoided giving such assurances unless i felt that i could genuinely do so <e> <s> when i give such an assurance i genuinely take the matter back and look seriously at it to see whether i can accommodate the noble lords who have raised the matter <e> <s> i shall not devalue the practice that i have followed for many years <e> <s> i offered to do it last time but it was rejected <e> <s> i do not feel that the case is strong enough for me this time to take the proposal back <e>", "<cs> let me make it absolutely clear that i meant nothing personal to the noble lord lord stoddart with whom i have done battle on many occasions and for whom i have the highest respect <e>", "<cs> the amendment is the proposed new paragraph put forward by the noble lords lord stoddart and lord gallacher <e> <s> it would require a public gas supplier to prevent any escape of gas reported to him whether or not he was the supplier although he would be able to recover the costs <e> <s> paragraph of the schedule is a new provision <e> <s> it recognises that in the future gas may be supplied by another company but that british gas will remain by far the most familiar company in the mind of the public so that any escape might be reported to it <e>", "<cs> we realise the concern to which gas explosions such as that which occurred in putney give rise <e> <s> the publication of the health and safety executives recent report into the rutherglen glasgow explosion underlines that concern which is fully shared by the government <e> <s> as a safety matter responsibility in this area falls to the health and safety commission and the executive <e>", "<cs> i think that question was directed to the noble lord lord stoddart not to me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to take this opportunity of debating this point with the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i am glad he put this amendment down because it gives us an opportunity to talk about an important element of safety <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon for taking these three amendments together <e> <s> they have a common theme that is the standard of training of officers authorised to enter premises whether for the purpose of disconnection on safety grounds or otherwise <e> <s> that standard of training is very important indeed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> certainly my remark was not in any way meant to provoke either the noble lord himself or his noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the point had been raised and i thought it was during his intervention and that it was worth commenting upon <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i give the noble lord my absolute assurance that i shall certainly read all the debates we have had on these safety clauses and if i were to find that the legislation was defective in any way i should take advice about it <e> <s> more than that i do not think he would expect me to say at this moment <e>", "<cs> that is a reasonable request <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the attention of my noble friends and my right honourable friends to what the noble lord lord diamond has said <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i do not think that changes the principle <e> <s> the members of the committees are in a position to grant themselves or their relations tenancies <e> <s> wherever that pertains those people are in danger of being accused of showing favouritism towards their own <e> <s> i do not think that that is right <e> <s> i do not think it is realistic to compare the situation of those who are elected to those associations with those who are elected to local government <e> <s> the kind of electorate is quite different and even if the elections to local government are often on very small turnouts there is the opportunity for a much wider and larger cross-section of the community to take part in those elections <e> <s> therefore i do not think it is a fair comparison or even a comparison at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord selkirk and to the noble earl lord perth for their support <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has aroused the conscience of the house and it has led to some interesting and useful contributions <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce for what he had to say <e> <s> he has highlighted the difficulty that the government would be in if we accepted the amendment <e> <s> indeed as a result of what he said my view that the government simply could not accept the amendment in its present form is wholly confirmed <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister has not changed the bill has <e> <s> while the noble lord has been refreshing himself we have been studying the housing scotland bill but we are i think coming almost to a conclusion <e> <s> i realise the hour <e> <s> we are running perhaps minutes late <e> <s> as i was saying before the noble lord interrupted me these amendments are intended <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall i think that my noble friend said not before oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> this is a novel thought straight from the mind of a former chief secretary of the treasury <e> <s> i wonder what the noble lords reaction would have been when he was chief secretary of the treasury if somebody had suggested that government sales of any kind should be thus treated <e> <s> i know that sadly the noble lords government were not inclined to privatise in the way that this government are <e> <s> indeed we might not have been in the difficulties that we were in at that time in the late s if the noble lords government had acknowl <e>", "<cs> as always i was interested in what the noble lord lord stoddart had to say but before the noble lord lord diamond decides what he will do about this amendment i should like to put one question to him <e> <s> i suspect that he actually did have an opportunity of trying out this experiment <e>", "<cs> oh yes <e> <s> just let me finish <e> <s> i suspect that he had an opportunity to try out this experiment or to influence his party to try it out because if my memory serves me correctly in long after which time the noble lord had ceased to be chief secretary to the treasury but when he was still a member of the labour party his government sold a massive tranche of bp shares <e> <s> did he suggest to his government at that time that they should put that money into a special fund or did he acquiesce in the idea that it should go into the consolidated fund <e> <s> that is an interesting thought and perhaps the noble lord might be able to enlighten us <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for having the courtesy to warn my noble friend that he intended to raise this question <e> <s> that has given me an opportunity to examine the matter and take advice <e> <s> the answer is quite simple <e> <s> clause gives exemption from liability only where the mini-prospectus is not misleading if read with the full listing particulars <e> <s> if it is misleading there is no immunity <e> <s> the clause does not affect liability for statements made in the full prospectus <e> <s> if those statements were shown to be misleading liability would follow for those making the statements in the normal way <e>", "<cs> i am sure that when i give my noble friend lord stanley his answer he will be willing to share it with the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friend lord burton asked me at the outset why exclude loose grain from harvested crops <e> <s> farmers often grow grain for feeding their dairy cows <e> <s> this is to ensure an even basis for assessment <e> <s> the standard yield per hectare which will be prescribed will be based on a stocking ratio figure which represents the average number of cows kept per hectare of grass and fodder crops <e> <s> this figure cannot be compared directly with one which takes account of areas used for grain crops <e>", "<cs> the tenants balance sheet will indicate that the buildings have been written down <e> <s> while it is our endeavour to try to be as fair as we possibly can to the tenant it is rather difficult to have it both ways <e> <s> if the buildings are completely written down they will not affect the tenants fraction as much as they would if they were only half written down <e> <s> but in such circumstances i am sure that the noble lord would agree that there will be other issues which will be taken into account in the tenants fraction <e> <s> but so far as the buildings are concerned we cannot do other than take the asset value <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps do even better <e> <s> i shall give an answer and write to my noble friend <e> <s> the situation is that arbiters are accustomed to assigning values to tenants improvements in rent determinations <e> <s> the method will be to assess the full rental value of the holding and from that deduct their assessment of the rental value of the holding where there are no tenants improvements or fixed equipment <e> <s> the difference will be the annual rental value of the tenants improvements and the fixed equipment <e>", "<cs> if i have completely contradicted what i said earlier i am sure that will give the noble lord great joy <e> <s> he will have an opportunity to study this when he sees the report and my reply <e> <s> i am glad to hear that he is satisfied at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> i am extremely interested to hear the noble lord say this particularly with his experience of farming <e> <s> i think that he would find it very difficult to spend as much time as i have with the scottish nfu and not be persuaded by some of the arguments that they put forward <e> <s> apart from anything else i think there is a very considerable difference in the physical attributes of the less favoured areas in many parts of scotland particularly the old lfas compared with those south of the border <e> <s> however if the noble lord is suggesting that there should be no difference i would have to disagree with him very strongly indeed <e>", "<cs> yes that is so <e>", "<cs> that is a point that we did look at but the best advice available to me was that it would not be preferable to that which has been presented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i shall certainly communicate it to my right honourable friend in view of the meeting that he is soon to have with the local authorities <e> <s> we must always be careful to compare like with like <e> <s> we must bear in mind that south of the border rateable values of english clubs are still expressed in terms of the level of rents at the time of their revaluation <e> <s> we must bear in mind that scotland has had two revaluations since then and all types of property in scotland have on average increased almost eightfold <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe as he so often does has hit on <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can confirm to my noble friend that i am aware of those and many other anomalies which are revealed in the different systems north and south of the border <e> <s> i reiterate what i said to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that that is one of the reasons why the government are determined to press ahead with a complete review of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be no new money at present for the local authorities <e> <s> it is entirely up to each authority to determine whether it should invoke the powers of rebate that it has <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords earlier remarks about the all-party interest in the situation i hope that that all-party interest will be reflected by giving the legislation a speedy passage when it is presented <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass on that message to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it can be achieved without any cut in social services <e> <s> there will be cases which merit a rebate and there will be others which in the view of the authorities do not justify it <e>", "<cs> my lords residues containing plutonium from the fabrication at sellafield of fuel for the prototype fast reactor at dounreay are sent from sellafield to dounreay for recovery of the plutonium <e> <s> a discrepancy was identified between the estimated plutonium content of materials sent and the plutonium recovered <e> <s> some eight kilogrammes of plutonium were subsequently found to be still undissolved within the reprocessing plant <e> <s> this was recovered <e> <s> there was no possibility of an explosion and there was no danger to staff or to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the noble lords concern about this matter but i cannot accept that we would not have heard about it had it not been for the world in action programme or the <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can say to the noble lord is that there was clearly some misunderstanding between british nuclear fuels limited and the atomic energy authority about the quantity of potentially insoluble material sent from sellafield <e> <s> both bnfl and the aea are taking steps to ensure that there is no recurrence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that without notice i cannot answer that question <e> <s> i shall take advice and communicate with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a question on the order paper for i think th june relating directly to this matter <e> <s> at that time following the taking of advice a full answer will be given <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first question indeed it was as a result of the present accounting procedures that the initial discrepancy was discovered <e> <s> the safeguards office of the department of energy and euratom were aware of the discrepancy and were kept informed of the investigation into the reasons for it and of the eventual discovery of the undissolved residues containing the eight kilogrammes of plutonium <e> <s> i cannot elaborate on what i said in answer to a previous question that the government are taking steps to ensure that all the procedures are being carried out correctly in order to avoid any repetition of this <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the noble lords concern and while i agree that the nuclear industry must always adopt the highest possible standards so far as safety in concerned i would not accept the rest of what he says <e> <s> i believe that a great deal of care has been taken throughout by the industry in order to ensure that there is no danger in the transportation of materials between sellafield and dounreay <e> <s> indeed i have given an assurance that these procedures are being checked <e> <s> a high standard has already been attained <e> <s> the nuclear industry has a safety standard of which it can be justly proud <e> <s> indeed it is more open about its dealings and about its mishaps however minor they may be not that i suggest that this was a minor one than probably is any other industry in this country <e> <s> i know that all that has been said in your lordships house today will be be carefully studied by the government <e> <s> i can give the assurance that all measures will be taken to maintain safety <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will certainly do everything they can as will the industry to ensure that there is no recurrence <e> <s> i would not necessarily take as gospel everything that is said in a television programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord marshall was referring to plutonium sent to the united states under the mutual defence agreement to which i referred <e> <s> he would have understood that being exported under the mda the material would have been brought into the military cycle <e> <s> however in my noble friend then sir alec douglas-home when prime minister told the house that the united states had no intention of using the material in weapons <e> <s> the united states government have stated that they have not used it for weapons and that is still their policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for asking that question <e> <s> it enables me to point out that the united kingdom received a certain quantity of highly enriched uranium in return <e> <s> that was for the military programme of the ministry of defence <e> <s> it would not be in the national interest to disclose the quantity of plutonium exported because that might indicate the quantity of highly enriched uranium received in return <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those of us who knew the noble lord in another place rejoice in the fact that since coming here he has retained his highly active sense of humour <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> these exports have taken place under the defence agreement that we have with the united states <e> <s> they have gone on during the period of office of successive governments of both parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i have i think made clear that the americans have indicated to us and have confirmed to us that plutonium exported from this country is not used for military purposes <e> <s> i reiterate that <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the simple fact of the matter is that there is nothing in the treaty that would prevent the americans using the plutonium for military purposes but they have given an absolute assurance that it has not been and is not being used for military purposes <e> <s> that we accept <e>", "<cs> my lords exports of plutonium and other nuclear materials can only take place on receipt of inter-governmental assurances covering peaceful use the application of safeguards physical protection and controls on re-transfer <e> <s> that would be the position regarding any plutonium that was exported <e> <s> the agreement that we have with the americans is in the view of the government absolutely satisfactory <e> <s> we have no reason to suspect our american friends in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon who as always carefully outlined his ideas as to how this amendment might operate <e> <s> i listened also with great care to the contributions made by the noble lords lord diamond and lord ezra and also by the noble lord lord grimond whom i am delighted to see joining our deliberations at report stage <e> <s> it is always a great pleasure to have the noble lord lord grimond participating in our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state had available to him a great deal of advice <e> <s> he asked a well-known consultancy firm to

been removed <e> <s> i am told that a full procedure was gone through and that a number of possibilities were identified <e> <s> the best choice was then made by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect may i remind the noble lord that we are now at the report stage of the bill <e> <s> it is a quite separate point that he has raised <e> <s> in any event i do not accept it <e> <s> i am making the point that i think i am right in saying that at report stage i have indeed violated the ales myself because i should have sought the leave of the house before even giving a reply to either noble lord who has spoken <e> <s> noble lords are not allowed at report stage to behave as though we were dealing with the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i shall not read out the rules of order <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords are equally as acquainted with them as i am <e> <s> i think however that at this early stage of our proceedings it is right that i should draw the attention of noble lords to the fact that we are at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we have yet again had an interesting and short debate on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond will not be surprised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am misleading the house in the slightest <e> <s> if my memory serves me correctly we were here until half-past nine the following morning on one occasion <e> <s> that made up for a fair amount of time that we may have lost during the day <e> <s> i am not complaining about that <e> <s> that is what government ministers are for <e> <s> we are prepared to stand at the dispatch box and listen to the arguments put to us and answer them to the best of our ability until whatever hour the house decides to sit <e> <s> i am not criticising that for one moment <e> <s> i am merely pointing out that in the view of most people in this house parliamentary democracy is working pretty well on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> he makes a very valid point <e> <s> i merely suggested that that is one of the sources which are available to the secretary of state <e> <s> he does not have to accept

by the director if he wishes to resign from office <e> <s> noble lords may recall that we had a constructive debate on the issue under amendment no <e> <s> on th april on the second sitting of the committee stage <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out that amendment which sought to impose a time restriction of six months on the director when giving notice of resignation would have imposed an overly-rigid requirement which could have caused difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i am not suggesting that the noble lord is looking a gift horse in the mouth but i can give him a perfectly reasonable answer to his query <e> <s> the government amendment removes the words in writing because the phrase is already defined in clause of the bill <e> <s> line on page of the bill states <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already debated in committee the necessity for the involvement of the treasury in approving the number terms and conditions of ofgas staff <e> <s> as we made clear then ofgas will be a non-ministerial government department manned by civil servants <e> <s> it is therefore inevitable that the treasury will be involved <e> <s> it will not be sufficient for them merely to be consulted they must specifically give their approval to these matters to ensure that funds are properly spent <e> <s> as to the second amendment it is certainly the governments intention that ofgas should be properly staffed <e> <s> since the director and ofgas will be creatures of statute they will be required to ensure that their statutory duties and functions are properly fulfilled and to employ sufficient staff to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords the present estimate for is up to approximately staff <e> <s> it will then be a matter of seeing how that number works out <e> <s> it may be necessary to increase it slightly but that is the present estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that the noble lord lord stoddart is mistaken <e> <s> by leave of the house perhaps i may say that as i explained when i originally answered the amendment ofgas will be a non-ministerial government department manned by civil servants and it therefore is inevitable that the treasury will be directly involved <e> <s> that is something that we just have to accept because the treasury itself as is its custom in government would insist that it was involved in order that it could have direct sight of how the money was being spent <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are dealing with an area of the bill which we have already considered in committee and which was voted against at that time <e> <s> however the noble lord has raised no new points which have persuaded me that the present provision is in any way likely to give rise to difficulties <e> <s> as i have explained before the government have expressed their clear intention that the office should be properly staffed to meet the demands that will be made on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that figure immediately but no doubt it will arrive in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house regarding condition the matter which the noble lord lord stoddart has raised million is the estimate of the costs of ofgas and the gas consumers council <e> <s> for subsequent years the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the amendment is withdrawn may i say that i am most grateful to the noble lord for his consideration of the governments feelings <e> <s> i can assure him that there is no danger of the government being embarrassed <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that he wants to press this amendment to a division then i suggest that he does so <e> <s> the government will not be embarrassed in any way <e> <s> the government have plenty of people here and if the noble lord feels that he must divide then i suggest that he does so <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already explained at some length why we believe that the right course is to appoint an independent regulatory body which will of course have at its head a well qualified and experienced director <e> <s> he will be supported by the number of staff necessary for the fulfilment of its functions <e>", "<cs> whose side is the noble lord on my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the noble lord said that the policy of a future alliance government if such were to happen would be to renationalise the gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has intervened <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend withdraws his amendment and with the leave of the house perhaps i may make two points to him <e> <s> first as regards buying the croft no compensation would be payable <e> <s> if the croft were being bought it would rule out the question of compensation <e> <s> the crofter and his landlord are free to agree between themselves as to what the rent for a croft should be and the period for which it should stand <e> <s> the figure set will be the rent for so long as the agreement lasts and thereafter until a new agreement is entered into or alternatively the scottish land court on application by either landlord or tenant fixes a different rent <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to my noble friend that even if i were persuaded by his argument i should find it impossible to accept it in those terms <e> <s> the terms of amendments and are clearly stated on the marshalled list <e> <s> they are to <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house no i am not saying that these amendments are not necessary <e> <s> i am saying that we simply do not agree with what the noble lord is proposing <e> <s> the noble lord has come back to this point <e> <s> we had it in committee we had it again on the first day of report and we shall have it on a number of occasions before we conclude report <e> <s> we believe that in the legislation we have provided a very satisfactory system which will enable the director after negotiation with the treasury to appoint the staff which is required for the purpose of carrying out his functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for including with his amendment five other amendments which are all related to the same subject <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would require british gas to have an energy-saving programme monitored by the director or the secretary of state <e> <s> many noble lords have already referred to british gass commitment to helping their customers save energy covering the use of existing equipment and developing new and more efficient appliance systems and controls <e> <s> perhaps i might mention some of their promotional activities and my noble friend lady gardner of parkes has just touched on this point which include for example the gas energy management award now in its eleventh year extensive publicity and advice to the domestic consumer in showrooms and through advertising and thermsaver energy efficient products the gaswarm homes certificates therm an exercise to assess <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt during my remarks i may be supplied with some additional information that i can pass on to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i should like to say straightaway however that i do not think that the noble lord can watch as much television as i do <e> <s> i am not a television addict by any means but for many months the electricity authority have had a highly successful advertising programme on television <e> <s> it must be very expensive because television is an expensive media through which to advertise <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that it matches anything i have seen on behalf of the british gas corporation <e> <s> no doubt as i am talking i shall be given some figures that i can pass on to the noble lord <e> <s> if not i shall let him know in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords no i would not accept that that would be the case at all <e> <s> with regard to the electricity industry it is not dependent upon one fuel alone <e> <s> certainly the government have an influence on where the electricity industry buys its coal and at what price <e> <s> but electricity is made from nuclear power and from hydro-electricity which is very much cheaper than anything else <e> <s> there is little doubt that if we had the potential to produce hydro-electricity in the kind of quantity which we presently produce electricity from coal then it would be very attractive but that is another argument <e> <s> i simply use these examples as a comparison in the argument that the noble lord is using <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i said to the noble lord lord diamond and the noble lord lord moiloy has raised the same point that i hope to give him figures <e> <s> i am happy to tell the noble lord that the note which i have received from the officials box is almost verbatim the remarks i made earlier <e> <s> therefore in due course perhaps i may drop the noble lord a note and give him some indication of the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i may have touched partly on those amendments when replying to the debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord as he indicated realised that those were grouped with it so if i reiterate some remarks i have already made perhaps the noble lord will be tolerant with me <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has acknowledged a similar amendment was debated <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated an amendment almost identical to this one which was tabled by the noble lord lord diamond in committee <e> <s> as my noble friend lord brabazon then said we do not believe that standards of service should be legislated for but should be the responsibility of the supplier who in responding to normal commercial pressures will have every incentive to maintain and improve standards of service <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house clauses to deal with the director changing the authorisation <e> <s> the procedure is laid down in those clauses <e> <s> condition of the authorisation will permit ofgas to obtain any informa-tion needed to monitor the quality of service <e> <s> i reject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has identified what at first sight may appear to be an unnecessary word in clause <e> <s> in fact the inclusion of the word is appropriate and i shall briefly try to explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i have listened very carefully to the noble lord lord diamond and the noble lord has been convincing on this if not on a great deal else this evening <e> <s> i am certainly prepared to take this away and discuss it with the draftsman who drafted this bill <e> <s> i do not have to tell the noble lord how difficult it can sometimes be to persuade draftsmen but i am prepared to take this back and look at it with the draftsman and in due course i shall drop the noble lord a line <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord ezra these groupings were agreed and when amendments are grouped the first amendment is spoken to and it is not common practice to speak to each amendment when it comes up <e> <s> i answered this debate when i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord then spoke to amendment no <e> <s> which had already been spoken to and i answered it again then <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord i can find nothing new to say about amendment no <e> <s> at this stage <e> <s> i know that the noble lord is not doing it out of any malice aforethought but it is not the common practice in the house to speak to these amendments as they come up when they have already been grouped <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord he should have raised the issue when amendment no <e> <s> was debated and with which this amendment was included <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that there should be proper safeguards against unacceptable behaviour by a gas supplier damaging to the interests of consumers or competitors <e> <s> i believe that the bill and the draft authorisation already meet the noble lords concerns <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i certainly do not but i am prepared to settle for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no further information but i shall certainly write to the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> both he and i live a little more than miles away <e> <s> we know that the people within that radius are well satisfied with the performance at dounreay over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the considerable experience of the noble lord lord dean of beswick in his capacity as a member of a union which is involved with the power industry <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house would endorse his confidence in the nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the policy of the nuclear industry to be as open as possible about its activities <e> <s> i doubt whether there is any other industry in this country which gives more information about any mishaps which may take place at its establish-ments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely correct to pursue his investigations of the nuclear industry because the nuclear industry is only too pleased to make all possible information available <e> <s> if there is anything since about which the noble lord seeks information i shall ensure that it is made available to him <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree with me that the present record of the nuclear energy industry in this country is second to none in industrial control of accidents <e> <s> does he further agree that if the chernobyl and similar reactors had before they were allowed to be constructed to undergo the tests which are imposed on the nuclear industry in this country there may never have been a chernobyl accident <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with those who have already extended a welcome albeit a qualified welcome in my own case to this bill <e> <s> i disagree almost entirely with the previous speaker the noble lord lord bruce of donington who has made certain insinuations about the oil industry and <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree with me that the total amount of contribution likely to be made by the year by alternative energy sources is in the region of per cent <e> <s> of our total requirement and that this is a very small contribution indeed <e> <s> does he further agree that it would be quite ridiculous to divert all our attention to alternative sources of energy when we have already successfully invested so much money in nuclear energy <e> <s> should we not be giving every possible encouragement to the nuclear industry to continue its forward march <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> his wealth of knowledge on the subject we always enjoy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying the position and i am happy to accept that he made that point in the form of a question <e> <s> i should hope that the answer would be in the affirmative and that the privatisation of the industry would lead to the kind of improvement which both i and the noble lord would like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with those who have already spoken in offering my thanks to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very important matter this evening <e> <s> my interest in the subject is principally in connection with the offshore supply industry <e> <s> i feel that the rest of the subject has been very widely covered this evening and it is no indication that i do not consider it equally important if i restrict my contribution to the north sea and the relationship of those who operate on the offshore supply industry therein <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend pass on to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy the concern that has been expressed in the house as to the possibility of an to per cent <e> <s> increase in the price of electricity <e> <s> at the same time will he suggest to him that every possible measure should be taken to try to influence the various component parts of the cegb and other boards to effect measures which will reduce that to per cent <e> <s> as far as possible <e> <s> in other words will he encourage people to buy coal where it can be bought at the cheapest prices <e> <s> will he encourage the boards to do all that they can to ensure that the amount of nuclear power fed into the grid is the maximum amount available <e> <s> in addition will my noble friend tell his right honourable friend that while nobody likes increases in price we appreciate the fact of which he has reminded us that in real terms the cost of electricity has been reduced by per cent <e> <s> over the past three years <e>", "<cs> my lords during the month of july we had a useful debate on merchant shipping initiated by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> as i recall that occasion was used as a market by the majority of those who participated during which they could put down suggestions as to what they expected to see in the bill which we are now discussing <e> <s> i must straight away congratulate my noble friend on the front bench on having managed to include so many of the things which he was asked to include in the bill on that occasion <e> <s> having said that i am very disappointed indeed that he was not able to give a little bit of help to the offshore supply industry in the form of providing some sort of protection for british offshore supply vessels operating in the british sector of the north sea <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for continuing his sympathetic approach to the bill <e> <s> i fully accept that he will take this away without commitment <e> <s> it would be unfair to expect him to do otherwise at this stage <e> <s> i shall certainly be available to talk with him at any time <e> <s> i hope that between now and report stage he will be able to frame an amendment which would be acceptable and indeed that the amendment might be put down by the government <e> <s> i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems almost unfair to rise as another of those who take issue with the noble lord lord parry in what he seeks to do <e> <s> we all appreciate the great sincerity with which he moved the amendment and we share his concern for those who fish from the port which is closest to his heart <e> <s> nevertheless i think that the point made by the noble lord lord greenway is extremely valid <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept the decision of the secretary of state for trade and industry not to make a referral but will my noble friend agree that the chairman of british caledonian is following good and true conservative principles by trying to get the very best deal he can for his shareholders <e> <s> if the government feel that this is not the way to proceed and that they have in any way to interfere would it not be more realistic for any interference to take the form of persuading the noble lord lord king that his offer should be upgraded <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state accept that there is a point of view in scotland different from that suggested to him from the other side of the house <e> <s> does he realise that the <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend accept that there are a number of us in this house who would be greatly concerned if there were to be any postponement whatsoever in the development of the nuclear industry in this country <e> <s> this is for a very wide variety of reasons not least among which is the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of people in this country whose jobs depend on a healthy and successful nuclear industry <e> <s> would my noble friend convey this point of view to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those which have already been expressed to my noble friend the minister for the way in which he handled this bill <e> <s> his consideration and the time he took to consider points made have added enormously to the quality of the legislation that we are now passing to another place for their consideration <e> <s> my particular interest in the bill as your lordships know was the welfare of the british offshore supply vessels association and its members <e> <s> i think that they are well satisfied with what we have achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that there are many in the country tonight who will be greatly relieved that such a statement has been made particularly as it affects the nuclear industry <e> <s> it will be seen as being implicit in the white paper that the government confirm their wholehearted support for that industry <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount withdraws the amendment i must say that i find the amendment quite outrageous <e> <s> those of us who live and have worked in the highlands of scotland emphasise to all and sundry the ease of access to that region <e> <s> after all we can be in edinburgh from inverness in two and a half hours <e> <s> even the noble viscount can reach edinburgh in a maximum of four hours from his part of the country i should have thought <e> <s> perhaps the way he drives he could even do it in three and a half hours <e> <s> anyway he should be able to do it easily in four hours <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that if some of those from the other side of the house who are making suggestions about statistics were to use their efforts in trying to persuade their friends in the trade union movement that mr gavin laird and the aeu were very savagely treated by their colleagues and that they should not have been so treated there would be potential ford workers in dundee who could be looking forward to jobs today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> will he accept that our monopolies and mergers policy as it stands at present looks decidedly vulnerable when on the one hand it prohibits two british companies that wish to merge and by such a merger to control say per cent <e> <s> of a given market even if that merger is in order to meet the challenge of the single european market in yet on the other hand allows a foreign predator to take over a british company thus enabling it to benefit from that very market <e>", "<cs> i find myself largely in agreement with what the noble lord lord marsh has said although i feel emotionally attracted to what the noble earl lord perth said <e> <s> nevertheless on this occasion i feel that the noble lord has let his emotions get the better of his judgment <e> <s> there can be little doubt that the scottish steel industry has done very well in recent years <e> <s> it is hoped that ravenscraig will continue to do well and that it will produce a product for which there will be a ready market and which will make it competitive not just throughout the united kingdom but competitive with competitors throughout the world <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there would necessarily be a different view <e> <s> my right honourable friend to whom the noble lord referred has been a loyal member of the government since <e> <s> i have no reason to think that he would do other than voice his views within the conventional method which is within the cabinet which is observed by the conservative party and accept the will of the majority of people <e> <s> in any case i suggest to my noble friend that he takes careful note of what has been said that he reads and deliberates upon the views which have been given but that at the end of the day he do nothing which would include an amendment such as this that would so weaken the legislation he seeks to put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfei suggest that whatever the failings of the conservative party in scotland it does not need guidance from his party as to how to put things righti was particularly interested in the point he made about previous nationalisationshe may well be righthowever he is vastly experienced in the world of financeover the years i have no doubt that he has given valuable advice to many companieswearing that other hat i wonder what his advice to a company that was interested in purchasing british steel would be in terms of having to contend with the stipulation which the noble earl lord perth seeks to include in the legislationi venture to suggest that he would tell his client to go very cannily and he would be right to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to follow the noble lord lord dean of beswick as regards some of his remarks but i shall save my comments until we debate the privatisation of the mining industry in this house on some future occasion <e> <s> i for one look forward to that very much indeed <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that miners are genuinely interested in their industry <e> <s> i believe they would have a very much better future than they appear to have at the moment if the mining industry were privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter on which we shall have to wait and see <e> <s> but i believe that the principle is right <e> <s> when the contract is made the cost is assessed by the generator and the supplier <e> <s> the grid will then be able to call in the most attractive price <e> <s> but my noble friend may wish to comment further <e> <s> certainly i shall give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only give my understanding of the situation <e> <s> if that is not correct i trust that my noble friend will correct me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that remark is hardly worthy of the noble lord <e> <s> nobody has advised me on what i have said <e> <s> i have spoken because i believe in this legislation <e> <s> i shall do all i can to assist in putting it through <e>

earl lord halsbury <e> <s> i am among those who used to read his speeches on energy matters long before i came to this chamber <e> <s> when he is talking on his own subject on the technicalities of physics and nuclear power he has no equal <e>", "<cs> the noble lord with whom i have had many dealings over the years is as aware as i am that the whole structure in scotland is different to that in

was first to speak to the amendment because his contribution clearly outlined the history <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take issue with the principles that have been spelt out by either the noble lord lord shepherd or the noble lord lord ezra because i believe we all agree that support for alternative sources of energy is very important and that in the future they will have a vital part to play <e> <s> we must get the situation into perspective <e> <s> my understanding is that the total contribution of all alternative sources of energy to power generation at the present moment is somewhere in the region of per cent <e> <s> that is a very small percentage indeed <e> <s> with all the best endeavours it is going to be many years before that percentage is increased substantially <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my good wishes on the passing of the bill <e> <s> i agree with what my noble friend lord renton has said <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with all that he said about my noble friend lady hooper and her team on the front bench <e> <s> the patience and courtesy which she and her associates showed were commendable at all times <e> <s> it is also worth saying that the constructive approach of the official opposition and the lesser opposition if i may call them so was also appreciated on all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that many of us sympathise with him very strongly as we do with the secretary of state for having to make the statement which he has repeated this afternoon <e> <s> there are also many who believe that what has happened may in the long run be for the best <e> <s> when during the debate on the amendment that has already been referred to i suggested that the noble earl lord halsbury might not have had
