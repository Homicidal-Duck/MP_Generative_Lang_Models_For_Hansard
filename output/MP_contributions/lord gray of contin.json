["<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft scheme laid before the house on th february be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross for the way in which he has moved this amendment <e> <s> i cannot agree with him of course and i think that the flaw in his argument is that he revealed the basic dislike of this party towards the whole principle of selling council houses <e> <s> i know that members of his party suggest that they are not against the principle but in every argument which has taken place either in another place or during the second reading debate here that weakness in argument has been revealed <e> <s> the noble lords party is basically opposed to this principle and of course naturally uses every means at its disposal for arguing that case <e> <s> in the case of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie his party is not opposed to the principle of selling council houses and in replying to this amendment i shall try to explain to him why we believe that the course we are following is desirable <e>", "<cs> i think that some of your lordships have been arguing a false case and i shall try to explain why i believe that is so <e> <s> i have sympathy with my noble friend lord selkirk who asked me why i thought the proposal was necessary and i have sympathy with other noble lords who suggested that the discount was too high <e> <s> but the level of discount reflects the fact that any house with a sitting tenant has a substantially lower value than one with vacant possession <e> <s> therefore anything which can be done to encourage a sitting tenant to take advantage of the opportunity which is available to him to purchase his house must ultimately be to the good and to the good of the local authority <e>", "<cs> if i may take the point raised by the noble lord first of all i would not agree that that is necessarily the case <e> <s> if i may answer his question the government obviously took advice on this matter before reaching a conclusion as to the desirable discounts to be offered <e> <s> but of course this could conceivably vary from one part of the country to another <e> <s> but nevertheless i would not agree with him that this was not realistic <e> <s> anybody who has owned property and has had that property occupied by tenants will appreciate that the value of that house is vastly reduced so far as a sale is concerned by the fact that it is occupied by a tenant <e> <s> therefore that must be reflected in the price which is offered <e> <s> as we see it we believe that we have got it just about right regarding discounts <e> <s> we feel that what we are doing here is an encouragement to a group of people for whom this per cent <e> <s> might be the difference between being able to make such a purchase and not <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier we believe that there are probably about people who conceivably could benefit by this decision and i think that it is the right decision in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> in that regard yes <e> <s> the particular group of people to whom i referred could be at a disadvantage but it is our hope that this amendment will not be accepted and that the people who stand to benefit will be enabled to do so <e>", "<cs> i am not going to start up any animosity between scotland and england if i can possibly prevent it <e> <s> but it has been a tradition that scotland on major issues and housing has always been considered one of those major issues has had its own legislation <e> <s> i am dealing with a scottish bill at the present moment and i was asked a question relating to an english bill which i answered as best i could <e> <s> however i would rather direct my attentions towards this tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland amendment bill <e>", "<cs> the improvement to the right to buy increasing the maximum discount to which tenants are entitled from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> will enable more tenants of long standing many of them nearing the end of their working lives or already perhaps in retirement to buy at prices which fairly reflect their tenancy record and the resources likely to be available to them <e>", "<cs> the point is that someone who is an early tenant should not be put at a tremendous disadvantage <e> <s> he or she should not have to think i cannot possibly purchase this house for or years <e> <s> it is reasonable that once someone becomes a local authority tenant and if the policy is to sell local authority houses that person should not be unfairly treated because he or she has been a tenant for only a short time <e> <s> it is equally important that a tenant who has been a tenant for a long time and who has been a good tenant should have terms offered to him or to her which reflect the quality of his or her tenancy <e>", "<cs> as i have already explained to the noble lord we do not consider it reasonable to put new tenants or relatively new tenants at a very great disadvantage <e> <s> they should be entitled to an incentive <e> <s> earlier the noble lord said that he had no objection to the sale of council houses and perhaps he has no objection in principle to the sale of council houses <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the noble lord must not put words into my mouth <e> <s> i was trying to explain that if a tenant has a good record he or she should have the opportunity to see the contribution which he or she has made by way of regularly keeping up with his or her rent and so making a valuable contribution reflected in the price which he or she will pay for the house <e> <s> that is all i said <e> <s> i shall not be drawn into the argument about whether or not a bad tenant should have the same privileges <e>", "<cs> all right <e> <s> i think that it is highly unlikely that a bad tenant would actually seek to purchase his house because most local authority experience is that the bad tenants are not the sort of people with a community spirit who might be tempted to purchase their own houses <e>", "<cs> i have to keep talking for a little while until i receive the answer to that from the box <e>", "<cs> in lieu of an answer from my advisers i can only repeat what i have already said to the noble lord lord ross i suggest that it is highly unlikely that a tenant of the type referred to by the noble lord would be in the position of seeking to purchase a house <e> <s> however i am sure that if we can keep this little debate going for a few more minutes i shall have the proper answer for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has considerable experience of local government and i am sure that he is able to put his own interpretation on what a bad tenant might be <e> <s> but i do not agree with his last comment that this is a socially divisive policy <e> <s> it is anything but a socially divisive policy <e> <s> although it is true to say as regards sales that the more popular houses have been the older houses and the houses in perhaps more desirable municipal areas they are by no means the only houses involved <e> <s> indeed in both glasgow and edinburgh in what one might not perhaps consider to be the most attractive municipal areas there are cases where houses have been purchased which is an encouraging sign <e> <s> there are people who are prepared to make purchases of those houses <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that for one moment <e> <s> i am suggesting that the type of tenant who is community spirited who is aware of the privilege which he has had in having a municipally-owned house for which he has paid rent is certainly the most likely person to wish to purchase that house <e> <s> two types of purchasers live in municipally-owned houses <e> <s> type a is the person who wishes to purchase the dwelling which he occupies <e> <s> type b uses his years as a tenant of a municipally-owned house and during those years he looks for and seeks to purchase a private dwelling outside <e> <s> both those categories of tenants are community-minded and are the type of tenants who are likely to purchase their houses <e> <s> i shall not attempt to define a bad tenant but we all have our own ideas of what bad tenants might be <e>", "<cs> i suppose that if the bad tenant can manage to raise the wherewithal to make the purchase he will benefit by the goodwill of the local authority and the fact that initially all tenants will be looked upon as good tenants <e> <s> however if he is a bad tenant it might be to the local authoritys great advantage if he does buy his house for it would relieve them of a great burden <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble and learned lord in that i think i failed to answer fully one of his earlier points <e> <s> as i now have the information for which he asked i shall try to give it to him <e> <s> his point which was a point also raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock was what contribution had the tenant of two years standing made particularly rent-wise <e> <s> one must accept that after two years the tenant has not made a major contribution by way of rental <e> <s> but the fact that a house has a sitting tenant reduces its market value by about per cent <e> <s> and even perhaps considerably more so that it really does not matter in that context how long the tenant has been a tenant the fact that he is a tenant of the house certainly reduces very substantially the value of the house <e> <s> i think that we <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord is unintentionally misrepresenting what i said <e> <s> he is using the analogy of the house in the private sector which is privately occupied and which is going to be <e>", "<cs> i accept part of what the noble lord says but it is surely reasonable whether we are talking about publicly-owned or privately-owned houses <e>", "<cs> whichever it is it is not unreasonable that the person who has been a tenant for or years should receive a special benefit <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is suggesting that they should receive no consideration because they have been good tenants <e>", "<cs> the valuation of the house with the sitting tenant remains as i said very much less than it would be without a sitting tenant but it is at the discretion of any government to suggest <e>", "<cs> very well the noble lord is not talking about any government <e> <s> let us go back to the private sector <e> <s> if the noble lord lord ross was a large landlord who had a great many houses which were all tenanted and he wanted to dispose of them would he not out of the goodness of his heart think it <e>", "<cs> i think we have dealt with this amendment in some depth <e> <s> i do not think i can agree to accept it <e> <s> i do not believe that it is desirable to accept it and i ask the noble lord lord carmichael whether he will consider withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord mackie and i am sorry i did not deal with that <e> <s> it seems that the answer to his mathematical conundrum has not been provided for me and i shall therefore write to the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to try to explain to the noble lord <e> <s> whether i shall be successful remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock is as charming as ever <e> <s> i shall try to answer <e>", "<cs> this does not deal with anybody else <e> <s> it deals specifically with the child of a tenant and the years spent as the child of the tenant <e> <s> it does not deal with anybody else in that situation <e>", "<cs> our intention in the bill is merely to replace the present discretion to count time spent as the child of the tenant by an obligation to do so <e> <s> we are not proposing to extend the categories of relatives who can qualify to include for example grandchildren nephews or nieces <e> <s> if one started to <e>", "<cs> the provisions are limited to humanitarian cases any child will benefit <e> <s> however i do not think the noble lord could benefit because he has had a break in tenancy and therefore he would not qualify <e>", "<cs> clause extends the list in section of the act of public bodies former tenancy of whose houses can be counted by tenants of district councils scottish special housing associations and new town houses towards the qualifying period for the right to buy and towards discount <e> <s> the basic principle upon which the list in section was originally constructed was that periods spent as tenants of local authorities and analogous bodies should be counted towards the benefits of the right to buy while periods as tenants of government departments and connected bodies should not <e> <s> during the passage of the act we accepted that there should be four exceptions to this general principle in respect of members of the armed forces and the prison service and of employees of the forestry commission and health boards <e> <s> these exceptions were made because tenants of these bodies are often required to occupy tied housing and in many cases are unable to arrange their own housing provision until they retire <e>", "<cs> whatever the merits of such a move might be it could not be embraced by this legislation <e> <s> i fear that it would require primary legislation of its own <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can help the noble lord with his question about how an occupant of a tied house will secure a local authority house <e> <s> such tenants will be allowed to apply for a local authority house in the normal way merely by putting their names on a waiting list <e> <s> the local authority is required to publish its allocations policy and it could not discriminate against former tenants of the public sector as long as they had been tenants of houses which will be added to the list about which we have been talking <e> <s> that will give them the protection which the noble lord seeks for them <e> <s> it will ensure that their period of tenancy in one of those houses will count as far as the local authority is concerned <e> <s> if they decided after the two-year period to purchase then their period of public sector tenancy would also count <e>", "<cs> though it may not be powerful enough to convince the noble lord i am afraid it is a fact <e> <s> the plain truth of the matter is that it would require primary legislation as i said in reply to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> in this legislation we are dealing with local authority housing in the public sector <e> <s> the noble lords lord mackie and lord howie have been referring to housing in the private sector <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie sugested that it would be a good thing to extend this provision to private sector housing <e> <s> i am not in a position to go into the merits of that argument <e> <s> perhaps it would be a very good thing <e> <s> i merely said that it would not be possible to do so in this particular legislation which deals with public sector housing <e> <s> that is the fact of the matter it would not be possible to achieve that change in this legislation <e> <s> it would require a new bill for primary legislation <e>", "<cs> this new clause is very sweeping in its effects <e> <s> it would not only remove the right to buy from most elderly tenants it would also remove the right from anyone who happened to live in a house which the authority could claim was ordinarily let to elderly persons <e> <s> as a result almost all one-apartment or two-apartment houses in scotland might be excluded from the right to buy <e>", "<cs> no i am replying to the amendment which the noble lord moved <e> <s> he moved it in his way i hope that he will let me reply in mine <e> <s> in addition when an authority receives an application to purchase from a tenant a house which has been specially adapted for elderly people it can as an <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross said himself that we must get used to the fact that he is no longer the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> he answers so well for me that i cannot improve on that answer if he is correct <e> <s> it is the local authority <e>", "<cs> the answer is that the sheltered housing is provided by local authorities <e>", "<cs> they can either build purpose-built sheltered accommodation or they can adapt existing houses suitable for old people <e> <s> but the concept of sheltered accommodation is housing which is purpose built in a complex with a warden and an alarm system <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i did try to cover that point when i was replying to the noble lord <e> <s> the council is able to make conditions which would enable them to have a pre-emption on the house when it was resold <e> <s> they have the right of pre-emption and the council can make that condition itself in the type of house which the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> but the complex type of house where there is a warden and an alarm system is already exempted <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that it seems wrong to deprive an elderly person of the right to purchase his or her home and is it not a reasonable safeguard to maintain the housing stock to include a right of pre-emption for the local authority to buy it back <e>", "<cs> houses such as the noble lord describes can be sold <e> <s> they come into the normal conditions <e> <s> if they have not been adapted if they are merely houses which are occupied by old persons then they can be sold in the normal way <e> <s> i do not want to go into the details again <e> <s> i have already described the two different types of either complex sheltered housing or adapted houses <e>", "<cs> i take the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> first of all most of the houses to which he refers are not public sector houses they are private sector houses <e> <s> i think that the majority of the type of houses he has in mind are perhaps cottages on farms or estates which over the years have been occupied by retired persons <e> <s> but if he has in mind houses owned by local authorities then the situation is as i have already described depending on whether the house has been specially adapted for old persons or whether it is merely a house which by custom has been used by old persons <e> <s> so i have already dealt with the three types of house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct in the second suggestion <e> <s> the house is bought back at the market value placed on it by the district valuer at the time of the purchase <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear from what has been said that at least some noble lords opposite are still labouring under the misapprehension that houses which are sold are in some way lost to the housing stock <e> <s> i have tried to make it as clear as i can on several occasions during our discussion that this simply is not the case <e> <s> if tenants were not allowed to buy their homes it does not mean that they would move away the great majority of them would continue to rent their homes often for a considerable number of years <e> <s> this is equally true whether the houses are in rural areas or in urban areas <e>", "<cs> i should like to try to deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> the act already does all that is necessary to safeguard against substantial numbers of former council houses in rural areas being sold as holiday or second homes <e>", "<cs> subsections and of section of the act enable the secretary of state to make an order permitting authorities to impose pre-emption conditions on sales of houses in rural areas provided that more than one-third of the council houses in the area have been sold and that an unreasonable proportion of the houses sold have been <e>", "<cs> i shall have to check on that point for my noble friend <e> <s> an area which has been designated a rural area within an islands or district council speaks for itself <e> <s> i shall have to seek information on whether actual designations have taken place <e> <s> once again i find that by speaking long enough the information has arrived <e> <s> areas as such have not been designated <e> <s> therefore when we refer to rural areas we are merely talking about country areas because no rural area as such has been designated <e>", "<cs> in the interests of brevity and to be in accord with others who have spoken i am tempted just to say that i do not agree and sit down <e> <s> but i hardly think that would be suitable and i should give your lordships the reasons why i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lords amendment seeks to deal with this matter by providing that a tenant who feels aggrieved by a decision of his council to refuse to sell his house may have recourse to the lands tribunal to have the decision reversed <e> <s> however this would add a further stage to the process and an additional complication which i believe is neither necessary nor appropriate to the relatively small number of cases which we expect to arise under this provision <e>", "<cs> the later stages of a sale once an offer to sell has been accepted and missives concluded are not regulated by the tenants rights act <e> <s> rather they are subject to the ordinary law of contract <e> <s> the legal remedy available to a tenant who considers that the district council is failing to complete the sale of his house within a reasonable time is therefore to raise an action of specific implement in the sheriff court requiring the district council to implement the contract enbodied in the missives <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment seeks to convert the proposed new section a of the act from a provision which will enable my right honourable friend the secretary of state to set up a right to repair scheme into a provision which will require him to set up such a scheme <e> <s> i appreciate that the purpose of this amendment is probing <e> <s> the government have made clear that it is their intention to introduce a scheme which will give secure tenants a right to carry out repairs which would otherwise be the responsibility of their landlord and to claim a payment from the landlord for having done so <e> <s> the commitment to introduce such a right was included in the governments manifesto at the general election last year <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is being less than fair <e> <s> we should have been very strongly criticised if we had not prepared regulations and agreed that there should be further consultation upon them <e> <s> i do not envisage that the draft regulations will be available before the early summer <e> <s> there will then be a period for further consultation <e> <s> we should then aim to lay the regulations before parliament in the autumn and the scheme could be brought into operation then <e> <s> or there might even be advantage in delaying its introduction until the beginning of the following financial year <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord that there will be further consultation <e> <s> i believe that it is better to deal with this matter without too much haste <e> <s> i trust that my explanation has satisfied the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me to explain what the government have in mind and i shall try to do so as briefly as i can <e> <s> under common law landlords are obliged to maintain their property in habitable or tenantable condition <e> <s> landlords may also have additional responsibilities with regard to repairs under the terms of their tenancy agreements with their tenants <e> <s> if a landlord fails to carry out a repair for which he is responsible after due notice from the tenant that the repair requires to be undertaken the tenant has a right at common law to withhold his rent until the repair has been completed unless such action is expressly excluded by the terms of his lease <e> <s> in appropriate circumstances the tenant can if he wishes carry out the repair himself and offset the cost against the rent retained <e>", "<cs> i am always a little apprehensive about arguing legal points with the noble lord but i have so often had it put to me both in this house and in another place that in legislation it is desirable <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has argued that the amendment would help poorer tenants and i certainly have some sympathy with this aim <e> <s> i believe however that there is an objection in principle to requiring the landlord to make payments direct to a contractor since it is the tenant who will be responsible for carrying out the repairs <e> <s> it seems to me only fair that if a tenant has undertaken to carry out a repair himself and is responsible for selecting and appointing a contractor and for supervising his work then the tenant should also be responsible for paying him <e> <s> the arrangements between a tenant and his contractor are a matter for them alone <e> <s> it is right that the landlords responsibility and therefore the payment should be to the tenant <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the amendment is designed to ensure that tenants have a clear idea of which repairs their landlord is responsible for and of whether they have the right to carry out a particular repair themselves under the new scheme <e> <s> it will of course be necessary to make clear in the regulations which repairs fall within the scope of the scheme and which do not <e> <s> it is our intention however to do this by means of broad descriptions of classes of repair which are excluded from the scheme rather than by means of a list of specific repairs for example the replacement of a door frame which are included <e> <s> the reasons for this are that there could be no guarantee that a specific list would be fully comprehensive and the nature of a specific repair can vary considerably according to the circumstances <e> <s> repair of a wall for example could cover anything from repairing a small hole in the roughcast to repairing a large crack caused by subsidence <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> he and i have exactly the same objective <e> <s> that is why we are determined to make it absolutely clear what can and what cannot be included <e> <s> but i remind him that this is an enabling power <e> <s> when they are produced the regulations will contain all the information which the noble lord lord carmichael seeks to have included <e> <s> but with respect it is unnecessary to include all this in the bill <e> <s> it will be included in the regulations <e> <s> i have tried to outline as clearly as i can how we are proceeding <e> <s> we are consulting as much as we possibly can <e> <s> we are waiting for observations on the consultation paper <e> <s> we shall take into account those observations and what has been said in another place and indeed here <e> <s> we seek to clarify the position beyond all doubt <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i think that i can help the noble lord <e> <s> landlords in scotland have a common law duty to keep their property in wind and watertight and in a tenantable and habitable condition <e> <s> in addition section of the housing scotland act requires landlords to keep the structure and exterior of their houses in good repair and to maintain in proper working order installations for the supply of gas electricity and water and for sanitation <e> <s> with these limited exceptions however the division of responsibility for repairs between the landlord and the tenant is entirely a matter for agreement between landlord and tenant <e> <s> practice varies considerably from district to district and even within districts where some tenants may be responsible for a particular type of repair while others are not <e> <s> some authorities for example exempt elderly or disabled tenants from responsibility for certain repairs <e> <s> it would not therefore be practical to attempt to list the repairs for which landlords are responsible in regulations which are to apply nationally <e> <s> tenants should be able to ascertain whether a particular repair is their responsibility or the responsibility of their landlord by reference to the terms of the written lease which their landlord is obliged to issue to them under section of the tenants rights act <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie had to say and to the contributions made by other noble lords <e> <s> however i do not accept that it would be appropriate to make the regulations setting up a right to repair subject to affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> generally speaking in recent years it has been the practice to restrict affirmative resolution procedure to cases where the powers are concerned with the alteration or definition of the extent of a statute or with the levying application or management of public money <e> <s> if too many instruments were made the subject of an affirmative resolution the purpose of delegating legislative power would be largely defeated by the time expended in directing the attention of your lordships house to the subordinate legislation <e>", "<cs> this new clause would require authorities to provide tenants with more and clearer information about their tenancies <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the aims of the amendment but i cannot accept that the administrative and financial burden for local authorities which would result from this amendment would be justified <e> <s> the act already requires authorities to provide tenants with a <e>", "<cs> as i explained at an earlier stage we shall have draft regulations by that time but i cannot give the noble lord any guarantee that we shall have the final regulations because when we produce the draft regulations we shall give an opportunity for further consultation <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would agree with that <e> <s> having received comments on the draft regulations we shall take those into account before producing the final regulations <e> <s> we shall therefore not have them within that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords comment but it still does not change my view that he is saying quite clearly however much he may try to disguise it that he is opposed to the additional discount which is being offered to council tenants who as i hope i shall be able to convince the house in due course have a very reasonable right to expect that they will be given such terms <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i shall try to deal with some of the points which have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove said that there is some difficulty over understanding exactly what is meant regarding the figure i mentioned of tenants <e> <s> i said that we estimated that the change to two years from three years will be of immediate benefit to some tenants who will be entitled to buy at the new basic discount of per cent <e> <s> i went on to say later that as i had indicated at committee stage we estimate that between and tenants will benefit from the overall increased discount if they choose to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have mentioned this point in connection with the comments of the noble lord lord carmichael because he asked at what discount the additional houses are to be sold to cover costs <e> <s> the authorities would require to sell an additional houses at the average discounted selling price <e> <s> that is the answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie is correct in respect of his figure of houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for moving his amendment so succinctly <e> <s> we have been round this course once already and have heard most of the arguments <e> <s> he rightly briefly refreshed our memories with the leading arguments that he has developed in the past <e> <s> i agree with him regarding the different types of housing <e> <s> there is sheltered housing in scotland and the basic feature of such housing is that it is provided with an alarm and a warden service <e> <s> sheltered housing may be built in a complex although that is not always the case <e> <s> i agree that there are not nearly enough sheltered housing complexes in scotland <e> <s> but sheltered housing has been excluded from the proposals from the outset <e> <s> it has never been the governments intention to sell sheltered housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am practising <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> i have not been persuaded by what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said <e> <s> but i do congratulate the noble lord on the ingenuity of the argument which he has advanced in support of his amendment <e> <s> i shall try to explain why i cannot accept the amendment and i hope that i may be able to convince the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house i should like to say that i did touch on that point but the noble lord may have missed it because i dealt with it along with a number of other matters <e> <s> local authorities are under the same obligation to house ex-tied tenants as any other applicant on their waiting list <e> <s> local authorities must publish their allocation policies and as far as we can see at present there is no particular reluctance on the part of the local authorities to house people because <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has explained that these amendments would provide that an islands council which wishes to refuse a request from for example a teacher to buy his house in a remote area should have to apply to the sheriff for permission to refuse to sell rather than to my right honourable friend the secretary of state as is proposed in the present clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could clear up a point with the noble lord he referred to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> are we discussing these together <e> <s> is that acceptable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not want to embark upon another amendment if we were not in fact talking about it at the same time <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> provides that the secretary of state shall make a scheme giving a secure tenant a right to carry out repairs and to be reimbursed <e> <s> it seeks to make the requirement to set up a scheme mandatory <e> <s> the present provision in the bill is by contrast an enabling power and it quite properly provides therefore that the secretary of state may make a scheme by regulations <e> <s> we believe that tenants should have this right as we made clear in our manifesto at the general election last june and we are at present consulting on the details of how such a scheme would operate <e> <s> but until we have worked out the details of the scheme it seems right that the power should be an enabling one <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the noble lord during the committee stage on almost all the points he has raised again during the report stage <e> <s> he knows as well as i do what the procedure is <e> <s> i explained it fully at that time but just to refresh his memory i shall tell him that consultations are taking place and have been taking place <e> <s> in due course drafting regulations will be compiled after account has been taken of the representations which are being made to the government rightly by the various bodies which are being consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very crafty <e> <s> he is always trying to get me to put a rope round my neck and i am not going to do that for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have the opportunity of seeing the draft regulations that assurance i can give him <e> <s> the last two amendments which the noble lord mentioned are those which he rightly says are drafting amendments <e> <s> i have looked at those amendments and i am sorry to tell the noble lord that i cannot accept them <e> <s> we had thought that a drafting amendment to the bill should be reasonably clear and easy to undertand much more so than in the case of many other bills we have to deal with very complex bills indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly entitled to his interpretation <e> <s> i have given my view in my opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and myself will be taking part in the committee stage <e>"]
