["<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that one of the sub-committees of the north atlantic assembly issues a bulletin which is full of useful information on this matter <e> <s> if the noble lord thought that it would be helpful i could arrange for some of those bulletins to be distributed here <e>", "<cs> my lords i entered another place in <e> <s> i spent years there and i have now spent years in your lordships house <e> <s> in all those years this mean little bill is the most reactionary that i have ever seen <e> <s> i do not think that it was improved this afternoon by the manner in which it was introduced <e> <s> we have from the minister the noble baroness lady young a hurried and theoretical explanation <e> <s> i found it extremely difficult to appreciate that she was talking about the education <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble and very good friend allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> i have been following him very well and agreeing with most of what he said but it is not true except of a very few local authorities that the situation changed when there was either a new labour or conservative local authority <e> <s> as i said in my speech in the period about which he is speaking there were many conservative and independent local authorities anxious to press ahead with comprehensive schools <e>", "<cs> it was a coalition <e>", "<cs> i feel that it would be better if the proposed words were included in the bill so as to make the position crystal clear <e> <s> the noble baroness may consider that the phrase managers or governors concerned means managers or governors of voluntary schools and we might understand that but i wonder what the courts might understand it to mean in the future <e> <s> we all know that in the past year or two various parts of the education act have been brought before the courts and the judges have ruled that certain matters that for many years we had thought to be so were not legal <e> <s> it would not in any way alter the purpose of the bill if the words that my noble friend proposes were included <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend i do not want to repeat my speech on second reading but i fully agree that we should oppose this clause <e> <s> when i spoke earlier in the debate i had not heard some speeches from noble lords opposite <e> <s> what my noble friend lord donaldson said on another amendment is quite true there are two points of view on the opposite side of the committee <e> <s> there is the view of some noble lords like the <e>", "<cs> because of the way in which the marshalled list has been drawn up with three clauses put together and the names at the top my name is added as supporting this new clause but in fact i signed every one of the amendments except this one <e> <s> i do not blame anybody these things happen but i want to explain why i did not sign this particular amendment <e> <s> it is not because i disagree with my noble friends intentions to try to make transfers more satisfactory but because i believe there is no satisfactory method <e> <s> i have never come across any satisfactory method of transferring children from secondary modern schools to grammar schools <e> <s> in fact i do not think there is one <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not being in your lordships chamber when this amendment was moved <e> <s> however i was under the impression that there was to be a debate on the finance bill and that eight noble lords were to speak in that debate <e> <s> that being so i thought that i had time for a cup of tea before the report stage of the education bill began <e> <s> it will be remembered that when we discussed the committee stage of the bill my name was attached to all of the amendments except the one about transfers <e> <s> i explained during the committee stage that this was because it was very difficult to devise any satisfactory method of transfers <e> <s> i hope that transfers no matter how easy they become will not be regarded as an answer to the -plus separation which takes place <e> <s> it was for that reason that i did not put down my name to that amendment <e> <s> however this is a rather different amendment from the one which we had before us during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount give way <e> <s> is not everything he is saying now the greatest argument that i have heard for a long time in favour of the comprehensive schools <e>", "<cs> my lords since the committee last met in will the noble lord say whether or not the object of closing it clown was financial <e> <s> would he <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the ministers statement that the government cannot afford to spend taxpayers money on the steel industry can the noble lord tell us how much of the taxpayers money will be spent and wasted if this strike continues for an interminable time <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak about the content of this bill i should like to say a word about its arrangement <e> <s> for two or three years i represented this side of your lordships house on the renton committee on the preparation of legislation a committee which had to try to produce ways in which bills could be made more simple and easier to understand <e> <s> we have as the noble baroness said had the great education act and several minor ones and now this one and looking at the schedules repeals alterations and amendments it is going to be difficult indeed for those who wish to see what the education law is to find their way through the multiplicity of acts <e> <s> this could have been one bill that the government could have prepared which might have taken into consideration one of the recommendations of the renton committee that is to rewrite the whole bill with parts of it in italics <e> <s> i am sure it will not be long before the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack will come along to your lordships house with a bill entitled education consolidation bill <e> <s> it is indeed difficult to find where we are with these many acts <e>", "<cs> if my noble friends amendment is accepted is not the noble baroness assuming that it will be the duty of local education authorities to provide nursery schools or classes for all children who wish to attend <e> <s> whereas if my noble friends amendment is accepted it will simply say <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a rather mild amendment <e> <s> it does not lay down that the local authorities must appoint certain people <e> <s> it just says <e>", "<cs> my lords this is muddled <e> <s> i am afraid this bill makes the position even more muddled <e> <s> this subsection legalises a practice which has been in operation for many years <e> <s> this is the first time that it has actually been made a part of the law <e> <s> everybody knows that in the past some parents have fought as my noble friend lord stewart said to save our grammar schools in the belief that their particular child would be one of the per cent <e> <s> who were going to go to a grammar school and not one of the per cent <e> <s> for whom a grammar school was not available <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one point clear <e> <s> the matters in the list were not in order of merit <e> <s> will the minister be sending out advice to local authorities and if so will she ask them to include in their list the five items which i have set out since she seems to agree that they are most important <e>", "<cs> my lords with that assurance and perhaps the minister could at some future time let us know what has happened about this matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i made it perfectly clear during the second reading debate that i consider this clause to be the worst part of a very bad bill <e> <s> however like the noble vis <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she answer my question about the report which according to reports in newspapers is at the department of education and science and which is not to be published before june <e> <s> will she say whether or not the reports in newspapers are correct when they say that in fact this report says that bright children do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is assumed that all these schools cater for children of high academic ability <e> <s> it may be that among those schools there are some of that kind but surely a lot of them do not cater for children of high academic ability but for the children of parents who can afford to pay the fees <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord mansfield was quite correct when he said at the beginning that he assumed this was a probing <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord the minister rather missing the point in that what is happening is that the government are keeping local authorities short of money and driving them to cut discretionary grants and many other things <e> <s> is not this another example of taking the burden away from taxation and putting it on to local authorities through rates and the rates are a very unfair form of taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that those of us who were members of this committee and who spent several arduous years on it are very pleased to hear that such progress is being made <e> <s> will he not further agree that if some of the other recommendations were put into operation it would mean that there would not be such a need for consolidation in future years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the city of leeds adopted the ark royal as their particular ship and had great association with the men and the officers who served on her <e> <s> i am sure the citizens will feel sad at the rather ignominious end of this great warship <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support my noble friend who has just spoken <e> <s> as he said during the second reading debate the noble lord lord broadbridge raised this matter and then when it came to the winding-up the noble lord lord bellwin said that because the noble lord lord broad-bridge was not present he would write to him <e> <s> like my noble friend who has just spoken i appreciate that the noble lord lord bellwin had a great many points to which he had to reply <e> <s> nevertheless a number of us would have been interested to see what was in that letter <e>", "<cs> my lords after the brilliantly devastating speech made by my noble friend lord stewart of fulham there is very little left to add from these benches <e> <s> i have listened with interest to the speech which we have just heard from the noble lord lord james whom <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked particularly about the -year-olds <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the fact that the suggestion is being made that old people should spend their lives sitting in armchairs wrapped in electric blankets a sad reflection on life in the s under a tory government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say how many children are receiving school meals now <e> <s> while she said that million were receiving school meals i did not hear her say what the figure was today <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that this practice will i create an invidious distinction within the schools between those children whose parents can afford to provide books and those whose parents cannot afford to buy them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me whether or not what she has mentioned applies to literature distributed at the school gates <e> <s> is she aware that only a few days ago i came across an instance where fascist literature was being distributed by people at the gates of a comprehensive school in my area <e> <s> what is the legal position in such a case <e>", "<cs> i think it is rather difficult to discuss these two amendments separately i was rather hoping that they would be taken together <e> <s> as i understand the amendment which we are now discussing it concerns the suitability of the buildings where the child is to go which is also the case with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i occupied the position now occupied by the noble baroness lady young i had to deal as i am sure she has to deal now with disagreements which arose between parents and local authorities regarding the education of their children <e> <s> i always found that so far as physically handicapped children were concerned the difficulty lay not so much with the child as with the building to which the child was supposed to go <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not intend to repeat the speech which i made on a previous amendment but to the noble lord on the other side of the committee who raised the question of expense i should like to say <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may just take up one point <e> <s> i did not make the point about an ordinary school becoming perhaps a special school in order to oppose this amendment but rather to say that wherever possible any ordinary school should be so fitted and built as to take handicapped children if they can benefit from the education there and to ensure that the area is not so big that the school would become a special school and indeed it does not say only one school in one area <e> <s> if we read this amendment properly it says <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that i was in washington at the time of the murder of lord mountbatten that i was absolutely appalled at some of the inverviews that took place on the very day of his funeral and that the position is now very much worse than it was then <e> <s> would he not agree that while there are quite a number of people in the united states who do not understand our position on the other hand there are a great many people some in high places senators and congressmen who understand very well but choose to mislead the people because of the effect on their electors <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little i need add after the important arguments advanced by my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> i suggest that it is dangerous for any act of parliament to leave the minister absolute discretion <e> <s> if the clause is left as drafted it will mean that the measure will <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain your lordships house very long because i know that there is other important business to come <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords it was in which does not appear to me to be years ago but it is when i was asked to help to shadow home office affairs on the front bench in another place <e> <s> the metamorphosis from shadow to substance occurred in when for three years i was minister of state at the home office <e> <s> this was a time when the childrens department was at the home office and not in the department of health and social security as it is today <e>", "<cs> understood what the noble baroness said my lords and while i may be wrong my impression was that that was the whole reason for setting up community homes <e> <s> be that as it may we have tried approved schools detention centres borstals and young persons prisons <e> <s> now borstals are to be abolished and we shall be setting up some new youth custodial centres <e> <s> the bill tells us who will be sent to them and for what period but i am more interested in what will happen inside those centres the kind of institutions they will be and the regime inside them <e> <s> i have visited many borstals detention centres and prisons <e> <s> i was never very happy about borstals <e> <s> each was trying to do a job of work but i was never certain that the governor ever knew quite what that job was <e> <s> i remember visiting one which was being run on the lines of the rather third-rate public school and it did not seem to fit in with the environment from which the boys had come <e>", "<cs> may i emphasise what my noble friend lady wootton has said <e> <s> there is overcrowding in nearly every prison in the country but the overcrowding in the local prisons such as leeds is very <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i get his figures right <e> <s> did he say that there were under-s in remand centres and in local prisons or was it a total of <e>", "<cs> i was interested in what was said by the noble baroness lady macleod of borve <e> <s> at one point however she confused remand homes and remand centres <e> <s> she also said that her court is able to send the most serious offenders to prison <e> <s> in our part of the world and in other parts too maybe it does not happen like that <e> <s> there is a remand centre some miles out of leeds which is on the same site as an open prison <e> <s> the reason why young people are sent into the most appalling conditions in leeds prison i am pleased that the noble lord the minister has seen the appalling conditions there is not because they are the most severe offenders but because the remand centre is full and there is nowhere else to send them so they have to go into leeds prison on remand <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord recall that we did have detention centres for girls and that it was because they were so unsatisfactory that we decided to close them and not send any more girls to detention centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the amendment moved by my noble friend but i am not very happy about the suggestion of the noble lord lord donaldson that it would be a good thing to leave out the four experimental centres what are called but are really not short sharp shock detention centres <e> <s> after all when the original detention centres were first set up there they were supposed to be for a short sharp shock <e> <s> i know several of them <e> <s> we are having the experiment now in four of them but there seems to be no difference between those detention centres which are not in the experiment and those which are <e> <s> what i should like to know from the noble lord is where does the rgime in the four experimental centres differ from the rgime in the other detention centres <e> <s> i have a feeling that there is not much difference at all and if there is not much difference there is no point in leaving these out <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment but i think we must go a little further than the noble baroness lady faithfull has gone and see what the alternatives are <e> <s> at the moment psychiatric hospitals and centres for young people are under the jurisdiction of the department of health and social security <e> <s> i raised this matter during the second reading debate and i must thank the noble lord lord elton for the letter which he sent to me about it <e> <s> but it does not clear up the difficulty which i am in and i think the noble lord realises that it does not go as far as perhaps it ought to go <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton has not mentioned the special centres about which he spoke at report stage when he told me that these were being used for this purpose <e> <s> i wonder how much of what he said today fits into the special centres and where they stand <e> <s> i asked him before and did not get a very clear answer who was really responsible for <e>", "<cs> my lords if what the noble lord lord trefgarne says is right that early diagnosis is really of no use does it not lead one to the conclusion that it is useless having any operations at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord the minister has misunderstood me <e> <s> what i intended to ask was does this mean that any breast cancer operation is useless <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the minister say that they had consulted the national association of teachers <e> <s> did he really mean that <e> <s> did he mean the national union of teachers <e> <s> if not has the national union of teachers been consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we have all listened with interest to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> as he knows i have been listening to him for a very long time both here and in another place and his speeches are usually quite entertaining <e> <s> but as usual i found some of his arguments difficult to understand <e> <s> i was very surprised that he brought in the fact that some of us who live in the north of england and come to london are using london transport and getting part of the subsidy that is being paid by londoners <e> <s> surely that happens all over <e> <s> i suppose that i am paying rates in yorkshire and other people coming from other parts of the country get the benefit <e> <s> but i was very surprised indeed to hear him put forward the argument that visitors from abroad are coming here and taking part of the ratepayers money in london <e> <s> i should have thought that the enormous amount that is brought in to commerce industry shopkeepers and hoteliers by foreign visitors to london far outweighs anything that they take out in subsidies from london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords we might agree with that if the government provided more subsidies to local authorities <e> <s> but if i may make the few remarks which i want to make i admit at the outset that i am not an expert in all the intricacies of public transport <e> <s> but i have lived the whole of my life in west yorkshire i know the area and its people and i realise the problems that they face <e> <s> i have had the advantage of representing the centre of the very great and busy city of leeds <e>", "<cs> and living to miles away in a small mining town so i know the people of west yorkshire <e> <s> although the transport problems in some of the areas of west yorkshire are quite different from those in other areas having studied the bill and the report of the proceedings in another place it is clear to me that this bill could have an adverse effect on transport in all areas of west yorkshire the cities the small townships the country areas and so on because it takes away local financial control and it seems inevitable that this will lead to a decline in transport services <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question which was asked about the police may i ask whether the noble lord is aware of this aspect <e> <s> it is not only the cost of the police involved but the fact that on saturdays in areas round cities and in areas a long way <e>", "<cs> it will be remembered that during the second reading of this bill i raised this question of childrens fares <e> <s> as my noble friend lord underhill has said it is not just a question of the fares of children who are travelling to school although it is partly that because while some children travelling to school are entitled to free fares others have to pay <e> <s> as i said on <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the most well trained teachers cannot be really efficient if at the end of their training they are teaching very big classes <e> <s> does he not remember i am sure he does that when he was chairman of the primary school committee of the north riding county council and i was the minister he came to me <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the difficulties the difficulty to which my noble friend lady masham of ilton referred some time ago namely that if a hospital which is giving specialised treatment is open to an area much wider than the area which the health authority covers the cost has to come out of the total amount of money allocated to that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain your lordships house for more than two minutes to make just one short but i believe very important point it is one which has already been touched on in general terms by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> during the second reading debate i said tht people south of watford those who live in the greater london area neither knew nor understood the problems and difficulties of the metropolitan counties in the north of england <e> <s> i come from west yorkshire which is a totally different area from the greater london area and there we have problems of great rural areas which they do not have here in london <e> <s> yet during the second reading and the committee and report stages we heard speech after speech from the opposite side of the chamber about how spendthrift are the greater london council <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say this <e> <s> i am not a ratepayer of the greater london council <e> <s> it is the concern of the ratepayers of the greater london council what the greater london council does <e> <s> but i am a ratepayer of west yorkshire county council and our powers to determine what happens in west yorkshire have been taken away from us because the government think they have to bring the greater london council to heel <e> <s> that is the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether or not over the years there have been sporadic outbursts of this disease in places other than leeds and whether looked at over the past few years leeds is any worse than any other place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that as i have lived the whole of my life within two or three miles of stanley royd hospital i realise only too well the appalling tragedy which happened in our area and the suffering not only of the patients but of the relatives of patients who were in the hospital at the time <e> <s> is the noble baroness also aware that i am personally acquainted with the doctors nurses patients and others at the hospital and in spite of this tragedy i feel that the patients are receiving all the medical care and attention from doctors and nurses which they would receive in other hospitals <e>"]
