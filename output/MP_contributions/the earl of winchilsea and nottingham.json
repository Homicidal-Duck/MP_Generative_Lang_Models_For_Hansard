["<cs> my lords in rising to support this bill introduced by my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley i crave the indulgence of the house <e> <s> briefly i should like to bring to the attention of your lordships similar legislation passed years ago in the state of oregon in the united states and touch on the consequences of their bottle bill on the environment on manufacturers and on consumers <e> <s> oregon is approximately the same size as west germany with a resident population of about million but with an annual tourist influx of roughly million <e> <s> it contains some of the most <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for his most courteous and brief reply i wonder whether he can throw a small amount of additional light on this topic for me <e> <s> can he confirm that this has in no way been used or in no way in the future could be used for the burying of any level of nuclear waste <e> <s> in other words could this research be at any time used in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord the minister for his somewhat optimistic reply is he aware that it is the considered opinion of the record industry which i share that unless legislation is introduced during the session the enormous contribution that this important and influential industry makes not only to our balance of payments but also to our position as a world leader in the variety and quality of its products and which is already seriously reduced will be subjected to further very serious reductions <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether british nuclear fuels limited are still using the leaky flasks which were identified as being the subject of a secret report months ago as detailed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord layton on his maiden speech but like the noble lord lord willis i find that i am unable to agree with much contained in it <e> <s> many noble lords will already have studied the governments white paper having followed parliamentary debates and various helpful research papers and will be familiar with the figures which show such a drastic decline in cinema attendance from an average of billion at the introduction of the voluntary levy to million in when it became statutory thereafter falling steadily until we are faced now with a figure of million <e> <s> the reasons for this trend are obvious <e> <s> with the growth of home television the introduction of colour television satellite communications the development of the video industry and the advent of all the new information and communication technology it was clear that the film industry would suffer and its income threatened and put out of balance <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the bill i should like to direct my remarks to possible fund-raising methods in addition to those proposed by the government which could quite easily be employed to assist the funding of british films <e> <s> in there were over billion individual viewings of films transmitted by all four television channels <e> <s> this staggering figure is based on reasonably accurate rating mechanisms that are used by television companies to work out the number of viewers watching a particular programme <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to various noble lords for their comments particularly to the noble lord lord somers when he said that every taxi driver is against deregulation <e> <s> i am convinced that this is in fact true <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for the point that he made <e> <s> he brought to the attention of the committee the situation in liverpool where the local council in effect deregulated thereby permitting the number of taxis to jump from to round about now i think he said <e> <s> this has resulted in a certain amount of i suppose physical chaos in liverpool as well as <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i make a brief contribution <e> <s> perhaps i can supply the noble lord the minister with the number of years that this subject has been under discussion by various governments <e> <s> i think it is for at least years that it has been promised <e> <s> it will be very helpful if something is coming <e> <s> all i should like to say is that london has the best licensed taxi system anywhere in the free world <e> <s> there was a recent article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it may be appropriate at this stage to announce my intention not to press my own amendment in view of what has already taken place <e> <s> i should also like to mention one or two matters which i feel ought to have an airing the most important of which is the current situation in liverpool where deregulation has in fact already taken place in all but name and where the number of licensed taxis has risen from just over to now just over <e> <s> this has caused the chief constable of merseyside a great deal of unhappiness and in his annual report he confirms the situation but is not really able to do anything about it <e> <s> the situation in liverpool is really quite dire not just because of the taxis as we all know but taxis constitute some part of the total situation and the public are at great risk <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be appropriate at this time to remind the house of something that i said at the committee stage of this bill which is that every government since the late s has promised separate reviews and legislation concerning the taxi and hire car industry and it would be very nice to know that this government actually mean what they say and will honour that promise <e> <s> the other comment i should like to make is to remind the noble earl that the liberal party is a very broad church indeed with our sdp allies it is becoming even broader and there are many shades of opinion which flourish and are housed under its roof <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from any constitutional matters or any <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said aggetts quarry is nearly worked out in any case <e> <s> the people who work there have been offered alternative employment at meldon quarry <e> <s> i thought that was a point worth restating <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of seriously irritating the house for which if i do i apologise as the clock is advancing i should like to thank the noble viscount the minister for the many assurances he has given to the house <e> <s> i should like also to say that i agree with everything the noble lord lord peyton has just said <e> <s> i feel that this order is going to make betting shops more attractive and therefore it will lessen the number of people who might like a day out at the races <e> <s> conditions on our racecourses really are getting nastier and people generally are not very well catered for there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for providing me with the opportunity of bringing to the attention of the house the specific case of the country of morocco <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the bill i should like to confine my remarks to two subjects both of which are of great concern to the record industry and which are not contained in the bill much to everyones surprise <e> <s> i should also like clarification from the government on clause which the noble lord lord morton mentioned <e> <s> i shall return to that point <e>", "<cs> i am mindful of the plea made to the house by the government chief whip and i shall do my best to comply with his wishes <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord has a very long telephone answering machine tape <e> <s> i understood that the levy would apply only on tapes of over -minutes duration <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords as prime mover of amendment no <e> <s> with the noble lord lord jenkin of roding i should like to say how eloquently he has put the case for this rental right which the government i am pleased to say have recognised as being a potential danger to the record industry <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord willis for what he said when he last rose to his feet <e>", "<cs> my lords many people myself included believe that israel deceived the united nations at the time of its admission to that body <e> <s> israel has never honoured the obligations clearly stated and agreed to by her at that time <e> <s> i refer to general assembly resolutions and in particular resolution which concerns itself with the territory and boundaries of the arab and jewish states the city of jerusalem the holy places and minority rights resolution which stipulated that all palestinian refugees be repatriated and the additional violation of resolutions and under which jerusalem remained an international zone <e> <s> furthermore in launching the wars of and israel has continued to flout the principles of the un charter and international law <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the bill and also to congratulate the noble lord lord nugent on introducing it <e> <s> i should like also to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord cobbold on his excellent maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he not aware however that the police federation is extremely concerned about this matter <e> <s> does he not agree that police confidence in this governments obligation to honour recommendations in the edmund-davies report which was undertaken in is being seriously undermined <e> <s> does he not further agree that the change-over from a domestic rate system to the community charge is being used as an excuse to stand down from that obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most encouraged by some of the remarks and sentiments expressed by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> however i have serious doubts and reservations concerning clause of the bill <e> <s> the promoters wish to use its proposals regarding the licensing of private hire vehicles to implement the adoption of part ii of the local government miscellaneous provisions act in london in line with the rest of england and wales <e> <s> but they fail to appreciate that as concerns the licensing of private hire vehicles and hackney carriages london is unique and cannot be lumped together with the provinces <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house because my name is not on the list of speakers <e> <s> i indicated my desire to speak in this debate but due to an oversight or problem my name was not included <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord tordoff and the noble lord lord underhill for their support <e> <s> i listened carefully to the minister <e> <s> i agree about not widening the proposal to include aviation <e> <s> it would certainly be a waste of time for police constables to search ladies handbags and so on <e> <s> that is why i did not include such a provision <e> <s> however having listened to what the minister said i feel that it may well be the wish of the noble lord lord bethell to return to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
