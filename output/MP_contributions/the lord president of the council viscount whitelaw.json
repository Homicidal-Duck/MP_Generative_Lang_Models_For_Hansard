his intention of retiring from the office of clerk of the parliaments with effect from the beginning of the summer recess <e> <s> my noble friend said then that an appropriate opportunity would be afforded to the house to pay tribute to sir peters services and it is in order to provide that opportunity that i now move to resolve <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to make a brief statement <e> <s> it is my sad duty to have to tell the house of the death of john webb who since has been the fourth clerk at the table and head of the judicial office <e> <s> i am sure the

hope that he will take advantage of what my noble friend has said about discussing these matters further with him and i hope he will realise that to continue too far on these lines imposes a considerable burden on this house <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i gave very careful consideration to the private notice question submitted to me by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s>

noble friend the minister of state that he was to raise this matter <e> <s> equally i accept that it is an important matter to be raised <e> <s> as the noble lord declared an interest perhaps i should

of it <e> <s> i should say that i have been a strong supporter of televising parliament both this house and another place since it was mooted in when i was on the losing side by one vote <e> <s> on

to this point <e> <s> what my noble friend said was of course correct <e> <s> equally i accept what noble lords have said and how they feel that in constitutional terms when another place has passed regulations it is the normal practice of this house not to vote against those regulations <e> <s> perhaps i could at the same time make it clear as i believe my noble friend was seeking to do to the noble lord lord shinwell and others that far from not paying attention to the house <e> <s> it is my job as leader of the house and i accept it absolutely to pay strict attention to what this house says and to the votes on that particular occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies may i point out that there is a point of procedure to which the noble lord lord bruce of donington referred and which i believe calls for my reply <e> <s> it concerns the question of the availability of the statement to which i attach the very greatest importance i have made very considerable representations to my colleagues in another place on this <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime minister has asked me to take responsibility for co-ordinating the presentation of government policy in

have the opportunity to pay tributes to the noble lord at the beginning of business tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords as leader of the house it falls to me to pay tribute to the memory of the noble lord lord byers whose sudden death yesterday came as such a shock to me and to your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord became a member of this house in having already achieved distinction in several fields <e> <s> while still at oxford he won renown as an athlete and held the british universities record for the -yard hurdles as well as taking part in several international athletic meetings <e>", "<cs>

that we are now taking too long on questions and it is my duty to point that out <e> <s> of course i rely on the good sense of noble lords to achieve some shortening of the period that we are now taking <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a ministerial responsibility to answer questions about donations to the conservative party but whether or not the figure quoted by the noble lord were confirmed

celebration but the government would be prepared to consider this matter if there were evidence of widespread interest in both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain nostalgia for me in taking part in a debate on industrial training <e> <s> some years ago as parliamentary secretary to the old ministry of labour i helped to pilot an industrial training bill through the house of commons <e>

requirement on employers who did not train themselves to contribute financially through industrial training boards <e> <s> it was indeed a first step and that is why it was thought to be a bold one <e> <s> today of course after the years that have elapsed it looks a puny and inadequate measure <e> <s> it was however something that went some way at that time and for the first time to meet the chronic shortage of skilled manpower from which this country has so often suffered and if we are not careful may very well suffer again <e> <s> since that time i am glad to say the requirement for skill training and the national responsibility of the government and of employers for its provision has been increasingly recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords ministerial statements are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the emotions aroused by this question and this particular problem <e> <s> i could perhaps give some instances myself which might match those of the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> but that would not help the business of the house <e> <s> we have taken minutes on three questions <e> <s> i would ask noble lords whether we may continue now with business because questions have been taking a long time <e>", "<cs> it was very good anyway my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question will be very carefully looked at <e> <s> i hope that the house will feel in view of the feelings recently expressed about the time taken in repeating statements that while this is the most important statement and one which quite properly the house will take considerable notice of minutes is a reasonable time to have given to it and the other debate which has been interrupted should now advance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as a keen student of whipping in another place i am very interested to learn the many different facets of it in this house <e> <s> it is very educational for me and no doubt for all your lordships <e> <s> i have no doubt that no one has done better in his education than my noble friend the chief whip but i think that we should not perhaps ask him now to weary with overmuch well-doing <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i am going to be an exception which proves the rule in this case <e> <s> i ought to be saying that the questions are taking a very long time <e> <s> but i am going to do something quite different <e> <s> i think it will be reasonable

friend the prime minister about the visit of the south african prime minister and the foreign minister on saturday nd june the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord excuse me <e> <s> he had a good go earlier this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps he would excuse us from any further goes just for a short time <e> <s> may we go to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords before i

my duty to reply in detail to many of the points made in this very important debate <e> <s> my one comment would be this <e> <s> if i were the noble lord lord graham of edmonton i do not think i would bother too much playing around with trying to knock the liberals down so hard because after all in life i always try to attract those people who might vote for me <e> <s> over the time i have been in this house i have never been aware of the liberal party voting for any other than the labour party <e> <s> so that i must say it seems rather surprising that they seek so much to distance themselves from the labour party and that the labour party try so much to distance themselves from them <e> <s> it is very interesting because when it comes to the matter of a vote i have not noticed that distance <e> <s> perhaps i am going to be rewarded soon and when i am i shall be interested to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important for me as leader of this house to answer that particular question <e> <s> we had this question which came up once <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not appear to be too much like a schoolmaster if i point out that we have taken minutes on questions so far <e> <s> while recognising that the questions were important and that there were some very important points to be put i hope that we shall not consider it a precedent for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the noble viscount is not this afternoon <e> <s> it is minutes since we started questions and the noble viscounts point is rather wide of the original question <e> <s> perhaps he would come back to it another day <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect to the noble lord he has had his say but i think he must know that it has absolutely nothing to do with the question that was asked <e>", "<cs> perhaps i shall fail on this occasion as i failed on the last because i understand that it is a somewhat complex procedure <e> <s> however i think that technically the truth is that the amendment really falls and therefore it is probably correct that my noble friend should withdraw it at this stage <e>", "<cs> none my lords <e> <s> the powers which this house possesses are considerable but it has in the past exercised them with restraint as indeed i hope that it will in the future <e> <s> this restraint has been self-imposed and i suspect that any attempt by the leader of the house for the time being to impose a code of practice to regulate the position would be neither welcome nor effective <e>", "<cs> my lords in substitution for my noble friend lord gowrie i shall give the answer to my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> in the three banking months to the end of banking may m grew by per cent <e> <s> on annualised rate psl by per

targeted bank lending and that psl and m are no longer target aggregates <e> <s> m and m the target aggregates are growing satisfactorily against the ranges set for them at budget time <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house if i were to make a very brief statement about the local government interim provisions bill <e> <s> the government have decided to table an amendment to the bill at the report stage to the effect that the present members of the greater london council and the metropolitan county councils will continue in office until but without elections next year <e> <s> at the same time further provisions will be introduced to prevent unreasonable actions by the outgoing authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which has just been moved by the noble baroness deals with elections to be held to the glc and the metropolitan county councils in may <e> <s> on th july i told the house that the government proposed to introduce amendments providing for the existing members of the greater london council and metropolitan county councils to continue in office but

opportunity for us to pay tribute to the noble lord in the house itself <e>", "<cs> my lords before i answer the noble lords question perhaps i may refer to the fact that it was exactly years ago

library of the house <e> <s> i cannot guarantee that this system will work to the satisfaction of all your lordships but i hope it will meet the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is an nstarred question on this very subject on the order paper for next tuesday i think that we have probably taken up enough time on it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my

to do and as the house expects <e> <s> surely i am entitled to do that <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord must be that questions are a matter for noble lords <e> <s> however if i were to hazard a view based on the noises that i have heard recently in the house and the looks on many noble lords faces i would say that i think this subject is becoming a little bit tedious and perhaps the noble
