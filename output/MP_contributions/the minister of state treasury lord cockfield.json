["<cs> my lords during the last two years there have been a number of debates in your lordships house on economic affairs productivity innovation and other apsects of our economic life and fortune <e> <s> those debates have been of a uniformly high standard and have contributed to public enlightenment and to a deeper understanding of the issues involved <e> <s> todays debate has followed in that tradition <e> <s> so many points have been raised that i hope i may be forgiven if i speak at somewhat greater length than i had originally intended <e>", "<cs> my lords these are difficult and complex matters and we are singularly fortunate in having the select committee of your lordships house to examine them and report upon them with such clarity in the report which is before us <e> <s> we were also singularly <e>", "<cs> no my lords vat is a broad-based tax on consumer expenditure and reliefs can only be justified on the most stringent criteria <e> <s> it would not be appropriate to exclude the hotel industry from the vat increase announced in the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a major concern of the government to improve public understanding of the general economic context of their policies and of the consequences of pay increases of different magnitudes <e> <s> in particular i would draw the attention of noble lords to the desire which we expressed in our manifesto for <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place in answer to a private notice question on reductions in public expenditure <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am arranging to have the relevant figures available published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters are under constant review <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think it appropriate for her majestys government to be publish <e>", "<cs> my lords our present economic difficulties are due in no small measure to an excessive level of public expenditure <e> <s> we must tackle this problem <e> <s> we are determined to do so <e> <s> we have the support of the public and we shall continue to enjoy that support <e> <s> we want a better future for all of our people but we will only secure it by harder work and greater productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer has noted my noble friends suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kaldor for tabling this motion <e> <s> it provides me with the opportunity not simply of defending the governments policy but of demonstrating that however hard and stony the road may be the governments policy does offer real hope for the future and there is no alternative policy which could offer that hope or indeed any hope at all <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted the suggestion of my noble friend but the general preference of her majestys government is to concentrate on tax reductions across the board which would help everybody rather than to extend selective reliefs of this kind <e> <s> the corresponding value of the concession compared with would be about p <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted the noble lords suggestion but i am unable to antitipate the budget proposals of my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason is to raise revenue <e> <s> the total revenue from confectionery ice cream soft drinks and other products of this kind which are subject to value added tax is estimated to be about million per annum and for confectionery alone about million <e> <s> i think my noble friend will recognise that the government could not forgo revenue of this order without making good the loss in other ways <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> neither exemption nor zero rating of agricultural fertilisers would save administrative costs and might indeed increase them <e> <s> this is because most manufacturers of fertiliser would become partially exempt traders with all the additional complications which that involves <e> <s> nor would exemption he in the interests of the farmer himself because it would mean that some tax would be included in the cost of fertilisers and could not he reclaimed against output tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are conscious that silversmiths and other craftsmen using precious metals face difficulties as a result of the unprecedented rise in the price of these materials <e> <s> silver articles which are exported are of course zero rated <e> <s> so far as the home market is concerned i do not think the fact that an article is expensive is a good reason for excluding it from tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord lord byers for tabling this motion which gives us an opportunity of looking both at the strategy underlying my right honourable friends budget and also the detailed proposals that he put forward last week <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord says that the battle against inflation lies at the heart of the budget strategy and we are grateful to him for his support in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords between them the two revenue departments employ a total staff of <e> <s> these resources need to be deployed in the most effective manner and due priority is given to tackling tax evasion <e> <s> both revenue departments have in fact scored significant successes in this field in recent years <e> <s> thus in the case of the inland revenue the amount recovered as a result of specific investigation work has increased nearly four-fold in the last three years while in the case of the customs and excise undeclared vat recovered as a result of control visits has almost doubled over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in interest rates throughout the industrial world reflects the upsurge of inflation and the collective determination of governments to tackle it by tight monetary policies <e> <s> high interest rates will continue to be necessary so long as inflationary pressures remain <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made no assumption about the rate of inflation in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that united kingdom industry generally is facing tough competition in both home and overseas markets <e> <s> the best way that the government can help industry is to stick to their policy of strict monetary control and reducing public sector borrowing <e> <s> this is the only sure and sustainable way of reducing inflation and bringing down interest rates <e> <s> but it is equally important that industry should restrain the increase in its own costs and in particular that the level of pay settlements should be brought down to a more reasonable level <e>", "<cs> my lords the imfs role is to provide balance-of-payments assistance to its members and to help them take whatever corrective measures are needed to adjust their economies <e> <s> assistance from the fund is essentially of a temporary nature and this means that the fund must ensure by the imposition of conditions where necessary that advances are repaid <e> <s> the funds guidelines were revised in march and in the light of this her majestys government do not consider that any special initiative on their part is called for <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might be forgiven if i bring the debate back to the subject matter of the motion placed upon the order paper by the noble lord lord lever of manchester which relates to the governments monetary policy <e> <s> i notice that in his maiden speech which i greatly regret to say that i missed because i was out of the country at the time the noble lord lord lever said <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> simply writing on a banknote is not an offence and it would be impracticable to make it one as it would be unenforceable <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all greatly indebted to my noble friend lord ohagan for giving us the opportunity of debating these important matters <e> <s> it is of course of particular interest to listen to somebody who is actually involved in the budgetary process in the european parliament telling us exactly and precisely what went on <e> <s> what he has told us this evening is of course ample justification for the existence of the dual mandate <e> <s> we look forward to hearing from him again on many occasions to keep us in close touch with what is going on in europe <e> <s> the debate also provides us with the opportunity of discussing the report of the select committee of your lordships house on the budget of the community and it is to this that i propose directing my remarks rather than pursuing the broad anti-european line deployed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> we owe a real debt of gratitude to the select committee and particular to sub-committee a both for their vigilance and their penetrating analysis <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are responsible for pay negotiations only in respect of their own employees <e> <s> so far as the private sector and the rest of the public sector are concerned this is a matter for the respective managements who are subject to the disciplines of the market place and where appropriate of cash limits and the like <e> <s> but all negotiators whether in the private or the public sector need to remember that excessive settlements mean higher unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the present money supply target range was announced in the budget speech on th march <e> <s> forecasts of output were published on the same day in the <e>", "<cs> my lords rates of interest charged to individual borrowers are a matter for the banks themselves <e> <s> the best service the government can give is to maintain their present policies which will bring down inflation and allow progressive reductions in inter <e>", "<cs> my lords the reduction in minimum lending rate was justified by the current and prospective trend of monetary developments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in doing so perhaps i might start by saying that the financial privilege of another place has the incidental advantage that your lordships are not required to examine this bill in detail <e> <s> it is a long and complex bill although not as long as the housing bill which has recently occupied so much of your lordships time and not as complex as some finance bills in the past have been <e> <s> nevertheless if any of your lordships wish to raise specific points on the bill i shall be happy to deal with them when i come to reply to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the achievement of the governments target for money supply growth is central to their policies for bringing down the rate of inflation <e> <s> while no target is set for bank lending as such growth in bank lending to the private sector is one of the factors influencing money supply growth <e> <s> accordingly the governments interest rate and other policies are directed at ensuring that such growth is compatible with the money supply target <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the commissions estimates the total refunds due to the united kingdom in respect of the budget amount to some million <e> <s> the precise arrangements for payment of these refunds and the timing are currently under negotiation with other member states <e> <s> but my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary is pressing at todays foreign affairs council for the earliest possible agreement on the regulations governing these refunds <e> <s> the government expect to receive the bulk of the sums due by st march <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not publish <e>", "<cs> my lords this was essentially a technical measure related to the structure of bank balance sheets <e> <s> a bank which is short of reserve assets would normally acquire them by bidding for them in the market place <e> <s> this would have driven up interest rates in the money market above the level thought to be appropriate to control the money supply <e>", "<cs> my lords forecasts under the industry act will be published in november <e> <s> a substantial and lasting reduction in the rate of inflation is central to the governments policies <e> <s> only in this way can we restore the economy to health and pave the way for substantial growth in both output and employment <e> <s> the present level of interest rates is a necessary part of that policy but interest rates will be reduced as soon as it is possible to do so consistent with attainment of the governments monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords in the months to september the retail price index rose by per cent <e> <s> and wholesale prices rose by per cent <e> <s> nationalised industry prices included in the rpi have risen by per cent <e> <s> over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords direct investment in the united kingdom by other eec countries totalled billion between and the latest year for which figures are available <e> <s> this excludes oil investment <e> <s> for the united states the comparable figure is billion and for japan million <e> <s> investment in the united kingdom by other eec countries and by the united states has been significantly higher since we joined the eec and in recent years the figures have been on a strongly rising trend <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that my noble friend is referring to heavy fuel oil which is used almost exclusively by industry <e> <s> the loss of revenue from abolishing the duty on this oil would be million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i was here throughout the speech delivered by the noble lord lord lever of manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords the inland revenue have strengthened their regional office management by introducing inspectors whose function is to monitor by selective sampling the quality of work performed by staff in tax districts <e> <s> their findings will be considered both locally and centrally in particular to judge quality and decide on any remedial action and the department will seek to improve quality in appropriate work areas by reinforcing their methods of supervision and reviewing their work procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole house will appreciate the extremely restrained and responsible way in which noble lords on both sides of the house have raised points on which they obviously feel very deeply <e> <s> this is a commendably short bill <e> <s> it extends to only four pages and five clauses and its scope is considerably narrower than many of the contributions made to the debate might have suggested <e> <s> it does not attempt to reconstruct the whole of the national insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords wheelchairs and a wide range of other items can under certain conditions be supplied free of tax to chronically sick or disabled persons for their domestic use and to charities for onward supply to such persons <e> <s> in the case of articles donated to hospitals relief is confined to medical or scientific equipment solely for use in medical research diagnosis or treatment and does not extend to transport or general hospital equipment <e> <s> changes in tax relief are a matter for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequers budget <e>", "<cs> my lords as the medium term financial strategy made clear control of the money supply over a period of years will reduce the rate of inflation <e> <s> but while the link between the money supply and inflation over time is clear it would not be right to assume that a short period of rapid growth such as occurred in the second half of will necessarily feed through directly to inflation at some point in the future <e> <s> if we maintain the thrust of the medium term financial strategy then we can expect to maintain the downward momentum in inflation established in <e>", "<cs> although formally only amendment no <e> <s> has at this stage been moved as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has suggested it is for the convenience of the committee if we deal with both amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> that is what i propose doing <e> <s> the bill logically falls into two parts <e> <s> clause provides for an increase of per cent <e> <s> in contributions and in effect the remainder of the bill deals with the allocation or the distribution of the additional money so raised <e>", "<cs> my lords up to st january subscriptions to the new granny bonds amounted to million <e> <s> the target for increased national savings for this financial year was million but this covers other measures as well as granny bonds and there are of course still two months to go <e> <s> sales of gilt-edged securities will continue to be the major source of finance for the governments borrowing requirement but in present circumstances an additional contribution from national savings is also needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the vat registration threshold is at present not as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> any change in the threshold is a matter for the budget statement of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer which i am unable to anticipate <e>", "<cs> my lords while i note what my noble friend says i am afraid that i cannot anticipate my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequers budget statement <e> <s> since coming into office we have however introduced a large number of measures to improve incentives and help businesses particularly small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords the law on the subject is i fear quite clear <e> <s> payments of this kind constitute emoluments and are chargeable to tax <e> <s> if payment is made through the employer he is required to deduct tax under paye in the ordinary way <e> <s> there has been no change of policy the inland revenue have simply been enforcing the existing law <e> <s> no question of consulting ministers would therefore arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that my noble friend has in mind the income tax concession relating to luncheon vouchers <e> <s> i have noted his suggestion but successive governments have taken the view with which i concur that there are strong arguments against extending selective reliefs of this kind <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the estimate given in februarys <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that the inland revenue have lodged notice of appeal against the decision of the high court in this case <e> <s> before the court proceedings began the inland revenue agreed that no steps would be taken to recover tax from any ici employees on whom assessments had been made <e> <s> but if in any case tax has been paid the question of any repayment would need to await upon the final outcome of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of lengthy discussions it became apparent that societies were unlikely to be able to introduce a scheme on a basis which would be acceptable to all of them <e> <s> accordingly the introduction of a statutory scheme has been noted as a matter to be considered when the opportunity next arises for building society legislation <e> <s> while the building societies association has never formally committed itself to guaranteeing that no investor in a building society would ever suffer loss the association is confident that in the event of difficulties arising in a particular society there would be a similar constructive response from other societies in the future as there has been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in salary being offered in the current civil service pay negotiations is per cent <e> <s> the annual holidays of non-industrial civil servants are broadly comparable with those given by good employers of similar staff in outside industry and commerce <e> <s> where there are differences these are taken into account in civil service pay levels <e> <s> on the question of sick leave allowances there are no comprehensive data on outside practice in a form which can readily be set against civil service arrangements <e> <s> it is not possible to estimate what will be the pension of a civil servant who is due to retire in years time <e> <s> it will depend on the level of his salary in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may quote from edmund burke <e>", "<cs> my lords widows pensions like retirement pensions are a form of income and liable to tax <e> <s> they have therefore to be taken into account as part of total income for tax purposes <e> <s> we have no plans to change this <e>", "<cs> my lords the two instruments are not comparable they are aimed at very different markets and necessarily have different features <e> <s> while the retirement issue national savings certificates do not bear interest as such a terminal bonus of per cent <e> <s> of the original purchase price is paid <e> <s> in addition the certificates may be encashed at their uprated value at any time after the first twelve months <e>", "<cs> my lords the audited accounts of the nationalised industries already distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure <e> <s> if however my noble friend has in mind a particular aspect where he feels that an improvement could be made perhaps he would let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords external financing limits are set at a level which takes account of the approved investment programmes of each industry <e> <s> in setting these limits regard is also paid to the extent to which the industry concerned may have internally generated funds to finance investment and the extent to which it may need to borrow to meet losses or other outgoings <e>", "<cs> my lords the present high level of interest rates in most countries reflects essentially the need to check monetary growth to curb inflation <e> <s> lower interest rates will be achieved not so much by initiatives of the kind the noble lord has in mind but by firm fiscal and monetary policy leading to a fall in the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> both this years and last years budgets included enterprise packages <e> <s> these contained a variety of measures designed to improve the fiscal and administrative climate for small businesses <e> <s> taken together all of these will help to encourage the creation growth and profitability of small businesses and so promote investment in them <e>", "<cs> my lords over the years big rises in money incomes without commensurate increases in productivity have increased our labour costs relative to those in other countries so undermining competitiveness <e> <s> this has meant loss of markets severe pressure on firms finances and profits and so loss of jobs <e> <s> future prospects for unemployment depend crucially on reversing this decline in competitiveness through lower pay rises and improvements in productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision in the sixth directive for exempting membership subscriptions from vat is limited to non-profit-making organisations with aims of a political trade union religious patriotic philosophical philanthropic or civic nature <e> <s> the exemption is subject to the proviso that it is to be applied only where it is not likely to cause distortion of competition <e> <s> this proviso would exclude from the relief clubs which provide facilities such as accommodation or catering <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that the market disciplines which apply in the private sector should so far as possible be reproduced in the public sector <e> <s> we aim to do this as appropriate by privatisation by a reduction in the monopoly powers of public enterprises and through cash limits and external financing limits <e> <s> it is moreover essential that those responsible for negotiating pay levels whether in the public or the private sector should realise the effects of what they do on the levels of output and unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be read a second time <e> <s> this is a short bill but an important one <e> <s> the chief registrar of friendly societies occupies a position of importance <e> <s> he is responsible for the supervision of friendly societies building societies industrial assurance companies and various other bodies <e> <s> of these the building societies whose growth in recent years has been phenomenal are the most important <e>", "<cs> my lords the available evidence does not support the noble lords claim that the number of business failures in the april to june quarter was a record <e> <s> on the contrary the evidence is that failures may well now be on a downward trend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are considering in detail the issues raised by the scott report <e> <s> no decisions have yet been taken but we hope to reach initial conclusions within the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords by early summer evidence was accumulating that the fall in output was coming to an end <e> <s> during the first half of the year manufacturing output stabilised short-time working was falling the rise in unemployment was slowing and business opinion survey trends were improving <e> <s> this was the background to the chancellors assessment at the end of july <e> <s> figures released today show that in the three months to august manufacturing output increased by nearly per cent <e> <s> over the previous three months <e>", "<cs> my lords considerable interest has been shown in the scheme and the government are confident that it will be of great benefit in encouraging investment in new trading ventures <e> <s> it is not possible at this stage to give particulars of investment by individuals as claims will not be made until next year <e> <s> but two funds have already been launched which are seeking to raise million for investment in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer has discussed the level of interest rates with his counterparts from governments of the european community and other states on various occasions in recent months <e> <s> at these meetings the governments of several major european and other industrial countries have renewed <e>", "<cs> my lords there is as yet no community instrument to provide the legal authority for the commission to make the proposed grant <e> <s> but as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland explained in another place her majestys government are co-operating fully with the commission as it prepares the necessary regulation <e> <s> if the proposed grant is made available expenditure on housing in northern ireland will be higher than it could otherwise have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the debate be adjourned until tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords my pleasant duty first is to congratulate most warmly my noble friend lord constantine of stanmore on a maiden speech which combined brevity with force and cogency <e> <s> the point he raises is one of great importance <e> <s> we have given much thought to this problem and shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we greatly regret the inconvenience caused to traders by the industrial action <e> <s> since this ended some claims have been repaid and i am glad to assure the noble lord that we are now virtually up to date <e> <s> every possible effort is being made to clear the small residue of claims which have been held up because queries are outstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in the total tax burden last year was needed to meet the higher level of government expenditure which was due in the main to the effects of the recession <e> <s> in terms of the overall tax burden the oecd report shows the united kingdom at the centre of the range occupying the eleventh place out of countries <e> <s> the oecd report does not comment on the burden of tax at different income levels <e> <s> but in making comparisons of this kind it is necessary to bear in mind the big increases in wages and salaries which took place in the years in question <e>", "<cs> my lords between the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of identified investment and other capital transactions resulted on balance in a net outflow of billion <e> <s> this net outflow is the natural reflection of the large current account surplus earned over the period <e>", "<cs> my lords gross receipts from the sale of shares amounted to about million <e> <s> net government expenses were about million apart from stamp duty and vat which are regarded as transfer payments <e> <s> expenses of some were incurred by the company and million was reinvested in the company by way of a subscription for new shares <e> <s> otherwise the sale proceeds have not been hypothecated to a particular use <e>", "<cs> my lords both revenue boards keep their procedures for the detection and prevention of evasion under constant review and additional resources have been allocated for this purpose by redeployment of staff <e> <s> thus it has recently been announced that the inland revenue is to redeploy some staff to counter tax evasion in the black economy <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no distinction according to country of origin <e> <s> the distinction is between wine made from fresh grapes and that manufactured from a concentrate whether imported or home-produced <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by giving the noble lord lord bruce of donington a measure of reassurance on one point <e> <s> the government have no intention whatever of withdrawing this bill which they regard as right necessary and proper <e> <s> the noble lord will therefore be able to look forward to the committee stage when we will debate with him many of the points which have been raised today which in fact are essentially committee stage rather than second reading points <e>", "<cs> my lords economic recovery depends upon the determination of all sectors of our community to ensure that our industry is competitive at home and abroad <e> <s> to this end the governments policy is directed to creating the right fiscal and monetary climate and to encouraging initiative and enterprise by reducing controls and providing incentives through the tax system particularly to help new and small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords neither receipts nor payments are made on a weekly basis <e> <s> moreover refunds under the agreement of may are for the most part made in the following year <e> <s> if one looks at actual receipts and payments during the year in question then the net contribution in is estimated to be approximately million <e> <s> the corresponding figure in was million <e> <s> expressed as weekly averages these figures would be somewhat less than million for and approximately million for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> this i suspect is the shortest and least controversial bill which your lordships are likely to be troubled with this session <e> <s> it consists of one clause of five lines and a short title <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting and indeed illuminating debate <e> <s> the fact that many of the opinions expressed have transcended party boundaries will be thought by most people to be a good thing and not a bad thing <e> <s> the house owes a debt of gratitude to my noble friend lord ohagan for instituting this debate and for the very thoughtful contribution that he made to it <e>", "<cs> my lords all member states of the european community are required by the council directive of st march <e>", "<cs> my lords the published accounts of the nationalised industries do distinguish revenue from capital expenditure <e> <s> in addition the public expenditure white paper shows every year planned capital expenditure for each of the industries and how it will be financed <e> <s> out-turn figures on the same basis are given for each of the two preceding years <e>", "<cs> my lords the luncheon voucher concession is not and never has been linked to the cost of a ham sandwich <e>", "<cs> my lords the travellers allowances are governed by community legislation and can be increased only with the agreement of all member states <e> <s> the intra-community tax-free allowance in question has been under review by the community for some time but so far without result <e> <s> the government have been and remain ready to agree to an increase in this allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago i worked for lord butler on the preparation of his first budget <e> <s> tributes have been paid from all quarters of your lordships house and indeed throughout the nation to the outstanding contribution lord butler made to our national life <e> <s> but to me he will always remain someone from whom i learned so much and remember with such affection <e> <s> he was my senior supporter when i was introduced into your lordships house <e> <s> every year since we came into office he would ask me for a report on the state of the national economy and every year he would place me on probation for a further months <e> <s> i am greatly saddened that this year i shall be unable to make my report to him <e>", "<cs> my lords excluding vat and stamp duty the amount payable by the government was about million <e> <s> the appointment of advisers and payment of fees by the companies themselves are matters for the companies concerned <e>"]
