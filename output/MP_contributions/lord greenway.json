["<cs> my lords it is always rather difficult to follow the noble lord lord kennet on this one of his pet subjects <e> <s> we have just heard a typically hard-hitting example of his expertise and knowledge on this subject <e> <s> in a way it makes me feel as though i am again making my maiden speech which i did on this subject five years ago <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble baroness lady vickers in congratulating the hydrographic office on their centenary report and indeed on their enormous contribution over the last years to the safety of navigation a task which they have performed with great dedication and enthusiasm often with very meagre resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord mcnair for asking this question this evening <e> <s> i shall direct my remarks towards the subject of the replacement of the pitcairn longboats about which we heard a little from the noble lord lord cledwyn and at the end i shall have a little to say about communications <e> <s> at present the islanders have only two serviceable boats left and they remain in service only through cannibalisation of the older ones <e> <s> they are or at least they were when new sturdy -footers built to a double-ended whaler pattern and reputedly based on a boat sent to the island by queen victoria as a gift <e> <s> originally they were propelled by oars but diesel engines have since been fitted <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl also associate the men of the merchant navy with his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for introducing this bill this evening for a second reading <e> <s> i also share some anxiety with the noble lord lord ponsonby over the title of the bill <e> <s> it seems to me rather strange in this day and age that we should have a bill called the merchant shipping bill which basically refers to pleasure yachts <e> <s> perhaps some form of simplification could be brought about whereby the qe could be treated somewhat differently from a sailing dinghy <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for his lengthy explanation of why he cannot at present accept my amendment <e> <s> i was becoming a little disheartened as he spoke but was extremely gratified to hear his final remark that his department would be very happy to look again at the matter <e> <s> with that proviso and reserving the right to bring forward a further amendment if necessary at report stage for the time being i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a few words on this bill which is a very necessary piece of legislation <e> <s> the government are to be commended upon their speed of action <e> <s> the department of trade have taken an extremely detailed look at the problems involved in amending the well-tried merchant shipping act with a view to providing a simple and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join other noble lords who have already expressed a welcome to the report of the noble viscount lord rochdale <e> <s> we all know of his great experience in the shipping world and the extremely hard work that he has put into the shipping industry over the years <e> <s> in explaining his sub-committees report he casts his net very wide and very sensibly to bring in the general overall situation existing in shipping today <e> <s> as it is not often that we have the opportunity of a fairly general debate on shipping i find it doubly welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house any comparable figures concerning soviet crosstrading activities <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord shed any light on the actual ownership of this vessel which appears to be a rather grey area <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that possibly greater future competition for our shipbuilding industry will come from the peoples republic of china whose shipyards have recently been set up largely with british help <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the decline of our merchant fleet is partly because of the increase in the merchant fleets of developing countries which has been assisted by agreements such as the unctad agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that blanket banning of the use of this antifouling paint by many thousands of yachtsmen on what appears to be insufficient evidence is manifestly unfair when some of the large tankers at present laid up in our southern ports have on their bottoms the equivalent of about times the amount of antifouling paint carried on the bottom of a single yacht <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether the government will keep an open mind on alternative treatments of schizophrenia and i refer in particular to diet <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i also welcome this report and should like to extend my congratulations to the noble lord lord gregson and to his committee on a very timely thorough but also as the noble lord said very complex matter <e> <s> it ranges from oceanography as your lordships have heard to exclusive economic zones and from coastal erosion to aquaculture and sewage disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this extremely well thought-out report presented so nobly on behalf of lord rochdale by lord kearton <e> <s> all credit to the committee which has done a thorough job <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much indebted to the noble lord lord shackleton for giving us an opportunity this evening to discuss not only the green paper on pilotage but also pilotage in general <e> <s> if my memory serves me correctly we were denied the chance to discuss pilotage in the merchant shipping bill because it went through this house on the nod right at the end of the session just before the general election <e> <s> the opportunity to talk about pilotage therefore is doubly welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite realise that point <e> <s> but the sort of ship i was referring to can easily come into the outer approaches to the port of london without a pilot possibly under the new proposed arrangements <e> <s> therefore the danger would be much closer inshore than the exercise which took place today <e>", "<cs> my lords as a possible alternative would the noble lord consider that the river thames is now clean enough for such recreational purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the burden mentioned in the original question falls upon foreign flag shipping as our merchant navy has dwindled to a shadow of its former self <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount able to tell the house i suspect that at such short notice he cannot that the reason the ship had to put to sea after she lost as i understand it one of her anchors and therefore in the existing weather was unable to lie to her remaining anchor was due to the fact that since the closure of the whiddy island oil refinery there were no longer any tugs available in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be having a rather nautical afternoon but perhaps we may now return to the pilotage bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the principle behind the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill at the committee stage and very briefly i should like to say that i do so again <e> <s> as i see it it removes yet another obstacle against the self-employment of pilots <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord swinfen about the great importance to pilots of good pilot boats <e> <s> at earlier stages of the bill i supported the provision of some means of keeping pilot boats up to a required standard <e> <s> it is probably fair to say that at the moment the pilot boats in this country are of a very high standard compared with those of other countries <e> <s> however i have a certain reservation about the general survey of pilot boats because surveying a pilot boat is rather an expensive business <e> <s> it might be beyond the means of some of the smaller ports to go through this process <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister will be able to comment on that point when he comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the principles behind the amendment in committee and i should like to do so again <e> <s> we have the problem of the thames estuary about which we have talked on several occasions during our proceedings <e> <s> under the bill it is intended that the present pilotage limits should be drawn into the harbour limits leaving a large area of what is often rather treacherous sea completely open and without any pilotage <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has a point with these amendments <e> <s> i should like to reiterate my support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly a little disappointed <e> <s> the royal yachting association will read what the minister has said in reply to the amendment and will make up its mind as to how it wishes to proceed further <e> <s> i should like to voice my thanks to the noble lord lord mottistone who is commodore of your lordships yacht club <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the feeling behind these amendments at committee stage <e> <s> on what has been said now my noble and learned friend may well be right in that the governments commitment to writing in dangerous cargoes to clause of the bill may well have implications here <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone said that he felt that the situation was adequately covered in the bill as drafted but i think that lord underhills amendment no <e> <s> has some bearing <e> <s> it is important that if a master or mate is granted an exemption certificate for a certain class of ship say for instance an ordinary cargo ship and then that master happens to be transferred to a high-sided car carrier which suffers from the problem called windage a major consideration in pilotage today he should not necessarily retain that exemption certificate <e> <s> i believe there is some merit in that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i also spoke on this matter and i am most grateful to the minister for bringing forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord underhill on this point <e> <s> it is quite proper that a charge should be made for exemption certificates to help the general administration costs of pilotage <e> <s> after all that is done on the continent today and i see no reason why it should not be done here as well <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may throw a small crumb of comfort to the minister <e> <s> i think the noble lord is making a mountain out of a molehill in many ways <e> <s> it is nonsense to suggest that the watermen who have been doing this job for many years are in some way incompetent and not capable of performing this work <e> <s> they have been doing it for very many years <e> <s> watermen undergo an apprenticeship and learn their craft over a number of years <e> <s> to state that the practice might be unsafe is not absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that these amendments have been brought forward in reply to similar amendments that i moved in committee <e> <s> certainly as i said they place a much clearer definition on the timescale which in certain instances was much too tight for the proper formation of an agency such as the one proposed by trinity house <e> <s> i am indeed grateful to the minister for this <e> <s> in relation to amendment no <e> <s> where the timescale is increased to not less than nine months after this bill is passed i take it that the minister is also at the same time in a way saying not more than nine months <e> <s> in other words it is not going on for ever because certainly we want to have some date to work to <e> <s> would the minister confirm that point <e> <s> if so i am very happy that he has brought forward these amendments and i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord the minister for having described these amendments and for meeting virtually all the points that i brought up in committee and also the points which i intended to bring up in my amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i shall certainly not be moving those amendments in the light of the amendments which the government have brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to detain the house at this late stage apart from saying once again how grateful i am to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to the outcome of what has just transpired i should like to thank the minister once again for meeting some of the points i raised at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for amendment no <e> <s> which meets the point that i raised in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said in his opening remarks there are too many deep sea pilots around for the work available <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord strathcona asked how the present licensing authorities know how many deep sea pilots are available <e> <s> anybody who is in that business has a good idea of how many pilots are around <e> <s> if i may speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his courtesy during our proceedings on this bill and also for the at times lengthy correspondence that we have had <e> <s> it is slightly unusual for a minister who is putting through a government bill such as this one to have to operate almost entirely on his own which he has done through sometimes lengthy proceedings <e> <s> i think that he is worthy of congratulation for having handled this task solo so to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the arrangements which the government have put in hand especially in regard to the placing of warning lights on ships bridges <e> <s> does the minister agree that perhaps the most worrying aspect of this disaster is the fact that so far as i am aware this is the first instance of a roll-on roll-off passenger ship sinking in calm weather in that the damage was not caused through stressful weather or through collision <e> <s> is he also able to confirm that it is not inherently unsafe for one of these ferries to cross the channel with her outer doors open as indeed was the case for a number of weeks some years ago when the french railways ferry cote dazur damaged her outer doors <e> <s> they were removed for repair and the ferry operated with only her inner door for that period <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what the noble lord has just said will he confirm that what the norwegians are proposing is precisely what is available to british merchant fleets under the registers of the isle of man gibraltar and i believe the cayman islands <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the intention of the norwegian register at present is to replace many of its experienced norwegian crew with i believe filippinos <e> <s> is there not a safety angle to be considered in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to tell the house whether there have been any discussions with regard to the possibility of setting up a strategic merchant navy reserve of ships not seafarers such as exists in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord underhill for bringing this matter to our attention <e> <s> i am sure recalling our deliberations on the pilotage bill when i spoke on behalf of trinity house he will not expect me to follow him in his remarks this afternoon <e> <s> i think that it is important to put the other side of the coin in the debate <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i made a mistake and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to come to that point <e> <s> before i do perhaps i should mention the royal navy vessels and the other government-owned vessels such as the port auxiliary services the royal fleet auxiliary the cable ships and so on <e> <s> it is true that these vessels have not paid light dues but as far as decca is concerned the navy has made contributions in the past <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked why there are not to be further payments <e> <s> my understanding is that there has been some delay but perhaps the minister can confirm that it is still the intention of the navy to pay something towards the cost of the decca service <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether he was referring just to the russian merchant fleet or talking about light dues in general because many russian ships visit our ports these days and they all pay light dues when they come here <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not implying that the noble lord had criticised trinity house in any way <e> <s> i was implying criticism from elsewhere which has been published <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to express my thanks to the minister <e> <s> i am sure that all yachtsmen will welcome what the government have seen fit to undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the second reading of this bill so ably introduced by the noble lord lord campbell who has covered most of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to stress that the facility would be just for yachtsmen but i was trying to stress the benefit to the town of swanage as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for the opportunity to discuss the problems besetting the british merchant navy <e> <s> it is a problem to which we have addressed ourselves on several occasions fairly recently in your lordships house <e> <s> i do not propose to go over much of the ground that i have covered before <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what the minister has said with regard to taking note of the current plans of the lighthouse authorities about reducing the number of lights <e> <s> in his discussions will the minister also bear in mind the importance of listening to ships masters and officers at sea whose views should be paramount in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse fully the remarks of the noble lord lord gray who has just sat down <e> <s> i feel that the offshore supply industry is in need of special treatment and it is certainly an omission that could perhaps have been taken care of in proceeding with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords they are watertight if the ship is not breached in any way <e>", "<cs> obviously if there is an accident that is a different matter <e> <s> however it should be said in relation to ro-ro ferry operation that those ferries have now been used widely throughout the world for nearly years <e> <s> they were introduced before the last war but the landing craft concept was enlarged after the war <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that in europe alone literally millions of people travel safely on such ferries every year <e> <s> one unfortunate disaster such as that which we have seen obviously demands a tightening up of the rules and regulations <e> <s> i think that the government are addressing that in the proper way and i welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that now is the time to take a long look at the whole question of urban pedestrian movement bearing in mind the increasing difficulty and frustration caused to pedestrians in moving about the pavements in london or indeed when going through the underground system where the traditional keep left system is increasingly being abused <e>", "<cs> would the minister not agree that perhaps the real problem here and the crux of the matter against the amendment is that we are not training enough seamen at the moment and that we cannot find enough people to man our ships <e> <s> companies are often forced to seek employees from other countries in order to fill their ships <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> however i think we must appreciate that the offshore industry is suffering like so many other sectors of the shipping industry from overtonnaging <e> <s> that is perhaps partly to blame for the present situation <e>", "<cs> following on what the noble lord lord geddes has said perhaps the minister might be able to provide some clarification for me on this <e> <s> let us suppose that an english company purchases not a substandard ship and i think basically that the noble lord lord underhill is trying to cut out the substandard ships with his amendment but a thoroughly modern and efficient container ship that has been built to all the latest international standards and wishes to operate it in the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord parry moved his amendment in his usual elegant manner <e> <s> however has he considered the furore that would arise if one of his welsh fishing vessels even proceeded near the spanish coast let alone tried to re-register under the spanish flag <e>", "<cs> in following the noble earl lord inchcape i should like to add a word of welcome for this clause <e> <s> as i understand it it is a general enabling clause <e> <s> the exact intentions of the government have not yet been made clear <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a brief word of support to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the system of separate ship managers is perhaps more prevalent today than in the past <e> <s> managers should certainly be written into the bill as is suggested <e>", "<cs> i think that the main purpose behind this clause is to tighten up legislation with regard to the transfer of oil which at present takes place in lyme bay among other places <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove might be getting at the transfer of say fish between trawlers and a factory mothership or a fish carrier such as is carried out widely by the comecon countries <e> <s> if that is what he is referring to i should be interested to hear what the minister has to say but i cannot think of any other circumstance in which that might have effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the regulations <e> <s> it seems to me to be only right that the same things that apply to our ferries should apply to those foreign ferries which regularly operate from our ports <e> <s> i take it that this is meant to refer only to those regular ferries that operate to the continental ports <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can tell me what would be the position until such time as a general ruling is given by imo were a ro-ro passenger ship to visit one of our ports either on a one-off cruise or perhaps with a floating exhibition <e> <s> this is something that takes place from time to time <e>", "<cs> i also declare an interest in that i still receive a considerable part of my earnings from photography <e> <s> there is a difficulty here <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken mentioned previous legislation whereby the rights were held by the person supplying the film <e> <s> as a photographer i sometimes ask another photographer to take a picture for me when he is abroad for example and i supply film for that purpose <e> <s> how will that lie under the present amendment <e>", "<cs> i also strongly support the amendment of my noble friend lord brain <e> <s> i agreed very much with what he and other noble lords have said <e> <s> i think it is time that photographers were brought into line with if you like the rest of the artistic world <e> <s> there is however one grey area which acceptance of one of these amendments would clear up that is it is not always easy to tell when a photograph was actually taken <e> <s> i have already expressed my interest at an earlier stage of the committee <e> <s> i as a photographer take an awful lot of photographs and i do not always recall exactly when they were taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i go back to what the noble lord lord strathcona said about a master who has just taken over a ship <e> <s> i cite an instance read about only last week <e> <s> a british master who through no fault of his own had lost his job with a reputable english shipping company was offered a job as a master of i think i am right in saying a panamanian vessel which he joined somewhere in the west indies <e> <s> he arrived on board to find that in his opinion the ship was totally unsuited for going to sea <e> <s> he cabled the owners of the ship to that effect and received a very rude answer <e> <s> he went on to say that in his opinion the ship should immediately be surveyed <e> <s> the net result was that after some argument he lost his job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord stewart will not be surprised if i take an opposite view to him because i followed him on second reading <e> <s> i think i am happy to follow the noble lord lord campbell in all that he has said <e> <s> if i may say so he put forward a very fair and factual account of what is at stake here and i see no reason to alter in any way my support for this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> in the generally accepted sense the limits of swanage bay stretch from just off peveril point to the old harry rocks <e> <s> i can appreciate that that might cause a little concern to the noble lord <e> <s> some people might think that the limit should perhaps be taken from what i think is called ballard point <e> <s> but even so this would still amount to no more than about per cent <e> <s> of the bay <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the remarks already made about the ministers courteous handling of the bill <e> <s> this is a wide-ranging and useful bill for the shipping industry although i must agree with the noble lord on the opposition front bench who said that he did not think it would go a long way towards bringing about an end to the present decline in the british merchant fleet and alongside that the decline in the important related marine industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house is grateful to the noble earl lord gowrie for introducing this bill in such a detailed and if i may say so such a masterly way <e> <s> we have heard from the noble earl of the great success of felixstowe <e> <s> in containers were moved which puts felixstowe among the largest and most successful ports in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome these two regulations <e> <s> i believe it is only right and fair that foreign ferries operating in and out of our ports should be subject to the same regulations as already apply to uk ships <e> <s> i believe that these are measures which any prudent operator would have brought in as a matter of course following the herald of free enterprise disaster <e> <s> the government are only reinforcing something which i believe would have been done anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord thomas and to the select committee for all the hard work they have put in on this bill <e> <s> i am not entirely surprised at their decision <e> <s> in the circumstances it was the only logical decision that could have been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that due to the recent spate of new building of cruise liners there is a line of thought that the cruise ship industry will have difficulty in filling the number of berths at present available <e> <s> is he also aware that in some shipping circles the ultimate dream is already being referred to as the ultimate nightmare <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said from that self-same dispatch box on a number of occasions recently that it is not practical to charge yachtsmen <e> <s> but in view of the sudden <e>", "<cs> my lords if the present trend continues we shall shortly find ourselves without a merchant shipbuilding capability <e> <s> is there not a strategic reason for keeping some of the yards in being if only in a mothballed state so that if ever the time came when we needed to build ships in a hurry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask him one small question <e> <s> these regulations are intended to apply in the main to cross-channel ferries <e> <s> am i correct in assuming that ro-ro passenger ships engaged in international trade for example two italian vessels which call at the port of london on a service to west africa and brazil carrying passengers would also be affected under this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords at the ouset of this debate the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey implored the minister to keep an open mind on this bill <e> <s> i hope noble lords will forgive me if i speaking from this bench keep a very open mind on this extremely long and complicated bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word of support on behalf of boating interests <e> <s> under the bill the nra will inherit the responsibility of maintaining navigations for three water authorities namely anglian which covers the rivers ouse and nene southern which looks after the upper medway and the thames <e> <s> there are almost boats including hired craft registered on those rivers which are important sources of amenity and recreation for boating enthusiasts and the general public alike <e> <s> in the case of the thames it is known that over million people visited the river last year <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his extensive reply and to my noble friend lord hylton for his support <e> <s> at this late hour i should like to consider carefully what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i have noted his remarks that the fears of the boating interests are misplaced and that the government do not wish to see a proliferation of committees <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that i may possibly return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for that reassurance and for the fact that he will look at this matter further <e> <s> i look forward to hearing from him on this point at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> the main point i noted was that my amendments would make the duty less effective than the wording contained in the bill at present <e> <s> i certainly wish to read what the noble lord has said more carefully tomorrow <e> <s> in the meantime i am very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am rather intrigued with the ministers reply <e> <s> i am delighted that we may have found a proposal which he feels he ought to look at again <e> <s> i cannot speak for the noble lord lord mcintosh who moved an amendment to my amendment <e> <s> i am speaking for the boating interests whereas his interests seem to be wider <e> <s> i thank the minister for agreeing to examine the point again in the meantime i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i was becoming a little worried until the last few words of the minister when he let himself off the hook by saying that he would perhaps look again at the matter <e> <s> it is obviously a matter that one or two of us feel quite strongly about and i am grateful for the support that i have received from members on the back benches and from the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> i do not intend to trade arguments with him as this late hour of the night as to whether negative or affirmative resolutions are better <e> <s> on the undertaking given by the minister that he will see whether he can find some way of incorporating our wishes in this matter i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my amendment relates to the need to consult the central council of physical recreation <e> <s> on second reading i outlined the reasons why the boating interests were unhappy with the code of practice <e> <s> at this late stage i shall not enumerate the reasons once again <e> <s> i am sure that the minister is now conversant with them <e> <s> however very little is said in the code about recreation and the draft is addressed almost entirely to important environmental considerations <e>", "<cs> as far as i am concerned one barrel is better than none <e> <s> if the government agree to write the sports council into the bill that at least goes halfway towards meeting what the boating interests required before the bill went to the house of commons <e> <s> therefore with that provision in mind i shall be happy not to move my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his full reply <e> <s> i am naturally disappointed that he cannot see fit to accept any of the amendments <e> <s> in regard to the coastal waters question it is rather the thin edge of the wedge to confer by-law powers in the face of one problem <e> <s> to say that they will never be used is with respect a hoary old chestnut <e> <s> however i shall read with care what the noble earl has said and in the meantime i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord moran will not be surprised if i resist this set of amendments <e> <s> i have some sympathy with him with regard to the canoeing problem on the wye <e> <s> the barge is an isolated incident <e> <s> presumably once it arrives at hereford that will be the end of matter <e>", "<cs> i note the noble earls objections to the amendment <e> <s> at this stage i will do no more than ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for this concession which i know will be very much welcomed by the boating interests <e> <s> i believe that it will help to give the code greater authority and i commend the amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a lot of recent talk on the radio and in the press about the fate of the dinosaurs <e> <s> some say that their extinction was caused by a meteor others say that it was caused by an excess of their own internal gases <e> <s> the noble lord lord crickhowell whom i am sorry to say has just left his place said that an awful amount of hot air has been expended over this dinosaur during the course of its existence <e> <s> i hope that its extinction will be just as swift as that of the dinosaurs <e> <s> i congratulate the government having finally made up their minds on the dispatch with which they are going about tackling the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the need for essential infrastructure also applies to the port of dover <e> <s> it handles now and will continue to handle large volumes of cross-channel continental traffic <e> <s> at present the area is somewhat inadequately served certainly in the last few miles by single-lane and sometimes dangerous roads <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for rising at this very late stage on this bill <e> <s> i had hoped that my noble friend lord lytton might be here to raise a particular point but as your lordships can see i stand alone on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as i do between two former distinguished and highly knowledgeable secretaries of state i shall keep my remarks in favour of the bill as short as possible <e> <s> i need not comment on the new facilities sought by the bill at kings lynn and port talbot which appear to me both logical and beneficial extensions <e> <s> nor do i question abps need for a deep water bulk facility at immingham <e> <s> there is at the moment some evidence of an upturn in shipping <e> <s> that coupled with an increasing need for the replacement of ageing tonnage worldwide could well see a return to the larger kind of bulk ships which have not been quite so in vogue recently <e> <s> already we can see that happening in the container business where much larger ships are being ordered <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that fatigue at sea has become a serious and possibly dangerous problem <e> <s> however does the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also say how pleased i am to see the minister reverting to his former incarnation on this bill if only temporarily <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord baldwin of bewdley for giving us the opportunity to
