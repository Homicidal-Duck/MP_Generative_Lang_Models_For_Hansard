["<cs> my lords i am happy to follow the right reverend prelate who brings a special and wise experience to this debate <e> <s> may i join with noble lords in saying how grateful i am to the noble lord lord scanlon for introducing this debate on such an important issue and for doing it in a way which on this occasion avoids me embarrassment which i might otherwise have suffered owing to the convention of the house <e> <s> i am happy that i have not been placed in that embarrassment thanks to the nature of his speech <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords who have spoken will understand if because of this occasion i do not pursue some of the interesting but perhaps on one or two occasions more controversial points that have been raised although i am happy to find that there has been such a vast amount of common ground in the speeches which have been made to your lordships house so far <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend comment on the apparent anomaly that when demand is down in the private sector prices normally tend to reduce whereas in the public sector certainly in the nationalised or monopoly public sector prices almost invariably increase <e> <s> is this not some encouragement to him to continue with the private sector taking over these roles <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first declare an interest as i am the chairman of a company with substantial mining and quarrying activities within the united kingdom <e> <s> i consider the purpose of this bill to be highly commendable and most of it i am only too happy to support <e> <s> the purpose is as indeed was the purpose of the stevens committee on which much of it is based to reconcile the needs of the environment and the needs of industry not a particularly easy task <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i add two further points <e> <s> i should not like my noble friend lord nugent to think i was being critical of planning staffs and their ability <e> <s> the stevens committee commented very strongly on the lack of experience of mining and quarrying activities within the planning authorities and it is understandable that it should be so <e> <s> the noble baroness who put forward the arguments against the amendment did so i think more in the context of minerals which are plentiful and minerals which you can work shortly after getting permission <e> <s> all these arguments were considered very fully by the stevens committee <e> <s> i am sure that if the committee would bear with me while i read chapter of the report of the stevens committee there would be no one left in this committee to oppose the amendment <e> <s> the arguments there are very formidable i believe they are impeccable <e> <s> they <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that full answer <e> <s> i shall certainly happily wait to see the full package as it develops during the course of this committee stage and beyond <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> briefly i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> i referred to the long-term needs when i spoke to the previous amendment and i shall not repeat the arguments <e> <s> enormous capital investment has to go in to dealing with the processing of more sophisticated metals <e> <s> some noble lords may have knowledge of the smaller sand and gravel and readimixed plants <e> <s> in many cases we are talking of what is vital to this country <e> <s> it can cost million million or million to erect processing plant to deal with many of these sophisticated metals <e> <s> therefore it is important that those who are planning such projects should be able to do so on the basis of long-term planning permissions <e> <s> i support the four reasons which my noble friend has given as to why this would not only be in the interests of the industry but in the interests of the environment as well <e> <s> i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause is part of the package to which i referred when we were discussing an earlier amendment as one of the heavy obligations which the industry are required and have been prepared to accept if they receive the compensating provisions to which reference was previously made <e> <s> my noble friend has been good enough to say that at the end of the day we should be satisfied that such imbalance as appears at this stage will have been restored and i am happy to wait to be so satisfied <e>", "<cs> without wishing to take issue with the noble baroness on the definitions in the dictionary i think that my noble friend has made a very valid and practical as opposed to practicable point on this clause because one can visualise restoration being <e>", "<cs> looking at the amendment of the noble baroness which has not yet been moved but which would cut the period to years i should like to make the point which i tried to make earlier about the need for long-term planning and the vast investment that is involved <e> <s> indeed years may seem a long time ahead but as it erodes and as further investment is required year after year it will become a very difficult problem for those who try to operate it <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not be enticed by the blandishments from across the table <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not now follow the noble lord lord perry in the points he makes but perhaps i might touch upon one or two of them a little later <e> <s> nor will i join issue with the noble lord lord glenamara whose speech was so effectively responded to by my noble friend <e> <s> like other noble lords i welcome this debate which has been initiated by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> any government that thought it knew all the answers would be complacent <e> <s> certainly the -point plan of mr steel contains many points with which most of your lordships on all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords the policies that were being pursued and advocated by the party in government in those days which was supported by the liberal party are not the policies of the people whom they are now supporting <e> <s> they are now giving their support to those who have condemned the party with whom they were previously in alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will have the opportunity to make her points later <e> <s> i think the record is fairly clear as to the terms on which that pact operated <e> <s> i do not wish to go back too far into the past but i must warn my noble friend that in view of the flirtations which the liberal party have carried on he should be wary so that at some future date he is not beguiled by their somewhat fickle attitude towards partners with whom they have operated <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may consider the point and let the noble viscount know how that should he interpreted <e>", "<cs> may i also declare an interest and based on the experience of that interest voice my support for my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> my reasons are similar to those of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it is very often necessary in times of recession to decide upon concentrating ones production on certain quarries or plants or minerals <e> <s> indeed months suspension of one in order to concentrate on others to get a more economic operation is a comparatively short period <e> <s> in response to the noble baroness lady birk i would say that when she referred to a mineral planning authority taking note of these facts the operations may be in a number of different areas under a number of different planning authorities and it would not be one that may have an omnibus view over all the factors <e> <s> i support my noble friend lord mottistone in this <e>", "<cs> my point on this amendment is rather different from that of my noble friend because it relates to the five-year period which indeed will not be debated under my noble friends amendment if this amendment is agreed to <e> <s> as i understand it this amendment will mean that the review resulting in a lower rate of compensation can be carried out in every period of five years <e> <s> i believe that that is far too frequent <e> <s> it can mean that the reduced rate of compensation which will become payable will result in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always delightful to follow the noble lord lord davies of leek whom i had the privilege of following on many past occasions in another place <e> <s> i am sure he will forgive me if i do not go into detail on the arguments that he raised <e> <s> of course the level of unemployment is a matter of wide concern as has been expressed throughout your lordships house and naturally i share that concern <e> <s> however i believe that we should put the figures in perspective and as has been said we should realise that they form part of a world recession <e> <s> though it may be of little consolation our figures may not look so bad when compared to those of other countries <e> <s> of the nine countries in the european community excluding greece two of them belgium and ireland have levels of unemployment higher than ours and three of them france denmark and italy have figures approaching ours <e> <s> in the past few months the trend has been rising in those countries <e> <s> that is no consolation but i believe that in looking at our own problem here it is right that we recognise that it is part of a larger problem which as previous speakers have said arises against a background of world recession and rising oil prices <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has prayed in aid for his amendment bodies with which i too have a close association the law society and chambers of commerce <e> <s> i think my noble friend will be aware of their very serious reservations about this clause and indeed the clauses which follow it <e> <s> i certainly would not associate myself with the noble lord in the reason that he gave <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend will say that part of this provision is to reduce public expenditure and i believe there are other <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the present law is working fairly satisfactorily <e> <s> i wonder if the noble lord could just say if indeed he envisages difficulties in making changes why make any changes at all to this particular aspect of the law <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to add to the complexity which my noble and learned friend has so clearly outlined but i think that the introduction of forcible entry makes the problem extremely difficult to resolve <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton referred to the sanctuary of the home <e> <s> does that mean in the case of a teenager his parents home <e> <s> is that the home and is that the sanctuary <e> <s> once one gives a right of entry then one must give the right forcibly to enter otherwise the person seeking sanctuary will go in and bolt and bar the doors and one has the problem of the police forcing an entry without a warrant and so on <e> <s> i find this an extremely difficult point <e> <s> i feel your lordships are of one mind in wishing to avoid sanctuary and i wish i could be more constructive in helping my noble and learned friend to find the right answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is quite impossible to cost either the value of an inflation-proofed pension or the liability that it places on an employer <e> <s> for that reason does he agree that no private employer can afford to fund such pensions <e> <s> will these be factors which are taken into account in the present considerations <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with this amendment and with the arguments put forward by noble lords opposite and by the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that the one point which distinguishes this from all other tribunals i understand the reluctance of the government and of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to extend legal assistance to many tribunals is that this is the only tribunal which decides on the liberty of the subject <e> <s> i believe that that is a distinction which justifies exceptional treatment in this case and i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord balogh has ranged over a wide economic field and i hope he will forgive me if i do not attempt to follow him in this tonight <e> <s> perhaps i shall be wiser when i have had the opportunity of reading it and of considering it more fully as i shall tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> t believe and i give him credit for this that the social and local implications of closure weighed very heavily on his mind as they must on that of any minister faced with that choice <e> <s> and they weighed heavily on this government too <e> <s> the point that i wish to make is that at the end of the day the consequences of not recognising the market forces mean that the closures become more severe unemployment becomes higher and losses greater <e> <s> it is a problem which faces ministers and those concerned with running large industries in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe and i am sure that the noble lord will not disagree that very large sums have been paid to industries to keep them in being at a time when they had ceased to be economically viable <e> <s> the history of our countrys economy followed under successive governments shows this <e> <s> and it has been done for the best of motives because of a reluctance to accept social consequences that would otherwise flow <e> <s> my argument is that had successive governments been prepared to allow market forces to operate instead of retaining a force which suddenly ceased to be viable after carrying a burden for too long then this sudden impact of closure would not have happened <e> <s> that was my argument <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that in those cases where facts and figures have been published such as in the case of southends refuse collection it has been shown quite clearly that this has benefited the ratepayers both in the level of costs and the standards of service <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have taken part in this debate i am grateful to the noble lord lord beswick for enabling us to discuss and debate this issue which is so critical to such a large part of our economy <e> <s> may i follow the noble lord lord oram on two points <e> <s> he referred to the government policies on privatisation as being disastrous with possibly the one exception of the national freight corporation <e> <s> i waited with interest for him to give perhaps just one example or a few figures to show any case where the privatisation that has so far taken place had been adverse or could come in any way under the description of disastrous <e> <s> in fact if he looked at the record i am sure that my noble friend replying will illustrate this he will see that there have been great successes in the advances that have already been made <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come on to the other part of it later in the remarks that i shall make <e> <s> the noble lord also following the noble lord lord underhill made some play about the conservative manifesto not spelling out the various parts of privatisation that we have achieved <e> <s> let me say that i believe that we were much too modest <e> <s> in electoral terms there certainly can be no advantage in nationalisation <e> <s> indeed it defeats me why the labour party have adhered to that el dorado as they have looked upon it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i understood the point the noble lord made but he referred to the revenue being generated by those properties being available for the further exploitation of the railway system in the years to come <e> <s> i imagine that the properties which have been realised had a yield of to per cent <e> <s> while british rail were borrowing at a rate greatly in excess of that <e> <s> those are sums which are leading companies in the private sector which are having to borrow money at high rates of interest to look through their portfolios to see which of their low-yielding properties and assets should be divested <e> <s> i call that a sensible course one which it would be right for british rail to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will recall that that alleged quotation was not in the manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords while of course accepting what my noble friend has said on the practice and constitution may i ask her to agree that it is perhaps not widely understood outside this house and is there not a danger of members of this house on such committees who strongly dissent and who are associated with parties who again have dissented from the findings of the select committee being in the press and having views attributed to them which perhaps would not be truly representative of the result of their impression of the committee and would lead to a distortion and a misunderstanding in the country <e>", "<cs> i must confess to having been a convert from the view which was expressed in another place in to the view which is now in the bill before us <e> <s> i then believed that it was right that the employer who actually discharges the man makes the man unemployed should carry the responsibility for it no matter what pressure he came under <e> <s> that was my view at that time <e> <s> i have become convinced by the experience of the last two years of the fact that the employers feel and understandably feel great <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord harris and lord marsh have spoken of the problems of particular industries and the noble lord lord marsh referred specifically to the difficulties in the printing industry which is an example of the problem which his clause seeks to remove <e> <s> all of us who are involved in industry must know of countless similar cases where one or two people can stop a whole business and operation with thousands of other employees <e> <s> the penalty that is imposed upon the employer and the pressure that it puts upon the employer as the noble lord lord marsh has said is a menace <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord spens has clearly explained the amendment and i shall not detain your lordships for many moments in supporting what he has said <e> <s> the issue is simple <e> <s> it has been widely debated outside this house and parliament but unfortunately it was not debated in another place in the passage of this bill there for reasons known to your lordships <e> <s> on an issue which attracts so much public attention we should know how the government view this important point <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the problem with the steel industry in the world is over-capacity that we in this country have made relatively a much larger contribution to closing down that capacity than any other country and that it is for that that we are now being penalised <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell mentioned the nurses but is it not a fact that today there are more nurses and they are better paid in real terms than was the case during the time when the noble lord was in office <e> <s> the noble lord will find that is so <e> <s> whether there are enough or whether they are well enough paid is another question but i think it ill becomes the noble lord to criticise the achievements with all the difficulties which have been faced in the health service by this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord i think he does confirm the point that i made <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell also referred quite rightly to the fact that the motion did not require the opposition to spell out their own policies but in so far as they criticise the result and are not prepared to say what they would do one is bound to seek explanations and perhaps i shall have an opportunity of doing so a little later in my speech <e> <s> however first i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating my noble friends lord rootes and lord kindersley on their maiden speeches and to note with pleasure the considerable experience the wide industrial experience that they will bring to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the article but could it be that that was in the context of youth training schemes and youth opportunity schemes which are going to ensure that no one is without a job or a training opportunity on leaving school <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pose the question in a slightly different way <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear referred to the right to strike as being sacrosanct <e> <s> i believe that the right to live is of even greater importance <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter put it in its right perspective when he said that we are talking about the granting of privileges and exemptions <e> <s> if this amendment were worded in the way in which indeed it could equally well be interpreted that you shall be privileged to take industrial action you shall be free from legal sanctions if in the words of the amendment you take action which endangers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my interest in this as a former treasurer of the conservative party is one that should be declared <e> <s> certainly i intervene only because the noble lord lord houghton and indeed others seem to have continued to get out of perspective the relationship between the funds which the labour party receives from the trade unions and those which the conservative party receives from so-called big business <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not go into percentages and i did not want to detain your lordships by dealing with absolute figures but i think one will find that the percentages are probably right <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord houghton said it is correct to make the point <e> <s> my personal view is that one should rely upon voluntary contributions for political purposes and i would be opposed to the type of state aid which the noble lord lord houghton put forward in a most excellent and clear-thinking report with the decision of which i disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords if as my noble friend said a copy of the prospectus was to be placed in the library today is it not the case that many of these highly technical problems could best be answered by looking at the prospectus itself <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord lord balogh correctly he said that there was no evidence that the private sector was any more efficient than the public sector <e> <s> in that case i would urge him to look at a clear example in todays press at the effectiveness of the introduction of the private sector in the refuse cleaning operations in birmingham <e> <s> but time prevents me from following the noble lord further in his speech which i shall look at again with interest tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to continue <e> <s> it is not the total raised by the prices i am concerned with but it is the apportionment of it between the domestic and industrial user <e> <s> historically we in this country have charged our domestic consumer far too little and our industrial consumer far too much and there are political problems in remedying that <e> <s> so it is not the total overall recovery but the apportionment of it which i believe has been unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware how much we welcome the tough stance being taken by his right honourable friend in resisting the disproportionate cuts in steel production capacity that have been suffered by the united kingdom against our european partners <e> <s> will he urge his right honourable friend to take account of the impact these steel cuts are having on industry both upstream and downstream of the main steel producers and here i should perhaps declare an interest and ask his right honourable friend to take account of the points made from both sides of this house on the impact of energy costs on these essential basic industries <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has raised some interesting points on the various articles but as like my noble friend i am opposed to the directive as a whole i am sure he will forgive me if i do not follow him on those points <e> <s> i am a director of companies which employ a large number of part-time workers and to that extent of course i declare an interest <e> <s> but i am expressing an entirely personal view in the points that i raise and they are not necessarily those of the companies to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with that <e> <s> i said could <e> <s> i accept fully what the noble lord says that as the directive is at the moment on the most adverse interpretation it could add per cent <e> <s> to the total <e> <s> i fully accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that although there has been a helpful improvement in productivity within bsc there is still a quite unacceptable level of absenteeism in a number of plants and that unless or until that situation is reversed there can certainly be no safeguards for the five integrated works for regaining our market share or for safeguarding jobs within the steel industry and within those industries that are dependent upon bsc <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in this debate i am most grateful to my noble friend for raising this unstarred question because it goes to the heart of industrial costs <e> <s> i must begin by declaring an interest because i am chairman of a company which is a very large consumer of fuel or at least it is in my view <e> <s> it spends some million a year on fuel and for certain operations the fuel cost the energy cost represents sometimes as much as per cent <e> <s> of the total costs of production as regards certain products <e> <s> therefore the price at which energy is available relative to the price at which it is available to our overseas competitors is critical <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the private sector there are a number of firms which while unfamiliar with the systems have the skills and competence to deal with a great deal of the maintenance and repair work that at the moment is not being done <e> <s> if this unfortunate strike continues will he consider encouraging the water council to make use of those facilities and so relieve some of the hardship and industrial loss that otherwise will follow and also show that a monopoly of this kind must not be used to abuse the public <e>", "<cs> this is a highly emotional amendment in that we all have a love-hate relationship with the press <e> <s> we love them when they are nice to us and say the right things we think otherwise on other occasions <e> <s> it is also emotional in that we all pay tribute to open government we all want open government it is something which we all endorse and yet we must be pragmatic about it <e> <s> i would support the amendment entirely if i felt from the practical point of view that it would produce a more effective result on the water councils and if i felt that their debates would be better and that we would finish up with a more effective operation lower charges and so on <e> <s> but i do not believe that it would be so <e>", "<cs> i would contrast meetings of the proposed water council with what happens at meetings of an executive board a contrast which was acknowledged by the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> it will be on all fours with bodies such as the gas and electricity boards which do not admit the press <e> <s> that is the contrast to be made between the decision of an executive board and that of a deliberative council such as your lordships house <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord lord stewart if he can remember i certainly cannot any occasion at which the deliberations at meetings of water boards when the press have been there have resulted in press reports <e> <s> therefore while the onus may be to show that they would be harmful my argument is that there is certainly no evdience to show that they have achieved the purpose which all of us would like if possible to be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the monitoring is already being done very effectively by the motoring public using hyde park corner <e> <s> might i suggest to my noble friend that perhaps the traffic authority might be advised to consult the taxi drivers who use that area most frequently because information from them would be both helpful and pungent <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons why there was so little shift back the release of that ratchet were manifold <e> <s> there was massive resistance by the labour party and massive resistance by the trade unions in the public sector <e> <s> then of course there was the recognition that these vast public monopolies having been created to return them to the private sector would probably lead to a private monopoly which to many was and is unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept the noble lords interpretation <e> <s> but what he has said endorses my point which is the desirability of getting that type of peripheral activity away from the main line activity and back into the private sector where it can be managed more effectively <e> <s> the government are moving in this direction and i congratulate them on what they are doing with british telecom british airways and the like <e> <s> but these large denationalisations will take time <e> <s> and i ask my noble friend to consider urging the nationalised industries and the public sector to look through all the bits and pieces that they have on their books which are not part of their mainline activity <e>", "<cs> my lords to put these figures into context could my noble friend confirm that the net overseas earnings from invisibles in the private sector have been running in the region of million per annum <e> <s> would he also remind his right honourable friend the chancellor before th march that the largest contributors to that were the banks <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the problem as my noble friend said that employers cannot force disabled people who are employed by them to register and that many employers who have well over per cent <e> <s> disabled will fall short of the statutory target of per cent <e> <s> registered disabled <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble baroness is in favour of or opposed to the amendment <e> <s> i most strongly support my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> i welcome too the support of the liberal benches <e> <s> i speak with a declared interest as the chairman of the largest contributor to the million of city rates <e> <s> i would correct my noble friend on one other figure <e> <s> in referring to the contribution made by the city as a whole to our industrial prosperity by invisible earnings my noble friend referred to the figure of million <e> <s> i believe he will find after research that that is the net figure after taking off the government invisibles <e> <s> the contribution of the city to our economy is even greater than he implied <e>", "<cs> be that as it may the point is that the city is a tremendously important part of our national economy <e> <s> as my noble friend lord renton said it is a question not of the number of electors who are within the city but of the number of people who go to work there and the people who depend upon the city for their livelihood throughout very large parts of our economy <e> <s> it would be regrettable and unfortunate if <e> <s> in the re-formed organisation which is now before the committee the city were not to be represented <e> <s> i shall not go into the arguments which have been very well put by my noble friends and others <e> <s> all i would say is that i hope very strongly that the government will feel able to accept the amendment <e> <s> if it were rejected that would be very harshly felt by the city and by those who play such an important part in our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first join with other noble lords in my congratulations to my noble friend lord king of wartnaby and particularly so if i may say so having known him for many years in his managing to be non-controversial on this occasion <e> <s> we look forward to hearing him on other occasions when that inhibition will not be applied <e> <s> i would also say that this debate has gone on rather longer than i scheduled and if unfortunately i am not able to remain until the end of the debate i hope that noble lords will accept my apologies <e> <s> it is a practice which i have never pursued before and i hope that i shall be able to avoid it on this occasion <e> <s> like my noble friend lord cockfield i propose to keep my remarks to the taxation provisions in the finance bill and i do so with the declared interest of being the chairman of the company most affected under the finance bill in that the company which i chair will have to provide an extra million of tax because of the contents of the bill <e> <s> the clearing banks as a whole will have to provide something like billion as a consequence of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is million my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i do not want to enter into a debate at this stage but i must in view of what the noble lord said refute very strongly what he said about the british financial institutions which give loans and financial services now which are equal to those anywhere else in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said is has been a wide-ranging debate and it has been particularly refreshing to find that in winding up the debate my noble friend lord young has taken on board the many points which have come from all parts of the house <e> <s> i have every confidence that they will be pursued with great vigour <e> <s> with that i thank all my noble friends and noble lords who have taken part in this debate for their contributions and ask leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord molson referred to this not being a mark metropolitan county council <e> <s> indeed i think that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said that it was probably a mark metropolitan county council <e> <s> however in so far as it is not a replica of the earlier amendment i ask what indeed is it <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers said that it would not be elected but that is left in some doubt in the new clause which says that it will be established <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> whatever else the glc and the metropolitan councils might have been i do not believe they have been very efficient distributors of public money to charities <e> <s> i do not refer to the quantum because that has been substantial and much of it has of course gone to very good concerns but much of that good work has been eroded by some of the rather peculiar distributions which have been made <e> <s> it is possible and i believe it is right and would prove very much better to get a greater participation from the private sector <e> <s> i believe that it would be possible for this new body to which my noble friend has referred to act as a catalyst in achieving this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start as other noble lords have done by congratulating my noble friend lord clitheroe on his maiden speech <e> <s> to my ear he struck every note right <e> <s> i congratulate also my noble friend lord aldington not only for his introduction to the debate today but also on the way in which he chaired the select committee <e> <s> to have persuaded a select committee of such a disparate group as the noble lords on that committee were to agree is good <e> <s> to have persuaded them to agree to a report which has the almost universal support of such a wide section of the community is quite magnificent <e> <s> my noble friend chaired the committee in the most distinguished way and made our task so much more easy and pleasant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord underhill will accept from me that i did not need his reminder any more than did my noble friend lord soames to declare an interest <e> <s> i am the chairman of a bank which is a member of one of the consortia the channel tunnel group and i obviously have an interest <e> <s> as to the value he attributes to my remarks i think he can certainly discount them today but it would be wrong to believe that because a noble lord has an interest his remarks should in any way or necessarily be devalued <e> <s> it is sometimes of considerable value to the house that your lordships speak on subjects in which they have a special interest and a special knowledge <e> <s> i do not claim that for my contribution today but i make that as a general comment <e>", "<cs> i just plant that in my noble friends mind as one of the points that i am sure he would wish to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords if that should happen it would be quite impossible for the financial proposals that have been put forward to remain in place <e> <s> it would kill the schemes as they are now put forward <e> <s> the delays would make it absolutely impossible to project any meaningful figures dealing with these large sums <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that is in the scheme <e> <s> i cannot give details of timing but it is all in the plan that has been put forward <e> <s> forgetting overlooking or discounting my comments in relation to road nevertheless i believe it is important we should go ahead with a fixed link now whatever form it takes whether it be road rail bridge or tunnel <e> <s> we need that fixed link <e> <s> delay in coming to a decision will mean that we may never get it <e> <s> indeed i go along with my noble friend lord soames today <e> <s> it is now or not in this century <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will agree that it should be now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i understand the noble lord lord kennet raised that point while i was unfortunately out of the chamber <e> <s> it is one thing to put together a packet today and do all the calculations in respect of the terms upon which that money will be spent starting in months time and following through to the end of the next half-dozen years <e> <s> it is another thing to put forward a packet which would be required for some quite indeterminate period <e> <s> i am not suggesting years such as with the by-pass and so on but with a planning inquiry which might take a long time it would be quite impossible to put forward a financial packet which would stand up <e>", "<cs> i should like first of all to declare an interest as the chairman of one of the clearing banks which would be involved in the operation of this clause <e> <s> at the same time perhaps i may say that i am quite sure that their objectives would be those of the noble and learned lord lord denning in wishing to do whatever was practicable in tracing the laundering <e>", "<cs> your lordships will remember that i declared my interest in a bank on a previous amendment <e> <s> may i now sound a somewhat cautionary note in regard to the amendment of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon raised a number of points with which in large measure i am in agreement as regards the problems which arise from the noble and learned lords amendment and i would add two further points <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the drop in the price of oil can bring to the world and to world trade many industrial advantages that should improve the position of many of the indebted countries while the world oil price remains at a reasonable low level <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest as a chairman of a clearing bank <e> <s> i am delighted to be following the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury who has contributed so much to the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support from the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i note the points made by the noble lord lord williams and by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> whether my noble friend the minister will feel able to extend the definition to meet my noble friends point i know not <e> <s> in practice the definition of one party being a bank or a licensed institution under the banking act is adequate for all practical purposes <e> <s> one thing i am quite certain it is desirable to do is to ensure that there is clarity so that people know when these transactions are entered into whether within the bill or the act as it will be or outside it <e> <s> that i hope would be achieved by this amendment or something on similar lines <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that he will look again at this matter <e> <s> certainly we shall see whether with him we can find some wording which meets his reservations and at the same time meets the very real difficulty which i believe otherwise arises <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at the risk of prolonging this discussion may i suggest to my noble friend that we miss all those words out and we just have a copy of any guidance issued without referring to writing or legible form <e> <s> they seem to me to be quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i speak in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i raised this point during the second reading debate in my capacity as chairman of one of the clearing banks an interest which i then declared <e> <s> i find particularly disturbing the apparent lack of understanding about the mechanics of the operation of clearing banks <e> <s> indeed the sib with which the committee of london scottish bankers has been in correspondence on this matter looks upon this particular clause in the bill as one of the main supports of the framework for protection for investors which is intended to be afforded by the bill <e>", "<cs> if i may just interrupt my noble friend can he explain to me how a branch which receives in one short period cheques for nearly million on one day in a matter of minutes or hours if you wish is able to see whether there is anything unusual how it could possibly trace and look through that reputable firm as it appears that all the cheques are drawn in favour of people who they believe to be absolutely reputable <e> <s> how can it possibly be done <e> <s> it really is a quite unrealistic picture that is being painted and i hope that my noble friend will reflect and take further advice on it before pursuing that line <e>", "<cs> i have not made myself clear <e> <s> how is it possible among those thousand cheques to verify the payee on each of those cheques and to say that that payee is a respectable and responsible person <e> <s> no amount of computers and the rest of it can identify that mr smith or mr brown to whom a cheque for is made payable is a genuine person or whether it is someone proposing to run off with the money <e> <s> to do so it would be necessary to operate inside the very offices of the payer and as i understand it no technology could possibly deal with the particular problems it would impose <e> <s> if my noble friend has a solution i should be happy to hear it from him but i cannot suggest one <e>", "<cs> i support what my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> my only purpose in intervening is to not let go unchallenged the comments of the noble lord lord williams who referred to the bank of england as now lacking any authority <e> <s> i hope that <e>", "<cs> i accept that my noble friend is comparing the authority at one time with the authority at another <e> <s> i think it would be a waste of the time of the committee to enter that argument but i believe it would have been most unfortunate if it had been left on the record that the bank of englands authority had been diminished in the way in which i thought the noble lord lord willaims had suggested <e> <s> i believe that its authority is very great not only within the city of london but far beyond and the respect in which it is held throughout the world is very great <e> <s> it would be a pity if anything was said which eroded that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may go hack to amendment no <e> <s> i feel i ought to thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for meeting the point which i raised in committee <e> <s> his noble friend lord lucas of chilworth said in committee that he would look at the point to see if it could be clarified <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friends amendment which i believe is a much clearer and simpler clause than that in the original bill <e> <s> i believe too that it is one of the rare occasions in this bill when we have an amendment which is going to be shorter than the original which is something which should commend it to us <e> <s> with regard to the last point of the noble lord lord williams on the second paragraph of amendment no <e> <s> i believe that he could stretch that to apply to almost any type of comment to advice on personnel relations on management structures and all the rest of it <e> <s> i believe that it is far wide of the intentions of the clause <e> <s> i support the amendment as put forward by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i once more thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for meeting the point which was causing considerable concern to a number of your lordships when this matter came up in committee and when my noble friend lord colville raised the matter <e> <s> i believe that my noble and learned friend has met that point very effectively and i am grateful to him for improving the bill in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey concentrated on the cross-subsidisation between the various sros <e> <s> i am rather more interested in the amount of subsidisation provided not only across but within the sros themselves <e> <s> here i must declare an interest as chairman of a clearing bank <e> <s> i wonder to what extent those who are of a very low risk category are going to be required to provide a major contribution to compensation for those of a much higher risk not only within one sro but in all of them because the clearing banks are likely to be members of all the sros <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his very helpful remarks <e> <s> can he make quite clear that what he has now said means that the contributions as between individual members of an sro will reflect the risk assessment as it is then assessed between those members and that we are not just talking of the risk element between one sro and another <e>", "<cs> my lords my point on this amendment differs slightly from those of noble lords who have spoken so far but i think it may be for the convenience of the house if i raise it at this time because really it is a point for clarification on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for the assurances he has given but i ask whether he can go a bit further and confirm as i understand is implicit in what he has said that it is the governments intention that the contributions made by the members of the scheme should so far as practicable relate to the risk attached to each contributor <e>", "<cs> my lords i very strongly support what my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has said and indeed what the noble lord lord ezra has said on this subject <e> <s> it is a pity that it is necessary to introduce an amendment into the bill because i had hoped and believed that this was a matter which could satisfactorily be settled within the sib itself <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill on polarisation but it is the way in which the sib is clearly interpreting its function and its rules which gives cause for so much concern which i share with the noble lord lord ezra and indeed my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept from me as one who sits on that panel from time to time that investor protection is the overriding consideration of all the members of the panel <e>", "<cs> my lords i too declare an interest in this matter as the chairman of a clearing bank upon which these rules will have an impact <e> <s> like my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne my interest is not just for the fortunes of the banks or building societies but it is essentially for the fortunes of the consumer who i believe will suffer severe penalties through the lack of competition and the like that will result from the rules as at present drafted <e> <s> many of the points were raised in the debate on th october <e> <s> it is something of a disappointment that they did not provoke a response from the sib until yesterday <e>", "<cs> yes the designated agency <e> <s> i ask my friend to take careful note of these points and indeed of what has been said both in this house and outside <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously they cannot be masters of every part of the whole wide range of financial services <e> <s> all bank managers have access to the best advice <e> <s> if they are unfamiliar with a particular opportunity they should make sure that they have the best advice in order that they can give to their customer the quality of advice that he has come to expect <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest as chairman of one of the clearing banks <e> <s> i am always happy to follow the noble lord lord bruce of donington particularly when i know that the points which he has raised will be so ably responded to by my noble friend lord young of graffham <e> <s> in his closing remarks the noble lord touched on one point to which i should like to refer that is convergence <e> <s> i think the noble lord has misunderstood the position in regard to the american and british attempts to converge at an understanding on the essential capital ratios <e> <s> that is extremely healthy for international banking and for the safeguarding of funds in banks here which will also benefit the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest as i did on second reading <e> <s> i am not sure whether my interest is in favour or against the amendment <e> <s> it is against the amendment i suppose speaking as chairman of a large clearing bank <e> <s> i should not wish to see my shareholders denied the opportunity of the most attractive bid which might be presented to them although i believe that they would suffer from the lack of management skills that they now enjoy if that circumstance should arise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would help if the noble lord would say whether the figures he is quoting are billions of pounds sterling or as is more usual in such matters billions of us dollars <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a substantial interest in banking <e> <s> therefore this bill has been of particular interest to me and i welcome it very much <e> <s> i am grateful like my noble friend and other noble lords for the consideration given by my noble friend and by my noble friend the secretary of state to the amendments tabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to take part in this debate and had not put my name down <e> <s> however i shall be brief <e> <s> i declare an interest as chairman of one of the clearing banks and chairman of the committee of london scottish bankers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way and for what he has said <e> <s> i accept and i am sure my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne accepts that the government are looking at this very important point <e> <s> we should not expect to have a full reply to those matters which have so recently been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby will realise that no doubt because of important matters he has missed almost the whole of this debate <e> <s> i hope that he will understand if i do not therefore follow his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether my statistics include sweden <e> <s> i shall certainly let the noble lord known the answer to that <e> <s> it will be a relatively small part of the total sum <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot apply a judgment from my point of view on matters which are only available to the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the bank of england <e> <s> they know the attitudes of other countries and luckily the noble lord lord richardson made this point in his speech and rightly so a cohesion has been achieved among the major countries by the finance ministers and central bankers so that they can act in unison on these matters of critical importance <e> <s> i should not like to prejudge what they might do <e> <s> from my point of view i would hope that they could achieve such reductions at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy for my noble friend being faced with such a complexity of points many of which are such that i believe that law lords would reserve judgment for some time in order to decide what are the correct answers <e> <s> it is undoubtedly one of the problems with this highly complex piece of legislation and the regulations that flow from it <e>", "<cs> i follow my noble friend in support of the argument for consistency <e> <s> whatever mental aberrations the court had in deciding that horses and ponies were not livestock i know not for i have not read the judgment <e> <s> surely the consistent argument is that horses and ponies are just as much livestock as hereford bulls and all the other kinds of animals that farmers breed <e> <s> i very strongly support the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord mason <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord roskill referred to me and therefore i should like to say that i strongly endorse the remarks he made <e> <s> i believe that his speech on this was absolutely correct and it is fully supported by me <e>", "<cs> i should declare an interest as a member of the takeover panel <e> <s> this amendment shows the enormously wide range of considerations that come into fixing a statutory limit in the way that the amendment suggests <e> <s> my noble friend lord caldecote produced factors to argue for a lower limit and my noble friend lord hanson debated why a lower limit could be disadvantageous to shareholders <e> <s> i believe that this debate shows the need for retention of flexibility <e> <s> i believe also that it is very effectively attained by the takeover panel as it operates at the moment <e>", "<cs> am afraid i can give no help either except that i know that the panel is considering this together with all those other issues with considerable urgency <e> <s> i hope that it will not be too long before it comes to a conclusion or a recommendation <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not be considered to be denigrating company secretaries but i feel i must say something in response to the noble lord lord williams because i do not feel that he really understands the practical position in a corporation <e> <s> the secretary is a statutory officer of the company <e> <s> the chain of responsibility lies to the chairman and through the chairman to the board of directors <e> <s> anything that crossed that and tried to establish a second tier of authority set up in opposition to the board and the chairman would be wrong <e>", "<cs> i have sat on a number of boards and been chairman of many boards of various shapes and sizes <e> <s> one thing which i certainly have learned is that one should not be too hidebound in ones approach to this particular issue <e> <s> i think that companies requirements vary <e> <s> i believe that there are occasions when a very large non-executive content is an advantage <e> <s> indeed in the company which i chair at the moment two-thirds of the directors on a large board are non-executive <e> <s> however on other boards with which i have been concerned there has been a small non-executive element <e> <s> therefore i believe that we should have considerable flexibility in the matter <e>", "<cs> first i declare an interest in that i am a member of the takeover panel <e> <s> that gives me the advantage of a not inconsiderable experience of sitting on the panel and hearing many cases <e> <s> i shall not detain the committee by going over the ground so admirably covered by the noble and learned lord lord roskill <e> <s> he has painted the advantages in a way which i think is clear and in my experience entirely accurate <e>", "<cs> then i am sure that the noble lord will be able to confirm from his own experience the results so ably outlined by the noble and learned lord lord roskill <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> at the moment it has been conceded that this is a suggestion contained in the directive which is open for discussion and i understand and certainly hope that the government will strongly oppose it <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord roskill has said these regulations would produce a less effective and less stringent control than we have at present <e> <s> i think it would be very unfortunate if we were to accept a lowering of standards in order to comply with some ec-imposed regulation <e> <s> i hope that we shall not reach that situation <e>", "<cs> i hope it will help if i inform my noble friend that there is a working party within the takeover panel which is looking at a great range of points which the noble lord has mentioned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am not a member of the working party <e> <s> it is considering various issues such as the threshold for compulsory bids and other matters which have been debated widely outside this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the intention of the amendment but i share many of the reservations that have been put forward both by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne and by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i have two points on which i wish to comment briefly first the method of valuation or assessment of research and development <e> <s> such a valuation must be meaningful <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond remarked on how it should be treated in the accounts <e> <s> but the accounts are a fairly mixed bag which can list expenditure which is used just for maintaining the business and also expenditure on long-term research <e> <s> it is difficult to be sure how one can accurately define that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> with great respect to him does he not believe that the giving of one global figure for research and development as the amendment suggests might be misleading <e> <s> is it perhaps better to rely on a breakdown to give an evaluation of the various component parts and the value attached to them as appears in ssap <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare an interest as a member of the takeover panel <e> <s> i am sorry that the chairman of the panel my noble friend lord alexander of weedon has had to leave the chamber and is unable to be here because i know that he wanted to take part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recall seeing a representative of the trades union congress on the panel <e> <s> however i stand open to correction and i am sure that the noble lord will check whether or not that is the case <e> <s> the panels members represent a broad selection of people with knowledge and experience in the interests of those for whom the panel was set up namely for the defence and protection of the investors <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i believe that i prompted the point that was raised namely that a working party had been looking at a whole variety of changes that may be necessary <e> <s> earlier in todays proceedings reference was made to leverage bids <e> <s> if such measures are introduced it is necessary to look at the rules and see what changes are required in order to cope with them <e> <s> this is a continuing process <e> <s> there are a number of areas that have caused concern in the last year or so <e> <s> i know that those matters are being reviewed <e> <s> the panel is not making any fundamental changes of structure but it is making sure that its rules evolve and develop to meet the changing conditions of the financial world <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that these links are not confined to industry but extend to commerce and particularly to organisations such as banks which have made considerable provision by way of equipment and other items to try to educate the young in economics and the business world <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the report of the kearton committee <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord on its presentation <e> <s> it was interesting to hear the speech of the noble lord lord greenhill who put the report in the context of foreign affairs of which he has vast experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord lord donaldson will not expect me to follow him on that last point <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord byron on his maiden speech <e> <s> as has <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me is he applying the same argument to the magistrates courts <e> <s> surely one must expect the same standard of justice in those courts <e> <s> does he believe that the person who takes instructions should not conduct the defence in magistrates courts <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that for some time now businesses from european community countries operating within hong kong have been attracting key staff to their hong kong businesses by offering them passports in their european countries the effect of which has been to deprive british and indigenous hong kong companies of key people at the same time giving those people the right of access to the community and the uk <e> <s> for that reason among many others his statement today is particularly timely and welcome <e>", "<cs> i like my noble friend lord renton support the spirit and the motive of the amendment but like him i have grave reservations about it <e> <s> a report to the general public does not seem appropriate <e> <s> like my noble friend i believe that if we are to have a report it should be to parliament <e> <s> secondly i wonder whether a committee to report within five years is appropriate because it is a continuing exercise <e> <s> a continuing review through questions in another place and here in the normal process of parliamentary government is far more appropriate than setting up a special committee <e>", "<cs> we have been debating whether clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> if clause does not stand part of the bill then part i falls <e> <s> it is common ground in all parts of the house that the objective of part i is to deal with clogging up of litigation through the courts and the delays and problems that are caused <e> <s> for the past seven hours or so we have been debating what clause does and the problems that it creates <e> <s> in that time a number of assurances have been given by my noble and learned friend that the points raised have been much in his mind although he has not given an undertaking about what he will do <e> <s> it is therefore now appropriate for us to decide that clause should remain part of the bill <e> <s> we shall have the opportunity to return to those points at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i was attracted to the suggestion made by my noble and learned friend lord benson that the words equivalent or better should be used <e> <s> however my noble and learned friend then pointed out the fact that his amendment when read together with amendment no <e> <s> a achieves exactly the same result <e> <s> it is that the ways must be new or better while maintaining the proper and efficient administration of justice <e> <s> that amounts to the same as using the words equivalent or better <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i together with all members of the committee recognise the correctness of the objective illustrated by the moving of the amendment by my noble friend lord alexander <e> <s> i also recognise as i am sure other members of the committee do the effectiveness with which the bar has operated the cab rank rule <e> <s> however the noble lord lord mishcon has illustrated through the amendment that he has tabled how the same result can be achieved by solicitor advocates <e> <s> we seek to achieve the objective referred to by my noble friend lord alexander the availability of advocates who accept legal aid and who will take any case <e> <s> the bar achieves that objective with the cab rank rule <e> <s> solicitors will achieve it if the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mishcon is carried <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson and my noble friend lord rippon laid considerable stress on the constitutional issue the independence of the judiciary which i understand <e> <s> i fully support that but i wonder whether they have overlooked the eventual supremacy of parliament which is above all other considerations <e> <s> the role of the lord chancellor is a very special role here <e> <s> i should have thought that the constitutional position is perhaps not as strong as they make out in suggesting that the role of the lord chancellor should be taken over by the lord chief justice <e>", "<cs> i understand those points but both my noble friends made considerable play of the constitutional importance of the appointment <e>", "<cs> while i agree with much that my noble friend has said with regard to his experience which i share i think that we should be careful about carrying this argument too far <e> <s> if we carried it to the conclusion that would flow from the argument of the noble lord lord murray it would mean that government of this country would be run by the civil servants who know all the intricacies of government and goodness only knows they are far greater and not by the vast lay majority that occupy both houses <e>", "<cs> my noble friend no doubt will accept that the schedule which he criticises was drafted by a lawyer or lawyers <e> <s> does he agree that in his claimed role as a layman his contribution is of great value <e> <s> the criticism that he makes on the drafting of lawyers might be a point in support of having lay members or a majority of lay members on this committee <e>", "<cs> in view of the comments of my noble and learned friend lord hailsham perhaps i may point out that industry and commerce are involved in all those matters that he listed with the exception of family courts and matrimonial matters so they would be ideal candidates <e> <s> in view of the comments of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i share the concern addressed by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it appears that we have two kinds of advice some one has regard to and some one does not have regard to <e> <s> i am not sure that i have followed the explanation of ray noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i understand that the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hutchinson is not based on the incapacity of an individual who has been given a right of audience but on the fact that he is employed by the crown prosecution service <e> <s> i understand that and i also understand what was said by the noble lord lord benson in his report <e> <s> what worries me is if it is said that one cannot get independence from police and prosecuting authorities by the employment of counsel for prosecutions in the crown court how do we obtain sufficient independence in the lower courts <e>", "<cs> in saying that he believed that trials on indictment are very different will the noble lord say whether he accepts the following <e> <s> if independence of the prosecution is essential for trials on indictment why is it not essential for prosecutions in the lower court <e> <s> alternatively does he believe that a lower standard of justice can be accepted in the lower courts than that for trials on indictment <e>", "<cs> i shall not attempt to follow my noble friend lord rippon in his wider comments on the impact that some of these clauses are likely to have on competition conflicts of interest and the like <e> <s> i am heartened to believe that perhaps we shall find ourselves in agreement at a later stage in the bill in the same way that i happen to agree with my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment would seriously restrict the choice of quality candidates and exclude those who have valuable experience in this field <e> <s> it will be the duty of the authorised conveyancing practitioners to help develop competition in the provision of conveyancing services <e> <s> industry in particular as expressed through the cbi is gravely concerned that one of the effects of these proposals will be to reduce the legal advice available in the high street to the medium and small sized businesses <e> <s> it believes that it is essential that on this board there should be sufficient experienced advice to enable some of the practices that might otherwise operate to adverse effect on the local solicitors firms predatory pricing tying arrangements and the like to be avoided <e> <s> it believes it essential that there should be experienced and wise advice on this board to enable some of these practices to be monitored and avoided <e> <s> it would certainly oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will look at the matter further <e> <s> it has the ring of seeking to develop competition and of encouraging cut-throat competition which does not necessarily go with the highest standards of integrity and fair dealing <e> <s> i am mindful that in the provisions covering the securities and investments board which is similar in its intentions it is not charged with such duty <e> <s> its main task is to make regulations which must promote high standards of integrity and fair dealing in the conduct of the investment business <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to amendment no <e> <s> azc which stands in my name <e> <s> the issue is rather wider and i suggest more important than some of the discussions on drafting which we have <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend has taken account of the fact that building societies and banks are mainly tied agencies as regards insurance and therefore are not allowed to give any other advice on a better policy and so on <e> <s> most mortgages are now linked with endowment policies <e> <s> therefore in that case the purchaser or mortgagor is not able to get the independent financial advice from one of those authorities which he could get and would get if he went to an independent solicitor <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may intervene at this point <e> <s> it may be that i have not done my homework adequately but can he clarify the following situation <e> <s> under his amendment what would be the remedy in the case of a building society undertaking probate services which caused acute delay and so on and which is not subject to the disciplines applicable under the law society rules which would apply to a solicitor who did likewise <e> <s> it may be that i have not followed his argument but does his amendment provide any disciplinary protection in such cases <e>", "<cs> i asked whether there is a similar discipline which could be applied to those people other than members of the law society that is those working in building societies and the like who are granted the right to operate and apply for probate but who do so in such a way that if they were solicitors complaints would be made which would lead to the final discipline of their being struck off <e> <s> i asked whether his amendment contained or opened up some such discipline which would apply to other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the paper <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would read it in full <e> <s> unfortunately the noble lord lord donoughue extracted one sentence out of a long article <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> they have made many well-informed contributions <e> <s> in particular i thank my noble friend lord de la warr for making his maiden speech on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of common ground between those on both sides of the debate <e> <s> those who may not support the amendment are nevertheless fully sympathetic to the principle which lies behind it <e> <s> all noble lords will agree that it is right that there should be a competent advocate able to represent any citizen regardless of the issue <e> <s> i am sure that all members of your lordships house will agree that as far as possible advocates whether solicitors practising in the higher courts or members of the bar should work according to the same rules and that there should be a level playing field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i raise one other matter of important objection <e> <s> it is that lay clients of solicitors come to them off the street <e> <s> clients of members of the bar are referred to them by firms of solicitors <e> <s> there is a complete contrast in the circumstances in which the customers come <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for proposing this amendment which will go a long way to meet the point raised in committee <e> <s> i understand that he is proposing that when consulting he will be seeking a background in commercial affairs that that will remain among the desirable objectives and that he will certainly wish to consult bodies such as the cbi when considering candidates <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for this consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find the meaning of the clause particularly difficult to understand <e> <s> it might be slightly improved if the last six or seven words of the amendment began paragraph b <e> <s> it would then read that the functions of the advisory committee shall in relation to the provision of legal services have regard to the desirability and so on <e> <s> i should have thought that that would make it clearer and would achieve the objective that my noble and learned friend states that he seeks with this paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat worried about this subsection <e> <s> i would have agreed that the bill should provide that the findings of the ombudsman should be mandatory but the government have not seen fit to provide for that <e> <s> therefore there is pressure put upon the person to comply by his being told either you comply with what i have said or you will publish in such form as i specify that you have not complied and the reasons for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords speech has referred to the dangers which would flow if using his words all prosecutions were conducted by the crown prosecution service <e> <s> his amendment provides that no prosecutions should be carried out by that service <e> <s> does his argument rest on the word all or is there a half-way house with which he would be happy <e>", "<cs> my lords in other words the amendment says that no prosecutions in trials on indictment can be conducted by the crown prosecution service <e> <s> as i understood the noble lords argument and no doubt i shall be corrected if i am wrong he is saying that the dangers will flow if all prosecutions are conducted by the crown prosecution service <e> <s> there is a large gap between those two points <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving his amendment the noble lord lord hutchinson referred to the consequences that he believed would flow if all prosecutions were conducted by the crown prosecution service <e> <s> i entirely share his views on that <e> <s> it would be completely wrong <e> <s> but his amendment goes to the other extreme and says in effect that no prosecutions on indictment should be conducted by the crown prosecution service <e> <s> that is going to the other extreme <e> <s> it would eliminate from the ranks of those prosecuting people with the experience to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred people who have the qualities to carry such prosecutions and who might wish to cross the crown prosecution service back to the bar <e> <s> in his amendment the noble lord could have referred to a limit of some kind how the percentage would be defined i know not but to bar all prosecutions by the crown prosecution service is going too far <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept what my noble friend says <e> <s> i raised the point to give him the opportunity to respond <e> <s> we cannot accept any lower standard of justice in any part of the courts whether it be the magistrates court or the high court whether it be for trial on indictment or otherwise <e> <s> of course different skills may be needed before the magistrates court from those required for trial on indictment <e> <s> in this respect i go with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> surely therefore the crown prosecution service should be in a position to train and provide people with those various skills for the magistrates court and for the high court <e> <s> it would be wrong if the amendment of the noble lord lord hutchinson barred all prosecutions on indictment being carried out by anyone within the crown prosecution service <e> <s> i hope that he will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sympathetic to the argument put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i shall not repeat the grounds that he has given in support of the argument <e> <s> i found them convincing <e> <s> all the information that i have been given fully justifies them <e> <s> indeed there are many instances of abuses to which he has referred <e> <s> those are likely to be aggravated if the bill remains in its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may try to clarify the point <e> <s> i see the duties of the authorised practitioner in so far as he is doing the work that was otherwise done by the high street solicitor to be identical and it is for the building society if it is employing a professional person in order that he may do the conveyancing work to accept a fiduciary responsibility to that person that a firm of solicitors would accept from its client <e> <s> that includes such matters as disclosure of commission accounting and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> if i have understood him correctly he accepts the obligation for the professional person acting in the matter to accept the same fiduciary duties as a solicitor has to his client <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend feels able to look at that point to see whether he can bring something forward to underline that duty i shall happily not proceed further with the amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble and learned friend is able to give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> in anticipation of his being able to achieve something to meet my problem i recognise the drafting difficulties i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> there would seem to be three courses open when a recommendation of the ombudsman is not followed <e> <s> the first is for the powers to be mandatory so that they are bound to be complied with <e> <s> secondly if they are not complied with and are left in discretionary form it should be for the ombudsman himself to publish that the recommendations have not been complied with and for him to give his comments upon that <e> <s> thirdly in accordance with the provision in the bill and one with which i disagree the ombudsman requires the person who was defaulted to publish that fact and as my noble friend lord renton said to possibly publish a libel or something defamatory about himself and to do so at his own expense <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment <e> <s> in defining the general duty of the board it should be made clear and i am sure that my noble and learned friend wishes it that it should be fair competition and that that will not only be developed but also maintained <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said competition can take many forms and some of those can be very unfair <e> <s> against the weight of some of the large financial institutions here i believe that it is important that the board should have a general duty to develop and maintain fair competition <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed with the response of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i suggest that it goes right against the trend of current legislation and indeed of current government philosophy on consumer protection <e> <s> we spent many days in this chamber discussing the financial services bill <e> <s> in that bill we spent a great deal of time on consumer protection on polarisation and on chinese walls being established in order to prevent any conflicts of interest arising <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lords who have spoken in congratulating my noble and learned friend on the ability courtesy and stamina the pure staying power that he has shown during the long days that the bill has been before the house <e> <s> i have found in almost all cases that the lucidity of his answers to points raised has been convincing <e> <s> as he knows i have certain reservations on a couple of matters which i shall not detain the house by raising again except to say that i hope that they will be looked at in another place and considered again <e>", "<cs> my lords i was involved in the principle of the bill well before it came to the other place and this house <e> <s> i strongly supported the principle of the benefits that it produces to students <e> <s> i may not have agreed with all the practicalities that were suggested but i strongly supported the principle <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat hesitant about entering into what is essentially a scottish debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend put those figures in context <e> <s> what has been the annual average rate of inflation in the united kingdom since may <e> <s> how does that compare with the annual average rate of inflation of the european community countries during the same period <e> <s> secondly how does it compare with the record of the previous labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend expect that the european commission will share the pleasure of the british taxpayer who sees this company which for so long lost money in the public sector now making money in the private sector and also making very good cars <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the stability of the exchange rate mechanism is bound to be influenced perhaps severely in the short term by the impact of the unification of the two german currencies <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that if the labour partys proposals for a new tax on income were ever to be implemented they would have a disastrous impact on the savings ratio whatever the level previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i accepted that the noble lord should speak before me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble lord lord ezra because as he reminded your lordships he and i sat together on the committee in <e> <s> i hope to refer to that later in my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree <e> <s> the noble lord did not specifically do so but he cannot criticise the whole department as he did without inflicting criticism on those who carry out policies <e> <s> of course his criticisms were in the main directed at ministerial control but it is difficult not to say that part of that criticism must pass on to officials who have been responsible for monopolies and mergers and many of the matters to which he referred <e> <s> however i note the noble lords assurance that he was not criticising officials which i welcome <e>", "<cs> i feel that there is a misunderstanding on the part of the noble lord lord monson and my noble friend lord mancroft when he spoke to the previous amendment <e> <s> the offence is causing or permitting a child under to ride without headgear <e> <s> that obtains whether that person is the owner of the horse or has control or custody of it <e>", "<cs> it is made quite clear that none of the people mentioned in subsection is responsible <e>", "<cs> the principle remains as it always has in criminal law with regard to the burden of proof <e> <s> someone has to prove that the owner failed to permit withdrew permission or allowed a child to ride without a hat <e>", "<cs> a number of resolutions that come before the committee should be positive <e> <s> however the provision does not fall within that category <e> <s> the regulations are straightforward <e> <s> the committee has passed an amendment relating to the consultations which must take place before they are made <e> <s> i believe that we should leave the provision in the form of a negative resolution <e>", "<cs> i have a special and perhaps unique interest to declare in that i was once bound over and remain bound over for keeping a dog in unsafe custody <e> <s> i had a most lovable terrier one of which my noble and learned friend lord hailsham would approve which happened to bite the relief postman <e> <s> having said that i entirely support the intention of the amendment it is right but i cannot support the amendment in its present form <e> <s> i share the reservations expressed by my noble friend lord gibson-watt <e> <s> i shall not weary the committee by repeating them <e> <s> the amendment is not perfect in achieving the objectives which are set for it <e> <s> the questions proposed in the green paper are valid <e> <s> i hope that the government will press ahead gather responses to those questions and in the light of those responses bring in such further measures as should be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to enter into this debate until the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris referred to it as being a discrimination against the advertising industry <e> <s> it was put in similar terms by those who have supported him in this amendment <e> <s> to my mind the discrimination is the other way round it is the amendment that asks for discrimination in favour of the advertising industry <e> <s> i agree with the right reverend prelate when he said that this bill is concerned with the viewer and the ultimate consequences to him <e> <s> the problems that the advertising industry and others may have in meeting the terms of the bill may be of concern to them <e> <s> the bill is directed at providing certain standards for the viewer <e> <s> i find it difficult to see why we should discriminate in favour of the advertising industry when so much of the viewers time is inevitably spent looking at the advertisements <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the credit balance earned by invisible exports in the past and at present is a major <e>", "<cs> my lords the longer the debate goes on the more convinced i am that the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is the one which i find most attractive <e> <s> it is quite clear that there are substantial divisions within the house as there have been in the other place <e> <s> i dislike the registration scheme of my noble friend lord stanley for the reasons which have been given by those opponents of it in this house although they were in a minority <e> <s> i also dislike although slightly less so the amendment proposed by the other place which is supported by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other speakers in congratulating the noble baroness lady castle of blackburn on her maiden speech <e> <s> i do so with particular pleasure because i made my maiden speech in another place on an occasion when the noble baroness was on the front bench conducting a transport bill through that house <e> <s> i am afraid that i made far less impact upon her and upon the house on that occasion than she made upon me and upon this house on the occasion of her maiden speech today <e>"]
