["<cs> my lords could i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask a question in connection with the statement <e> <s> it relates to the fact that ealing borough council were presumably not able to prevent the meeting <e> <s> in view of the fact that it was well known to the police that southall town hall is from a communications point of view practically the nerve centre of southall could not the police have made representations to ealing that the meeting should be transferred to a point where it could have been more easily contained and dealt with possibly with less damage <e> <s> the very fact that the police drafted in so many reinforcements shows that they must have known what was the situation with regard to that particular point in southall which i happen to know very well indeed <e> <s> i should have thought that ealing borough council could have been advised to transfer the meeting to another point even if they were not able to prevent it from taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the length of time and the very short time it took the government to recognise the dictatorship of president amin in uganda can they not speed up their recognition of this revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that they are committed to market forces operating generally could the noble earl say what is the governments policy <e> <s> why have they other than market forces operating in regard to fuel supplies <e> <s> would the noble earl also say what is an artificially low price <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the local authorities in the area have already been informed that there will be no second runway at gatwick but that what will be provided will be an alternative emergency runway which could be used only in cases of emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that because we have a greater preponderance of local authority housing in this country we have a greater liability to house people from other countries than other countries have to house our nationals in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord satisfied that the time that has been given for the preparation of the elections is sufficient under the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that china will probably be moving very cautiously having regard to its previous experience and its dependence on russia <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the intention of her majestys government to proceed in isolation on this matter or only in conjunction with our allies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the foreign secretary whether or not representations will be made to the company to suggest that the film should not be shown in any other countries thus not to harm relations further than has already happened <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a fact that some water authorities examined the position in regard to direct billing and found that local authorities were charging them more to collect the water rates than it cost to do it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords would the world be materially worse off if the debts were written off <e>", "<cs> i shall intervene only briefly <e> <s> i should have thought that one of the matters which the government must consider in not only this legislation but any legislation is what is the end product <e> <s> there is another dictum which we use from time to time namely not only must justice be done but it must be seen to be done <e> <s> if an individual can by-pass the whole of union machinery and go straight to a tribunal then what will be the end product whatever the decision of the tribunal <e> <s> that is what really matters <e> <s> we must have a decision which is seen by all concerned to be practical and proper in all circumstances <e> <s> the trade union machinery is devised to do just that but if it is deliberately bypassed by an individual what will be the result on the shop-floor after it it all over <e> <s> i ask the government to consider that point <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one small point on the question of small businesses and complying with the requirements of the law as it is at present <e> <s> presumably the first thing that an employer large or small has to do is to provide a contract of employment <e> <s> i should have thought that that involves the small employer in much greater difficulties than the matter of issuing the necessary warnings prior to dismissal <e> <s> incidentally as a good deal of the question of dismissal may well depend upon the contract of employment is this the first move and soon shall we be having complaints about the contract of employment as well and therefore small firms will not he required to adhere to that either <e> <s> once we start this particular erosion of conditions it does not end there <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government say to what extent enhanced capital value due to property speculation is taken into account by rent officers in assessing rents <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies to that may i <e>", "<cs> instead of expressing the situation in percentage terms can the noble lord give the number of houses involved in regard to the position under the last labour government <e>", "<cs> there is one small point that i should like to draw to the ministers attention <e> <s> the up-to-date situation is that with the almost cessation of council house building in some areas local authorities feel compelled to restrict their building efforts to building more places for old people <e> <s> that goes to show that this happens to be the most urgent sector at present <e> <s> therefore nothing should be done to reduce the stock in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble viscount tell us with regard to these admirable new factories that are being put up whether occupants have already been found for them or whether it is really a case of transferring unemployment from one area to another <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that any ratepayer who feels aggrieved has power to ask the district auditor to investigate these payments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider the further point that in many cases it will not be the value of the prefab but the value of the site that will be the attraction <e> <s> having regard to what single-house property sites cost these days if there is a site of a reasonable size with drainage road access lighting and everything else provided it would be a very great temptation to want to buy it <e> <s> you would get the odd ones bought in particular places which very often would prohibit the local authority doing proper redevelopment of the area <e> <s> i think that that in itself would be undesirable <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl explain a little further <e> <s> if there are no objections at all and the order comes to the minister for confirmation how will the minister find out that there might be some people around who might be affected by the order without going for a public inquiry or something of that kind <e> <s> if he is to have any grounds for including people who have not objected in the first case but who might object if it comes to the minister how does the minister find out <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether any british ships are caught up in the fighting and if so what can be done to help them <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i put just a small point which is perhaps general rather than particular <e> <s> i think it is important that legislation should be positive <e> <s> at the present time the governments proposals are not positive and while there may be machinery for departing from the structure plan this should be very clearly set out as has been done in the amendment <e> <s> we cannot have absolute rigidity obviously <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say what is the estimated gain either to the treasury or to the national insurance fund as a result of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord estimate what might be the cost of indexing pensions if there were a cut-off of pensions in excess of a year <e>", "<cs> my lords in cases of this kind where persons make complaints which are widely publicised and which are apparently not withdrawn but they are unwilling to give evidence and the crown is considering a prosecution does the prosecution in scotland not proceed with the case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to explain exactly how that would be exercised <e> <s> the secretary of state does not propose to take any active part and the shareholders happen to be the state <e> <s> precisely who will make this particular move in regard to the possibility of an unsuitable nominee for the board if all the other members of the board accept that nomination <e> <s> what <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make just one point on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am entirely in sympathy with the principle but i am a little concerned with the economies of it <e> <s> take the countryside one can easily in the course of duty travel miles to carry out an assignment or keep an appointment <e> <s> if you take the economics of going miles by car or miles by cycle and remember it is in the employers time and you are being paid for the time as well it seems to me that the case which is argued for the centre of a city could hardly be applicable generally throughout the country it would be completely uneconomic <e> <s> it would be very nice to start off a journey on a nice day and just about complete the journey by lunchtime <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that helicopters are very noisy and we do not want more of them if we can possibly help it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that this is another example of the operation of international power politics <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say precisely how much longer we in britain will have to stand a much greater cost for defence per head of the population than our allies in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords has not much of the so-called nationalisation of industry which was referred to in the question been very largely due to the failure of private enterprise itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the ministers reference to precepting i should like to know whether if that is to be considered it will be considered as a whole and certainly not against one particular authority when we bear in mind how many precepting authorities there are in the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that this case highlights the grave dangers that exist all the time in permitting british companies to go out of business or to be taken over by foreign companies who regard their operations here as only peripheral and who whenever they run into trouble close those places which are on the periphery <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether whatever political settlement is arrived at it is likely that none will be agreed by south africa unless her commercial interests are well looked after and that these commercial interests of south africa fit in very well with british commercial interests <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what funds are likely to be available from the community to deal with the problems arising from unemployment having regard to the huge amounts required for the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be proper for one government department requesting such information or any information from another department to say for what purpose they required the information and not merely to ask for it <e> <s> because it could be used for any purpose once it has been transferred <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say whether or not it would be desirable for the syrian army to be withdrawn and a less partisan body put in charge of the peace negotiations and keeping the peace in that country <e>", "<cs> i think i heard the minister use the phrase over the lifetime of the parliament <e> <s> does that mean the government could go for three or four years without making good a shortfall <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was intimately concerned with the affairs of southall for a very long time may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware i am sure he is that the asian population of southall generally is no less law-abiding than the native population <e> <s> in fact in my experience they are every bit as law-abiding <e> <s> therefore we have to look to some extent at the causes of the present situation <e> <s> there is undoubtedly i do not know whether the minister is aware of it a growing feeling among the asian population in southall that they have got to defend themselves against fascist and skinhead attacks and they appear to be grouping for this particular purpose <e> <s> i know that the police position is extremely difficult but the asian population in southall get the impression that the police are defending these fascist elements who after all are imported into the district they are not native to the district generally speaking and i believe that this is one of the basic causes of the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to real wages <e> <s> can the government distinguish between the increases in real wages and the increases which are due purely to catching up with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the object of providing the police with greater protection is in order to enable them to move into the crowd instead of standing distant from them as they have to at the present time in the light of petrol bombs and things of that kind <e> <s> in those circumstances having regard to the anxiety there is about the use of plastic bullets if the object of the police is to get into crowds and break them up plastic bullets used in those circumstances would be very dangerous <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be wise to lay less emphasis on plastic bullets and leave them very much in abeyance and see what arises from other actions before there is any question of the possible use of plastic bullets <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the present incomes policy coupled with unemployment is the means by which wage restraint is being exercised at present <e> <s> and is it the intention of the government to continue along those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say whether or not it would be desirable to separate the prescription of glasses from the supply so that there is some freedom of choice <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the fact that the indexation is for the purpose of providing against hardship among pensioners will the noble baroness say whether or not there ought to be a cutoff point where the hardship no longer applies <e>"]
