["<cs> my lords i had a self-denying ordinance on the debates on the act which we are now burying because as chairman of a very active and successful quango in the principality i felt i should keep silent <e> <s> we were one of the bodies which might have been subsumed by the assembly and therefore had slightly too direct an interest in the matter <e> <s> i must confess quite frankly that i am very glad that that particular possibility has been removed from us <e> <s> on the other hand i have another interest <e> <s> it is now more than years since mr cledwyn hughes whom we shall shortly have the pleasure of welcoming to your lordships house who was then secretary of state and i was minister of state at the welsh office put forward the proposal that arrangements should be made for the surveillance of nominated bodies in the principality and that they should be made more publicly answerable <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the order which was passed in the other place would permit them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords against the background of general policy so eloquently deployed by the noble lord lord alport to whom we are all greatly indebted it seems to me that there are probably four main issues on which we should like to take the mind of the government <e> <s> the first of course is the immediate matter of fairness and justice to students who are either already in mid-course or to whom firm offers have been made for the next academic year <e> <s> the next area of concern is the arbitrary effect of the measures taken by both the previous government and the present one on particular institutions or particular courses within those institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt but i do so in order to get the record straight because it is important <e> <s> will the noble baroness tell us whether the that she mentioned as though they were also a problem are not either self-financing in the proper sense of that word or directly exchanged <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness try to make it clear that they are not necessarily any burden <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank warmly all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> the ministers speech was very encouraging and i am sure that we are all grateful to him for it he went further than i thought he might <e> <s> but these are serious matters and i was particularly grateful to my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth because he widened the debate by asking i think the most important question of all <e> <s> are these very detailed matters what the community was really created for <e> <s> i think that that is the nub of the matter <e> <s> if we could get that straight then i think there would be less occasion for differences of views between some of us and our very warm friends in brussels <e> <s> on a personal basis we have the warmest regard for all of them but we find ourselves frequently in the difficult position of appearing to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might be allowed to add in reply to my noble friend lord shackleton that arrangements have been made for a visit to brussels in the first week of december by representatives of the sub-committee of the select committee <e> <s> i trust that the noble lord lord ashby and the noble earl lord cranbrook will both be able to come so that we can try to put to our friends in brussels the very real difficulties which we find not through any antagonism whatsoever towards the objectives which are common to both of us over the scientific methods employed and the lack of publication of scientific data on which we could reach considered judgments <e> <s> this is a peculiarly difficult directive <e> <s> we hoped that we should not have to discuss these water directives again <e> <s> but we were entirely convinced as the noble lord lord ashby made all too clear that what we were being asked to do was just practically unattainable or unascertainable <e> <s> it was a nonsense <e> <s> the degree of particularity we were required to observe was quite unnecessary and was just not practicable for anybody who had studied the matter with water from a river not water in a laboratory <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i may speak for my noble friend lord nathan as well as for myself both of us are members of the royal commission on environmental pollution in saying how grateful we are in particular to the noble lord lord walston for introducing this debate on a report on which we spent many hours <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord walston thought i was trying to spoil his christmas recess but i also knew that when he really started reading the report he would enjoy it and find it interesting <e> <s> i therefore had no compunction at all in putting some pressure on him not least because i think we would all agree that he is certainly one of the best qualified persons in your lordships house to introduce a debate on such a subject being i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot generalise beyond a point on that <e> <s> that there may be too many regulations in certain directions i would not deny but that there are other tasks which are essential for modern agriculture if it is to be both acceptable and successful is quite clear to anybody who looks at this subject with attention <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to interrupt <e> <s> would he not agree that if you put a factory farm on to an industrial estate all the other industry would leave <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord orr-ewing indicated i had the pleasure of working with him as his deputy at the metrication board for about four years most amicably considering our difference of views on various ideological matters and other fields <e> <s> all of us who have had to deal with metrication in the united kingdom know that its history has been bedevilled by three things <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear said by decimalisation of the coinage secondly by confusion with issues connected with the european community and thirdly by the pusilianimous attitude of successive governments each in turn giving way to the temptation of simplistic populist appeal <e> <s> the trauma of decimalisation is surely behind us <e> <s> i cannot believe that any member of your lordships house really wants to go back to pence in the shilling <e> <s> if you do my lords then you are not the men i take you to be <e> <s> why therefore should we have so little confidence in our ability to overcome the loss of ounces in the pound or inches in the yard <e> <s> to anyone brought up in the modern world to choose to waste ones energies in the extra labour of calculations involved with such units when one can do it by moving a decimal point is ludicrous <e>", "<cs> that is dead and gone too is it not <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged <e>", "<cs> it shows a complete lack of imaginative understanding of what remarks of that kind mean to those of us who know <e> <s> i hold no brief for people who throw eggs and tomatoes when a minister of the crown visits the area but i can understand why because it was symbolic of something which appeared to be i am sure it was not in fact a kind of dehydrated indifference to what we had all experienced either directly or because of the family emotions and traditions that are passed on from one generation to another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but would he not perhaps agree that the distinction between an official language and a working language is a valid one <e> <s> we might get by with two or maybe three working languages but of course the documentation must be in all the official languages <e>", "<cs> my lords my sympathy for the noble lord lord seebohm and his team has been mounting <e> <s> this is no reflection whatsoever on any noble lords who have taken part in this debate for every speech tonight has been extremely constructive <e> <s> we also are grateful to the minister for having given us such a careful and detailed reply better than i expected franklyand of course needless to sayi mean the details <e> <s> we are very grateful <e> <s> it only remains for me once again to thank all noble lords who have taken part and to thank noble lords for some generous references to myself they are deeply appreciated <e> <s> as all that we are doing in this motion is to ask noble lords to take note of two significant and interesting reports i have no wish to withdraw the motionand i hope that it will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment he will have heard confirmed by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford what i had already briefly referred to in my own remarks that as we understand it a number of the water authorities are already voluntarily complying <e> <s> if the major water authorities including the major industrial ones as i understood from the noble lord lord nugent are already doing this on a voluntary basis then the disparity in resources cannot be all that large <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank most warmly the select band who have contributed to this brief debate <e> <s> it is not a subject which arouses great popular concern but it is important particularly for the industries both the water industry side and the industrial producers in this country that we try to get these matters as correct and as workable as possible <e> <s> nevertheless i think that there is a case for the plea that i put forward that was not in fact touched upon by the noble lord that is for something which one could hand for example to the meps <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when some respondents to this survey were asked what in their view was the main cause of delay to industrial metrication they put high on the list government vacillation <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this applies to all governments of every complexion at least for the last decade <e> <s> but is he also aware that only per cent <e> <s> of those who responded gave as their opinion that metrication is not necessary <e> <s> the corollary of that is that per cent <e> <s> believe it to be necessary <e> <s> as someone who has worked on this matter for a very long time will he take it from me that the cost to industry of <e>", "<cs> i realise that these matters have been dealt with very expeditiously <e> <s> nevertheless when one considers the interest and emotion aroused in the principality we should at least draw attention to the fact that there are two welsh persons present and that we very much welcome this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> may we know which ones <e>", "<cs> my lords may we have just the numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord the end result is very different <e>", "<cs> may i support what has been said by my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that members in all parts of the committee will recognise that voluntary organisations do not have vast resources at their disposal <e> <s> in fact at the present time with inflation it is extremely difficult for some of them to maintain even the very small supporting staff they have to work with <e> <s> as their name implies voluntary organisations are mainly voluntary <e> <s> a few of them can afford to employ absolutely basic staff but no more <e> <s> if they are not called into consultation it is very difficult for them to keep track of what is going on <e>", "<cs> i was deeply disappointed by the speech of the noble earl lord avon because he did not seem to appreciate the full gravity of the position in relation to sites which have after all been examined with some thoroughness by the nature conservancy council <e> <s> there can of course always be differences of view as to the relative significance of various factors but i will quote from a speech made in the other place last june by a junior minister at the welsh office because in wales we have at the moment an important exercise on the berwyns where the nature conservancy council wishes we all tend to use the word designate because it comes readily to the lips to designate a major site of special scientific interest <e> <s> the colleague of the noble earl in the other place said <e>", "<cs> because the controls were applied too late the order was available on monday afternoon and he cut everything down on sunday <e> <s> that happened because the persons in the locality had not woken up quickly enough to the possible threat to this area of woodland and it had not of course been designated as a site of special scientific interest <e> <s> had it been then conceivably even he might have recognised the situation and not carried out the destruction for which he was responsible <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i was misunderstood <e> <s> the procedure has been going on for quite some time <e> <s> it has not yet reached finality <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies may i ask him about his remarks concerning amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he said that it would be unreasonable for the notice to be effective from the day on which the bill becomes operative <e> <s> that is not what the amendment says <e> <s> it says from the day on which the notice is served <e> <s> there are situations where if you are served with a notice which is not immediately operative you then proceed rapidly to destroy if you are so minded <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend if he can tell me what happens then to the sites of geological or physiographical features of which there are about seven or eight <e>", "<cs> this surely could be a matter of phrasing so that it was not mandatory but open to the court <e> <s> after all if you are taking imprisonment out which i am all in favour of i think we are unanimous in that and the government must find a way of meeting it you are left with monetary penalities only <e> <s> that depends very much on the circumstances of the person concerned it may be a genuine penality or it may be something for which he does not care two hoots <e> <s> but if he feels that it is possible that he may be obliged to waste all the work that he has done surely this is making the penalty fit the crime <e> <s> i would have supposed that psychologically apart from monetarily this could have quite a strong effect <e> <s> i think most farmers would think twice before putting themselves in the situation where they risked if it were contrary to the appropriate regulations looking foolish among other things <e> <s> the farming community is a fairly closed community and if a chap has done something and then has to go and grub it all up he will not feel all that pleased when he goes to the bull and bear on the saturday because people will be pulling his leg about it <e> <s> i am not being entirely frivolous <e> <s> this question of the esteem of your peers is strong in most circles of society <e> <s> i would have thought that was one reason among others why at any rate the idea contained in this amendment is a very sound one <e>", "<cs> as a member of coenco of which the noble lord lord craigton is chairman i should like briefly to echo what he and my noble friend have said <e> <s> we had supposed that on this clause at any rate the government might have realised the strength of feeling in the conservation movement in this country <e> <s> i am just lost for words <e> <s> thank you for nothing <e> <s> that is all that one can say <e> <s> it is deeply disappointing <e> <s> we recognise that there are problems about some of these matters but we have had no substantive encouragements of any kind <e> <s> i can only say that we are deeply depressed and disappointed <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble baroness would agree with me that if she were living in one of those charming border towns near her home there must be conservation areas there i think they have them in scotland too do they not <e> <s> and if one was in a conservation area it would be very similar to having an sssi on ones land <e> <s> in other words there is something there which is of public value as my noble friend said and of course if you are so fortunate as to be in a conservation area in an urban setting you are there because there is something distinctive about that area <e> <s> but you are under various constraints as to what you may do with your property <e> <s> surely it is very similar if you have an sssi on your land you are under certain constraints <e> <s> but you are under certain constraints for a reason because that particular area of land is important for nature conservation <e> <s> you get some tax advantage which i do not myself understand but i am sure it is significant and surely the person in that situation can turn it into an asset <e> <s> you can describe all the beauties of the estate and then say and we have even got an sssi <e> <s> this is the attitude we should adopt <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i was not able to be here when the matter was raised on rd february but i have read the <e>", "<cs> for once i have considerable sympathy with the government front bench <e> <s> it seems to me that one needs both <e> <s> i speak as a citizen of a small country which in certain parts is absolutely invaded by people who come to the countryside and behave in a way which is bound to cause intense irritation to those who live there <e> <s> an example i could give is the aran mountain area of wales <e> <s> persons from outside that area have issued a guidebook for those who wish to walk rock climb and so on which disregards the convenience or the rights of those who live and work in that area without a by-your-leave and after no consultation with them <e> <s> they were made welcome when they first came but they have caused such irritation more than that real bitter anger at the inconsiderate way in which they have behaved <e>", "<cs> i should also like to add my voice <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord bellwin on the front bench and we are delighted to welcome him on the front bench <e> <s> his name appears on a number of amendments and i hope that he will take this matter seriously as well as the noble earl lord avon who has had to do most of the work on the parts of the bill which i have attended at any rate <e> <s> we really believed that we were to have some advance from the government on clause <e> <s> unless we get some advance it will be a great disappointment to all those who put in such a tremendous amount of voluntary work in protecting both wildlife and the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words as i came in on this point at the committee stage <e> <s> what concerns me is the proposal for a code of conduct which as i was in my native land yesterday i did not even see until this morning which is to be laid before parliament and which has to obtain the assent of parliament <e> <s> yet once parliament has given that assent there is no means whatever by which that code of conduct can be put into effect <e> <s> parliament is being asked to enact something which is not legislation in the normal sense of the word it is simply asking people to follow a no doubt most desirable code which surely could be done by administrative action <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest for one moment that they would do anything illegal i do not wish to be misunderstood <e> <s> above the law usually means that you are trying to do something illegal <e> <s> what they are asking for is that the law should be different for them which is not quite the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords all that i said was that i had not seen it until this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put to the noble earl for reflection between now and third reading the point that if on third reading my noble friend wishes to revert to the matter we could at least get in this house a declaration of general intent <e> <s> that could then be amended in the other place at the instance of the government <e> <s> then we would at least be giving the other place some lead as to the intent <e>", "<cs> my lords this goes wider than national parks and i am glad it does because there are certain areas in wales for example where they are not in national parks they should be sssis but they have not necessarily been designated and i think i gave too rosy a picture last week when i was discussing the triumverate of the nature conservancy council the forestry commission and farming interests <e> <s> i understand now that i have got myself more up to date that it has not been working perhaps quite as smoothly as one might have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not think that if this amendment were put down the government might then think of this problem <e> <s> whereas if it is not put down we shall simply go on as we are at the moment where hill farmers for extremely expensive marginal food production get rather more than per cent <e> <s> of their incomes one way or another from public funds <e> <s> there may be better ways to do it <e> <s> it does not necessarily have to come from the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> if this amendment is put down the government might have time to think how in more practical ways they could meet the problem which is a very real one and bring forward their own amendment in another place <e> <s> if we do not put it down the other place will never think of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord ridley was able to discuss this matter very briefly at the committee stage but for technical reasons it was not possible for him to have a vote on the amendment which he then moved <e> <s> it seems to me important that tonight late though the hour is we should consider this matter and in particular find out exactly how the mind of the noble earl lord avon has been working in the interim <e> <s> he said quite clearly that he would be happy to consider the amendment of the noble viscount lord ridley at the report stage but there has been no indication that the government themselves proposed to table an amendment on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me there was a proposition only a few months ago which fortunately was defeated that there should be coniferous forests in ogwen at the foot of snowdon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether there is any intention on the part of the government to strengthen the amenity and conservation membership of the regional committees <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble earl is obviously an expert on this subject perhaps he can answer the question that i put to the noble earl lord avon <e> <s> is there any reason why that method of payment should not be used where there is a compulsory rather than a voluntary management agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i would point out that the situation is not equal in the sense that in the last resort the farmer can hang out whereas the local authority has no further power after the -months period has expired <e>", "<cs> may i add that it is rather like the wolf and the lamb argument my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the only point that i am still not entirely clear about is the point on compensation where the noble earl quite properly said that the present arrangement would be for lump sums only <e> <s> it appears to me that that is not necessarily immutable <e> <s> he later said that there might be some difficulties <e> <s> every government says that there are difficulties about changing arrangements <e> <s> i do not believe that that is an insuperable argument for substituting ultimately if necessary a compulsory management agreement if that seems to be the most suitable thing to do <e> <s> so i do not think that his argument was the least conclusive <e> <s> i think that we want to come to a decision so i shall not comment if noble lords will forgive me on any of the other points that have been made in this interesting debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like most sincerely to thank every noble lord who has taken part in this debate and also to express my gratitude for the very kind remarks that have been made both about the work of the committee and the work of those who <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not having had time to consult about this proposed new clause <e> <s> in general one welcomes it but with the noble lord lord renton one cannot help having some apprehensions about the internal drainage boards in particular <e> <s> as the noble earl lord avon rightly said sometimes they are not particularly strongly staffed <e> <s> i am concerned about some of the things which happen at the instance of internal drainage boards who for reasons which seem to them to be right and proper straighten out canalise banks cut down trees and shrubs and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not able to be in the house for the second reading of this bill and as this is the first occasion since i ceased to be a member of the british waterways board and can therefore speak without restraint i felt i could not let this opportunity pass without making some reference to clause of the bill the principal clause <e> <s> it was referred to at some length in the brief second reading debate on rd march <e> <s> i do so partly because i have great sympathy with the points made then by my noble friend lord underhill <e> <s> i felt that we should not allow this bill to leave this house without perhaps putting into better perspective the problems which are evoked by this clause than the noble lord lord skelmersdale was able to do on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i was at fault <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl enlighten me please <e> <s> if this proposal which he has agreed by correspondence only is so admirable and so equitable and so practical and all the other pleasant adjectives one can think of why is it not possible for it to be included in the legislation not necessarily of course in the forms that are now before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords at least i come with a fresh mind <e>", "<cs> as chairman of the select committee of your lordships house on the european communities i should like very strongly to support the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> i do so partly on a point arising out of the paragraph which we are now discussing and partly because the question arises later as the noble lord lord aylestone mentioned in reference to the power of the secretary of state by statutory instrument to designate certain types of service <e> <s> i think the noble baroness lady elles is herself aware that there has been correspondence about the position of the employees of the european institutions not only on this <e>", "<cs> it is a very odd harmony <e>", "<cs> i should like to pursue that <e> <s> surely the noble and learned lord would agree that although we have obligations to many other international organisations more particularly i would suppose to the united nations organisation and i hate to intervene when lawyers are in dispute our legal relationship with the european economic community is of a different nature from our relationship with other international organisations to which one might refer <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise this point <e> <s> this part of the clause must have been drawn up by a man <e>", "<cs> i should hope a bachelor <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has indicated it is absolutely absurd <e> <s> how could anybody expect to regulate their private life and some people are not very good at it in such a way that they could make quite sure that the birth of their child coincided with the appropriate moment of employment <e> <s> how many young couples after all will wait one year three months before they do anything <e> <s> because that really is what is being demanded in this clause <e> <s> you must be in a job and if you are married you must have a close period so to speak so that if you think you may be posted overseas your child does not arrive at any point before the requisite period <e> <s> that does not make sense at all <e> <s> you might possibly say a total period of employment before and after but to say that you must be employed for two years before you are allowed to have a child born overseas is nonsense <e>", "<cs> i never use that inelegant phrase <e> <s> but if my noble and learned friend will perhaps look at subsection <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister tell me whether if one maintained a subscription to shall we say brookss pratts or the athenaeum that would be regarded as being an adequate close connection with the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> with great respect the amendment to which we are addressing ourselves covers many aspects other than employment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> i am sorry i was not able to hear all the arguments put forward by the noble earl but am i right in thinking that if a period of three months notice is to be given during which if an area is to be designated as a site of special scientific interest representations may be made there will be no safeguard that no detrimental action can be taken during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord enlighten us and say whether this will be a taxable or a tax-free capital gain <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how greatly i welcome the speech which we have just heard from the noble earl lord peel because i think he has put his finger on so many of the points worrying a great number of us <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that the only matter which is strictly before us at the moment is an amendment which asks that the word shall should be replaced by the word may <e> <s> in other words that there should be some element of discretion left to the nature conservancy council on the one hand and the national park authorities in the appropriate circumstances on the other so that they would not be under an absolute obligation which is the situation in the bill as at present drafted to offer grants even though they feel that the case for not proceeding with a particular agricultural or forestry development is sustainable in light of conservation considerations if they are absolutely obliged in the circumstances where agreement has not been reached in the earlier stages with the assistance of adas <e> <s> i should like to say how delighted many of us are that in amendment no <e> <s> adas has been at long last formally brought into the proceedings <e> <s> but it has not of course been brought in in the comprehensive way which many of us would greatly have preferred <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord so soon in his speech <e> <s> would he not agree that the consensus is very far from complete and that those of us who have received representations from the acc and other bodies recognise that they are very apprehensive indeed <e> <s> there is no consensus there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the amendment standing in the names of my noble friends and myself <e> <s> needless to say we very warmly welcome the intention of amendment no <e> <s> which has been moved by the noble earl and all that we are attempting to do in this group of amendments and i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a b c and d is we hope to make a little more practical the proposals in the governments amendment <e> <s> we do so with the support of the countryside commission and i think the very lively sympathy of the association of county councils <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord digby if he supports our amendment no <e> <s> d <e>", "<cs> my lords i can entirely understand of course why at this late stage in the bill the government do not like any amendments who would <e> <s> on the other hand i must confess that i am disappointed <e> <s> after all what we are discussing is maps we are not discussing any major physical work or grants or anything difficult like that <e> <s> we are simply discussing maps <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not really all that difficult surely for the government to accept a somewhat wider definition than they have which is confined as i understand it exclusively to natural beauty <e> <s> how that can be said to take in the matters in which the noble lord lord melchett is interested i do not know <e> <s> i am not saying that he is not interested in natural beauty but his main interests i think lie elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to get no response to this sensible and generous piece of advice <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i think that i must ask those who are in support of amendment no <e> <s> a to indicate their support for it because it is a very sensible amendment <e> <s> lacking any further indication that the government will do something about this i would hope that we would show our opinion of the matter in the lobbies <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not worth moving <e>", "<cs> i have said all i wanted to say my lords <e> <s> as i received no co-operation at all i did not see why i should say any more <e>", "<cs> does that mean that amendment no <e> <s> d is left in the air my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but i think he will appreciate that this bill does not deal with the drinks to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords for reasons which i shall make plain in a moment i am very much restricted in my comments on this bill but i think i should say a few words because i believe i am the only member of your lordships house who was a member of the late lamented waste management advisory council <e> <s> i would confirm what my noble friend lord melchett has said to the best of my recollection the report which has been referred to by so many of your lordships already and no doubt will be referred to subsequently never came before the full council <e> <s> it was a working group set up by the council <e> <s> i felt that it was perhaps slightly reprehensible that so far as i can find in this report there is no indication that the report never came before the full council <e> <s> the full council as the noble earl lord avon may know was of course in limbo for a very long period before it was ultimately executed <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect we regarded the working party when it was established as a subsidiary of the main council <e> <s> normally when a subcommittee or a working group is set up its report is submitted to the body responsible for its establishment <e> <s> the main council never had any opportunity of commenting on this report <e> <s> one could envisage circumstances in which one might have suggested that parts of the report be referred back for further consideration <e> <s> i am not saying they would have been all i am saying is that there was no opportunity so to do <e> <s> as a member of the full council i felt that it was only proper that i should make this position clear <e> <s> there was one quite admirable member of the full council <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord i was almost going to call him my noble friend but he obviously is not <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords i was most interested <e> <s> i had no opportunity of making that interest effective as i might very well have done had the opportunity been offered <e> <s> those who are perhaps a little better informed than the noble lord lord craigton of what really happened about the waste management advisory council will appreciate that under the current administration we were left with no communication whatever for nearly two years not knowing whether we were still active or had been abolished <e> <s> as the noble earl may know i complained to some of his ministerial colleagues <e> <s> ultimately after very long period of complete inactivity in which we had no explanation at all we had the usual polite note telling us that our services were no longer required and that the waste management advisory council had ceased to exist

to exaggerate <e> <s> really is hardly a network <e> <s> how does he compare it with west germany for example where there are some disposal points <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned scotland but am i to take it that the secretary of state for wales will be making some different arrangements in the principality <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like most warmly to thank the noble earl lord cranbrook for his as always lucid and comprehensive exposition of the matter which is before us <e> <s> i am also delighted to know that the noble lord lord ashby has struggled from cambridge to be present <e> <s> but i much regret that my noble friend lord wynne-jones has found the climatic conditions so adverse that he alas <e> <s> is not with us

called drins <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps make clear at the outset that in general terms i support the order which is before us <e> <s> this puts me at variance <e>", "<cs> as i said previously my lords on that we are entirely at one but it is a point that should be made <e>", "<cs> it would be a very much better map from the point of view of water control <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords present today who sit on the european communities environment committee will appreciate that one of the great difficulties in europe is precisely that there are no authorities which can control cross-boundary rivers in their entirety <e> <s> we are extraordinarily fortunate from that point of view in our island situation in that we can do so <e> <s> the only place where we might have a slight difficulty would be northern ireland and the republic but fortunately those particular rivers are not of great consequence except locally <e>", "<cs> my lords could we be further enlightened <e> <s> is it not so that that is reciprocal so <e>", "<cs> my lords it does <e> <s> you can appoint somebody to be a member of the severn-trent from the welsh water authority but do you not then have to make a place for somebody from the severn-trent on the welsh authority which takes up one of the places <e>", "<cs> my lords under what category does that person the severn-trent man come on to the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that there will then be members <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very briefly to welcome this bill most warmly and to thank the noble lord lord abinger for introducing it on behalf of those of us in the principality of wales who are interested in these matters <e> <s> we have of course included in the bill a reference to our national museum of wales in cardiff <e> <s> it is not as ancient or as grand as the british museum but it has nevertheless a number of exhibits of very considerable distinction <e> <s> i have spoken recently with the director of our national museum and with the keeper of antiquities and both of them most warmly welcome the proposals which are included in the bill which is before us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the pleasure of listening to the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord chandos after which as the convention is one said that one hoped he would be heard frequently in this house <e> <s> i am sure that the speech which he has made this afternoon fully establishes him as a very <e>", "<cs> while my noble and learned friend is considering the response he might wish to make could i put in a plea to the minister <e> <s> i believe he is aware that in general the bill has very considerable support in your lordships house and there are situations sometimes when it would be extremely helpful if one of the government draftsmen could be asked to advise on a matter of this kind <e> <s> no doubt it is legally a tricky one but the general intention is agreed on all sides the current law is inappropriate as we made clear on second reading <e> <s> in practical terms it is extremely difficult to implement the present law in any way satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can enlighten us in his comments <e> <s> presumably as we are dealing with a prerogative power of the crown it would be possible would it not <e> <s> if it was really thought on other grounds to be desirable for the prerogative to be used in such a way that possibly the landowner might also have his share through prerogative action rather than through any statutory provision in this bill <e>", "<cs> then something different could happen if it were thought to be desirable <e>", "<cs> i should like to pursue that matter for a moment <e> <s> it seemed to me as a completely lay person in this matter although i happen to be a modest member of the country landowners association that we should be regarding this less as depriving the landowner of a possible right than as an extension of the royal prerogative <e> <s> one would hope that prerogative if it really seemed desirable to modify it could be modified by sensible and civilised discussion with the powers that be rather than by worrying ourselves unduly about the statutory provision which we are trying to make in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to take part in this debate initiated so admirably by the noble lord lord kearton <e> <s> we are all indebted to the noble lord lord flowers for his work in recent years in guiding public opinion in areas where authoritative analysis and informed judgment on technical and scientific subjects are needed <e> <s> i had the privilege of sitting under his chairmanship on the royal commission on environmental pollution when he produced the sixth report on nuclear energy acknowledged to be a classic in its sphere which won worldwide esteem as well as influencing opinion at home <e> <s> the report entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords to pursue the point made by my noble friend lord ponsonby about mid-wales we are aware that the secretary of state for wales has recently been indisposed and i am sure we all wish him a speedy recovery but as the minister was able to talk about llanelli and pontypool may i ask him to explain when we may be enlightened as to the fate of mid-wales <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answer is not concerned solely with cash but that it makes some of us feel rather ashamed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the prayer of my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> i had hoped very much that the noble earl lord cranbrook could have been here today but important business has detained him elsewhere <e> <s> as your lordships will know he is chairman of the sub-committee of the european communities committee which deals with environmental matters and which has taken some evidence on the matter before the house this afternoon <e> <s> however that committee has <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to supplement that intervention by asking the noble earl whose description of the eec position was of course entirely correct whether her majestys government will not exercise their best endeavours to see that in an integrated scheme some funds from the environment directorate might be made available for these <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i made it entirely clear in my opening remarks that i was not in a position to speak on behalf of the committee for the reason that they had not yet reported <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to support the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> as some of your lordships at least may be aware the severn-trent water authority comes quite considerably into the principality of wales because of the severn catchment area <e> <s> without detaining your lordships i should just like to say that the point made by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley is important and is one that i am sure should be seriously taken into account by the committee which will be working on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that additional responsibilities have been placed on every regional water authority in the country and on the land drainage authorities by the wildlife and countryside act and that these additional responsibilities that they are carrying out will almost inevitably result in extra work for the nature conservancy council and that the progress will be scrutinised very closely indeed by those of us who are <e> <s> interested in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister agree that he should also be sensitive to the right to give <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that even those of us who have had the benefit of studying the illustrated booklet find it absolutely daunting and that the preliminary expenses that <e>", "<cs> could the minister enlighten me <e> <s> as i understand it this subsection refers to subsection as well as to subsection <e> <s> i can appreciate the noble earls arguments on subsection which refers to property but the reference to subsection covers objects as well and in that i would have very considerable sympathy with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that six of our fellow member states in the european community have been able to make arrangements for their citizens living in other parts of the community to vote <e> <s> why should british citizens be at such a great civic disadvantage <e> <s> cannot the government find a way even if subsequent legislation might have to modify it to enable these persons to vote in the forthcoming election in <e>", "<cs> but my lords six other member states have not waited for the council they took action several years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that if one has a ruined tower covered with ivy which is doing considerable damage one can preserve the tower in that state but one would not be conserving the tower because it will still gradually crumble <e> <s> there is a slight difference between the two words <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the congratulations which have already been extended to my noble friend lady nicol <e> <s> in addition to her great experience in local government it is clear that she has also been blessed with a voice to which it is a pleasure to listen <e> <s> i wish also to say how much we welcome the noble lord lord hemingford as an active member of your lordships house both for his own sake and because <e>", "<cs> well my lords as i say i can speak for an authority which i had the honour to chair for five years <e> <s> we found that it was a very useful link with local government in wales <e> <s> at least they knew that they had on our authority four members to whom they could turn and who could act as interpreters of local authority interests <e> <s> that was quite apart from the direct contact that one had in day-to-day business the whole time <e> <s> i repeat that we do not have even that statutory assurance in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect as i understand it the noble baroness will not have orders <e> <s> this is one of our complaints <e> <s> there will not be orders there will be guidelines which will not actually be binding on anybody <e> <s> there is the greatest difficulty in getting hold of these and following them unless you happen to be a member of an organisation which is directly concerned <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene my lords the noble viscount lord brookeborough will surely recognise that the social fund is primarily for training purposes <e> <s> it is a misnomer to call it a social fund <e> <s> most of us are very much in accord with what my noble friend lord northfield said <e> <s> we are concerned that there should be an environment fund in some shape or form <e> <s> the european parliament recently voted that in relation to the current budget and i hope that when he replies the minister will deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i intervene briefly in this short discussion in support in particular of the <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister indicate whether this particular consortium were requiring the government to put their own public resources into the necessary feasibility studies or whether they themselves were going to undertake these regardless of whether or not there was government assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might add just a sentence or two in the absence of any member of the social democratic party wishing to take part in the debate which is perhaps significant <e> <s> it would be appropriate for a valedictory word to be said for the <e>", "<cs> i should like in general terms to support my noble friend lord melchett although i would say to him that so far as the principality of wales is concerned there is virtually no grade i land <e> <s> we have very little grade ii land and any reservoirs that we have are likely to be built on grade iii or even a lesser categorisation of land <e> <s> from our point of view that part of his amendment is almost irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i listened to my noble friend with the utmost attention <e> <s> i heard him refer to grade iii land but it is not in the amendment as it is proposed <e> <s> i am in a little difficulty about advertising the report of the select committee on science and technology in a debate on the water industry because unfortunately we have been pre-empted by this bill and the report has not yet been debated in the house as a report <e> <s> but as we pass through the various stages of this bill it is helpful to remind noble lords that their own select committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord sherfield who unfortunately is abroad at the moment and hence i am speaking in a sense for the select committee has made a fairly thorough study of among other matters the question of methods of water storage <e> <s> we reached the conclusion as we state in this report that most water authorities are satisfied that their resource needs will be met without major reservoir construction at least during the rest of this century and several of them are fairly confident that it will be some distance into the next century before they are obliged to turn to reservoir construction for their water resources <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will nevertheless think again about this matter because those of us who have some experience of environmental questions in certain parts of the country are not always convinced that the land drainage authorities take full account of their obligations under section of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> this is partly because of the composition of these particular bodies <e> <s> it is an historical anomaly in many ways that in their relationship with the regional water authorities as such the water authorities really have no jurisdiction over what the land drainage committee does unless its activities in some way impinge upon the direct responsibilities of the water authority <e>", "<cs> i think this has been a useful discussion even though it has led at the moment to no statutory conclusions <e> <s> i was most grateful to the minister for explaining clearly the position of the government and their endeavours to square the circle or solve the insoluble <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend for her very clear exposition of the main points of the amendment standing in her name <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a small practical point <e> <s> he referred to three sets of guidelines and he used the word published <e> <s> does he mean that in the normal sense of the word in other words we can get it from the printed paper office or does he mean that copies have been laid in the library <e> <s> if copies have been laid in the library all that one can obtain as i have already found is an awkward photostat which is bulky and heavy and is nothing like as convenient as the kind of document which ought to be available in the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> other bodies also have similar arrangements to those mentioned by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> in wales we have close relationships with the welsh water authority on the part of the council for national parks and the council for the protection of rural wales of which i am a member <e> <s> we certainly would not wish to have any disturbance in that kind of informal consultation which is what it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> i make no apology for rising even at this late hour <e> <s> it is because this bill has been inadequately thought through <e> <s> this was made plain on second reading <e> <s> it is a matter of complete astonishment that this particular issue has not been dealt with in this piece of legislation <e> <s> my personal view is that it would be better when we have heard what the noble lord the minister has had to say for my noble friend to withdraw his amendment so that we can have a proper debate at a reasonble hour on report <e> <s> i see that the noble lord the government chief whip is rising to his feet <e>", "<cs> i repeat my charge to the government that it is because the bill has been inadequately thought through in the first place <e> <s> there are lacunae in this bill which ought never to have occurred <e>", "<cs> i suppose we should be grateful to the minister even at ten past midnight-not exactly the most appropriate hour to announce a decision which is welcome in itself and of which i think i am right in saying that we were given no warning at second reading <e> <s> however one only hopes that this good intention will be turned into actuality during the currency of the present administration and that it will not then be upset should there be a change in the administration in the relatively near future <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me as chairman of the select committee in your lordships house which studied this matter in some detail to indicate that in principle we support entirely the efforts of the noble lord lord bethell in promoting the bill which is before your lordships house tonight <e> <s> needless to say it would be much more appropriate if this were a government bill because it is a constitutional matter <e> <s> sooner or later it would appear to me that if it is to proceed in time for the next european elections it will have to be a government bill <e> <s> i should have thought that propriety demanded that it should be a constitutional bill sponsored directly by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords before i turn to the subject of the conwy tunnel supplementary powers bill perhaps i might be permitted to refer to the loss that we have suffered through the death last weekend of our welsh spokesman in another place mr alec jones <e> <s> this added to the death of the parliamentary secretary for wales on the government side and to that of the chairman of our welsh development <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i would wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i very much appreciate the point made by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley he is making a perfectly fair comment <e> <s> the boards which are now to run the water authorities are very much smaller in number than they were previously <e> <s> that is something which i personally support i believe we need a managerial board <e> <s> however when one limits the numbers in the way in which they have been limited and when one takes account of the need to have for example local authority representation in one form or another and managerial representation which is one of the reasons why the form of administration is being changed it is very easy to overlook the other interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i was disquieted to hear the noble earl say there was no real significance in the second of the two amendments <e> <s> i thought he was putting over a very smooth case indeed when he said that of course the two ministers the secretary of state for the environment and the minister of agriculture were always in the closest consultation <e> <s> the fact remains that as i understand it it is only the minister of agriculture who has the statutory power in these land drainage affairs to require an inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only fair to the noble lord lord beaumont to indicate that he drew attention to some of these points on second reading when i briefly supported him because we felt that something was likely to be amiss unless these matters were taken into consideration <e> <s> there may have been some error of omission or commission in the procedural way in which this has been handled but the substance is entirely in accord with what lord beaumont said today <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak as i raised this question at a much earlier stage of this bill because i complained about government by guideline and the fact that if one goes to the library all one gets is a very awkard photostat copy of a departmental document <e> <s> if one wants to discuss it then one surely must consider if we are to have government by guideline whether we could have draft guidelines which i think is really at the back of the mind of my noble friend <e> <s> i think i would be correct in saying that this would have an element of innovation about it but after all one must keep up with the times and if the government are to govern by guideline we should have draft guidelines <e>", "<cs> would they appear on the pink paper which is circulated to us because that is what most members read <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it that the reference by the noble lord lord skelmersdale in col of <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the select committee presided over so admirably by the noble lord lord sherfield i feel that i should say a few words in support of our report <e> <s> i need hardly say that in his most lucid exposition the noble lord lord sherfield has covered all the major points <e> <s> as he is no longer chairing this particular sub-committee perhaps i may be permitted to say what a considerable pleasure it has been to work under his chairmanship and also to have the assistance of our excellent clerk and our specialist adviser <e> <s> in other words it has been a thoroughly satisfactory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell the house particularly in regard to wales since salmon from wales is as fine a delicacy as salmon from scotland what is to happen to the group to which he referred which is studying this matter following the demise of the national water council which is about to expire <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in this debate because i have found myself out of sympathy with some of what appear to be the main provisions of the bill which is before us <e> <s> i listened with the closest attention to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and also to the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson but i am still not entirely <e>", "<cs> from this side of the committee i should like to support the noble viscount lord ridley and the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> although i am not familiar with the precise details of the matter it appears to me essential that something of this nature should be included in this proposed legislation <e> <s> this time almost to the minute tomorrow evening i expect to be at grosvenor house at the red dragon ball together with some other good welshmen and friends of wales listening to his royal highness the prince of wales because the ball is in aid of the national trust in wales and the princes own environment committee of which i have had the honour to be a member for a number of years <e> <s> i am quite sure that it would cause considerable unease and disquiet if for any reason this case proposed by the noble viscount lord ridley supported by the noble lord lord sandford and in the name of the noble lord lord gibson was not found in principle at least to be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to follow the noble lord lord nugent in his discussion in general terms of the control of inflation except to say that i thought that the authority of his argument was somewhat diminished as soon as he came to a subject on which he is an acknowledged expert <e> <s> then he wished an exception to be made for expenditure to he incurred on that very necessary work even if it did not happen anywhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i have been trying all day to find copies of the two written memoranda which were sent to the committee of the other place from the university colleges of aberystwyth and bangor respectively <e> <s> they are not to be found in the library of the house of commons and they cannot be traced in the victoria tower <e> <s> they were not printed they were merely deposited <e> <s> that shows the degree of concern it would seem which is paid to any of our welsh affairs <e>", "<cs> excuse me my lords they are referred to but as papers which were deposited but not published <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago until i had to give up the position on becoming a member of the university grants committee i was a member of council at the university college of wales at aberystwyth <e> <s> i must confess that i was then better informed of the details of the work of the welsh plant breeding station than i would claim to be today <e> <s> but i was recently in aberystwyth and was able to make some inquiries on the spot <e> <s> i did so because virtually everyone in wales in university or farming circles has been shocked by the relative down-grading proposed for our one and only agricultural research station in the principality <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been induced to intervene in this debate among so many noble lords who are much more directly concerned with and have a far more profound knowledge of the matter than i can claim partly because in preparing a brief contribution to the debate last monday on the fate of the welsh plant breeding station at aberystwyth i became fascinated indeed almost mesmerized by a brief study of the really bizarre story of certain agricultural relationships in the past two or three years <e> <s> i spoke of the relationship between the ministry of agriculture maff the agricultural and food research council afrc the joint consultative organisation for agriculture and food familiarly known i understand as the jco acard the ugc and the advisory board for the research councils <e> <s> one can add to them the scottish office thrown in for good measure and i suppose an occasional bleat from the welsh office although that was publicly inaudible <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord the minister had an opportunity to study the recently published report mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> lord hunt produced by the chief scientist of the nature conservancy council which indicates the very considerable degree of loss in habitats and similar areas in recent years <e> <s> has he also had an opportunity personally to study the commitments entered into by her majestys government in february and reaffirmed at the stuttgart summit subsequently which indicate that agricultural policy should be closely integrated with policy for the environment particularly in relation to agriculture and forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord the minister and to the house for not having put my name down on the list of speakers but i was not sure whether i could be here this evening <e> <s> however i did receive correspondence about prussia cove at the time my noble friend put down his unstarred question some little time ago <e> <s> i wanted to assure the house tonight that the points he has made are of very great significance not only at prussia cove <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to add my modest support to the recommendations of this committee of which i was very happy to be a member <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble earl lord bessborough in that this committee was one which i with less knowledge than the noble earl can command found to be one of the most difficult but also one of the most interesting and fascinating committees on which i have ever had the pleasure to serve <e> <s> i can say this with no false modesty because i believe we all recognise that the quality of a report is dependent primarily on the quality of the chairman the specialist adviser and the clerk to the committee concerned <e> <s> in this case all three were absolutely first class and the report produced is accordingly of high quality <e>", "<cs> i think i should also add a word briefly in support of my noble friend lord prys-davies because as he and the noble lord lord hooson have made quite clear this is a particular problem of the principality <e> <s> it affects no other part of the united kingdom <e> <s> as my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos knows very well indeed he having been a secretary of state for wales the two languages have equal validity in the principality and official documents are all produced in both languages <e> <s> it is part of the recognised education system that welsh should be taught at the primary level even in areas like the county of gwent for example where there is a very small minority of welsh speakers and where it is recognised that children there should also have an opportunity of learning the language <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly and as usual to raise the voice of wales since scotland has already been mentioned <e> <s> we have a system of community councils in wales which on the whole works satisfactorily <e> <s> i might claim to be a londoner as well as a welsh woman and i would

years knows that there are there social areas social distinctions and social gradations to which only someone who lives in hampstead is fully sensitive <e> <s> one would find it very difficult to get ones aspirations fulfilled if the london borough in which one happens to live however active and imaginative it may be is too big for some of the things that one wants to have done <e>", "<cs> how many letters does the noble lord the minister wish us to write to him before he is convinced <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to join in the very warm congratulations already proffered by

oclock in the afternoon <e> <s> it is quite clear from the gravamen of the speeches we have already heard that this is a matter of the most intense interest to a great many members of the house and personally <e> <s> i have already benefited very much from the very substantial contributions not least that made by the noble earl lord peel who i think has given us an extremely interesting insight

quarters of the house in trying to defend what is becoming increasingly indefensible <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former member of the cinematograph films council which is to be abolished may i say how glad i am that its advisory duties are to be taken over by my noble friend <e> <s> may i also pay a brief tribute to the late sir wilfred eady because although times have now greatly changed and i

"<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all much indebted to the noble lords lord greenhill of harrow and lord adrian for the reports which they have presented to us and also if i may say so to my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies for having used certain pressure to enable us to discuss the two reports tonight while they are still fresh before us <e> <s> it is not easy to find time for such debates

this house as being probable may we have his assurance on the following matter <e> <s> we hope that the government will take a sympathetic attitude towards amendments in addition to the closing of the three-month loophole which is the main objective if a reasonable consensus can be found between the voluntary environmental organisations and the agriculture and other interests involved <e> <s> as

not as yet by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl inform us how far government thinking supports the suggestion which was recently made informally by mr william waldegrave at newcastle that we should establish an independent environmental protection agency in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution which produced the sixth report on nuclear energy and having studied the relevant parts of the tenth report i support the questions put by my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> i also emphasise that i hope everyone in

that committee on a bill which has the blessing of the devon county council the dartmoor national park authority and the countryside commission <e> <s> however i believe there is one area of disquiet

nearby okehampton by-pass <e> <s> it is generally welcomed as the noble lord <e> <s> lord sandford has said <e> <s> i think one should briefly draw attention to the fact that an important amendment was agreed in committee which has now established the position and authority of the nature conservancy council in relation to those parts of the commons which have been notified or may be notified as

should reply to that one too <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the remarks of the noble lords lord nathan and lord nugent in saying how sorry i am that the noble lord lord ashby is unable to be with us for todays debate <e> <s> as the first chairman of the royal commission on environmental pollution he led the way in the early s in considering how best we in the united kingdom should tackle the problems of water quality and pollution control <e> <s> he subsequently took the lead in the relevant subcommittees of the select committee on the european communities of this house in scrutinising the scientific justification for the proposals relating to pollution emanating from the commission in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that there is complete illogicality between the position relating to the very serious damage now occurring at this particular quarry in the yorkshire dales national park and the attitude of the government to the loophole preventing comparable damage to sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> how can the minister reconcile those two attitudes <e> <s> ought not the government to address their minds to some way of meeting this situation when instead of a three-month loophole there has already been a -month loophole allowing very damaging work to be undertaken in a national park <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment to be moved by my noble friend lord underhill on the supposition that we get that far <e> <s> if it were not so serious a reality the matter of the okehampton bypass

doing my utmost to be entirely fair <e> <s> the other industrial estate on the exeter road is far better situated and far better laid out but that is another matter altogether <e> <s> that would have acceptable access whichever of the two contested routes were chosen <e>", "<cs> ah but wait my lords <e> <s> the national park authority has already embarked on preliminary local consultations on possible revision of the park boundary in preparation for the formal -year review scheme initiated by the relevant authority for national parks namely the countryside commission <e> <s> in other words park boundaries are sacred but not absolutely immutable for all time <e> <s> but as soon as one went to okehampton and saw the reality the idea of boundary modification became untenable <e> <s> not only is the quality of the land to be traversed by the proposed southern route indubitably of national park standard as the recent country side commission statement so fully confirms but this wooded escarpment is clearly part of the land mass of the park itself and provides a striking in parts indeed a dramatic introduction to the high moor even softening the shock of a sprawling army camp which one finds above it <e> <s> this is true even if as suggested by the noble earl lord iddesleigh the woodlands are not perhaps of the highest possible ecological quality as mrs rumbold the junior minister in another place admitted at the eastern end at fatherford where the new southern road would have to be carried on a high viaduct for a considerable distance there would inevitably be the most serious visual intrusion <e> <s> whatever alleviating measures were adopted i know that some have been considered i am convinced that traffic noise would completely destroy the present

inserted into what is a scottish bill <e> <s> we have just as serious problems over salmon management and salmon fisheries in the principality as there are in scotland <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene in this debate especially as the expressions of satisfaction must be particularly gratifying to the minister <e> <s> such expressions make it all the more distressing to those of us who are concerned with the comparable problems in wales and no doubt the same applies to anyone from england concerned with the english estuaries that we are not being dealt with under this <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the minister that amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord ross of marnock may perhaps be amended at the next stage to be permissive <e> <s> in other words it can be amended to contain may and not shall <e> <s> it seems to me that so far as england and wales are concerned the deliberations may take quite a considerable time and we would not wish in any way to hold up this desirable legislation for scotland <e> <s> if by making such an alteration we could give a permissible power to the english and welsh authorities whichever they may be that would allow adequate consultation to take place <e> <s> it would not be mandatory but if we found a suitable way of doing it in england and wales then at least the enabling power to bring forward the appropriate orders would be in the bill <e> <s> i suggest that as a possible way of dealing with the strictly england and wales aspect <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear the noble lord say that i was offering him an insurance policy <e>", "<cs> naturally we listen with great respect to what the noble lord lord belstead says <e> <s> but some of us have made inquiries about the extent and if one might say the quality of the co-operation in certain areas <e> <s> i do not say that this applies everywhere but such inquiries as i have been able to make convince me that there is a significant proportion of illegal fishing going on in areas where agreement has been reached between the sea fisheries committees and the water authorities <e> <s> as the noble lord lord moran says these agreements apply only to fixed nets and there is no adequate control by means of the method of fishing <e>", "<cs> no doubt the minister will consult with the welsh office and the welsh water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords

organisations which take part in inquiries <e> <s> i hope that in the process the act of and the statutory orders special procedure act which was called in aid in discussions on the okehampton bypass

the conclusion of his question the noble lord lord molson states <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that his reference to the national health service in this context is complete hypocrisy for not only is there competition between private and public medical attention but even within the national health service one is able to change ones doctor if he proves less than

that out of any future speech <e> <s> we are coming to wales shortly and the noble lord is becoming quite an authority on the principality <e> <s> on the financial side it is perfectly true that some

director general and price fixing takes away the only attraction for privatisation that there would have been <e> <s> without that we would have been free to charge the midlands and merseyside an adequate price for the water from wales on which they rely <e> <s> if that is taken out of the equation which i understand is the case and there is to be no discrimination in charges there will be no

straight <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent the government using their own money or the taxpayers money it is just that they cannot use community money <e> <s> is that the point that the minister is trying to make <e>", "<cs> i believe that the sub-committee of our environmental scrutiny committee which reports to your lordships house is shortly to examine the question of forestry and its relation to the ec <e> <s> if we are to wait for some time we may be enlightened by the <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that after this brief discussion we wholeheartedly support the amendment which is before the committee <e> <s> on the other hand it is extremely disturbing that we have had no adequate explanation from the government of how the comments in this report could affect the matters before us <e> <s> i raised this point originally on the environmentally <e>", "<cs> but on clause i should think that the minister might have thought it proper <e> <s> i did not know that my noble friend was going to raise this matter otherwise i think i might have raised it myself when we were discussing clause <e> <s> but as it has now been raised at least we should be told <e> <s> i should have thought that the minister would have been politically well advised to have taken the initiative in giving us reassurance on clause if that reassurance could properly be given <e>", "<cs> the minister is simply dodging the question that i put to him <e>", "<cs> that is dodging it all the same <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support the amendment proposed by the noble lordlord moran <e> <s> i do so as president of the council for the protection of rural wales <e> <s> everything that the noble lord said about our anxieties is well-founded <e> <s> therefore i support the proposed amendment and the arguments adduced by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as my name has been mentioned again i should like to say that i have lived for years in the dovey forest in mid-wales and i know a little about the kind and quantity of labour that in fact is used locally <e> <s> certainly there is a certain amount of contract labour but forestry has become a highly mechanised industry <e> <s> i do not say that it makes no contribution to local employment of course it makes some contribution but it is marginal as my noble friend recognises <e> <s> i do not go all the way along with him as regards some of his philosophy but to suggest that we are not interested in having tree planting is quite incorrect <e> <s> indeed we are but we want the right trees in the right place <e>", "<cs> that is all very well but there has recently been a statement by the junior minister in the department of the environment that the government are seriously proposing to study this matter further <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench was probably not aware of that statement <e> <s> my understanding is that the government are persuaded that there is possibly great benefit in certain circumstances from having the type of order to which the amendment refers <e>", "<cs> my lords before we take a division on this amendment can the minister not deal with the differentiation made in lord melchetts amendment between the goods and services which are included both in this amendment and in the bill as it now stands and advice <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the difficulty of an adas officer being asked to draw up a scheme or maybe to undertake some kind of survey or something of that sort <e> <s> surely that is caught under services or goods <e> <s> advice is different <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be able to get something better <e> <s> i ask noble lords in all parts of the house to consider what their feelings would be if they were adas officers who have been proud to belong to an existing organisation which receives warm praise from all quarters and had to read if they have had the pleasure of seeing this list of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that at the very least the minister will be able to assure us on this occasion that the consultations will not be confined to national parks because as the noble lord lord hunt has said and he and i are both very much concerned with national parks as officers of the council for national parks we recognise that at least in the parks one does have some measure of protection and there are examples in parts of the country which are not in designated areas at all which require just this sort of protection for which the county councils association is now pressing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord not agree that as between jerusalem and jericho the distance between london and cardiff in either direction is equivalent and that therefore there can be no objection to basing in cardiff a welsh-speaking commissioner who can also deal as the present office deals with a number of cases across the border <e> <s> the workload can be perfectly well adjusted in that way <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord not agree that it is of little consequence to have a welsh-speaking commissioner in london as proposed <e> <s> that does not matter to the metropolis but it does matter to the capital city of wales that it should be denuded of an office that it has enjoyed that can perfectly well perform and that can i repeat deal with cases across the border because the welsh-speaking commissioner will undoubtedly be bilingual <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord inform us whether he disapproves therefore of the designation of cardiff as a capital city <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the kernel of the question <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that he meant orally rather than verbally <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord enlighten me <e> <s> what happens in wales please <e> <s> this refers only to england <e>", "<cs> if it is to be amended in england why should it not be amended in wales <e> <s> perhaps that point could be included in the letter <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend certainly on two of the three amendments she has moved namely amendments nos <e> <s> a and c <e> <s> both these amendments are really insurance policies in other words they would enable the secretary of state to specify by order either certain types of forestry or certain types of land drainage which might cause damage to the countryside in one form or another <e> <s> it seems to me that it is extremely important that this type of amendment should be accepted by the government <e> <s> i am delighted to see that the noble lord lord gibson-watt is with us <e>", "<cs> i am indeed touched <e>

very much concerned particularly in the principality of wales that we should not go the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it occurred to the government to consult the womens royal voluntary service in a situation of this sort <e> <s> leaving on one side the question of visas does he not appreciate that the situation which has arisen was almost certainly and inevitably likely to arise and that what has happened through lack of foresight on the part of the the home office really leads to a feeling of despondency in some of us <e> <s> we regret that a once great imperial power should be seen to be so incompetent and lacking in foresight that they did not take the most elementary precautions to ensure that the situation which has arisen and caused so much distress and discomfort was dealt with by better organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not denying that <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that all this was foreseeable and that therefore better organisation could have been undertaken in due time <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble earl and i had been in charge of the arrangements they would have been better <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give an assurance that if the requirement for visas is extended to other parts of the commonwealth or the rest of the world for that matter really adequate notice will be given so that we do not have a repetition of what happened last week <e> <s> the date by which visas will be essential should be notified well in advance so that people can make their dispositions and we do not have a repetition of the appalling situation that arose at heathrow <e>", "<cs> i have been most interested to listen to some of the legalistic difficulties which this bill and the amendment present <e> <s> i am not a lawyer but i am a housewife <e> <s> i have tried to translate the provisions of the bill and what would happen with the amendment to my position as someone who goes to mid-wales whenever possible and

sing the names <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all noble lords have regarded this as a most welcome debate and we are all grateful to my noble friend for initiating it <e> <s> it is a short debate so we have only one ministerial speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead can no doubt be alluring on occasion but we shall have to wait to the end of the debate to hear what the government have in mind about alternative land uses and the rural economy <e> <s> we do not yet know how much will be revealed even when the minister does speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that the noble baroness the minister is now realising the possibilities of this apparently simple piece of legislation <e> <s> it interests me very much that all the back-bench speakers listed have been active in one or other of two organisations <e> <s> the noble lords lord kennet and lord campbell of croy as well as myself have all been officers on the advisory committee on pollution of the sea <e> <s> the noble lord lord nathan and the noble earl lord cranbrook are currently members of the royal commission on environmental pollution of which i was a member in when the royal commission reported on pollution of the sea <e> <s> i think i can fairly claim to be the only one of the back-bench speakers who has been a member of both organisations <e> <s> that accounts for my interest in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> would it not be simpler just to put the full miles in the bill now instead of having to do so later if required <e> <s> what is the objection to that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness enlarge a little on that statement <e> <s> are her majestys government proposing to do anything further to extend port state jurisdiction which of course it would have achieved under article of the law of the sea convention <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i am deeply disappointed in the noble baroness i thought she had more common sense <e> <s> what conceivable harm could be done by accepting this amendment <e> <s> i fail entirely to see why she needs to resist it <e> <s> as i tried briefly to explain there is no possibility of any nature reserve at whatever distance legitimately from the shore being designated without the full consultation by the appropriate secretary of state and the various interests which the noble baroness has very properly referred to <e> <s> therefore what conceivable harm would be done to anyone by allowing this extension forthwith to the legislation which is before us <e>", "<cs> the machinery is there in any case <e> <s> all that is needed is for the secretary of state concerned to inform the nature conservancy council being sensible enough no doubt to consult in advance and say i am very sorry but you will appreciate that this is not a situation in which i feel able to designate <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not want to hold up a bill for which as the noble lord lord campbell has rightly said both of us have been waiting for quite some time <e> <s> i am still unhappy about the reply which i have received but i do not wish to press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before turning to the main subject of this debate i too wish to proffer my congratulations to the noble lord lord dainton on a maiden speech of outstanding quality <e> <s> i do so with particular pleasure as i sat under his chairmanship some time ago when i was a member of the university grants committee over which at that time he presided <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the objectives of the year of the environ-ment is to encourage people to take greater pleasure and have more enjoyment in the countryside and in its flora and fauna <e>

the seasons and handels the cuckoo and the nightingale <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw attention to clause <e> <s> it seems to me that the government are giving the secretary of state power that if certain companies have not produced schemes that are satisfactory to the secretary of state and i read from clause <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that because the second phase is now under consideration this is the very moment at which he should speak not only to one but to at least two of his right honourable friends <e> <s> in a recent debate on civil research and development in this chamber we drew attention to the fact that there is too little coordination among different government departments on civil research <e> <s> this is an excellent example of where a department with major responsibility that is the department of energy is contributing an absolutely minuscule amount whereas the department of education and science under the research budget has to contribute a much larger amount for an industry which ought itself to be able to pay for it <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble lord lord kennet in supporting these two amendments <e> <s> one can do so it appears to me with perfect good sense and rationality without necessarily taking a view as to how or if and when one amends the geneva convention because i do not profess to be an international lawyer and i would have no personal opinion on that matter <e>", "<cs> come come <e> <s> i cannot believe that the noble lord really wants to confine himself and take no notice at all of the rest of the world in such an international enterprise as shipping <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do can the minister indicate why he thinks the reference to the international maritime organisation in the first amendment would be out of place <e> <s> it is the major international organisation for these matters we are party to it <e> <s> the other organisations that he mentioned the oslo convention and the london dumping convention all take part in the discussions in the imo as does the food and agriculture organisation <e> <s> they have a status there although they also have their own jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally much obliged to the noble viscount for the reason that he has given for not being able to accept the amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue the matter in a tiresome way but i must confess that i am rather disappointed that having endeavoured as he said to improve an amendment which at the most asks that account should be taken and no more of the views of others it is still not acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords my first concern in this debate is not only to add my warm congratulations to the noble baroness lady blackstone on a memorable maiden speech but to support her argument that the part-time facilities offered at birkbeck college to women as well as to men are a most important encouragement to obtaining qualifications which would otherwise remain out of reach <e> <s> flexi-time is vital to many women whose careers have been interrupted by domestic responsibilities particularly a career in science or technology which almost inevitably will require updating or extra qualifications appropriate to a more senior position <e> <s> so to withhold grants or to reduce facilities as has been proposed at birkbeck is surely counterproductive wasteful and to be deplored <e>", "<cs> my lords has there been any consultation with the atlantic salmon trust a very reputable body which i believe drew the attention of the ministry to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount able to tell the house whether anyone is looking at the possible inter-relationship between the smaller taff barrage which is proposed and the adjacent severn barrage which could have considerable effects on birds and other wildlife <e>", "<cs> i too hope that we stick to one definition rather than two interchangeable ones <e> <s> as the noble earl lord cranbrook mentioned the european community speaks of extensification <e> <s> by that it means that one grows less intensively but still using the land <e> <s> i do not wish to detain the committee at this relatively late hour but i have received representations from a number of environmental bodies in england and wales strongly supporting the amendment now before us <e>", "<cs> can the minister perhaps enlighten us as to whether in the document she has been referring to which is to be forthcoming shortly it will deal with the matter which was discussed by those of us who went from one of the select committees of the house in february i think to brussels that is in regard to the very difficult question of a base line from which any scheme is to be calculated <e> <s> unless that is going to be dealt with in the document it will make it very difficult to reach any sound judgment at all <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will look favourably on the amendment <e> <s> i have a small property not far away from that of the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> i watched the hill on the other side of a small valley to see what happens to the scrub oaks which are such an attractive feature of some of our upland landscape in wales if we do not fence it and keep out the sheep <e> <s> the sheep eat the saplings and the wood does not regenerate <e> <s> ultimately it falls to pieces and is invaded by bracken which does not help anybody <e> <s> there is undoubted substance in the ideas <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am grateful to the minister for replying to the amendment <e> <s> however i am disappointed that she has not dealt at all with the desirability in those areas of having a much more comprehensive approach concerning <e>", "<cs> my lords it deals with the much wider issue of the plantation of trees in the upland areas which can be planted according to the proposed scheme in the bill without necessarily consulting anyone at all <e> <s> one simply applies for the grant and if it is within the hectarage and within the designated area of disadvantaged land then so far as i can make out one can simply go ahead up to the maximum limit regardless of any other consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble duke the duke of buccleuch has intervened in this debate without putting his name down may i crave your lordships pardon for doing the same thing <e> <s> i am certain that my noble friend lady nicol will deal most adequately with the subject of this debate but i should not like it to be thought that because there are not many of us present on this side of the house we are not deeply concerned about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the formation of a select committee of this house which is embarking on an investigation into agricultural and food research and development <e> <s> is she proposing to take cognisance of that <e> <s> the subcommittee concerned is under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord butterworth and we hope that our labours may be of some assistance to the government if they are prepared to wait until we have reported <e>", "<cs> i was also engaged in public business in the principality earlier in the day so i am not sure to what extent the minister has covered the points raised by the noble lord lord peston <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain to the committee if he were a librarian having to work out the purchasing list for a library how he would feel about the remarks which he has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the problem of clearing trees is as important as planting <e> <s> while grants for planting trees in the immediate future seem to be reasonably generous as i understood the answer given by the noble earl in a recent debate the assistance which is absolutely essential for preliminary clearance is nothing like as satisfactory <e> <s> has further consideration been given to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in the expressions of gratitude to the noble earl lord cranbrook for initiating this debate <e> <s> on this occasion i am almost tempted to call him my noble friend <e> <s> i think that we are all much indebted to him <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down did he see the photograph in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the photograph <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that while the prospects for the future seem more encouraging the question is misleading in suggesting that we already hold a leading position in the field of superconductivity <e> <s> i believe that we are trying to attain that position <e> <s> however to suggest that we have attainted it is surely misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in the gratification that has been expressed this evening that as the noble lord lord hooson has said the government for once have abandoned their basic philosophy and decided that instead of cutting their contribution investment is the best policy <e> <s> this is a bill which i think all of us must welcome very warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords four voices from wales are due to be heard in the debate of which mine is one <e> <s> the noble lord lord gibson-watt with his important national responsibilities understandably used a fairly broad brush <e> <s> however i wish to concentrate especially on the welsh scene <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend deals with that point perhaps he could deal with a detail which affects a situation in wales where there are a great many proposed foreshore and estuarine developments <e> <s> you might wish possibly to object but for reasons of expense you refrain from doing so because you know that there is another objection or petition in train and that some of the points about which you may be concerned are likely to be dealt with through the petition of a better financed or stronger body <e> <s> if it then withdraws its petition what is the position of the person who originally wished to object <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord enlighten the committee on the position of those who are members of quangos <e> <s> i believe that it is now unfashionable to use that term <e> <s> for example for some time i had the honour to be chairman of the land authority for wales <e> <s> it is the only part of the community land act which still stands and is active <e> <s> does membership of that body qualify one to be considered to be in either industry or commerce <e> <s> strictly speaking one is in neither yet one is engaged on the most active transactions in development land but from a public point of view <e> <s> what is the position of someone in such a capacity <e> <s> as regards the principality of wales i could mention at least half a dozen quangos some of whose members would be highly desirable <e> <s> however i am not sure that if the definition is strictly applied one would say that they were either industrialists or in commerce <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the proposition that there should be two students <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that whoever suggested one student has never had experience of presiding over such meetings <e> <s> it is essential that there should be more than one person representing the students and for bodies of this size two would be an appropriate number <e> <s> it is not only that a student would require moral support in entering the room and support <e>", "<cs> surely the noble and learned lord recognises that a rector is in a different position to some of us who have had to preside over councils <e> <s> i ask the noble and learned lord to take into account <e>", "<cs> you are lacking in experience <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a point of definition <e> <s> i know that we are discussing amendments dealing primarily with numbers but one cannot consider them intelligently unless one is reassured about the definition <e> <s> i raise again the definition in clause b of persons who appear to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a case for further investigation and consultation with the hazardous waste inspectorate on this matter <e> <s> as i understand it in some areas the financial returns for dumping such waste are very low indeed <e> <s> at the same time it is using up potential sites for our industries <e> <s> for example with the concern about build-up of methane gas and so on this is becoming a very serious problem <e> <s> it deserves further investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that these amendments should at least be dealt with by midnight <e> <s> does he not recognise that for some of us walking the streets after midnight is not an occupation that we wish to continue <e> <s> it seems to me and i hope it would seem to him to be an abuse of the general procedures of the house to expect noble members to sit more than very occasionally after midnight <e> <s> to conduct business at two oclock in the morning is not conducive to adequate consideration of business by the relatively small teams concerned at

report <e> <s> one needs to have some experience of the psychology of student bodies to recognise that it is very difficult indeed unless one has an exceptionally capable and confident student

convincing speeches from such distinguished academic figures as are in your lordships house <e> <s> but perhaps i may be permitted to say a few words arising from my very recent experience <e> <s> i

lords will the minister enlighten the house as to what mandate the secretary of state for the environment thinks he has to hand over national nature reserves to non-public bodies except following a revision of scientific opinion as to their scientific value <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not answer my question in the least <e> <s> a number of nature reserves are owned by the nature conservancy council <e> <s> anyone who has read the report which came out a little over a week ago under the name of mr wilkinson who is the very admirable chairman of the nature conservancy council will

otherwise i cannot see how it will make all the distinctions it hopes to make before <e>", "<cs> the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls are touching in their innocence but hardly convincing <e> <s> however i shall not say that about the contribution made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> if we were absolutely convinced about the amendments put forward by the noble lord and his supporters which we shall reach later this week we should at least be much less worried <e> <s> i say that because it is true that the pattern which he proposes carries with it an element of social responsibility which is not to be found in the pattern as set out in the bill which is now before us <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to know that <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be successful <e> <s> we have no guarantee that he will be <e> <s> while those companies are in the private sector they may reasonably be relied upon to offer impartial advice <e> <s> that will be much more difficult for them when they are in the private sector and when their developments or other developments might be at stake according to the advice that they give in reply to the consultation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister <e> <s> does he recognise that the national parks are much concerned about the fact that it is consultation only that is guaranteed <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i fully accept what he says about the further amendments <e> <s> i have looked at amendment no <e> <s> which uses the term consult but there may be other amendments on their way <e> <s> naturally we shall study them with great interest <e> <s> however i do not think that the minister has dealt with the point about statutory consultation <e> <s> what happens with the plcs <e> <s> will they have the same rights to consultation as the existing water authorities <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation but i wonder whether he will reflect again on the first of the amendments <e> <s> i understand his difficulties with regard to the second <e>", "<cs> we have the chairman of the advisory committee with us <e> <s> i am not sure whether it is in order but perhaps i may ask him whether he and his colleagues considered what was suggested by my noble friend that there should be a time limit followed by a review of the situation <e> <s> there can be real difficulties <e> <s> the matter has to be seen to be just as well as being justly administered <e> <s> there are problems concerning staff loyalty <e> <s> not all authorities are able to provide the national rivers authority with adequate scientific staff and equipment <e> <s> i recognise that fully <e> <s> but should it not be the aim of the national rivers authority within a reasonable period to provide itself with adequate facilities <e> <s> might we not think in those terms of some modification <e>", "<cs> i wish to remind the committee of a remark made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford during the second reading debate when he very rightly pointed out that it took her majestys government roughly two-and-a-half years from the time that they issued their original white paper on which he and those of us who know something of the industry commented to realise that their original white paper was completely <e>", "<cs> it had not <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of making a long speech on this matter because i raised it inadvertently on tuesday without realising that the noble earl lord onslow had tabled a specific amendment <e> <s> i should say that we were both briefed from the same source <e> <s> however he was more energetic than i in this respect <e> <s> nevertheless i hope very much that we shall receive a satisfactory reply from the minister <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may pass from stoke newington to the highlands of wales <e> <s> i have here a <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds can the minister clear my mind on one point <e> <s> i should know but i am not certain how far the duties of the authority under clause extend <e> <s> the subsection states that it is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out to the minister another matter that is very much in the public mind particularly after the broadcast on sunday last namely the amount that is to be spent on flotation and who decides it and when <e> <s> is it true that the costs of privatising the water industry including as i understood the remarks on that occasion the costs to the government of the flotation will be at least million of our money either as consumers of water or as taxpayers paying the costs of flotation met by the government <e>", "<cs> i am sure we would all wish to support the suggestion that this provision should be a mandatory obligation <e> <s> after all section is one of the most important sections from the point of view of public interest and public opinion <e> <s> i presume that the majority of companies concerned would do this in any case <e> <s> however i think the public have a right to expect that this information will be included in any annual report <e> <s> i cannot believe it would be detrimental to any of the companies concerned that they should be under some obligation to do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw attention to amendment no <e> <s> d in particular <e> <s> it deals with compensation to the individual rather than with the payment of penalties to the secretary of state or anyone else <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask a question about the clause <e> <s> i was surprised that no amendments had been tabled although i understand that some have been considered <e> <s> i believe that the committee is entitled to know from the minister what the government believe the local authorities should be undertaking as regards monitoring and reporting upon the water quality in their areas <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister whether there is any difference between the <e>", "<cs> from where will they recover the cost of routine sampling <e> <s> the first two lines on page state <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words before the minister amplifies his reply as i hope he will <e> <s> this clause gives the secretary of state extremely wide powers to impose duties to regulate the performance of any duty to prescribe the matters to be taken into account by local authorities in determining for the purposes of subsection what is appropriate and so on <e> <s> there is not a word about any obligation on the secretary of state to see that the local authorities are in any way recompensed for the duties that he unilaterally imposes on them <e>", "<cs> surely the private supplies are dealt with under clause <e>", "<cs> we are on clause stand part and it is the only way possible for any of us to raise these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all warmly welcome the statement that has been made <e> <s> may i ask the minister to assure the house that the future pay and conditions of the gurkha regiments will be commensurate with the praise that has been rightly bestowed upon them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> he said that so far as concerns farms which are businesses after all metering is obviously the most <e>", "<cs> as one of those who took part in the discussions with the noble baroness lady young who was then in office on the extension to the -mile limit i hope very much that the government will take this matter a little more seriously than they have done so far <e> <s> i have considerable sympathy with the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> this was one among many reasons why it was desirable to extend the national limit from three to miles in the first place <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mcintosh has indicated i hope very much that the government will reconsider the situation <e> <s> i wonder whether we should impose a duty on the nra to do something if not to place on it the whole gamut of responsibility that it undertakes as regards fresh waters <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord indicate what objection the government have to mentioning the nature conservancy council specifically <e> <s> it is all very well to say that they are having nice cosy talks at the moment and i am sure that the present occupants of the government front bench are on the closest and most friendly terms with the nature conservancy council <e> <s> that does not mean however that that situation will necessarily continue for the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still a little unclear about the attitude of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i can understand and to a great extent share his feelings about the treasury <e> <s> anyone who has been the chairman of even the most modest quango knows how infuriating the treasury can be <e> <s> i am all for freeing oneself from the clammy hand or what i would call the gladstonian dead hand of the treasury wherever possible <e> <s> however i am very much concerned about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there could well be a situation in which it could be to the advantage of environmental interests if the borrowing powers of the national rivers authority were possibly extended not necessarily including the treasury <e> <s> i hope therefore that serious consideration will be given to amendment no <e> <s> in addition to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the greatest sympathy with the amendments to which my noble friend has just spoken <e> <s> however did my noble friend lady birk or my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey agree to the grouping which is before the house <e> <s> it seems to me that to group these amendments in this way is a very unsatisfactory method of debating difficult issues <e> <s> as a modest back-bencher i cannot help thinking that it is very difficult for us to follow the arguments in the way in which the government apparently wish them to be considered <e> <s> unfortunately the noble lord the leader of the house is not in his place <e> <s> i wish he were as i should like to address my remarks directly to him <e> <s> these amendments were only available to us recently <e> <s> to the best of my belief the grouping was only publicly available today <e> <s> i consider that it is an abuse of the procedures of the house to proceed with a debate of this importance in this manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to add my support to the expressions of concern and interest dealt with by my noble friend lady nicol in her amendment and its consequentials <e> <s> it seems only right and proper to anyone concerned with conservation that sssis should be brought within the overview of the secretary of state and that this should be regarded as an obligation whatever his ultimate decision may prove to be <e> <s> but at the moment there is nothing in the bill so far as i understand it to cover the situation whereby in the circumstances we are dealing with in this grouping such sites including national nature reserves not just local sites of scientific interest might be disposed of without being adequately considered <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister concludes his most lucid speech for which we are all very grateful he could have gone on longer for some of us to explain other matters which have been raised will he comment on his remarks on the very wide discretion which the government plainly wish to reserve to successive secretaries of state <e> <s> does he not recognise that with such a wide area of discretion in the hands of the secretary of state there is all the more need to inform the public of the situations over which the secretary of state is exercising that discretion before he comes to a final decision <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lady david perhaps i may be permitted to say a few words on this amendment <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable concern that we should have a more satisfactory definition of the protection being offered for flora and fauna <e> <s> the noble baroness lady blatch indicated that the noble earl lord cranbrook has done his best to provide a definition although whether the government can accept it in precisely that form remains to be seen <e> <s> nevertheless it is important that flora and fauna should not be restricted to absolute dependence upon water <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say where he places the kingfisher for example <e> <s> to some extent it is dependent on an aquatic environment but it does not live underwater <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it from me to worry myself unduly about the number of votes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said and i shall be happy if the government take time to consider further this matter <e> <s> i would not have thought of putting down the amendment had i not been approached by those <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment tabled by my noble friend <e> <s> i was a member of your lordships select committee on science and technology which recently considered the matter <e> <s> i was not a member of the committee which sat in but a long time has passed since then <e> <s> a recent report was placed before your lordships house to which i should like to draw attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise as i have no doubt the noble lord lord renton was about to do in that i did not place my name on the list of those who wished to speak <e> <s> i had not realised that that was necessary on a reasoned amendment <e> <s> i apologise for my ignorance in that matter <e> <s> however i think it will be agreed that i have been a conscientious follower of this bill in all its stages in this house so i hope i may be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he explain in what way the very valuable addition of so many acres of sites of special scientific interest will make a great deal of difference to the areas available for recreation <e> <s> sssis as a rule but not invariably are not places in which recreation is strongly encouraged <e> <s> they are protected from too much intrusion <e> <s> that is not universally true but it is true of a great many sssis <e> <s> to my mind at any rate it is not of such significance as the minister tried to indicate when we discussed the possibilities for recreation <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first occasion on which i have taken pail in any debate on the electricity bill <e> <s> it is the first time that i have even been here to listen to the debate because while the water bill was still in progress i was so deeply immersed in water that i decided that i could attend to only one bill and not this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention at all of speaking on any of the details of the regulations <e> <s> i simply wish to indicate my very strong support for my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey and the representative of the liberal parties i suppose i should say since there is only one representative on the benches <e> <s> i also wish to say how glad i am that the noble lord lord shaughnessy has taken the trouble to come here and tell the house what your lordships joint committee on statutory instruments feels about the way in which these regulations have been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i have to thank the minister for that very unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> with his ancestry he knows that wales is not only a most beautiful country but a small and vulnerable one <e> <s> he will also know that concern about environmental issues is becoming ever more widespread both in the united kingdom and in the european community <e> <s> does he recognise that to isolate the administration of environmental protection in wales could prove to be a false kindness <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important matter for wales <e> <s> i do not often intervene at question time whereas the noble and learned lord intervenes on almost every possible occasion <e> <s> does the minister accept that the welsh voice should be heard as of right and not of favour in the highest quarters of environmental policy-making and that this will not normally be achieved by concentrating concern in a small isolated and separated administration <e>", "<cs> mr lords will the minister indicate how his reply squares with what the secretary of state for the environment is reported to have said to mr brian walden on television on sunday that a great britain personality on the scientific side is somehow to be preserved <e> <s> where does wales fit in with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the parties concerned have personal interests among other things <e> <s> such opinion is by no means universal in wales <e> <s> one of the largest voluntary organisations the royal society for the protection of birds has publicly declared that the proposed arrangements will be a disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords can it be explained why scotland has had this consultation document and the welsh office has refused to issue anything <e>", "<cs> my lords as number on a list of speakers which extends to names it falls to me to try to set a modest example to some though not all of those who follow me by severely curtailing my remarks <e> <s> much of what i wished to say was put to your lordships with eloquence and authority by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and sustained by my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe <e> <s> there has also been the contribution of the noble baroness lady warnock and that just now which i greatly appreciated of the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> i have no wish to repeat arguments which have been put with greater knowledge and authority than i could possibly command <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a perfectly irrelevant interjection <e> <s> i was saying that whatever the opinions of my noble friend he can follow them without constraint <e> <s> i should be allowed to follow mine <e> <s> i do not believe that anyone has the right to deter or deflect anyone who wishes to take advantage of properly controlled research <e> <s> we are discussing properly controlled research based on the general principles of the warnock report as explained so clearly by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i shall say no more <e> <s> i have made my personal position clear i leave the field open to others with perhaps more specific experiences to described than i can contribute <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl intervened in my speech last week so perhaps he will allow me to intervene in his <e> <s> the select committees of your lordships house make no pretence of being representative <e> <s> they are responsible to the house unlike in the other place where committees are representative <e> <s> i think that we should keep that quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount has said that the opposition are making something of a meal of this does he agree that it is the best christmas dinner that any opposition had for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that if the government want per cent <e> <s> agreement when there are obvious conflicts of interest we shall never have legislation on common land <e> <s> is it not therefore the path of statesmanship to recognise that one must obtain the best agreement possible <e> <s> most of us are now of the opinion that we have obtained the best possible with the remarkable co-operation of people who recognise that their interests are not always consonant one with another but who are prepared to give way to a certain extent <e> <s> the government should show a little statesmanship for a change <e>", "<cs> my lords in intervening briefly in this debate i wish to deal with one aspect only of the important subject introduced by my noble friend lord peston namely the improved propects of access to higher education for those who lack normal qualifications for entry <e> <s> in doing so i am keenly aware of the importance of training as well as formal education to improve our british image and prospects <e>", "<cs> can the minister explain what the government propose to do about these very difficult multiple pregnancies which cause a great deal of distress <e>", "<cs> could it not be reconsidered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer the point made by the noble baroness lady seear about disadvantaged persons and their training <e> <s> if these outfits are to be profit-making they will charge <e> <s> who will pay the fees or other expenses of those who are disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will surely recognise that there is some difference between family planning and planning land development <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> it is unsatisfactory to equate the running of hardship funds in universities with the running of access funds in view of the problems that will be faced with the access funds <e> <s> they are quite different matters <e> <s> the hardship funds are for exceptional difficulties for example in the case of someone whose grant has not arrived from overseas or someone with a death in the family where one must step in and ensure that the student can continue his education without having a break on financial grounds <e> <s> the hardship funds are not for the widespread administrative difficulties which would undoubtedly be faced <e> <s> that is why the committee of vice-chancellors and principals is so unwilling to undertake that kind of administration without having any extra resources for the administrative costs involved <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister again but the arguments on the governments side are so unsatisfactory <e> <s> one must include the per cent <e> <s> poll tax in the equation <e> <s> people are bored to death with the poll tax but it is part of the equation and in some areas it will be a significant amount <e>", "<cs> it is unfortunate that this debate should be taking place at this hour because it touches on one of the most serious aspects affected by the legislation before us <e> <s> i am not adequately prepared and the time is too short to try to go into any great detail <e> <s> surely the government must recognise that there is something wrong when they are accused as they are in relation to housing benefits and students of neither respecting real need nor ascertaining true cost <e> <s> there is something quite fundamentally wrong about that <e>", "<cs> the chance of uninterrupted study in certain homes is minimal <e>", "<cs> i was <e> <s> i heard everything that the noble earl said which was based on regional differences of costs <e> <s> that is not what we are discussing now <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by the noble viscounts noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is valid <e> <s> however we must do our very utmost to obtain international agreement on standards <e> <s> therefore working through the imo is probably the most effective way forward <e> <s> will her majestys government take full cognizance of the importance of the international element <e> <s> otherwise our shipping will be still further disadvantaged by foreign owners who register under other flags <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the leader of the house recognise that that applies to the front bench but not to the rest of us who have taken an interest in the bill <e> <s> i was in the wilds of north wales and would not expect my front bench to try to contact me on the three or four different telephones which i passed so to speak over the weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is made more difficult when the minister has tabled an amendment which is grouped with others one of which has been moved by another member of your lordships house <e> <s> i was under the same impression as my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i thought that we were really listening to the noble earl introducing his own amendments as opposed to the precise line taken by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> it puts the house in a very difficult position when the minister is trying to introduce his amendment and at the same time referring to another <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord make this perfectly clear <e> <s> did i understand him to say that this will be treated with the usual parsimony of the treasury as additionality <e>", "<cs> my lords that is regrettable because the whole exercise in additionality is something about which some of us fail to agree <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has already replied <e> <s> the noble lord should sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i draw the attention of the noble earl to the fact that this coming year will be particularly arduous because it covers the entire body of students as i understand it and not just one years entry which will occur later on <e> <s> we have to arrange as we shall in our college to deal with some students though not all of them will be eligible for the loan system as some are from overseas <e> <s> nevertheless it will be a very difficult job and if as the noble lord lord flowers indicated we have to check a number of personal documents whatever they may be i cannot help thinking how much easier it would be for the government to accede to the vice-chancellors suggestion that it should all be done through the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree with the noble lord lord renton that if we accept the amendment now there is still an opportunity in another place for members to say that they do not accept it <e> <s> we then have the procedure between the houses and so on <e> <s> if we do not have this provision on the face of the bill we have nothing that will sustain us if by unhappy chance anything should go wrong with the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all wish to thank the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for yet again

defeat of gladstones second home rule bill upset the apple cart and started people thinking <e> <s> in practical terms the only major changes made to our powers were the drastic changes which occurred

better <e>", "<cs> not in politics my lords <e> <s> i leave my noble friend lord mishcon on the front bench to deal with this matter except for one point which i will touch on before i conclude <e>

of the sea and also when he was a commissioner in brussels in charge of ec policy on the environment among other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that it was precisely because there was a remarkable consensus following very long discussions between the various organisations concerned that we hoped that the government would at last take some action <e>", "<cs> can the minister deal with the real situation rather than with semantics <e> <s> surely my noble friend is right <e> <s> technically it may not be a contract and rewording of the amendment may be necessary

of practice <e> <s> the reality of the situation has not been met by the minister <e>", "<cs> that answer is merely taking refuge in words <e> <s> how does the minister propose to deal with the reality of the situation which appears to present a considerable practical difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i strongly support what the noble lord said <e> <s> during my long experience in both houses i have never received at this stage a document put before the house which is difficult to read <e> <s> there has been no opportunity to obtain a properly printed copy

well-founded <e> <s> the point is this who will know what the advice was <e>", "<cs> i think that we are back where we were a short time ago <e> <s> we have reached the stage where an appeal from the secretary of state to the secretary of state does not make constitutional sense <e> <s> however i think that there should be a strong obligation on him to ensure that the decisions he makes and the

<s> are parts of wales to be called regional <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness admit that unless she is in a position to give us exact figures next week there will be continuing great apprehension among the staff and so far as concerns wales the members of the new council that is to be established as to precisely what they will be allowed to do and what resources they will have at their disposal for the deployment of staff and other necessities for the proposed new administration <e> <s> at present no one knows how to plan in advance because the government have not been in a position to give them any firm information <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of wearying the house i must reinforce what was said by my noble friends <e> <s> in my long experience of public life i have never come across a more time-consuming procedure than that required to designate a marine nature reserve <e> <s> it is an appalling area of bureaucracy <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will not satisfy herself with fair words although we are always glad to hear from her <e> <s> the situation ought not to be allowed to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question not merely of speeding up the process but of altering it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not for one moment fail to acknowledge the excellent work which has been carried out by various organisations both public and voluntary in particular situations <e> <s> however what worries me is that the totality of the effort that is being carried out may not produce results that are commensurate with the time and resources spent on endless consultations conferences seminars and other such things <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i am not the only member of this house who finds it disturbing that at this late stage with only a few days between now and prorogation we are still unsure of a fundamental element of the whole exercise <e> <s> i find that extremely disturbing <e> <s> during the last few minutes i have tried to visualise the position of the two welsh representatives on the joint committee <e> <s> how will they be able to discharge their functions without running into the kind of legal risks so eloquently described by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> if that presents a danger for the joint committee i cannot see why in certain circumstances it will not also present a danger for the body in wales and ultimately in scotland <e> <s> i believe that in wales the legal power now vested in the ncc to designate areas as sssis national nature reserves and so forth will be exercised by a committee which has a dual function <e> <s> therefore would it not be putting the members of that committee at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she explain the position of the secretaries of state for scotland and for wales respectively <e> <s> they have certain legal responsibilities <e> <s> are they to be advised by the joint committee or are they to take the advice of their own joint bodies and ignore the joint committee <e>", "<cs> my lords occasionally the speaker in the house of commons confused me with lady bacon but i had hoped that in this house a distinction might be made <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government are considering that important issue i shall speak in defence of paragraph c <e> <s> i had thought that encourage was an in-word on the conservative benches <e> <s> it appears so frequently in the white paper that i thought it would meet with universal approbation <e> <s> i am concerned not only with the social and economic interests of rural areas but also with the nature of the social and economic development which should enhance the natural environment of wales <e> <s> certain suggestions for development in rural areas certainly do not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i may be prepared to do a deal on this matter <e> <s> if the noble baroness will give me an assurance that she will withdraw the emphasis on particularity as regards subsections a a and b then in all the circumstances i shall be prepared to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> however this is a very serious matter and if the noble baroness does not give that undertaking it will be impossible for me to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords <e> <s> we have reached a stage in this legislation where we cannot carry on the argument indefinitely <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord crickhowell that i cannot see the flexibility when we are told that an essential feature of reorganisation of the new country agencies is that they should perform exactly the same functions as at present <e> <s> i can see possible legal difficulties <e> <s> we had a warning last week from the noble lord lord jenkin of roding about a judicial review <e> <s> that is likely to occur from time to time <e> <s> if one steps outside something dreadful might happen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that this is purely a bilateral arrangement between the military authorities of great britain and those of the united states and that it has nothing to do with for example any nato commitments that we may have <e> <s> does the minister understand that if he tried his hardest he could not have found a more sensitive site in the whole of wales for this installation <e> <s> this is not just a matter of local opposition <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord lord crickhowell is fully aware of that fact <e> <s> to put the matter at its lowest does the minister recognise that if the government want to lose the few conservative seats that they still hold in wales this is an excellent way to start that process <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome our debate today partly because the report of your lordships select committee well deserves consideration and partly because it provides me with an opportunity to draw your lordships attention to the very serious problems which face the rural community in my own country of wales <e> <s> i listened with much interest to the stimulating speech of the most reverend primate <e> <s> it left me with the feeling that salvation stops at offas dyke <e> <s> i am sure that that was not intentional <e> <s> it was very much an english enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords that is most regrettable <e> <s> i had always hoped to recognise him as a fellow countryman but i am obviously deprived of that privilege <e> <s> perhaps he will tell me afterwards which radnor he belongs to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt simply to correct the noble lord <e> <s> it is called the development board for rural wales <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been advisable to have withdrawn the bill and reprinted it in a logical order rather than have this arrangement which i do not believe that i have ever seen before on an order paper <e>"]
