["<cs> my lords it is a very great pleasure on this my first speech in your lordships chamber to follow two such familiar and doughty warriors as the noble lords lord gray and lord ross <e> <s> i understand that one of the most valuable functions of this house is to scrutinise and revise legislation but i take it that we are also prepared to ask from time to time whether particular bills are necessary at all <e> <s> one of the most telling arguments in favour of the bill before us is that it repeals a great deal of previous legislation but it has positive aspects of its own <e> <s> it is extremely widely drawn and under it regulations could be made about practically anything <e> <s> it also gives extremely wide powers though they may have appeared in previous bills <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the minister two short questions before he replies to the official opposition <e> <s> a certain amount of dismay if anything the minister says could cause dismay has been occasioned in shetland by some of his remarks on second reading <e> <s> i asked him about the prospects of a management scheme and he was rather dismissive of the possibility of any management scheme although in the previous parliament the government had not been wholly opposed to it <e> <s> indeed it is known that in brussels it is looked on with some favour <e> <s> in shetland and orkney there is considerable interest and indeed enthusiasm for a management scheme <e> <s> the question i want to put to the minister is whether he will have conversations with the shetland and orkney fishermen about their proposals for such a scheme <e> <s> if so it clearly might have an effect upon clause of this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise two points about the amendment before we depart from it <e> <s> i know that these extremely wide powers are available to fishery officers under other legislation but i still think we ought to be told whether they are necessary because they are exceedingly wide <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of your lordships committee to the wording of paragraph <e>", "<cs> have we any evidence that the powers have been justified <e> <s> have the fishery officers said that they could not do their duty without the powers <e> <s> have there been any cases in which the powers have been essential <e> <s> it seems to me that otherwise we shall be writing the powers into statute after statute without any examination as to whether or not they are necessary <e> <s> the urgency cannot be so very great the provision is concerned only with documents <e> <s> there are plenty of powers to detain a fishing boat in port to prevent it from taking to sea until the documents can be examined <e> <s> i should like a little more <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister is having difficulty in convincing me <e> <s> however i was thinking that if we were entitled to demand the noble lords diary or if we were to get someone else to produce it and we were to read in it the appalling things that he does in his spare time there would indeed be some reaction but that is what he is holding out as being necessary in regard to fishery law <e>", "<cs> following what has just been said by the noble lord may i ask whether it is intended to have any special representation from scotland or indeed from wales on the board <e> <s> i am not myself clear at the moment that this is necessary but of course scotland is explicitly represented on certain similar boards <e> <s> i should like to know from the government whether it is their intention that this should be the case here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the official opposition for allowing these benches to ask the first question on the statement <e> <s> in deference to the distinguished lawyers i see on the opposition front bench i must say that i fully understand that this is without prejudice <e> <s> bearing in mind that the question was asked by a colleague of mine in another place i should like to know whether i am right in thinking that the main danger from the chemical would arise if any of the barrels were hauled on the deck of a trawler and there opened or split and that the chemical affects the skin and hands of people <e> <s> i take it that the crews of trawlers have been advised not to touch the barrels if they come up in their trawls <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome the statement <e> <s> it is good news for the fishing industry that we have made some progress rather earlier than usual in the year <e> <s> i should like to ask three questions <e> <s> can the minister tell us more of what the total allowable catch particularly for haddock cod and herring is and whether the extra mackerel catch that was wanted in the minch has been granted <e> <s> secondly can he say when the minch will close for mackerel <e> <s> thirdly can he say more about herring over which some disquiet has already been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the individual objectors at a great disadvantage in these inquiries <e> <s> with all due deference to what has been said would not the inquiry be shortened cheapened and very often the result be much better if lawyers were forbidden to take part in them <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> surely it would be much better where it was possible to proceed by agreement on the matters with which this bill deals and where there are local area committees which have satisfactorily come to an arrangement between the different interests of fishing then it would seem sensible to allow them to proceed with it <e> <s> secondly as has been pointed out this is not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to make one point in reference to this amendment and possibly the next one <e> <s> i fully take the noble lords point <e> <s> we are all nature conservationists to some extent today and no-one wants to see the essential areas of the sea-bottom destroyed by trawling <e> <s> but i daresay that the noble lord would agree that the nature conservationists are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deply indebted to the minister for one more explanation <e> <s> may i finish by quoting a saying often heard around the coasts of scotland it is no good arguing with ailsa craig <e> <s> therefore i shall drop the attempt and meaning no offence thank the noble lord once again and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words at least in support of the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> whether it is essential or correctly drafted i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will consider this amendment favourably <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross of marnock said it may not be perfectly drafted <e> <s> i would have drafted it a little wider and extended the scope of consultation to other bodies besides the inshore fishing industry if there are bodies representing other elements of the fishing industry <e> <s> i think they could be consulted too <e> <s> but that is a minor matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am in order in saying one word in view of what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not sat down and i am very glad to hear it <e> <s> i am much obliged to the noble lord for not sitting down <e> <s> may i then put this point to him <e> <s> not only is he quite right of course about the emergency but does he not think it a little alarming that the minister particularly referred to a dispute and said that the secretary of state might have to act very quickly because of a dispute <e> <s> i accept the noble lords view that it is very unlikely that he would have to act very quickly in any degree but i thought that the ministers argument was <e>", "<cs> as this is a matter of some complexity in fact complexity worthy of the parliamentary draftsmen i am not certain that i understand it all even after the lucid explanation from the noble lord lord howard <e> <s> but in so far as i do understand it i strongly recommend that part of it which emphasises that in rural areas landlords still have some rights <e> <s> they have a long-term interest in the land and it is only right that they should be consulted <e> <s> so i merely adopt what has been said by several noble lords already and support that part of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may very briefly intervene i would wish to support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i ought i suppose to confess to an interest in that i am chairman of an organisation called job ownership limited which exists to promote co-operatives management buy-outs and the like <e> <s> i think everyone would agree that the wider ownership of shares is highly desirable in this country and also greater participation by the workers in the management of the companies in which they work <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is very welcome news <e> <s> but has he any comparable figures for the rest of the country and can he say whether this fall in crime coincides with more policemen on foot on the beat which many people think is the most effective deterrent to crime <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> i particularly agree with what he said about the importance of overseas students <e> <s> i am glad to say that the university of kent with which i am most acquainted still succeeds in spite of difficulties in attracting a remarkable number of overseas students <e> <s> i should like to join the congratulations offered to the noble lord lord wilson rievaulx and also to join those who have thanked the noble lord lord annan not only for giving us a very long day on education but for his most refereshing speech about universities especially coming from a paid-up supporter of the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the sale of a liquid made in japan and masquerading as whisky is in general to be discouraged <e> <s> has the noble baroness any knowledge of the bbc insisting that at least the japanese clearly mark their bottles as not being scotch whisky <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate the noble viscount on choosing this subject <e> <s> i am delighted to be able to debate the work of the highlands and islands development board and i agree with almost the whole of the noble viscounts speech <e> <s> if i have one quibble it is over the wording of his motion because i think it could have called attention not only to the cost of the board to the national economy but to its benefits <e> <s> i think it has been of great benefit not only to the highlands but also to the economy in general <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there will be widespread sympathy with her noble friends suggestion <e> <s> is she aware also that many people feel that the foreign ministers ought to go a great deal further than they have gone so far <e> <s> is it not rather alarming that neither the great powers nor the united nations appear to be able to do anything in the iran-iraq war or to stop the fighting in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is widespread sympathy with the point behind the question of the noble lord <e> <s> lord dean and that many people will be asking why it is that water authorities need to meet in secret at all <e> <s> there is not much hope for open government unless if i may say so they at least can satisfy the public that their charges are reasonable <e> <s> will the minister make it clear that responsibility to the secretary of state is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for delaying the minister <e> <s> i do not want to speak at any length partly because the case has been so admirably argued by both my noble friends <e> <s> i should like to make three points extremely briefly <e> <s> i wonder whether the government understand with what contempt and astonishment europeans regard their behaviour <e> <s> this is a serious point <e> <s> we are the only country in europe which pursues this extraordinary electoral system <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mayhew said all the arguments that might be advanced against it in a particular country have no relevance at all when it comes to electing the european parliament <e> <s> if one travels abroad one realises that it is a matter of extraordinary astonishment not only among liberals but among christian democrats and social democrats through-out europe that we continue with it in defiance of the wishes and indeed the customs of the european assembly <e> <s> it makes europeans think still more that we are totally out of tune with the advance towards co-operation in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness go a little further on the questions which have already been asked <e> <s> will she agree that it is hardly enough simply to take the opinion of a governor as represent-ing the people of hong kong however excellent he may be <e> <s> in a democratic country surely there must be some obligation to devise some democratic means of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that some of the extra employment that has arisen as a result of oil is in places such as shetland and orkney which have very little else to offer in the way of employment and that as oil production runs down it will be important to support the local authorities in finding alternative work and in training some of the people who will lose their current employment and indeed in encouraging investment in other labour-producing industries and services in the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that an initiative was taken by mr macgregors predecessor at the british steel corporation under which the corporation set up an organisation that did a great deal to find alternative jobs at corby when the steelworks there was closed <e> <s> will the noble lord perhaps have a word with mr macgregor in his new incarnation to see if a similar initiative might be taken in certain places where pits are closed leaving widespread unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord beloff for introducing this motion and for the interesting speech which he made in arguing for it <e> <s> i am also delighted to follow the noble lord <e> <s> lord cledwyn of penrhos who introduced into the debate a note of cheerful acerbity for which he is well merited <e> <s> i do not wish to take issue with him in his many stringent criticisms of the government because that is not my business but i would make just one or two comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wholly on the noble lords side <e> <s> the government have kept the co-operative development agency in being and what they are going to do now we do not know <e> <s> i am wholly with the noble lord that co-operatives are one way of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay these proceedings too much <e> <s> we have argued a great deal about this matter but i am bound to say that i regard the ministers arguments as bureaucracy of the worst order <e> <s> the whole difficulty arises not from any reality but from the technical point that islands councils are both housing authorities and education authorities <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the realities of the world <e> <s> it has to do with what goes on in the scottish office <e> <s> the argument over these houses is that many of them are on separate islands <e> <s> it is not a question of remote areas they are divided by the sea and the scottish office cannot ignore the sea <e> <s> it cannot pretend that separate islands are exactly the same as edinburgh or glasgow because they are not <e> <s> god made them differently and not even the noble lord can put that right <e>", "<cs> if no one else is going to address the committee on this important matter i shall take it upon myself to say a few words largely adopting those that have already been said <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord the minister will be able to deny that scottish rating is now on a very narrow base indeed and getting narrower <e> <s> nor can he deny that over the last two or three years the government have put more and more responsibilities on local authorities <e> <s> we have had at least two long local government scotland bills mostly on unimportant matters evading the main troubles of local government but nevertheless putting new duties on local authorities <e> <s> meanwhile the base upon which they raise their finance is being steadily narrowed <e> <s> it is long past the time when we need a new system of raising local government finance <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me to interrupt perhaps i may say that i would hate him to go away with that impression i hope i said no such thing <e> <s> what i said was that the government had introduced two bills much of which i thought was unnecessary but of course the noble lords committee had made a very great contribution of thought <e> <s> i am very glad of this opportunity to put that on record <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not wish to delay matters <e> <s> i did mention it <e> <s> to have gone into it in detail at this time in this debate might have irritated the committee and indeed possibly if there is such a possibility have been out of order <e>", "<cs> on the face of it this seems to be a reasonable amendment <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the views of the government upon it <e> <s> perhaps they will be able to explain what the clause means <e> <s> after the words <e>", "<cs> before we pass from this point if the minister intends to reply to the noble lord lord ross could he also reply to the question i am going to ask <e> <s> the noble lord has an important point when he says that matters have changed since he was secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> i am not convinced that everything he did as secretary of state was itself ideal but certainly things have changed <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the two basic objections to the governments attitude towards rates are these first that instead of laying down more precisely what local authorities have power to do and relieving them of many duties they have left it very largely open-ended in some directions about what they can do and they have laid new duties upon them <e> <s> it is absurd to proceed by allowing the local authorities to take on commitments of all sorts indeed encourage them to do so then say that they are spending too much and that they must be cut <e>", "<cs> i do not object to this very strongly either <e> <s> certainly i think a ratepayer may well have the right to inspect the accounts <e> <s> in fact i thought he had but if he has not then i agree that this is reasonable <e> <s> there is a very small point here <e> <s> over the last two or three years there have been constant additions made to what local authorities are bound to do and at the same time the government constantly complain that they take on more staff and spend more money <e> <s> as i say this is a very small matter but it is cumulative and it will add to the work of local authorities <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to interrupt <e> <s> if that is so does the word interested add anything at all <e> <s> when the noble lord is looking at the redrafting of this clause will he consider leaving out the word interested <e> <s> as far as i can see he has now made it so broad that anyone engaged in research of any kind can go to a local authority and ask to see the accounts <e> <s> if that is so the word interested seems to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that there is a considerable debate in the country as to who really represents the majority of the electors <e> <s> certainly the government do not they were elected into office at the general election without an overall majority and they do not have an overall majority today <e> <s> from what he has said does he not draw the conclusion that this is the house which fairly represents the feelings of the country and not the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us what the law is in regard to inquests held on british citizens killed abroad <e> <s> who decides that they shall be held and who decided in this case <e> <s> further in view of her last answer are we to take it that there are to be no further inquiries as to the allegations that the embassy did not take sufficient notice of the danger in which mr skinner apparently alleged he stood <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has said that it was possible to hold inquests on british citizens killed abroad <e> <s> can she tell us who decides to hold an inquest and who so decided in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl interpret the words possible recoverable in his reply <e> <s> does that imply that these reserves are theoretically recoverable at however great cost or are they economically recoverable and if so what assumptions are made about the future price of oil <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies perhaps he could clarify my mind on one point <e> <s> i think he said in his opening remarks about this amendment that it in no way changed the law it merely clarified it <e> <s> may i take it therefore that it will not affect the rating values of orkney and shetland to any extent <e> <s> as he will be aware there are some very large moorings for sullom voe and flotta <e> <s> am i to understand that there will be no change so far as they are concerned in the rating position <e>", "<cs> my lords before we part with this bill can i enter a small protest against the drafting of it <e> <s> it was almost entirely drafted by references to other bills <e> <s> it is a matter of very great importance to every ratepayer in scotland and it is really rather intolerable that legislation should be put out from parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the comparison between the universities and the polytechnics do not the figures show as one would expect that it is very much cheaper to educate art students and <e> <s> that being so why it is very necessary to increase the number of science students <e> <s> if it is finance that is worrying the government about university expenditure will they give an assurance that they will not cut down the number of art students which potentially is very great indeed purely on grounds of economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for rising to speak at this hour <e> <s> i thought that i had my name down on the list of speakers but i am told that my request did not reach the appropriate authority <e> <s> i know that there is nothing more depressing than an extra speaker at twenty minutes past oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords while i know that many of the bodies which the noble lord the minister has consulted are grateful for the change that has been made may i ask whether it is not the case that they are still very worried about the impact of vat on repairs to historic buildings <e> <s> may i also ask the minister whether it is intended that there should be further conversations with them about this matter in the hope that a more agreeable solution can be found <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay the proceedings on this bill and perhaps i am really rising on a point of information <e> <s> do i understand that a motion to postpone discussion of the title means that the government are going to amend the long title and that they are going to amend the long title after this bill has passed all its stages in the house of commons in such a way that it will cease to be a paving bill and that important changes will be made in the powers of local authorities <e> <s> if that is the case then surely it is a somewhat unusual procedure <e> <s> i do not for one moment allege that it is an abuse of parliamentary procedure but surely it is stretching parliamentary procedure rather far to amend the long title of the bill at this stage to make it really a rather different type of bill <e>", "<cs> i did not imply that there was anything sinister about it and of course i am most grateful to the noble lord i fully understand that i am a novice as regards the procedure of your lordships house <e> <s> but this is a very important constitutional bill and a paving bill <e> <s> i just raise the point is it really the custom not to make minor amendments to the bill and therefore change the title but really to change the nature of the bill <e> <s> as i understand it it is to enable that to be done that this motion is being moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the decision of the government to continue the co-operative development agency and industrial development bill <e> <s> like the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce of donington i am somewhat curious why they have taken the power to give it direction and to wind it up by order but the government have assured us that they are wholeheartedly behind the agency and therefore we must suppsose that there is nothing sinister in those parts of the bill <e> <s> though as the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce of donington has said we shall no doubt want to examine them rather carefully in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am profoundly doubtful whether our problem can be solved by the appointment of new ministers or indeed new advisory bodies <e> <s> however if we are to have a new advisory body on youth problems can the noble baroness the minister give us an assurance that some members of the body will be youthful that is to say they will be under <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is well aware of course that most of those engaged in the youth service field are well over <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister state the up-to-date position in scotland <e> <s> will he tell the house what are the arguments for allowing monofilament nets to be used at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are most grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> is he aware that we are indeed impressed with the importance of economy by local authorities and is he aware also that we do not believe he will ever achieve such economy under the present method of allowing local authorities to fix their budgets and then attempting rate capping <e> <s> the solution is to reform the system of local government finance so that instead of a wholly capricious rating system which many people do not pay or pay in full the local electors are much more responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that up to now it has been a principle of our dealing with the colonies that formally so to speak the whole population should be consulted about their future before it is decided <e> <s> do we understand from her statement that welcome as may be these consultations with certain officials in the case of hong kong there is going to be no such procedure which as i say has been the common form in dealing with the future of all other colonies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that nothing astounds us less on these benches than the coalition between the conservative and labour parties on this matter <e> <s> is he also aware that what surprises us is that a minister of the crown should say that he regards a fair representation of political opinion in the european parliament as meaning that per cent <e> <s> of people in this country have no representation at all <e> <s> is he aware that there are arguments against electoral reform but that there is no conceivable reason for saying that it results in a fair representation in the european parliament <e> <s> does the conservative party really want to find itself arm in arm with the labour party and on the record by this quite monstrous answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister holds that all members of the other place represent all their constituents why does the conservative party bother to have general elections at all <e> <s> surely the answer is that they can quite well be represented by the labour and alliance members of the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this would appear to many people to be one of the most important developments which have taken place <e> <s> can he say on behalf of the government what help they are giving <e> <s> is the finance to come exclusively out of sums already voted to the national coal board or are they giving special aid to this very important project <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the minister <e> <s> it will not have escaped his attention that this was partly a public relations exercise in which i hope the govenment will take some notice of these new developments in the social services <e> <s> in view of his reassurance i beg leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for his explanation of the governments thinking <e> <s> i found it good in parts and bad in other parts and i should like to study what he has said <e> <s> to begin with it seemed to me that he was taking up a very negative attitude to the paramount importance of educating people more widely in the advantage of co-operation as a third way forward in the whole industrial world <e> <s> but later he seemed to be saying that he would encourage the agency to go in for seminars and other means of propaganda <e> <s> i should like to examine exactly what he has said <e> <s> i appreciate that there are other means of spreading the gospel and i appreciate also that the agency has only a limited amount of money and that because of that it may not want to take on too much work <e>", "<cs> i am not sure exactly what procedure allows me to do but i have no doubt that with the leave of the committee i can go on speaking <e> <s> i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord oram who of course speaks with great authority on this matter <e> <s> if i may say so i agree wholly with him that i have been going rather wider than training but the minister also did so <e> <s> it is difficult to draw an exact <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will enlighten us about what is intended by this power <e> <s> first it was not included in the bill <e> <s> therefore may i ask him to tell us what has led to the government suddenly taking the power to abolish the cda <e> <s> the minister spoke earlier without qualification <e> <s> he said that the cda would live for six years <e> <s> the minister did not say that the government would abolish the cda <e> <s> i know that the minister is an exceptionally careful man and as he did not qualify what he said i took him to mean that the cda would have a life of six years <e> <s> now however we know that this is not to be the case <e> <s> in other words the cda is on sufferance and can be abolished at any time that the government take it into their heads to do so by order in council <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should just explain a little further what i had in mind <e> <s> i have taken the word liability in clause <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord the minister and as he has said he will take a further look at the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> of course we must have assistance for the regions in this very over-centralised country but i believe it is not unreasonable to set a period of months as this amendment suggests <e> <s> we have had the experience of delorean and it is apparent that the vetting of all projects has not always been as good as it should be and that a particular responsibility now rests on parliament to see that open-ended commitments are not entered into <e>", "<cs> i would always rate brevity in ministers as one of their highest qualities and i am delighted to accept this <e> <s> i wanted to find out whether plant included vessels or not <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support what has already been said by the mover of this amendment and by my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i also rise to ask a question which arises out of the debate we had on this matter in committee <e> <s> i left that debate not entirely clear as to what in the governments view the co-operative agency could do <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister to look at columns and of the committee stage debate <e> <s> at the bottom of column the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth <e> <s> he has indeed repeated what he wrote in his letter to me <e> <s> i am sorry that the government do not feel able to extend this bill <e> <s> i recognise there would be some extension <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw the noble lords attention to a point which may seem small but which is of very great importance to the people concerned <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the shetland fishermen have a rather different view of the common fisheries policy from that expressed by the scottish fishermens association <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that in shetland there was disappoinment that the committee of your lordships house which has recently been visiting scotland was unable to visit shetland <e> <s> is he also aware that the hake fishery off the north of shetland was traditionally one of the spanish main fisheries <e> <s> i should therefore like to ask the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister agree that unfortunately many of the long-term unemployed are now concentrated in certain districts and communities <e> <s> will the government consider introducing some new measures more specifically aimed at communities which have really lost their traditional form of employment and which are not sufficiently pinpointed under the regional aid which is at present given <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this question apparently in some disorder which i shall be very glad to do may we take it from what the noble lord the minister has said today that one point which i have been doubtful about in my own mind has been cleared up that the original exclusion zone was no guarantee to argentina that if they remained outside it they would not be attacked <e> <s> indeed it was not communicated to them <e> <s> are we to take it that it was simply an instruction to our own commanders that they should not attack argentine ships outside the exclusion zone without the approval of their political masters <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving us a chance to discuss these questions concerning all local government before we become totally drowned in london <e> <s> i listened with great profit and interest to the speech from the noble lord lord brooks <e> <s> with many things he said towards the end of his speech i found myself in total agreement but there are two points on which i disagree with him <e> <s> i do not believe that the government are deliberately out to kill local democracy <e> <s> the troubles of local democracy arise from muddle and confusion and from the frequent changes to which he himself drew attention when he outlined what has been happening over local government finance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that among the many interesting sidelines to this matter the question of access to leuchars junction station arises <e> <s> is he aware that this might well be impeded <e> <s> will he take the opportunity therefore to press british rail to re-open the line to st andrews <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord will highly approve of that <e> <s> if in so doing they are forced to pull down the monstrous hotel which they have built on the old station at st andrews that would be a very good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that answer but could she be a little more specific as to whether she has since the american presidential election definitely protested to the americans about the flow of funds to murderers <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that further steps could be taken to stop this and that any such steps would be most welcome not only in this country but to most people in southern ireland as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government pay particular attention to the very constructive suggestions made by my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> may i also ask whether some sympathy is not due to the secretary of state for education in trying as i understand it to tackle a problem which is very obvious <e> <s> the problem is that the comparatively rich or middle classes have a much better chance of reaching universities than do the poor or what are called the working classes and having got there they are to a large extent supported by the taxpayers many of whom are poorer than they are <e> <s> bearing in mind that there are many large claims upon the taxpayer the claim to help africa the claim of the national health service and the claims of all the social services is there not a real problem as to how we are to finance universities <e> <s> i think the situation is recognised by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the allegations made by the cnd can the noble minister give an assurance that none of this failure to deliver is due to censorship carried out without authority by the post office <e> <s> can he also tell us what if any authority there is for opening the cnd letters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he would not agree that the constantly escalating costs of this weapon will distort the whole defence budget <e> <s> would he agree i am sure he would that there is no doubt that the cost estimates are going to be about double what they were originally and that this is bound to mean cuts in conventional arms and other much more essential parts of our defence programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that mildly encouraging answer <e> <s> may i ask him to be a little more specific <e> <s> would it not be a good thing bearing in mind that industrial relations have not always been spectacularly improved by the present state of nationalisation to encourage workers co-operatives in some parts of the nationalised industries <e> <s> might it not even be a good thing to suggest to the miners that if they believe they can keep certain mines open to advantage then they might try their hand at one or two of those mines <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the government treat receipts from the sale of the capital of nationalised industries as income and set it against the psbr <e> <s> are not local authorities entitled to do the same thing or are they forced to treat the sale of their capital assets as capital <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not this charge is called a tax does not the minister agree that even his own supporters have said that it certainly has the effect of a tax <e> <s> is there any point in reducing taxation if this highly regressive impost is to be carried out through the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take this opportunity to clear up what i believe to be a misapprehension <e> <s> is he aware that there appear to be some people now in receipt of free drugs who are frightened that the government intend either to deny them those drugs or to make them pay for them <e> <s> am i right in thinking that there is no such intention on the part of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government are further considering this matter will they bear in mind that the student unions perform many useful tasks for students as well as making a nuisance of themselves on occasion <e> <s> would they also consider that many students are short of money and they might prefer that this quite large grant out of public funds which is available to their unions was paid to them and they could then make up their minds regarding what they want to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister one question concerning scotland <e> <s> may i first of all say how much i agree with what has been said about the lack of any inquiry into the finance of local authorities <e> <s> in the absence of that i feel that this inquiry will be largely frustrated <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether it will be within the powers of the inquiry to inquire into the number of tiers of local government in scotland <e> <s> as he will be aware there has been considerable criticism of the two-tier system in scotland not least from his own party <e> <s> do i take it therefore that it will be outwith the remit of the inquiry <e> <s> if not are they entitled to inquire into it and also into the relationship of the various local authorities in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by acknowledging an interest in this bill because my wife is a trustee of the national museum of antiquities <e> <s> it must not be assumed however that everything i say is a direct echo of what she says <e> <s> secondly i am sorry to say that i have to make an apology because i had not quite realised that we would be so much delayed by statements and it is conceivable that i may have to go to a meeting which i undertook to attend long ago before the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> he has referred twice to the amendment which he intends to move <e> <s> will that amendment give the society of antiquaries representation on the board <e> <s> is that what the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the british merchant navy has fallen from per cent <e> <s> of the world fleet to per cent <e> <s> indeed the fall has been very much steeper since <e> <s> only two new merchant vessels for registration under the british flag have been laid down since last july excluding placements for the falklands <e> <s> the british flag is becoming known as the flag of inconvenience rather than convenience <e> <s> without pre-empting the budget will the government give us an assurance that they will look at the taxation position as it affects british shipping <e> <s> also will they explain how they expect this country to be supplied in the event of war <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure though i am a comparatively new member of your lordships house warmly to congratulate the noble viscount on a quite excellent and extremely fluent maiden speech <e> <s> i remember his predecessor who was a very well-known figure during the war and i am told a very respected member of your lordships house <e> <s> my only <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am greatly obliged to him <e> <s> i have been listening with great care to his explanation of why the present title has been chosen <e> <s> i fully follow his reasoning against talking of the museum of scotland at the present but as i understand it the amendment moved by the noble earl is permissive <e> <s> it does not write this into the bill now but merely gives power to the board with the concurrence of the secretary of state to assume this title or to set up a museum of scotland if in the future the secretary of state should wish to do so <e> <s> if i may say so ably as he has dealt with the present situation i do not feel that the minister has convinced me that this permissive power should not be written into the bill now so that if the trustees and the secretary of state feel as recommended by the williams committee that a museum of scotland should be established they can get on with it at once <e>", "<cs> as i indicated earlier i wish to say a word or two on this clause particularly on sub-section <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but i am not sure that he has understood my amendment <e> <s> perhaps i have drafted it wrongly <e> <s> my amendment i hope leaves in subsection <e>", "<cs> in the light of that further explanation which i still found rather unsatisfactory i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am totally convinced by that argument and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised at the suspicious nature which the minister of state has shown <e> <s> the idea that the board will flog expensive <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as an executor of the national trust of scotland i should like to support this amendment and the general tenor of the amendments moved by my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i do not mean to go over the arguments again but to my mind we still lack an explanation as to why the national trust in scotland is not put on a par with the national trust in england <e> <s> i hope that ministers will not rely on the argument that the national trust in scotland has been getting on quite well without these powers or that these powers are seldom used <e> <s> if these powers are considered necessary for england as i believe they are it would seem to me to place a very heavy onus on the government to explain why they should not be extended to scotland <e>", "<cs> to obviate the danger that i have an answer before my amendment has been moved it might be convenient for the committee if i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> which is very much on the same subject if that is agreeable to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i cannot resist saying that i shall tell my wife who is a member of the board about the very complimentary things that have been said about her <e> <s> the minister has assured us that she is a highly public-spirited woman and that she sweats her guts out in the <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> the old board is down-market compared with this one <e> <s> i want to say that i do not find the arguments of the noble lord lord gray wholly convincing bearing in mind the contrast between this board and the one which is going to preside over the national library <e> <s> while we are grateful for his recognition of the claim of the society of antiquaries to be represented i hope he will look again at this matter and possibly increase its representation and also give us some assurance that the board will really have an adequate number of highly-qualified people to control its activities <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that while there has been an increase in the scottish colony of grey seals the scottish colony represents a fairly high proportion of the total world population of grey seals <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us what has been happening to that population <e> <s> is it also increasing and how does the scottish colony relate to it is it increasing proportionately <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret like my noble friend lord banks that the savings banks were not mutualised but i follow the powerful arguments which have been advanced by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne and i do not want to continue with that debate which has been fairly fully explored <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not the case that at present there are adequate production facilities for motor vehicles in this country to meet the present demand <e> <s> if that is the case is it the governments view that there will be a very great increase in the demand for motor vehicles both in this country and in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i ask a question arising out of what the noble minister has just said <e> <s> may i first of all thank him very much for writing to us all about various matters concerned with this bill <e> <s> however from what he has just said do i understand aright that it will be within the power of the board to establish a totally new museum not merely to amalgamate the royal scottish museum and national museum of antiquities and call them by a new name but to establish a totally new museum whether it is a museum of industry or of anything else <e> <s> that is my first question <e> <s> if that is so it would seem to me that that is one of the main purposes of the amendment that we are discussing <e> <s> i am not quite certain why the minister rejects it but he may feel it is unnecessary <e> <s> anyhow that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords as the position is surely rightly stated by the noble lord lord ross of marnock in that the board cannot make regulations or instruments of a legislative character would it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised a similar amendment in committee to reduce the number of members and indeed to cut down the number of advocates <e> <s> i did not want to abolish them i merely wanted to reduce the large number of advocates <e> <s> my proposal was met with horror by members of the legal profession but i am used to that <e> <s> i remain of my original opinion <e> <s> i was not deeply influenced by the arguments of the minister who seemed to be saying that as this has always gone on it should go on forever <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl lord longford that everything that could be said in favour of this motion has been admirably said by my noble friend lord wigoder <e> <s> i also agree with the noble earl and with my noble and learned friend lord wilson that it appears that there is a very strong tide running through this house this afternoon in favour first of repealing section of the official secrets act and secondly of the widest possible dissemination of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there will indeed be widespread sympathy with what the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter has said about the post in london <e> <s> but it must be said that in certain other parts of the country particularly in orkney where i live the deliveries are extraordinarily good <e> <s> i think there is a great variation in this <e> <s> is the minister aware that it seems to some of us that part of the trouble is that the post office is now overloaded with a miscellaneous collection of duties which deflect its mind from its primary business which is the delivery of the mail as cheaply and as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> may i start by saying that i wholly support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> i would like to take up one or two of the points made by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> first of all i think my noble friend made it clear that if his amendment is accepted and i hope it will be that is not the end of the story <e> <s> there will then have to be a new bill dealing with the trustee savings bank in scotland <e> <s> speaking for myself i wholly accept the general lines of the existing bill and would hope that when a bill dealing with scotland is introduced it would indeed free the trustee savings bank in scotland from some rather antiquated restrictions and from the heavy hand of centralisation <e> <s> i personally hope it would bring in neutralisation <e> <s> but at any rate i wholly accept and i am sure my noble friend does that a new bill would be required and that it would free the bank in the way the present bill does from many restrictions <e>", "<cs> that may be so but moving as i do rather lower down the scale than the active bankers of edinburgh i notice that among the humbler people in scotland there was considerable anxiety that they would be taken over either by the hong kong and shanghai bank or one of their predators <e> <s> i think there was a genuine and widespread feeling throughout scotland that we wished to retain the independence of our own banks <e>", "<cs> i only want to check that i heard the noble earl correctly <e> <s> did he tell your lordships committee that if the board of tsb scotland want to sell their bank they can do so without the authority of their holding company <e> <s> could they for instance sell the whole bank to the chartered bank as was proposed by the royal bank of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> is he aware that the public at large will greet with some alarm and puzzlement the apparent fact that the british cannot design an aircraft of this kind on their own but apparently have to have the help of the brazilians or the swiss <e> <s> is he also aware that it will puzzle them still further that they cannot even supply the engine <e> <s> will he be good enough to enlighten us as to why this is <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will not be deeply moved by the graveyard argument in relation to this amendment <e> <s> it may well be that many of the people who were original subscribers to the trustee savings bank or depositors are indeed dead as it has been going for some years <e> <s> but this is true of any major business <e> <s> it is certainly true of ici or of any other such business that the people who originally launched it on its way have passed on <e> <s> but that is not held to be a reason for denying the present owners and shareholders any share in the ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that in addition to regional aid some important factors at corby have been as follows <e> <s> first of all the work of the british steel corporation and <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl absolutely sure that all the pictures held by the national gallery are always on view if they are not being repaired or conserved <e> <s> secondly may i ask him whether he agrees that this picture which is a genuine part of the british inheritance is probably rightly in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that seems to me to be a slightly academic answer <e> <s> is he not aware that homelessness is one of the greatest human tragedies in this country <e> <s> is he aware that it is costing the local authorities millions of pounds a week to house these people <e> <s> is he aware that it is impossible to ask young people to go about seeking employment when they can neither get accommodation nor pay for it <e> <s> as the noble lord is putting the blame on the local authorities would he not consider allowing them to use all the proceeds from the sale of council houses for either reconditioning accommodation or building new houses <e> <s> would he not also consider freeing the tenancy laws so that more tenancy accommodation can be offered <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for repeating this answer to the private notice question <e> <s> we too express very deep regret at this tragic death and send our sympathy to all those concerned and to the relatives of the boy <e> <s> i think it should be said that sympathy is also due to those who run these centres who really act under great stress and difficulty and must be very concerned about the chain of events of which this is the latest <e>", "<cs> my lords i must with respect take issue with some of what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> to begin with let us make it clear once again that those of us who support the amendment are in favour of the general tenor of the bill which is as the noble lord lord taylor said to enable the savings bank to change its nature and to take part as a normal bank in the wider banking business <e> <s> we are not against that <e> <s> we believe that the amendment does nothing to derogate from that <e> <s> the government are missing an opportunity <e> <s> they are not being asked to harm the bill in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to refer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for introducing this extremely important subject <e> <s> i also find it a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord stallard with many of whose remarks i very much agree <e> <s> i agree particularly with his remarks about the effect of local government finance the need for repairing the housing already in existence and also the effect of closing hostels and such like which i think was also referred to by my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside this particular case which is under inquiry and bearing in mind that the appalling crimes of cruelty to children cannot be dealt with exclusively by the law nevertheless does it not appear to the government that the penalties for assaulting and indeed murdering children appear to be very much lighter than those for similar crimes carried out against adults <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister agree that as has been indicated by the noble lord who asked this question this is not only a matter of what universities do but also of the chances for women in the post-university adult world dominated by men <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that on the whole women are much better than men as drivers of cars and engines and much more skilled in operating many machines <e> <s> will the noble earl do his best to break down the violent male prejudice against women in the many occupations in which they actually excel men <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government agree that the need for an increase in the amount of rented accommodation available is now extremely urgent <e> <s> can the government assure us that their inquiry will not only go into this particular case nor even only into the reform of the rent acts which may be necessary but will look at the general need for more rented accommodation in particular possibly the encouragement of local authorities to provide some more rented accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will have heard the noble lord the minister tell us in his cheerful way that it is the government who are showing such extraordinary generosity by giving million to the ratepayers of scotland <e> <s> is it not the case that it is the taxpayers who will produce the money <e> <s> is this not a prime example of one of the worst features of modern administration <e> <s> instead of going to the root of the trouble which is the ridiculous rating system the government attempt to off-set it at a cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> will the minister say whether he still maintains his admiration for the rating system which he has expressed so recently in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think a slightly delphic reply was given by the noble earl <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the treasury or the government have given assurance to universities that if they raise money from companies and so forth this will not be deducted from their grants <e> <s> is this the case with the arts <e>", "<cs> i welcome this bill and i have no desire at all to delay its progress <e> <s> i am no expert on the eagle nor can i follow the noble lord lord burton on his very knowledgeable and detailed account of the depredations of eagles in the highlands of scotland <e> <s> but i should like to take the opportunity of his amendment to raise a matter which i have raised before that is the general control of predators <e>", "<cs> once again i rise to take advantage of the noble lords amendment to raise a matter which particularly affects orkney <e> <s> in a previous debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether there has been an increase in the amount of new tonnage ordered sailing under the british flag <e> <s> can he also say when the committee which the government i understand have set up to investigate the effects of the decline of our shipping is likely to report <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an honour to be called upon to congratulate on your lordships behalf and on my own the noble baroness upon her notable maiden speech <e> <s> high things were expected of her <e> <s> she comes to us with a long history of achievement in different fields <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that we have not been disappointed <e> <s> of course she has at least two great advantages in dealing with this subject <e> <s> first of all i understand she has mastered existentialism which is the only subject of equal complication to the welfare services <e> <s> secondly she has an elegance of expression which conceals any possible scintilla of controversy which might enter into her speech i am not suggesting that it did but the great art of being controversial is to appear not to be controversial <e> <s> i know we look forward with great expectations to many further speeches from the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that even if the allegations were true the chances of setting off nuclear weapons by mistake so to speak are extremely remote <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may first ask him whether in fact it is the statement which was more or less published in full in the scottish press this morning <e> <s> is it not the case that the scottish press have an advantage over this house in that the paper referred to in the statement appears to have been available to them yesterday but was not in our library three-quarters of an hour ago <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that although this is not surprising it is reprehensible <e> <s> i doubt whether i can expect him to agree with that because no doubt he leaked it <e> <s> however is he aware that the prime minister wrote to me some time ago saying that she disapproved of statements to parliament being issued to the press far in advance of their being made to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay the proceedings <e> <s> but may i be allowed to thank the noble lord the minister for assuring us that the leak had nothing to do with him <e> <s> i shall withdraw any possible imputation that it might have had anything to do with him <e> <s> however would the noble lord not agree that it is most undesirable <e> <s> a leak of this detail must have been authorised in some way at a fairly high level i should have thought in the scottish office <e> <s> will he give an undertaking that some inquiry will be made into how this happened and that steps will be taken to prevent its recurrence <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully appreciate the difficulty of dealing with the problem do the government think that the vast amount of publicity given to terrorist acts is helpful <e> <s> does it not only achieve one of the objects of terrorists but also make the business of controlling terrorism more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords as an original signatory to the amendment to which attention is now being given by the government i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord taylor and also to those who supported him in the conservative and labour parties <e> <s> i think in view of what has just been said that it might be as well to set the record right <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor invited me and i think the noble baroness lady elliot the noble earl lord selkirk and indeed the noble lord lord ross of marnock to meet the representatives of the savings bank <e> <s> if i am wrong no doubt i shall be corrected <e> <s> certainly the noble baroness the noble earl <e> <s> lord selkirk the noble lord lord banks and lord taylor and myself met the representatives of the savings bank <e> <s> it was perfectly open so far as i know for the noble lord lord ross to attend that meeting <e> <s> again no doubt i shall be corrected if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords at any rate will the minister confirm that income tax will be reduced during the present parliament <e>", "<cs> when the minister is dealing with that question will he clarify a point which i have in mind <e> <s> i understand that the bill as drafted would apply to a showground on which sports may take place as they often do when the show is over <e> <s> in my experience there is a certain amount of alcohol available on showgrounds for there is usually a bar at which a certain amount of beer is provided <e> <s> am i right in thinking that this bill could apply to that <e> <s> if that is so i do not think it is sufficient for the noble lord the minister to say that no minister would apply it <e> <s> the point is that parliament should not give powers even if they are not used unless they are shown to be essential and necessary <e> <s> i do not believe that it is essential or necessary that ministers should have a power to enforce the provision of this bill on a showground because there is a certain number of sports and some beer is provided in a bar <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that the whole question of propaganda paid for out of public funds either instigated by or connived at by a public authority was examined not only by the widdicombe inquiry but in general and some code of conduct established <e>", "<cs> subject to your lordships opinion i had proposed to move the second amendment very briefly but i am open to argument <e> <s> i am a new boy in this house <e> <s> it was my intention up to now to speak briefly on the second amendment and to move it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to noble lords who have supported me the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord sandford and to the minister for showing sympathy at least to the thinking behind the amendment <e> <s> i realised that it would be desirable to legislate in general and not piecemeal <e> <s> as i mentioned in moving the amendment i am aware of the proposals in the white paper which were endorsed by the secretary of state for industry <e> <s> but as has been mentioned the trouble is that the financial services legislation will i imagine almost certainly come into operation considerably after this bill <e> <s> it may be that the provisions will still be useful but i think that your lordships will agree that it would have been highly desirable that the provisions which the government themselves say that they at any rate contemplate introducing in the financial services legislation should be available when this bill is passed into legislation if it is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> what he says is absolutely true <e> <s> as he divined i intend with the approval of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for his response to my argument and also to the noble lords lord sandford and lord oram <e> <s> indeed i remember well the noble lord lord orams distinguished chairmanship of the co-operative development agency and i rather look forward to visiting venice with him where no doubt we shall be well received by the gondoliers <e> <s> but i was rather surprised at one remark made by the noble lord the minister which was that it was not the governments intention to interfere in transport <e> <s> i understood that the whole of this bill was an interference in transport <e> <s> if it is not an interference in transport it appears to me that we are wasting our time <e> <s> but i suppose that the noble lord the minister meant that he did not want the secretary of state to do any more than is his duty in regard to the national bus company <e>", "<cs> my lords let us be quite clear about this <e> <s> i understood from the noble earls first statement that no action would be taken until the courts had given their decision that is to say that the bill would not become law until after the courts had given their decision <e> <s> is that the case <e> <s> if so does that mean that it will not become law until not only has the court of first instance given a decision but any appeals have been disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the court of session were to decide that ownership rested with the present depositors we should then be left with a bill floating about in mid-air and with a clear court ruling that certain people owned the shares <e> <s> surely that would be wholly unsatisfactory and from a parliamentary point of view something that at all costs should be avoided <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong this matter but i understand it has been suggested that mr murray withdrew his opinion on the grounds that the position had been altered by the act <e> <s> do we understand that that is not so that he maintained his opinion in spite of the act but the preponderance of the opinion of other lawyers was against him <e> <s> secondly i should like to ask is it alleged that the act definitely altered the ownership of the savings bank <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord banks <e> <s> i hope to do so extremely briefly <e> <s> i do not intend to repeat what he has said so well nor indeed to repeat what i have said so well on previous occasions <e> <s> i find that the commons reason is wholly unconvincing <e> <s> to begin with as my noble friend lord banks has said trusts for this kind of purpose are quite common and work very well <e> <s> secondly i do not see that the setting up of such a trust would interfere with the wide distribution of direct shareholding as suggested by the commons <e> <s> i believe that the depositors should have some special recognition in this bill <e> <s> above all i am interested in the employees and however good the terms offered to them this would give them a definite and long-term stake in the bank <e> <s> therefore i think that the commons objections are unconvincing and that we should insist upon our amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to ask a question that is germane chiefly to the new clause <e> <s> i am not sure whether this is a suitable moment for raising it <e> <s> certain local authorities in scotland have powers for instance under the private bill legislation in scotland to provide or assist transport by both road and sea <e> <s> i take it that their powers to provide or assist ferries and the bus services which run in connection with those ferries will not be affected <e> <s> if one is running a ferry clearly it is of great assistance if one can be sure there is a bus service to meet it <e> <s> secondly i presume that the money which the noble lord mentioned if the services are approved might be available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his helpful reply <e> <s> as i said i put this down as a probing amendment <e> <s> i realise that the mystery which may be created by clause is put right by clause <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord the minister has said i am very happy to withdraw my new clause <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord teviot for his brief intervention in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to take it from the reply of the noble minister that the government have no intention whatever of encouraging these industries to put up charges more than commercial needs demand <e> <s> is he aware that there have been widespread suggestions that they intend to use these industries as a method of taxation and in spite of the high charges and their large profits to enforce increases in prices which will bear exceedingly heavily on the poorer people of this country who cannot afford them <e> <s> i take it from his answer today that that is out of the question <e> <s> i also take it that the government will not use any increase in the charges for public services as a method of allowing a decrease in other forms of taxation in the forthcoming budget <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind the minister that the subject of water was explicitly mentioned in my question so that presumably he was briefed about water <e> <s> now that he has in fact withdrawn his statement about the activities of the government on water may i ask him to look into the activities of the government in relation to other services as well <e> <s> may i also ask him to reiterate the statement that he made in answer to my first question that the government will not press these services to raise their charges above what the services think necessary from their commercial point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government to consider two simple steps which would help in reducing unemployment <e> <s> the first is to reduce the cost of employing people <e> <s> the second is to redress the balance of the advantage of installing capital plant and so forth as against employment <e> <s> at the moment there is a huge advantage in the subsidies for capital expenditure whereas the cost of taking on new workers is very great <e>", "<cs> my lords as there are many people in this country for whom a telephone is essential and who are badly off will the government look again at the remedies available to them <e> <s> they are faced with a private monopoly making enormous profits which is not responsible to parliament which is not responsible to any market and which totally ignores the views of the consumer associations <e> <s> surely something should be done to remedy that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the noble lord is particularly concerned about unemployment in the inner cities <e> <s> will he say whether or not the measures so far taken have come up to his expectations as far as the inner cities are concerned <e> <s> will he further say whether the speeches reported in todays papers indicating that the government are apparently very willing to invest mean that there will be bigger investment in the infrastructure roads buildings drains and so forth of the inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether these losses were expected by the government <e> <s> can he reassure us that they are not having a very deleterious effect on the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself very much in agreement with the main theme of the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> like him i believe that all monopolies become conspiracies against the public and like him i think that they are not always very effective and that the best protection against them is a minister who can be harried in parliament <e> <s> like him i do not have wholehearted belief in consumer councils <e> <s> but i think he failed to notice one point made by the noble baroness and that was her suggestion that not only should these councils be representative of the consumers but they should include people elected and chosen by the consumers <e> <s> up to now that has not been the case <e> <s> they have very often been tame dogs though i think that they are becoming less tame and they may be better than nothing <e> <s> however competition is the main support of the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to ask one further question <e> <s> i fully appreciate that the government cannot make good all the damage that was done by the summers weather but would he bear in mind the enormous cost of importing freight into the part of the world where i live in orkney and shetland <e> <s> if we have to import large quantities of feed the price really becomes astronomical <e> <s> would he look at whether it would be possible to give any help over freight charges on the import of hay and suchlike feeds if it is essential in orkney <e> <s> i am not quite certain yet how far we are affected but no doubt he will have figures in his survey and if he could bear that in mind i would be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble baroness notice a report in the papers that an institution described as the guildford college of law cancelled an invitation to the learned solicitor-general to come and address them apparently on the grounds that the demonstrations which would result would damage its reputation <e> <s> if this report is true which i can hardly believe would the noble baroness consider whether this is a suitable institution to teach law <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness the minister confirm or deny the allegations which have been made about the conduct of this nobel prize winner particularly with regard to dr sakharov <e> <s> if they are true surely criticism of the nobel prize committee is in order and should be made <e> <s> perhaps this does not happen on all occasions but on this occasion it would appear that the committee have awarded the prize if it is true to somebody who cannot possibly be worthy of it and i think the government should not be ashamed to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble lord to reply that the government are now spending rather more money on these salaries than was the glc <e> <s> does this not mean that the glc was not quite so extravagant as the government at times have made it out to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no interest to declare <e> <s> i have only a few elementary questions to ask most of which have already been asked in one form or another <e> <s> nevertheless they are the kind of questions that are in the minds of many people and i make little excuse for asking them again <e>", "<cs> my lords is the scottish office represented in any of the groups <e>", "<cs> perhaps it ought to be my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the government not agree that in putting into practice this admirable policy of making bypasses it is necessary to pay some attention to economy in the use of land <e> <s> bypasses often pass through valuable land <e> <s> does the government not agree that the verges very often seem to be unnecessarily wide <e> <s> is this due to a national regulation or is it the fault of the local planning authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that there were very clear statements from the government that various settlements should remain below the rate of inflation <e> <s> may i ask the minister directly whether the government intend to apply that policy to those people for whom they are themselves responsible <e> <s> if the government are expecting the lower paid to show restraint surely it is for the well paid to show an example <e>", "<cs> my lords since wage and salary restraint is said by the government to be absolutely central to their economic policy will they consider giving rather more positive advice to these people in <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government are discussing the matter with the local authorities will they bear very much in mind a point that has already been raised by the noble lord lord dean that is the urgent need for more housing <e> <s> as some of the funds arose from the sale of housing will they do all they can to see that the maximum amount is put back into new housing <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the attitude of the americans themselves show that this is not a very easy question and would it not greatly help in the laudable aim of containing terrorism if the americans would cease to harbour ira terrorists and would take steps to prevent the raising of large sums of money in america for the support of the ira <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble earl i am very conscious of the timeliness of this motion which has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> his motion asks for a coherent policy on both monopolies and mergers and it goes on to ask for safeguards for three classes of people consumers shareholders and workers <e> <s> to my mind the best protection for the consumer is competition and there is no real substitute for that <e> <s> if monopoly is inevitable then in my view the least bad method of dealing with it is to make the monopoly directly responsible to a minister of the crown and through him to parliament <e> <s> that is my view on monopolies <e>", "<cs> i should like on behalf of my noble friend lord thurso and these benches to thank the minister very much for this new clause which my noble friend lord thurso suggested in his second <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister as i understand he is giving way <e> <s> i should like to confirm what he kindly said in answer to my question arising from the further question of the noble lord <e> <s> lord burton <e> <s> it is quite clear that this new clause will apply to the whole coast of scotland to sea trout salmon and every other form of fishing in the islands and whether or not there is a board <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly simply to support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> whether it is preferable to have further amendments i do not know <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord lord ross said <e> <s> it is the principle in which he is interested and it may be more convenient in england to deal with it through the game acts <e> <s> but if we are to stop organised poaching and it is organised poaching that we are worried about it is surely sensible to prevent the poachers driving over the border to carlisle york or wherever else to sell their ill-gotten gains <e> <s> if it is good for scotland it must be good for england <e>", "<cs> before we part from this clause i should like briefly to raise a doubt about it <e> <s> it seems to me to be a simpler clause than many we have had to deal with in recent bills and i hope i have understood it rightly <e> <s> if i have what it says is that someone may be charged under these acts or a general rule of law and may be acquitted under the act on which he is tried nevertheless in spite of being acquitted he may then be found guilty under one of the other acts specified in the clause <e> <s> there are of course many examples in law of somebody being charged with an offence who may be found guilty of a lesser offence on the same evidence <e> <s> in scottish law if a person is charged with stealing he may on the same evidence be convicted of reset which for the benefit of those who know even less scottish law than i do which is saying something <e> <s> is receiving stolen goods is it not <e> <s> the lord advocate nods his head so i take it that that is good enough <e> <s> even if there are numerous precedents as i have no doubt there are i feel that that is something which the committee should examine with extreme care <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord but surely the example that he quotes is one on which the charged person virtually pleads guilty to another offence <e> <s> had the clause said that or anything equivalent to it i should certainly not have raised the question but it simply says that if the court is satisfied whatever the accused says that he is guilty of another offence it is entitled to convict him <e> <s> that seems to me to be a very different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the government think that it would be a somewhat unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to all noble lords particularly those who have given way <e> <s> i hope not to delay the house for very long <e> <s> indeed i should have thought that all the criticism that can be made of this amendment has been made in the telling speeches of the noble lord <e> <s> lord sandford and the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> i wanted to add a word or two becaue i am somewhat perplexed by the form of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble viscount for introducing this motion on a matter which i think is too little discussed <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on his excellent speech with practically all of which i agree so i need not go over those points again <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble marquess does so i may say a word in support of his amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i too listened with great attention to what was said by the noble lord lord gray but my mind which is not as sharp as that of the noble marquess remains confused <e>", "<cs> my lords before we depart from this amendment which has been so eloquently moved may i just ask one or two questions of the government <e> <s> i have no idea whether the government have been totally persuaded by the speech of the noble marquess to accept it but at committee stage and on clause i raised some questions relating to the legal provisions of this bill <e> <s> i should be most grateful if the government whatever they do to this amendment could answer one or two rather elementary questions which are in my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is the fact that the noble lord the minister is replying to this question a sign that he is primarily responsible for diversity of employment in rural areas which is exceedingly necessary <e> <s> if so can he tell us what is the role of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food and whether both in england and scotland the government intend any redistribution of responsibility in this area <e> <s> because it is certainly very necessary indeed that with the fall in the number employed in agriculture other employment should be encouraged <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may raise again a question that i am sure has been raised before <e> <s> it is a very simple one <e> <s> it seems to me that if clause applied to the government it would forbid the publication of any large fall in the unemployment figures <e> <s> although that would not be designed to affect it certainly could reasonably be regarded as likely to affect public support for a political party <e> <s> applying that to local government in certain parts of the country one sees large notices saying that this road widening or this bridge was undertaken by the local authority often in collusion with the ec or some other body <e> <s> although that is not perhaps designed to affect support for the majority party on the local authority it is certainly likely to do so and in fact is intended to do so <e> <s> it is intended to make out that the local authority is a good one and therefore that the people who control it are good <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers last reply that her majestys government encourage the widest possible ownership by workers what priority will he give to the bid that has been put in by the workers and management which the government must surely think will be a highly desirable outcome for this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is a matter of considerable public importance can the government tell the house when they expect the investigations to be completed <e> <s> if the investigations are not completed reasonably soon after all they have been going on for a month when will the government take the powers which they possess under that section to find out for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords you may think from my exalted position on the batting list that i am speaking officially on behalf of the alliance <e> <s> that would be a mistake <e> <s> i do not know whether the alliance has a policy on charities <e> <s> i hope that it has not <e> <s> i have spent a great deal of my life trying to dissuade the liberal party from having policies on everything under the sun <e> <s> all i am attempting to do this afternoon is to make one or two points which are purely my own idea <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are indeed grateful to the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> we welcome the initiative that has been taken <e> <s> we hope that it succeeds and that the teachers accept it but we are bound to remark that it is indeed a pity that it was not made many months ago when it was first suggested <e> <s> if the government were willing to have an inquiry they could have saved everyone a great deal of trouble over the past few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for spelling out once again the governments policy <e> <s> but may i ask him whether he thinks that the methods and indeed the possible results of the most recent takeover struggles have meant that reference to competition solely is not enough and that there are wider considerations to be taken into account <e> <s> will he look at the matter again <e> <s> in particular does he not think that the views of workers in the industry who make the value of the assets that are taken over should be given a chance of expression <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with considerable diffidence to express a doubt about this amendment <e> <s> my diffidence arises from the fact that not only do i much respect the movers of the amendment but several of them are my political allies and i notice they are supported by my right reverend friend if i may so call him the bishop of rochester <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is aware that at least there should be congratulations for the chancellor of the exchequer on one point and that is on his strictures to the oil companies on their failure to reduce their prices in line with the reduction in the price of crude <e> <s> will the noble lord assure us that it is the governments view that lower oil prices actually give the economy great hope can be a considerable boost to the economy and are not something to be deplored <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain what was the answer to the question of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> although outside pressure may not be very effective will the minister say whether she thinks that it would be a good idea to raise this matter through some agency of the united nations <e> <s> after all the ethiopians are in receipt of immense aid from all over the world and it seems to me possible that some conditions could be attached to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that his answer shows an extraordinary dog in the manger attitude by both british telecom and the post office <e> <s> is it the governments view that all element of public service has now been removed from british telecom and the post office even though they have been privatised <e> <s> if so this appears to me a very strong argument for renationalising <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what effect that answer will have on the noble earl lord selkirk who made such a powerful speech in moving this amendment <e> <s> no doubt his clearer mind than mine will have understood what the minister is saying <e> <s> i have been left in considerable doubt <e> <s> at one point i thought that the minister more or less categorically said that there is no reason in the future why more charitable housing associations should not be formed <e> <s> but then in answer to the noble baroness who speaks from the other side of the house he said that he would look at this matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government not agree that at present there are people who are fitted and who have the qualifications to go to university but who cannot get places <e> <s> will they undertake that there will be no further reductions in the number of places and no further attack upon the robbins principle and that people who are fitted and qualified to get university places will have a chance to get them <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that i should now move my first amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is saying that i should speak to it <e>", "<cs> i am slightly intimidated by what the noble lord lord sandford has said in case i have not moved my amendment <e> <s> if i have moved it i should now like to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am not wholly satisfied with the noble lords reply <e> <s> i am not sure that the government have taken on board the position of fishermen who may be considerably affected by the orders made <e> <s> i am not sure that i am convinced that owners would have an absolute veto without apparently giving any reason <e> <s> but these are matters to which we might return <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what is happening at swan hunter can the government tell us whether they are bringing forward the date for the next naval orders and if so when will they be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister give us an assurance that two matters will be within the terms of reference <e> <s> the first is the growing habit of selling off parts of the business to be taken over not for any commercial or economic reasons but apparently to attempt to comply with the existing law and avoid a reference and secondly there is the effect particularly the long-term effect upon the communities affected by these takeovers which are very often not for commercial reasons but for purely financial reasons <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments moved by my noble friend <e> <s> the arguments in support of employee ownership are widely known and have often been rehearsed in the chamber <e> <s> i do not think that it is necessary to add much to the speech of my noble friend or to go over the arguments again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i greatly welcome his undertaking that the rent acts will be amended and also that empty accommodation will be made available to occupiers <e> <s> is the minister aware also that excellent though owner-occupation is in many ways it will never solve the problems of the homeless and that in addition to the admirable projects he has mentioned there must be more resources made available to provide accommodation for renting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect is the minister aware that i am totally disappointed by that reply <e> <s> is she aware that the trouble has arisen because the university grants committee changed its formula and that the threatened cut of one-third in the financing of birkbeck college is ultimately owing to the governments own cuts in further education <e> <s> will she give a guarantee to the house that birkbeck will not be crippled or indeed forced to close <e> <s> is she further aware that at present it is the only college that is devoted entirely to further education for part-time students who pay their own fees <e> <s> does she not think that this is something which the government will want to encourage <e> <s> will she therefore assure the house that whatever the university of london or the university grants committee are forced to do because of lack of finance the governmment will give a clear undertaking that this unique college will continue and that its future will be assured <e>", "<cs> my lords while we may hope that the ugc will think again about its new formula will the government make it crystal clear that they understand the difference between the so-called part-time students who indeed are whole time at birkbeck college and who do a four-year course for which they themselves pay and the negligible number of part-time students who are enrolled at other universities <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen that despite these encouraging diminutions of pollution there are allegations that the damage is still very high and possibly increasing both in the highlands of scotland and in sweden <e> <s> can this be reconciled <e> <s> what is the governments view about the damage done by acid rain and such like <e> <s> if they are not in a position to give a detailed answer now would they consider publishing an official statement about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there is some sympathy for this question <e> <s> if the meeting is to take place might it take place in public so that we can hear what importance the director general of oftel and the chairman of british telecom attach to reducing their charges <e> <s> this is one of the things which would benefit the public good a great deal but so far it does not seem that british telecom are keen to reduce their charges <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as well as the findings of the medical officer of health for caithness the local caithness doctors have just produced a report saying that in their view the health of caithness is very good as no doubt the noble earl lord caithness will confirm and that they can trace no direct relationship between these diseases and dounreay <e> <s> but of course leukaemia is a very frightening matter and there is some anxiety so will the minister undertake that the further inquiries are speeded up as far as possible <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that whatever may be thought in the neighbouring <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if british telecom concentrated on giving us an efficient and cheap ordinary telephone service instead of going in for all these frills and pornographic ongoings <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak only briefly in support of the amendment and of the speeches made by my noble friends <e> <s> there are two points which i think should be made <e> <s> first this is a bill which sets up as has been said many times a private monopoly <e> <s> many of us who are by no means opposed to privatisation believe that some competition is the best guarantee for the public and that that is absent in the bill <e> <s> secondly we have some experience of british telecom and as the government will have noticed from the criticisms made on all sides of the house our experience of that private monopoly has not so far been entirely reassuring <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord i am much interested in what he said about the breadth of consultation <e> <s> some of us were a little puzzled and possibly perturbed about what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an attempt to specify the qualities of the winner after the race has been won <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to support this amendment because it gives us an opportunity which indeed we have had before for discussing further this important post and its functions <e> <s> i was unable to be present at some of the earlier debates on the bill because i was in hospital which may excuse me for repeating arguments that have probably been heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i detected a note of regret <e>", "<cs> my lords as no other noble lord is going to address the house i think that it would be highly discourteous of me to remain silent after the very kind invitation expressed by the noble lord lord stoddart on the last amendment that i should support him on this matter <e> <s> i am very glad to support him <e> <s> he has eloquently moved his amendment and he has outlined the main arguments <e> <s> i do not intend to go over them again <e> <s> however i should like once again to point out to the house that in my view we are asking for a director who has not only to have diverse qualities but actually contradictory qualities <e> <s> he has to be experienced in big business in accountancy and finance <e> <s> that means that he looks at the world from that point of view <e> <s> he is accustomed to a secretary he is accustomed to a car he is accustomed to a high salary and a share in the profits <e> <s> and he is no doubt interested in the prestige of his post <e> <s> we have heard already that he may consider merely a pittance <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government make it quite clear to the industry that it is intolerable that prices should go up at all when its raw materials have fallen so greatly in price <e> <s> will the government bear in mind this experience with this monopoly when they look at consumer protection over gas and telecommunications and so forth <e> <s> it is quite clear that these monopolies are out to exploit the consumer to the maximum that they think they can get away with <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to delay the house on this matter nor to repeat arguments which as the minister said were deployed on earlier amendments <e> <s> however it seemed to me that my noble friend was raising a rather different point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i draw his attention to the old subject of the flaring of gas <e> <s> he will know full well that it is still going on and on an immense scale in orkney and shetland <e> <s> i do not know whether that comes under this provision for the promotion of energy conservation but if it does not it ought to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness take the opportunity of raising with the soviet authorities the conditions in which political and religious prisoners are kept in russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may not these celebrations appear rather provocative particularly to irishmen and possibly even to catholics <e> <s> will the government not agree that the so-called revolution of was in fact a <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> speaking as a layman i am an out-of-date and defunct lawyer i am sure that he has some reason to offer as to why these very serious matters at wapping which he has mentioned cannot be dealt with under clauses and <e> <s> if the noble lord can explain why that is i shall be most grateful <e>", "<cs> i speak with some diffidence as a non-lawyer but i am a politician <e> <s> as has been said the clause has great relevance to the conduct of politics in this country <e> <s> before i come to that may i thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for supporting my view that the clause has little or nothing to do with the disturbances at wapping <e> <s> i do not believe that it can be right to repeat ineffectually in a bill what is already in the bill with far more potential effect <e>", "<cs> in my view it is dealt with in clauses and and very adequately dealt with if in fact it is not already dealt with under the common law and other statutes which i strongly suspect it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount very much for making this statement and also the council for their admirable report <e> <s> it seems to me that the report and the statement raise issues which would be better dealt with in debate than by question and answer <e> <s> i hope therefore that the government will forgive me if i do not go at great length into the details of these matters which they have mentioned <e>", "<cs> will the minister be good enough to confirm one point which arose from his explanation <e> <s> as i understood him dealing with the position of the noble lord lord williams of elvel as investment adviser to christ church he said that the test should be whether he receives any remuneration <e> <s> that is as i understand it <e> <s> will he confirm that because i have been asked by treasurers and others in universities what their position will be under the bill <e> <s> on university courts and councils people give a good deal of investment advice free of charge as treasurers <e> <s> it may be that they are members of firms which indirectly may do business on behalf of the university but nevertheless i should like to confirm as i <e>", "<cs> these individuals are giving advice as a public service <e> <s> they are not gaining anything from it <e> <s> they are merely giving their services free of charge because they are knowledgeable people <e> <s> i wanted to make it clear that those people would not fall within the bill and would not have to be registered <e>", "<cs> i rise full well knowing that i am somewhat ignorant of the subject but like many people who are more learned in the law than i am i now find the state of this bill considerably confusing <e> <s> if these amendments are dealt with in the manner suggested by the government how does this leave the prospectuses and takeover bids <e> <s> this seems to be a highly relevant matter bearing in mind what has happened with distillers and guinness <e> <s> it may not be relevant to this particular part of the bill but i had rather hoped that they would fall within the compass of the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that they constitute advice and encouragement to people to invest <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i should like to support all that has been said in favour of the amendment <e> <s> to my mind it is the most important amendment that we have discussed today <e> <s> until now we have largely been discussing sophisticated matters for the protection of people who should be able to look after themselves because they have highly paid advisers and access to the best information <e> <s> we now come to the nub of the bill which is the small or new investor <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that added importance is given to this matter by the fact that in this age of high technology it has taken as long to install lifts at one station on the underground as it did in the days of the horse and cart to build the whole central line <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i very strongly support this proposed amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams has pointed out there are obvious difficulties about it <e> <s> i imagine that as drafted it would defeat the whole purpose of the big bang <e> <s> i am not sure that would be a bad thing but it would certainly arouse strong feelings in the city <e> <s> as i undertand it it would affect the operations of many people concerned in the city even under the present regime <e> <s> therefore as the noble lord says it may be a matter which has to be thought over very carefully and brought in after further discussion <e>", "<cs> the amendment says at least one-third <e> <s> it is not precise <e>", "<cs> i may return to ponder a little on exactly what is the sib <e> <s> we have been assured by the government that it is not as the noble and learned lord lord silkin suggested a quango <e> <s> it has been described by the government as a private sector body <e> <s> the government say also that it derives authority from statute which is undoubtedly true but that it does not derive authority from the government <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much for that reply but it seems to show that the sib is by no means a normal private sector body <e> <s> that is the point that i had in mind <e>", "<cs> before the mover decides what to do about this may i ask one question of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with what has been said by the noble lord who has just addressed the committee <e> <s> like him i am not in a position to say whether this is the correct way of dealing with what is undoubtedly a problem nor whether the wording of this amendment is the correct wording <e> <s> but i am sure that there is a problem and a problem which was outlined clearly in relation to the guinness-distillers affair by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> do not intend to go over those details again <e> <s> it is a problem which goes far beyond the city of london and i do not believe that decisions in these matters can be left exclusively to those who are engaged in finance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that many people will welcome this question and will welcome the governments favourable response to it <e> <s> may i take it that the government are familiar with the excellent work done by mr <e> <s> bowman and inter action and that they will give that due weight when they come to make a decision on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble lord on his appointment <e> <s> may i ask him whether if we are to have a new body dealing with the countryside he will consider letting us know how

having any effect on the naval shipbuilding programme <e>", "<cs> my lords as a reasonably old inhabitant of this building in one way or another may <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i was also present at a previous stage of the bill when the point was raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it seems to me that the new wording is a considerable improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to support the amendment for essentially the same reasons as i have advanced in previous debates on the bill that is from the point of view of the public and public confidence in the running of these affairs and in the operation of the bill generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask a question on amendment no <e> <s> which leaves out subection of the clause under discussion <e> <s> how will the matter stand if this subsection is left out <e> <s> i approve of it being left out because i think it is totally unenforceable <e> <s>

by direct broadcasting from abroad <e> <s> i am not quite clear whether the government feel that anything in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can enlighten me on this point <e> <s> i find that he has the best of the argument as to whether or not this is a collective investment but i am wondering what practical difference it would make if they were in the bill as it seems to me they should be <e> <s> as has already been said there are other companies acts <e> <s> would any great purpose be served by bringing investment trusts into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this would be a good thing would it not <e>", "<cs> i am one of those who ventures not to agree <e> <s> it seemed to me listening to the case made for this amendment that it was indeed unanswerable <e> <s> it does not seem now that the minister has answered the main point which is that the phrase all the circumstances is not the same thing as taken as a whole <e> <s> i do not think he answered that point <e> <s> i understand that he was inclined to accept this amendment and his only reason for not accepting it was that it would mean amending other parts of the bill <e> <s> why not do that <e> <s> if it is important or sensible to have this amendment what is to prevent the government from amending the other parts of the bill which i think may well be improved by similar amendment <e> <s> without it as has been said it seems to me that the courts will believe that this provision has been deliberately omitted and it will make it extremely difficult for them to interpret the bill in the way that both the government and the mover of the amendment want it interpreted <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should declare an interest in that i am chancellor of a university <e> <s> unfortunately the pay of chancellors is what today is called zero rated <e> <s> however will the government agree that the standard of teaching in the universities is extremely high and that they are getting excellent staff extremely cheaply particularly when compared with salaries paid in the city and in advertising <e> <s> will they bear in mind that the reason they are unable to get these staff is due to the high standing of our universities <e> <s> they must ensure that the universities are supported to the full or there may be a general falling off in the standards of further education <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the governors remarks yesterday that the government have abandoned monetary targets <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount think that there is any chance that we might have a six-month holiday from legislation <e> <s> this would be immensely popular in the country and would give the government an opportunity to put their house in order <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the opinion of the government that alleged pollution by acid in galloway is due to emissions from power stations <e> <s> if so which power stations and if not to what do they attribute it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am drawn to my feet if that is the right expression by the extremely appealing speech of the noble baroness to whom we have just listened <e> <s> she spoke of the customers <e> <s> i must say once again because it has often been said before that many of the customers in scotland want rented accommodation <e> <s> there is an enormous demand for rented accommodation <e> <s> if we want a mobile labour force we have to ensure that there is rented accommodation or else people cannot move <e> <s> the noble baroness i know appreciates this and indeed she mentioned it but she said that the situation should be met in other ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> i congratulate the government on their efforts to obtain some multilateral agreement and regret that that has not been possible <e> <s> i should like to ask further questions about the new fisheries zone <e> <s> has it been drawn up largely for reasons of international law or are the actual fishing conditions in the south atlantic taken into account <e> <s> it seems to me to be very much the same kind of zone as we have heard a good deal about in the north sea <e> <s> i should like to be assured that such matters as the migration of fish in the south atlantic and the type of fishing whether it is industrial fishing or whether we hope to establish some kind of in-shore shipping there have also been taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that those of us who passionately believe in free speech must make some protest on behalf of the universities against the sort of speech that we have just heard <e> <s> it is totally untrue that either this country or the universities are in the state of germany in the s <e> <s> it is a monstrous and useless exaggeration to pretend that they are <e> <s> in point of fact the universities of this country today are in a highly creditable state <e> <s> they are extremely well run by their governing bodies they do a marvellous teaching job and so far as they are able within the customs of this country they protect free speech <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there is wide agreement about what has been said by the noble lord lord williams of elvel when he commented on the anxiety about insider dealing <e> <s> will the government undertake that no city firm of which a member is convicted of insider dealing will receive any contract from the government or any public authority under its control <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question before we part with the order

of navigation <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate that the government cannot mention all that has been done in this field perhaps i may ask whether the minister will confirm that they are well aware of and are investigating closely the work done by the highlands and islands development board which was not mentioned in his answer and which has wide experience and considerable success in this field and from which many lessons could be learnt in creating rural employment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us how much electricity is now being generated by wind in orkney and

like other speakers by congratulating the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe on his motion and the admirable speech with which he introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there will be very wide support for the question put by my noble kinswoman lady elliot of harwood and indeed for the comments of the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> does not the noble lord the minister

this matter first because i think that it is good that he has given a chance for your lordships house to discuss these reports and secondly because i am an ex-chairman of a minority rights group and i am grateful to him for the publicity he has given to them <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that this debate as i understand it is not about northern ireland but about the possible relevance of certain reports about other minorities in europe to the situation in ireland <e> <s> if it were about northern ireland i would hardly dare to intervene because i do not claim to be any expert on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while we understand his reluctance to go too far in this matter before the bill appears can the minister assure the house that the government are aware of the peculiar importance of scotland in this area <e> <s> will he give some assurance that if a scottish bank is threatened with takeover not only will its importance in the british banking system be adequately safeguarded but also its importance for scotland <e> <s> at present under takeover laws this does not appear to be a factor which is taken into account <e>", "<cs> i am encouraged to intervene by the noble lord who wishes to hear other voices <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the debate about whether we should to some extent depart from the principle that no one is bound to incriminate himself <e> <s> i had understood at earlier debates that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate accepted that he would have to look again at various proposals which were designed to obviate this risk <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government agree that the present state of the law regarding sunday trading is first putting a totally unfair burden on the police and secondly bringing the law into total disrepute because it is wholly illogical and it is quite differently administered in different parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i dissent from two common attitudes to the universities <e> <s> the first is that they are really technical colleges and that their job is to turn out whatever skilled workers industry requires <e> <s> i hold the old-fashioned view that they have a much wider job than that <e> <s> i also hold the view that the main troubles of this world are not lack of engineers or lack of production but what we are going to do about nuclear power and bio-technology how we are going to spread wealth throughout the world and preserve peace <e> <s> these are subjects which are pre-eminently within the field of universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for introducing this motion <e> <s> i assure him that i do not speak from any political point of view <e> <s> on the contrary i have ventured to enter the arena with so many distinguished lawyers doctors and professional people of all kinds first because i have been following to some extent what has been going on in america and secondly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am grateful for that answer but i quite appreciate that the government have no responsibility and i am glad to hear that there have been no representations <e> <s> however do the government agree that the bbc for the government are not responsible has a public responsibility and its intention to make a film of the events concerning ward which are now years old was extremely irresponsible <e> <s> if the bbc had evidence it should have produced it to the appropriate authorities and if it does not have sufficient evidence as it now alleges surely it would be quite improper even to suggest making a film which could only cause pain and could serve no conceivable public purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the government on as i understand it giving an assurance that part-time students and particularly those at birkbeck will not be penalised <e> <s>

cannot say that i am an expert on ducks but i live on a farm where i am glad to say there is always a duck or two about <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment as it carries my name <e> <s> as the noble lord who moved it said it is an extremely simple amendment and i do not think it needs much argument <e> <s> i should have thought that it makes eminent sense not only because of revaluation but also because the bringing into operation of the bill in the time proposed will lead to chaos <e> <s> the government themselves do not know how it will work and there will be widespread evasion <e> <s> in the end it will not result in people paying for the things they use <e> <s> it will be a random poll tax <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment briefly <e> <s> it would seem to me that the only excuse for introducing this bill in scotland before a similar bill for england is that the government are treating scotland as a test-bed <e> <s> if they are not doing that there seems to be no point in having a different date for the change in england and scotland <e>", "<cs> may i press the minister a little on this point <e> <s> it is of great importance to some people <e> <s> does he not agree that he has it wrong and that it will indeed be necessary to keep a valuation roll <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i was present when he explained that the noble lord the computer which seems to have been responsible for the drafting of the bill had got out of hand <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> before we part with this clause i hope the noble lord the minister will be able to answer the questions put by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i had understood that there would be some abatement so to speak of the charges levied upon people such as crofters ministers and so on who on the face of the bill as the noble lord lord ross has said come into rating for the first time <e> <s> if there is to be no abatement for them the situation will be extremely serious and what they will pay will bear no relation to the use they make of services because some of them live in areas where the services are still very poor <e> <s> it will mean that if there is a family with two or three grown-up children there will be a very large payment indeed to be made by people whom no one could possibly claim are rich or are getting away with government subsidies and so on in a way to which they are not entitled <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord goes further i should like to raise a point <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for what he said and i should make it clear that i do not want to pre-empt the debate which will take place <e> <s> i am surprised that this point has been raised at all <e>", "<cs> i am sorry for rising to my feet at this late stage <e> <s> i was hoping that the minister would deal with what i call the second point made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> the minister has given the governments reasons for thinking that the amendment is inappropriate or unnecessary for keeping down rate levels <e> <s> he said that the government have machinery which could deter local authorities which strike too high a rate <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support my noble and learned friend on this amendment <e> <s> he has put all the arguments in favour of it extremely clearly and i do not need to go over them again <e> <s> but if we write into the bill with the consent of the treasury it seems that we ought also to write into the bill by affirmative resolution of parliament <e> <s> i do not want to open up again what appears to be a source of division in the conservative party between the noble lords lord renton and lord boyd-carpenter but i confess that on that argument i found myself on the side of the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee but i must put it on record that both the fish over which i have cast my fly have risen very satisfactorily to it <e>", "<cs> surely the simple point is that if there is one order it will be subject to the affirmative resolution <e> <s> there will be either one order or orders <e> <s> we are now told that there will be one <e> <s> there is therefore no question of debates <e> <s> there will be one debate on the resolution referring to one order <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and the new clause from a position slightly different from that of most previous speakers <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth speaks with direct knowledge of scottish banking <e> <s> as i read it the amendment would not only apply to potential takeovers by foreign banks <e> <s> it would not be necessary <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will be grateful to the minister for having explained this part of the bill <e> <s> but i must confess that even after the explanation i find there are many outstanding questions <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord lord kirkhill intends to do but i should have thought that points have been raised which require further consideration by the government <e>", "<cs> from this side of the committee we also agree with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i hope that the government will take some notice of his remarks <e> <s> the drafting of bills has reached a standard which is practically unbelievable and quite unintelligible to anyone other than a whole time lawyer with a full legal library <e> <s> at the same time i should like to put up a gentle defence of the noble earl lord dundee <e> <s> i was brought up in the time of no less a person than the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with whom i was once in chambers to say that everyone in this country has the right to the defence of fog <e> <s> it seems to me that he has been exercising that ancient british right of spreading fog on a standard which would win admiration throughout the temple and no doubt lincolns inn <e>", "<cs> could the minister make some response to another point made by the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> she said that allowances of all sorts and pay as i understood it in scotland would take into account the effect of these charges <e> <s> would the minister agree with that <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to have an argument across her body so to speak but assuming that the noble baroness said something like that have the government any comment <e> <s> do they expect wages and allowances in scotland to take into account these charges <e> <s> while they look into the matter raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter are they going to look at not only the services but other people whose salaries may be affected by this in scotland <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said by the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> it seems to me highly desirable that such officers should reply and that they may be encouraged not to do so <e> <s> does the minister expect that in the normal case the officer concerned will not only reply but will also give some reason for his decision <e> <s> if he is not to reply then the person who has objected will have no knowledge as i understand it of the reasons for the refusal <e> <s> surely the normal procedure would be for the officer to give a reason <e> <s> without such a reason it will be difficult for the person in question to pursue the appeal <e> <s> i therefore ask the minister to look again at the matter and see whether natural justice does not mean that it should be turned the other way round so that if the person objecting gets no answers it should be taken that the objection is accepted <e>", "<cs> in connection with this amendment which i support i wonder whether i can raise a point relating to the electoral register <e> <s> i do so with diffidence because i must confess that this area is not one in which i am a leading expert <e> <s> i find it very difficult to foretell the results of this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord makes up his mind what he is going to do perhaps i may thank the minister for the information that he has given <e> <s> when he is mulling over what he will do with this bill in the long easter break can i ask him to consider this <e> <s> up to now it might be considered an advantage to appear on two electoral rolls because one then has an alternative if one does not vote in one place one might vote in another <e> <s> it may be a very serious disadvantage to appear in two electoral rolls <e> <s> further one may not know that this has happened <e> <s> as it is no offence there is no means of knowing <e> <s> i do not ask the minister to go any further on this point now but i ask him to consider it <e> <s> he has changed the situation round <e> <s> people may be affected by being entered on rolls about which they know nothing <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what has been said on this amendment and to draw the attention of the minister to the fact that not only will this wretched chap aged have to notify the registrar that he wishes to pay the tax but he will have to read the bill to find out whether he is liable <e> <s> that will take him some time <e> <s> i reckon he will be before he finds out whether he is liable <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will not rely too much upon precedent <e> <s> in the discussions on this bill i think that we have already learnt that precedents can be extremely dangerous guidelines <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has raised a point which merits discussion <e> <s> like him i do not wish to trespass upon the powers of another place over taxation but this matter seems to me to go beyond the simple question of taxation <e> <s> the schedule speaks of excessive and unreasonable proposals by the local authorities which are subjective words <e> <s> so far as i can see it does not insist that they should be defined if they can be defined in entirely financial terms <e>", "<cs> i confirm what my noble friend says about the cost of living in the highlands <e> <s> certainly in respect of transport and especially food it is higher than in the south <e> <s> it could also be said that in parts of the highlands people do not enjoy many of the services which exist in the south <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might ask a question of the government before the minister replies <e> <s> i do not want to go over what has been said many times before about the act in general <e> <s> i want to raise a point which is specifically aimed at the amendment <e> <s> one of the advantages and i agree that there may be disadvantages also of postponing this measure until similar legislation applies in the rest of britain would be to ensure that industries and activities in scotland are not put at a disadvantage by the introduction of these measures before they apply in england and wales <e> <s> presumably the government have made some inquiries and estimates as to whether after this bill becomes an act if it does become an act not the individuals we have heard of but industries and employment in scotland will be better or worse off <e> <s> quite apart from its benefit to individuals if this becomes an act do the government consider it will benefit scottish employment industries services and the general industrial base of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will take the amendment which has just been moved very seriously <e> <s> apart from the question of the regulations which as the noble lord has pointed out will be extremely numerous and will all require consideration my experience which i admit is limited is that the local authorities are still trying to find out how the bill will work <e> <s> they are discovering that the bill is giving rise to new difficulties and unanswered questions <e> <s> for instance i received a letter only a day or two ago about the effect that the bill will <e>", "<cs> my lords before we pass from this i add to what has been said that it seems to me that the minister has admitted three very important things in his speech <e> <s> first he rightly says that this is a matter which is not really dealt with by the bill but the problem is that the bill does not deal with the main troubles of local authorities and that is a fundamental objection to it <e> <s> secondly he states that this will make the local authorities mere agencies but they are mere agencies in most respects already <e> <s> our complaint is that the government keep on treating them as agencies and putting new duties upon them <e> <s> they might face up to the logical conclusion of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to take up further time on this matter upon which the government have behaved rather well <e> <s> for my part i should like to thank them for the proposed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as some of us will have to explain the bill to students it may be as well if we really understand it <e> <s> there has been a lot of talk as though certain students would pay only per cent <e> <s> i think that that is not in the bill <e> <s> there is a prescribed amount in the bill which may be more than per cent <e> <s> the government may intend the figure to be per cent <e> <s> and that of course is very valuable but they cannot bind their successors <e> <s> am i right in saying that per cent <e> <s> is what the government hope the students will pay but it is not in the bill <e>", "<cs> that confirms what i thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister not only for struggling with this serpent but for saying that he will write to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and indeed that he will think about it again <e> <s> however i must say that i think we all understand what is meant and that there is all-party agreement about it including the noble lord lord gray <e> <s> the point is that the bill does not say it <e> <s> that is the difficulty we are in <e> <s> when the attention of the minister is drawn to this by such eminent grammarians as my noble friend viscount thurso and the noble lord lord ross of marnock i hope that he will consider the point <e> <s> i assure him that the officials of my local authority were puzzled as to why it is put in this particular way in this particular part of the bill and nowhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will explain why their amendment is considered superior to the two lines of the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> we must look at these bills from the point of view of ordinary people and not lawyers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise much the same point as the noble lady <e> <s> is it not the duty of the householder to give the electoral registration officer all the particulars which he needs before he comes to levy the charges <e> <s> am i wrong in thinking that in committee the government looked favourably upon dealing with the difficulties which they were going to impose on students and people like them who <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord ross of marnock makes up his mind i should like to point out that there is a clear distinction between the electoral register and this register <e> <s> people want to buy the electoral register in order to take part in elections <e> <s> anyone who has taken part in an election will know that one would be greatly hampered if one could not obtain copies of the register except by inspecting it <e> <s> as the minister said those who will want to buy this register will wish to do so for commercial reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to repeat what i said in committee about crofters which has also been said by many other noble lords <e> <s> however three points have arisen <e> <s> first we now learn from the figures of the highland area that the burden of the bill will be very much heavier than even the most mischievous of us expected <e> <s> it has been argued and has just been argued by the minister in answer to that that the crofters will receive a rebate <e> <s> that is a perfectly fair argument and i accept it but it has never been the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he has said for his sympathetic attitude and for his statement that further discussions can take place <e> <s> however as he well knows the difficulty that we are up against is the time limit in the bill <e> <s> unless something can be done there will be a serious situation for orkney farmers <e> <s> it is not a question of the orkney council itself being able to do much about the situation because as the minister knows under the bill it cannot discriminate it must fairly apportion the results <e> <s> therefore it has only limited play <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not apparent that this is quite contrary to common sense <e> <s> as has been said to levy tax on repairs which are much more important than alterations is nonsense <e> <s> if the ec is the stumbling block can the minister say what representations have been made <e> <s> the house should not accept that because this has always been the position it should continue <e> <s> the whole country must see that such a levy is nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> candidly i do not see a great deal of point in dividing the house at this stage on this type of matter <e> <s> however i should be grateful if he would give me a bit more assurance than he has done <e> <s> i understand that he does not dispute the figures <e> <s> he has not given any alternative figures to those produced by the local authority and indeed by the milk marketing board which has also produced figures showing that its rates will be greatly increased <e> <s> i am grateful to him for saying that he is confident that the matter can be resolved <e> <s> however i should be grateful if he could explain what he means by that <e> <s> once the bill becomes an act there can be no further amendment and no discretion as i understand it will then be left to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in the same difficulty as the minister <e> <s> i do not know what to say until these meetings have taken place <e> <s> of course by that time the bill will be an act <e> <s> i find the situation very unsatisfactory and i am severely alarmed <e> <s> however if there is a procedure in this house as in the other place which allows the amendment to be negatived i will save your lordships the trouble of traipsing through the lobbies <e> <s> i do not feel inclined to withdraw the amendment totally because i believe that it could lead to very serious personal hardships and certain hardships on local industry and farmers which would be serious for the whole community <e> <s> i therefore move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stewart speaks with great authority on education and it is indeed a subject of wide interest to your lordships <e> <s> i must therefore apologise for turning to an entirely different subject and that is scotland <e> <s> i do not believe that we could consider the governments programme for the forthcoming months or so without paying some attention to what happened at the general election in scotland <e> <s> at a time when the conservatives won a striking victory over most of britain they won exactly seats in scotland as against won by the opposition <e> <s> the labour party won seats the alliance nine and the snp three <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate the minister on his appointment <e> <s> may i ask him to be careful about placing too much faith in the introduction of computers <e> <s> my experience is that the introduction of computers usually at first at any rate makes confusion worse <e> <s> would the minister not be well advised to put in a few sensible human beings before he places all his faith in machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for rising to speak without having put my name on the list <e> <s> i know that at this time of night nothing is more depressing <e> <s> however my excuse is that i did not notice that my noble kinsman had tabled this important question <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government received an explicit and enforceable undertaking from news international that it will keep the paper going <e>", "<cs> my lords although it may be true that in the s there was a great deal of criticism of telecommunications nowadays vast monopoly profits are going into private hands owing to the operation of public services <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a new boy in the house but with all due respect to the leader of the house is it the case that it is the leader of the house who decides whether or not senior secretaries of state shall take part <e> <s> does he treat them like children <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to give us a slightly more definite answer to the noble question put by the noble lord lord renton about the application of parkinsons law <e> <s> can we be assured that the appointment of more parliamentary counsel will not simply lead to more legislation <e> <s> the basic trouble is not merely the parliamentary counsel but the endless spate of ill-thought out legislation with which this and the other place are inundated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords will have much enjoyed the speech of the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal with her great knowledge of birmingham and her high hopes of the minister which we all share although in the case of the noble baroness she has been somewhat disappointed <e> <s> i am sure she is right in saying that what is needed in the urban areas is an overall raising of standards not only of housing but of services education and health <e> <s> it was apparent long ago that children born in sunderland had a far poorer chance in

prevalent in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord who moved the amendment decides what to do i hope that the government will give an undertaking to look at the matter again at continuing stages <e> <s> it appears to be quite apparent that if a property is withdrawn from the open market which is the effect of the bill it will restrict the possible purchasers <e> <s> it will

restrictive i do not see why the clause is needed in the bill <e>", "<cs> before the committee passes on from this amendment i should like to emphasise that this is a matter of great importance for many people <e>", "<cs> my lords both the ministers answers are to a certain extent to be welcomed in that no restrictions were either asked for or as i understand it imposed on the dalai lama and discussions as i understand it took place with the right honourable and learned gentleman the foreign secretary <e> <s> apart from those discussions have the government made any representations about what has been done in tibet and if so with what result <e>", "<cs> it may indeed seem sad and shocking that this type of new clause should even be contemplated <e> <s> it means that parliament is now

about the scottish universities but on which there will be no one with a knowledge of the scottish law <e> <s> whatever the noble and learned lord may say about this commission it will presumably be much concerned with law <e> <s> having listened to the intervention of the noble lord lord morton of shuna and having read clause which states <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in the bill to say that there will be even one scot <e> <s> if that is intended it should be written into the bill <e> <s> it is indeed true that some of the powers of commissioners are laid down here <e> <s> but they appear to be rather differently interpreted than in the answer given to the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with what has been said from the opposition front bench <e> <s> however

exaggerated <e> <s> however it is surely odd that the noble earl at this stage should have to consider the matter <e> <s> is he not aware of the number of homeless people in london <e> <s> when they

association of a successor company to british steel although these are vital to any public discussion of the whole matter it seems that the government should think again particularly as they have been talking of privatising british steel for a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords while i sympathise with the sentiments of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is it not the case that no one can

welcome as it shows an apparent new interest in the arts <e> <s> will she agree that our first obligation is to the living arts and indeed to existing collections <e> <s> some institutions cannot show all their pictures and some such as the royal holloway college are actually in danger of losing their pictures <e> <s> if the purse strings are now much looser will she ensure that our existing collections and our living arts for example opera ballet and so on will receive their fair share <e>", "<cs> my lords why has the composition of these committees always been secret <e> <s> is it anything to do with the fact that they are believed to have been appointed partly because of their <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the minister but i think he said that no tenant would be forced to change his landlord against his will <e> <s> surely that is exactly what is happening in the shetlands <e> <s> there the tenants wish to go to one landlord and are being told that they cannot do so <e> <s> therefore that seems to me exactly what is <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise in particular to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for having missed his words <e> <s> as someone who has put down this amendment three times or has added his name to it i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for having virtually accepted the argument <e> <s> like the noble earl lord perth i accept the governments amendment <e> <s> i am glad that the historic and very important position of scottish universities is now recognised on the face of the statute and it has been on most statutes since the act of union <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood from the papers this morning that the minister responsible whoever he is has refused to meet the nurses representatives for further talks <e> <s> do i understand from what the noble lord has said that this is not the case and that the government are willing to have further talks with all suggestions open <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister remind the house of the relative costs <e> <s> what are the relative costs of producing electricity by nuclear means and by other means such as coal and oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly agree with the question <e> <s> if the minister will not take up the issue will he represent to the post office that because it is unable to give any guarantee that first-class mail will be delivered within hours a good deal is not so delivered it is unreasonable to add an extra penny to the charge <e> <s> i believe that in any event the differential charge is totally unjustified <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that there is very strong public interest in this matter quite apart from the researchers interest <e> <s> there is also an interest outside the realms of medicine <e> <s> certainly that interest is basically on the side of publication <e> <s> there is a strong public interest in research being published <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government published any definition of pollution <e> <s> if not will they do so <e> <s> while many forms of pollution are extremely damaging is the minister aware that what is pollution to human beings appears in some forms acceptable to certain denizens that live in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak with any expert knowledge of the water industry <e> <s> however we are all consumers of water <e> <s> so it is on behalf of consumers that i should like to say a few words <e> <s> we are indeed most grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for having raised the matter <e> <s> there is no doubt that water is a natural monopoly and an absolutley vital one <e> <s> it has normally been held to be almost impossible to control such monopolies by competition <e> <s> we shall be interested to hear whether the government believe that it can be done in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords even at this early stage of the matter could i ask the minister to be more specific as to why he thinks it will encourage the children of weekly wage earners to go into higher education <e> <s> that is one of the most crucial issues in higher education <e> <s> i am not totally opposed to loans in all circumstances <e> <s> however i fail entirely to see why they should encourage a working class family to send its children into higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords when i determined to speak about scotland in the debate i feared that i might be a voice crying in the wilderness and that i should be on a different railway line from everyone else <e> <s> i find that that is not so <e> <s> many of the points which have been made by the noble baroness will arouse echoes of pleasure in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most glad that i made the point <e> <s> it also accounts for the noble lords extraordinary adoration of capital punishment <e> <s> no doubt he is in favour of public hangings with etchings available afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill produced was an absolute shambles in that it did not deal with taxation or give any right to tax <e> <s> i must confess that the governments present attitude to the developments in scotland bodes ill for the future <e> <s> they had better get down to considering what is going on in scotland instead of brushing the matter aside and pretending that because one bill was a failure the whole matter can be shelved <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how our charges compare with those of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what is the level of the charges <e> <s> are they higher or lower <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that to some of us this noble gesture is rather alarming <e> <s> is she aware that many so called elderly retired fellows of the royal society are well worth preserving including at least one who is here today <e> <s> personally i would much rather have them than the mappa mundi <e> <s> does she agree that if elderly guinea-pigs are to be found for that purpose such rather useless guinea-pigs as myself might be more suitable than fellows of the royal society <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that two leading newspapers now refuse to take part in the lobby system <e> <s> does not that destroy the governments case that the system is universally popular <e> <s> further can the noble lord tell us how it is that the details of the statement about british shipbuilders were all contained in yesterdays morning newspaper when the noble lord maintains that the main means of communicating information should be through statements in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords there cannot possibly be any reason for persecuting the bahais <e> <s> i hope that noble lords are now disabused of the idea that they are a remote middle eastern sect <e> <s> there are small flourishing communities of the bahai in both orkney and shetland <e> <s> they play a very valuable part in that they are attempting to synthesise the religions of the world and not to create difficulties between them <e>", "<cs> my lords we all share the deep distress that has been expressed about this appalling accident <e> <s> i fully understand that information is still coming in but i wonder whether the minister can tell us a little more about the casualties on the ground <e> <s> i believe that he said that five people have so far been identified as dead in the town of lockerbie <e> <s> can he tell us which villages and small towns in the -mile swathe of which he spoke are the worst affected what are their names and whether he has any information about the casualties there <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the degree of modesty shown by the minister welcome not only to the noble and learned lord but to us especially when we look at the building of the department of the environment which is a strong candidate for being the ugliest building in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the two companies are amalgamated may we look forward to advertisements saying guinness and whisky are good for you <e> <s> will the noble lord who has shown some sympathy with the point that the whisky trade is discriminated against impress upon his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer that there is no reason for this discrimination <e> <s> indeed there is no defence put up for it except some historical accident <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker from these benches since he made his maiden speech i offer our congratulations to the noble viscount lord dunrossil on his most excellent speech <e> <s> let us get <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that not only the government but also all air users should be most grateful to the noble baroness for her constant questioning on this most important subject <e> <s> however can he say a little more about the governments view on air traffic controllers <e> <s> it appears to me that the delays which caused so much chaos last summer were at any rate in part due to troubles over air traffic controllers <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the minister said the staff are against this change can he tell us with whom the ultimate decision will lie and when it may be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of iraq is it not true that casualties who were clearly identified as suffering from the effects of chemical weapons were examined by impartial doctors from other countries and that the charges are proved to the hilt <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from that question may we be informed when the opposition front bench may be seen dancing round the maypole <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer to the original question with which i have a great deal of sympathy <e> <s> will the government make it clear that if fish is diverted from one port to another it is not necessarily in a state of rapid decay as the noble lord described it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us at what discount under market prices the houses will be sold <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government either permit or encourage the manufacturers of rat poison to pep up their product <e> <s> i have spent pounds and pounds on it and the orkney rats simply love it <e> <s> it is full of bran and what it needs is more poison <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow up some of the points which have already been raised in this admirable debate for which we are much indebted to the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> the first matter about which i wish to speak is the future control of the railways <e> <s> excellent as their performance has been as was shown by the noble lord lord ezra the uncertainty hanging over their future prevents the necessary investment and may have some effect upon morale <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why i support the admirable speech of my noble friend lord russell is that mr martin russell who is a friend of mine approached me some years ago about this matter <e> <s> it seemed to me that a question of public interest is involved and that further inquiries ought to be made into the unhappy history of his bank <e>", "<cs> even at minutes to and even with the committee so well supplied with experts it may be a mild advantage to have the view of an amateur in this matter <e>", "<cs> i too should like to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> it emanates i think from job ownership limited of which i was chairman until recently <e> <s> the device of lists appears to have worked well <e> <s> that may appear rather curious but it works well and it saves a great deal of time and trouble in drawing up the relevant articles of association <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> does it mean that he now accepts the evidence that the most appalling atrocities have been perpetrated by the ethiopian government <e> <s> does he also accept that because we and our allies in europe give a large amount of aid to ethiopia we are in a position to bring weight to bear upon that country <e> <s> finally has any approach been made to russia in respect of this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply so far as it goes which is not very far <e> <s> does he not think it extraordinary that the government were prepared to spend over million to set up a gallery for the thyssen collection and yet they are now not prepared to make that money which has not been used for that purpose available to assist the opera and obviate the need to rent covent garden or to enable our galleries and museums to exhibit some of the innumerable works of art which at present they are forced to keep in their cellars and storehouses <e> <s> does he not agree that it is a scandal that that sort of offer should be made for thyssen and yet so little is done in what i believe is museum year to enable our own native collections to be shown <e>", "<cs> my lords what steps are the government taking to ensure that students whose examinations have already been disrupted do not suffer from those troubles which are in no way their fault <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the government made representations to try to reduce the horrifying projected increases in water charges and that they received a dusty answer <e> <s> if that is the case will they make further representations and what hopes have they of containing the projected increases in those charges <e>", "<cs> one might say that hope springs eternal in the governments breast my lords <e> <s> do they recall the far off day when they announced that their success in stopping inflation would be the judge and jury of their economic policy <e> <s> are they also aware that since then the pound has fallen to about half its value and that according to a poll today the majority of people in this country believe that the government will never stop inflation <e> <s> do they agree that they at least need some new policies if they still intend to stop inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that his optimism is not very widely shared <e> <s> at the moment the universities are snowed under with returns and demands of one kind or another nearly all emanating from the government or their appointed bodies <e> <s> the problem has become so bad that there is talk of making the position of the principal of the vice-chancellors committee a full-time job for a year taking him away from his university duties so that he can deal with this mass of administration <e> <s> would this not be a complete waste of time money and talent <e>", "<cs> my lords as was said by my noble friend we cannot speak for our colleagues on the continent but is it not most extraordinary that a fairly recent member of the government who are supposed to have a collective view on these matters now expresses a totally contrary opinion to that which he apparently held some months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of a question tabled by the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil i measured the thickness of the statutes passed in the year in which i first entered parliament <e> <s> it was under a wicked socialising bureaucratic labour government <e> <s> the statutes are one inch thick and are contained in one volume <e> <s> the latest statutes are in three volumes and are just over four-and-a-half inches thick <e> <s> does the minister really believe that such a weight of legislation most of it ill-drafted and difficult to understand is setting the people free <e>", "<cs> my lords is it then the case that the allegations at any rate are untrue that peterhead if not directly involved with the disaster took a considerable amount of pressure off aberdeen at a vital moment when aberdeen was deeply involved <e> <s> secondly what damage would there be if this closure was postponed until after the inquiry <e> <s> it seems anomalous to have an inquiry and to make major decisions in the area just before it is due to report <e>", "<cs> my lords is the damage to the ozone layer thought to be already affecting the climate <e> <s> if so is it responsible for the excellent winter which the south of england is enjoying <e> <s> if the climate continues to improve is there any possibility that we shall have better weather even in scotland <e>", "<cs> i support the extremely able exposition of this amendment which we have just heard from the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i have listened to the debates on all these amendments and it seems to me that there are three serious ways in which security is damaged <e> <s> one of course is from traitors within the services which this bill does not deal with but we are apt to forget that that is one of the main troubles with security and it is strange how that is tolerated <e> <s> i was personally told by donald maclean that he was totally unfit to be in the foreign office a sentiment with which i agree but he was pressed by the foreign office to remain <e>", "<cs> the government will have heard the arguments put forward by the noble lords lord thomas of swynnerton and lord dacre of glanton who spoke as eminent historians and with wide knowledge of the subject that we are discussing <e> <s> i hope they will also have read the speeches of mr amery mr aitken and others in the house of commons so i shall not repeat the arguments which must be well known to the government by now <e>", "<cs> i must have been extremely difficult to understand even by my standards <e> <s> i was talking entirely in the past tense or years ago <e> <s> does the minister really believe that it is vital that we should know nothing about how security ever operated in the whole of history <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether he is aware of how glad we all are to see him answering questions for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that intervention i ask the lord advocate whether this does not seem a perfectly proper question to raise in parliament <e> <s> is it not the case that there was enough evidence before the court for the sheriff to convict trimble for killing the child <e> <s> if an adult had hit or slapped another adult so hard that the person died the adult who committed the assault would unquestionably have been accused of something more than a common assault <e> <s> i ask again why a higher charge was not brought <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the announcement by the minister <e> <s> however can he say <e>", "<cs> my lords long ago at the beginning of the debate the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones remarked that the proposals contained in the green paper had sprung out of the blue <e> <s> several speakers since then have complained that there has been insufficient time to consider the proposals that they come as a surprise and that much longer is required to consider them <e> <s> only people matured in the inns of court and used to their pace could maintain that the proposals have sprung out of the blue <e> <s> all my life there has been endless talk of the need for some change in the legal system <e> <s> we have had the marre and i do not know how many other reports <e> <s> the green papers appeared in january <e> <s> it has not been noticeable in the debate that the judges for instance are tongue-tied about them <e> <s> they have lodged some eloquent and cogent criticisms <e> <s> it has not been apparent that they have been unable to think out their views <e>", "<cs> my lords this appears to be a very typical lawyers point <e> <s> it has nothing to do with my point <e> <s> what i want to know is why should it cost to defend them <e> <s> that seems to be a different matter <e> <s> whatever the reason may be there are two matters i would stress one of which has not so far been raised in this debate <e> <s> we should make it far easier for people who appear in person <e> <s> when i was at the bar such people were practically openly persecuted and i am told they are not exactly welcomed now <e> <s> nothing is made easier for them <e> <s> yet if anyone is setting up a sensible system of law one of the first things they would do would be to make it possible for people to argue their own cases <e> <s> secondly we should give far more money to law centres and citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> we should consider extending legal aid to all sorts of matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their interventions <e> <s> whether the case is right or wrong it is interesting that the noble and learned lord lord scarman feels that it is a powerful argument for our adversarial system <e> <s> i think that it is a very powerful argument for an investigative system <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how the wider access programme about which he spoke will work in the more remote parts of scotland to which the residential college at newbattle was of particular value <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to apologise <e> <s> as a result of a longstanding engagement i cannot be present during the final stages of the debate <e> <s> i apologise in particular to the noble viscount and the noble baroness who so ably opened the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening but is the noble earl saying that i said the polytechnics are second-class institutions <e> <s> i must have been talking in my sleep <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble and learned lord agree that this is a matter of the greatest importance namely the rights of the individual as against the bureaucracy and that it is causing widespread concern <e> <s> therefore does not he agree that while we are reforming the law this might be the moment for discussion of this proposal and for the extension of the judicial review <e> <s> for example the noble and learned lord might wish to issue one of his non-controversial green papers on this matter so that we can see the various alternatives possible thereby dealing with a matter that i suggest is of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords as a recognition of the improved atmosphere in international relations will the government consider asking the soviet fleet to pay us an official visit <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not an extraordinary contrast between the attention and indeed expenditure given to the lamentable deaths of people at a football match and to the statistics which we have just heard <e> <s> while i do not accuse the government of complacency in any way does that not suggest that by far the most serious cause of accidents is dangerous driving on the roads and that it is to that which public attention ought to be directed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to say anything about the wider problem of transport in london though i absolutely accept what was said by the noble earl in opening this debate that it is all one problem and it has to be looked at at some point as a general problem <e> <s> i wish to speak about the underground <e> <s> but before doing that i say only this about buses <e> <s> london transport is determined that buses can only be run through london in convoys with large gaps between a convoy of five or six buses of the same route number <e> <s> london transport maintains that it is impossible to stop that <e> <s> it is possible to stop it but it is difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister rightly said that one of the great dangers to the country is inflation through excessive wage demands <e> <s> does he agree that those demands are fuelled by the enormous increases for the people at the top of the professions and industry <e> <s> does he also agree that it is hard to expect the employees of the bbc to be satisfied with or per cent <e> <s> when the director general is awarded an increase of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i should have to spend most of my minutes making apologies and that has turned out all too true <e> <s> i must first make a humble apology to the noble lord lord hughes for interrupting his speech that being far from my intention <e> <s> my main apology is that i believe that i am the only person who is attempting to speak in the debates on both the green and the yellow papers <e> <s> i am certainly the only person who has no qualifications whatsoever for doing so <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mccluskey who opened the debate and thank him for a most excellent exposition of his criticisms of the yellow paper <e> <s> my last apology is for standing between the noble lord lord hughes and the noble lord lord jauncey of tullichettle whom everyone is extremely anxious to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that even those of us who are enthusiastic about encouraging prestwick think that that is an absolutely dotty way of doing it <e> <s> if the governments reasoning is that they will improve communications to prestwick which are far from good can he say whether they have started the programme what improvements they will make and when they may be completed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether it is still the governments contention that this is a tax not on property but on the use made of services <e> <s> will he confirm that the decision therefore depends not on who owns or does not own the home but on what use is made of the local services <e> <s> is that not the whole basis of the governments case for this tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers explanation of the word gives the impression which i am sure is wrong that the government might regard a worse public service as being cost-effective <e>", "<cs> my lords this scheme may indeed be an improvement on the last scheme or statement but if so it is a very small improvement <e> <s> i should like to press the noble viscount on one or two points which have been touched on <e> <s> without wishing to <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand from the ministers initial answer that in fact the government are well satisfied with the economy <e> <s> but does he agree that that is a little complacent <e> <s> there have been some improvements particularly for those at the top of the pile but are the government really satisfied with the rate of unemployment coupled with the distribution of the increased wealth and inflation <e> <s> is it not time that they found some new remedies as clearly the current ones are failing to deal with what most people consider to be a rather unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to break in to these exchanges between the monarch of the glen and the queen of sheba but is this not a wholly abhorrent proposal <e> <s> i must say that i have not heard of it before but whatever precautions are taken about the welfare of deer in factory farming the very idea of factory farming deer must be wholly abhorrent and should in my view be forbidden <e>", "<cs> my lords is the heart of the leader of the house not touched by the fact that the tories in scotland do not have one single representative in europe <e> <s> in spite of everything there are quite a few of them <e> <s> does that not show not only a lack of any attempt at democracy but a curious lack of belief in the noble lords own party and indeed a curious obliviousness to the right of the scots to have the various opinions in scotland deployed in europe <e> <s> is not now the case for electoral reform absolutely overwhelming <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that however the situation arises and whatever the relationship between the woman and the child the child is frequently removed from the woman who is the putative mother and great distress results <e> <s> can the minister say whether it would more often be possible for the child to accompany the mother if the mother is taken into custody <e> <s> can the minister further say whether it would be possible to make better arrangements with the country from which the mothers and children come so that there is some check on this trade <e> <s> it amounts really to a trade in children <e> <s> is the minister aware that it is causing great distress to social workers and others at airports <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that the land that has been sold off will remain under forestry or are the purchasers entitled to make what use of it they like <e> <s> can the minister be more explicit as to how the government propose to enforce the guarantees for example of public access <e> <s> is it not the case that at least under the law of england once one has parted with ownership in property one cannot enforce burdens on ones successors <e> <s> is that not also the case in scotland and if so how do the government propose to get round it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the white paper but perhaps i may ask first whether it applies to scotland <e> <s> i rather imagine that is does not <e> <s> but if not what will happen about scotland <e> <s> will there be a separate white paper in that respect <e> <s> secondly when the government are considering wider proposals as was mentioned by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will they be considering an extension of the inquisitorial system which after all is widespread in europe with which we shall become more and more involved <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it no one is proposing to move the zoo from regents park <e> <s> while it is presided over with great distinction by the noble lord lord peyton would not the government agree that in principle at least the more animals that can be kept in the country and out of london the better <e> <s> although regents park is greatly enjoyed by human beings it is not so clear that all animals greatly enjoy it <e> <s> therefore should not caution be taken in extending the zoo though no one is suggesting that it should be abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that quality is a matter for the universities does he agree that if they are to increase the number of first-year students and maintain quality they must <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a matter which has already been raised in correspondence with the scottish office by mr wallace <e> <s> i also attempted to raise this matter in the other place but unfortunately it earned the guillotine and i was prevented from doing so <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i thank the minister for his remarks and i look forward to hearing from him <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of the amendment <e> <s> we have seen in the education world a tendency to press universities to take on fringe activities running conferences and so forth with a view to helping out their general budget <e> <s> like the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove i fear that there may be a temptation for school authorities to go down the same road <e> <s> if anything should be free of means testing it is general education in all its forms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his initial answer does not carry complete <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister is considering the letters will he bear in mind that shetland is on the same latitude as leningrad <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what has been the increase in the cost of an ordinary local call <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of refugees which was raised by the previous speakers is the minister aware that it seems incredible to many people in this country that a country of over million very rich people and a commonwealth of well over million people cannot find room for refugees <e> <s> will he give a guarantee that if the worst comes to the worst and they cannot genuinely be voluntarily repatriated they will be found somewhere to go in the world and will not be forcibly repatriated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear of anything which would give the voters more information on what they are voting about <e> <s> candidly i think the vote is going to be one of the most confused even in our parliamentary history <e> <s> how are they to know how the school governors will behave in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord decides what to do perhaps i may say that the ministers replies seem to place on the secretary of state the most extraordinary onus <e> <s> we are told again and again that he will have to weigh this consideration with that consideration and that he will have to take this into account and that into account <e> <s> we shall need a special secretary of state to run this act alone <e> <s> it is highly undesirable that parliament should pass a bill which entails such an extraordinary breadth of examination by a secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that amendment no <e> <s> is under discussion <e> <s> i wish to take advantage of that in order to return to a point i raised in committee <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships for this manoeuvre but my excuse is that in committee the minister kindly said that he would contact me about my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it took longer to put a new escalator into holland park station than it did to build the whole of the central line with picks and shovels before the first world war <e> <s> could he not call in the army <e> <s> i can assure him that the engineers in the army would get these things done in one-tenth of the time that london transport takes to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet spoken on this matter <e> <s> the more i listen to what is said the more in favour i become of such an amendment <e> <s> we are not certain about how the bill will operate in scotland <e> <s> i do not believe that the english experience is necessarily valid although the welsh experience may be <e> <s> however there is a great variety of education in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for his courtesy and for the amount of work which he has put into this bill <e> <s> unfortunately i could not be present at the second reading because i was taking part in an educational occasion that is the conferring of degrees <e> <s> i confess that i am wholeheartedly in favour of involving parents to a greater extent in education but i am less enthusiastic about introducing new divisions into scottish education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will admire the courtesy and indeed guile of my noble colleague who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the minister aright when he said that the total cost was only million and that if the disabled were added it would be million <e> <s> have not the government lately poured far bigger sums of money than that into projects much less worthy <e> <s> as the noble baroness said do we not read every day of increases in pay and allowances and so forth throughout the public service which make this sum look like chickenfeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall start by thanking the noble earl lord perth for introducing the debate and for the excellent speech he made in so doing <e> <s> i should also like to say what an honour it is to follow a real live artist in a debate <e> <s> indeed it is most rare as we are mostly slippered pantaloons who look at such matters from a theoretical point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to four most impressive speeches on the need to develop a new policy towards china <e> <s> i particularly want to thank the noble viscount lord mersey for raising this vital matter and for the way in which he deployed the case against china and in favour of tibet <e> <s> we have also heard from the noble lord lord ennals at first hand of some of the horrors which have been occurring and also from my noble friend lord avebury who has a long record of defending human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords are not all nations trading nations <e> <s> further if trade is to be put above human rights or ordinary human decencies then presumably we can say goodbye to any rule of law or anything like it in international society <e> <s> therefore do not the government realise that there is a clear contradiction between saying that we must give credits to iraq and then saying that we totally disapprove of their internal form of government <e>", "<cs> my lords now that this scheme which the government assured us was so perfect has collapsed will the minister ask his right honourable friend to consult again with the vice-chancellors and principals and so forth on the other two schemes that have been put forward in some detail either for graduate tax or for linking loans to national insurance <e> <s> there are many people in this country who think that these are preferable to the current scheme in any case <e> <s> does he not agree that surely now they should be re-examined <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that on certain islands off the coast of scotland it is impossible to find any employment other than fishing and that the situation there may require special treatment in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what proposals the trustees themselves have for this large quantity of pictures that are never seen <e> <s> do they hold out any hope that they will ever be seen <e> <s> how many public buildings can be expected to take on the suggestion of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> what is proposed for this huge sunken galleon of pictures which lies apparently in the vaults of the tate <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in britain today with certain aspects of the law <e> <s> i applaud the government for trying to improve matters <e> <s> my difficulty is that i do not believe that the bill will improve matters <e> <s> indeed i do not believe that it goes to the root of anxiety about the law <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale not only for his speech tonight but for his continuous efforts to achieve something concerning the subject we are now debating <e> <s> he has made efforts in which he has been extremely well supported or led by the noble lord lord renton whom i am also glad to see here <e> <s> i hope very much that their words and those of the noble lord lord rippon will be listened to <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a policy of the government that the security at the barracks of fighting units should be carried out in certain cases by private security firms <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any reason the taxpayer cannot be told what is being spent on marketing <e> <s> there cannot be any secrecy <e> <s> that is clearly expenditure from public funds and surely the public have a right to know what has been expended <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clear up the point about the lack of evidence <e> <s> the government rest their case on the contention that there is no evidence <e> <s> what appears to be evidence has already been printed for instance in the back of mr paul foots book <e> <s> is it the governments contention that that is forged it may be inconclusive but it appears to be evidence or is there some other explanation as to why it does not count as evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords although there may have been underfunding is the minister aware that my water rates in london increased by over times in the years before nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the logic behind the poll tax supposed to be that it is a contribution for services <e> <s> do not most people make far more use of the services in their first home than those in their second home <e> <s> yet those people will pay a higher charge for their second home <e> <s> have any special arrangements been made for people who require a second home not as a holiday home but because for instance they have to work in london while they have obligations in the country <e> <s> i am thinking of members of parliament of both houses <e> <s> have any special arrangements been made in their case <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that much of the debate over the next few hours will also focus on the complaints of students that they are poor <e> <s> part of the reason is the failure of parents to pay their parental contributions <e> <s> if this proposal of my noble friend would help in extracting the parental contribution from reluctant parents would it not be worth considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course vote for the amendment of my noble friend but i confess that i find this bill blissfully intelligible <e> <s> it is the only bill over the past four or five years of which i am certain i understood the whole purpose <e> <s> that does not mean that it is constitutionally absurd and there is no reason why it should not have contained a great deal more information about payment and repayment of these loans <e> <s> however i hope the result of the criticism in this house will not mean that we return to those endless farragoes from which we have suffered in previous bills <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government confirm that while they refused to see the dalai lama apparently in the hope of appeasing china they have received the health minister of iraq without any protest whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the government entirely justified in ignoring this question <e> <s> a year ago they assured me that they would abolish inflation <e> <s> if so it would be absurd for them to take it into account <e> <s> when is inflation to be abolished <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that such a registry is in existence at least for england <e> <s> it is a private enterprise registry which indicates where one can obtain grants for various purposes <e> <s> would it be worth inquiring whether that covers scotland or indeed encouraging a similar registry in scotland <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest sympathy with this amendment and certainly with the very important point that has been raised about the churches <e> <s> i certainly support what the noble and <e>", "<cs> i am much indebted to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> however my mind is still not clear on the matter <e> <s> who are these controllers who are in control if the management is not responsible in this respect <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i cannot say that i am convinced by his arguments or that my mind is much clearer <e> <s> nevertheless as it is late at night i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would be good enough to enlighten me a little further on the companys responsibilities to the secretary of state and to parliament <e> <s> i have noticed since joining your lordships house that a rather wider view is taken here of the questions which ministers will answer <e> <s> am i right in thinking that as this is an independent limited company the minister in another place will not answer for it <e> <s> he will say that he is not responsible for the companys day-to-day proceedings <e> <s> therefore a student who has a grievance about his treatment will not be able to go to his member of parliament and have the matter raised in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord the leader of the house will forgive me for saying that this has come as something of a surprise to me <e> <s> i thought that i heard the noble earl say very courteously that he was deliberately speaking earlier with a view to assisting the house <e> <s> i understood that the rule in such a case is that other people are permitted to speak after him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one brief point with regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it refers to gathering <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment both from the point of view of students such as medical students who not only have a longer period of training but are put to some considerable extra expense and from the point of view of scottish students <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like further information on this matter <e> <s> it does not seem to me at all clear exactly how the student loans company will work <e> <s> it is a wholly separate limited company it is not under the direct command of the minister <e> <s> he cannot tell it what to do i take it <e> <s> it will be bound by the laws of limited liability and by this bill when it becomes a statute <e> <s> it seems to me that in fulfilling its functions it is going to make large demands on universities and colleges for information to enable it to follow up students <e> <s> the previous series of amendments raises important and difficult matters in this regard <e> <s> it may be known to universities if ex-students have gone abroad as they tend to keep in touch with their former graduates <e> <s> where graduates go after graduation and what they are doing are all questions which the company whether the minister likes it or not may want to raise with institutions <e> <s> i believe that a large amount of work may be placed upon institutions and they will be in some difficulty as regards knowing whether they are entitled to reply to inquiries or whether they should reply <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> as i mentioned on a previous amendment i have suffered from being named in proceedings which came as a surprise to me as i regarded myself simply as an honorary officer of the charity concerned <e> <s> i now understand that an honorary officer may be found due for expenses even though he is not named in the proceedings <e> <s> i should have thought that was contrary to natural justice and therefore i hope that the noble and learned lord will consider the amendment seriously <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that i have some interest in achieving a further definition of control <e> <s> i raised the matter under an earlier amendment and i expressed some dissatisfaction with the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i hope that now that two lawyers have also expressed some doubt as to what is meant by control and some hope that it will be further defined at some stage we shall have a further definition of control <e>", "<cs> i too was puzzled to note under the new clause that the court must be satisfied as to paragraphs a b c and d <e> <s> to me as a non-lawyer it looks as though the court must be so satisfied because the word or is not inserted the bill simply lists those paragraphs as the conditions upon which it must be satisfied <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would confirm that <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble and learned lord is not prepared to accept shall instead of may in line <e> <s> does that mean that he intends to leave it open for the secretary of state to make or not make regulations or does he consider that the regulations are in any way compulsory on the secretary of state <e> <s> if his intention is to give the option to the secretary of state can he explain why that is necessary <e>", "<cs> a speech made in favour of these amendments the principle of which i agree with raises a question in my mind which is possibly more appropriate to the proposers of the amendments than to the government <e> <s> who is to choose the solicitor <e> <s> as has been said there are many areas in scotland where solicitors are difficult to come by <e> <s> when this bill has gone through they may be reduced still further <e> <s> it may then be quite difficult to find a man who is totally independent <e> <s> at any rate it should be made plain that it must not be left to the conveyancer to find a solicitor <e> <s> whether that means that we shall have to have a panel of solicitors or whether it is considered that the client is capable of choosing his own solicitor seems to be a matter that requires further thought <e>", "<cs> it might save the committees time if i spoke on this amendment instead of my amendment no <e> <s> which is not grouped with it but attempts to deal with the same matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on the handling of the bill i do not think we have received an answer to the point originally raised by the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> it was that whatever notice was given to the front benches no notice could have been given to people on the back-benches or the cross-benches <e> <s> in a matter of this kind that is important particularly for the cross-benches <e> <s> i also believe that it is rather unfair to attack the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> we are all unpaid slaves in this place <e> <s> it seems to me that on a matter of this importance we have some right to suppose that it will arise at a time when trains still run and we should not normally be in bed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that he said that the government would meet the costs that seems to be perfectly adequate and not that they would make a contribution to the costs <e> <s> he said at one point that the government would meet them <e> <s> we wish to qualify that by finding out what they will be and the method of meeting them which is to be decided <e> <s> will he confirm that he categorically stated that the government would meet the costs <e> <s> that is quite clear <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble and learned lord the lord advocate can assist me on a matter which no doubt i should be able to find out for myself <e> <s> i understand that an advocate such as a barrister is not liable in negligence <e> <s> will a solicitor advocate be liable <e> <s> can one sue a solicitor advocate for negligence <e>", "<cs> as my name has been mentioned perhaps i may be allowed to add a few words to the debate <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey but i do not want to pre-empt what i hope to say on monday when i hope to have the noble and learned lords support <e> <s> as regards the present situation i speak as someone who is not averse to widening the rights of audience <e> <s> however i must repeat what i said at second reading the ordinary persons view about the law is first that it is too expensive secondly that the delays are sometimes inordinately long and thirdly that it is uncertain <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the provision is extremely widely drawn <e> <s> it refers to other bodies which are not professional bodies <e> <s> i do not know whether there is a definition of professional body <e> <s> the provision may have been inserted because there is no such definition <e> <s> but as it stands it can <e>", "<cs> while i agree with the purpose of the amendment is it customary to embody such provision in legislation <e> <s> i never remember seeing anything like it before in an act <e> <s> does the secretary of state not have power to authorise the lord president to have the staff and expenses necessary for carrying out an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> in view of his promise that he will look at the drafting i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i was aware that i was trespassing on ground which we had not yet come to but i did so in the hope of saving the committees time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we part with the clause if it is not going to be objected to will the noble and learned lord the lord advocate be kind enough to clear up my mind as a layman on one or two points concerning subsection <e> <s> i find the negative drafting rather difficult to follow <e>", "<cs> may i be quite clear <e> <s> are we handing over to the secretary of state and the lord president the decision as to whether advocates can or cannot enter into a legally binding obligation <e> <s> that seems to be a very big step and i wonder whether parliament is right to delegate that <e> <s> as i understand it they would be free to do so unless it is forbidden both by the lord president and by the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore it appears likely that this will come about without direct parliamentary sanction and i wonder whether that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am not sure whether this has anything to do with the question may i ask the government whether they are aware as a matter of interest that it is not only the greek orthodox church which keeps to the julian calendar <e> <s> certain parts of the shetlands also keep to the julian calendar and celebrate old christmas and old new year as well i may say as new christmas and new new year <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the answers given by the minister that he considers that a great benefit was conferred on scotland by the introduction of the charge a year earlier than in england <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer shows a very welcome improvement over the years in the conduct of the authority <e> <s> will he now consider extending this admirable suggestion still further and apply it to ministers of the crown and in particular to the secretary of state for transport and his immediate minions <e>", "<cs> i very much support what has been said by the last two speakers <e> <s> we are on a narrow but extremely important point <e> <s> i wish to return to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said <e> <s> he moved a new clause to the bill which he said was chiefly necessary in the case of homicide and serious fraud <e> <s> since then we have had other examples where it might be useful <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the courtesy of his reply and for reminding me of the undertaking given as regards clauses and <e> <s> i agree that those clauses are important <e> <s> however i still think that <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the government expecting inflation now to turn down <e> <s> the minister said that we shall join when inflation is on the way down <e> <s> has not the time come for that or do the government expect it still to go up <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that at times of high and increasing inflation to save is a very bad bet <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not help if by way of example some of those who are exceedingly well paid stopped taking enormous increases in salary every year <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the white paper are we to infer from the ministers previous reply that the government have considered or are considering further proposals which are not yet known to this house or are they content to continue to make representations as the minister stated <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government consider following the example of that god-fearing country scotland <e> <s> i am sure that there would be unanimous agreement to following the scots who are famous for their religion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his right honourable friend the prime minister is on record as having said that the only reason that she is not receiving the dalai lama is for fear of offending the chinese <e> <s> she is taking that course not because he is the head of a refugee government but because she wishes to practise appeasement <e> <s> is the minister aware that appeasement in this sense has never worked and will have no effect upon the chinese <e> <s> what recent protests have the government made against the behaviour of china <e> <s> even that countrys own government admits that tibet is totally autonomous <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter perfectly right in saying that one major factor in inflation is excessive wage demands <e> <s> however do not these wage demands start at the top <e> <s> will the government come clean and say that they are opposed to and per cent <e> <s> increases in salaries or wages whoever claims them <e>", "<cs> i rise to do something which i do not often do and that is to say a word in defence of the government and another word in defence of the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i thought she made a rather good speech though she does not need any defence from me <e> <s> i think she stated some of the things that many people in scotland are thinking <e> <s> the governments proposals contained in the bill are sensible unlike most of their proposals in most bills <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure include propaganda and advertisements <e> <s> if so can the minister tell us what the costs will be <e> <s> i notice that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what would persuade the government in regard to scotland to get away from the diktat of government and embrace the democracy of the people <e> <s> in scotland they hold a very small vote and there is a very large majority against them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly agree with the noble lord lord dormand in his criticism of the government and with his insistence on the importance of manufacturing industry <e> <s> i was also particularly struck by two previous speeches one by my noble friend lord ezra and the other by the noble lord lord callaghan <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord ezra was right to stress that what we need are some long-term measures to assist the economy of the country <e> <s> as for the noble lord lord callaghan who has held all the great offices of state he particularly graced the office of prime minister in which his performance was much better than in other offices my heart warmed to his dismissal of the myth that some sort of thatcherite miracle has been performed <e> <s> it is absolute nonsense and high time that someone in authority exploded that myth <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove in the congratulations he offered to the minister <e> <s> i also wish to congratulate the noble lord lord carmichael on his speech <e> <s> however i did not altogether follow his razor-sharp mind as regards water although i understand that he was chiefly concerned with drought <e> <s> i must confess that among all the evils of this wicked world drought is not high on the list for those in the far north of scotland <e>", "<cs> but my lords should there be doubts there <e> <s> it seems to me that even if those things appear in other places they should appear at this point also <e>"]
