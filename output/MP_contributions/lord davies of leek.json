know that the government want to save money but at the same time i hope they do not destroy the educational purpose of british education <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that they will look at this amendment with favour because although a school may be in another educational area if a legitimate percentage of children from area x go to school in area y it would be worthwhile to have some kind of

aristocrats if i may pay tribute to the lucky people opposite who through centuries have maintained the beauty of the land but upon the modern trend for over-capitalisation of farming and the

ramifications of this matter are causing quite a lot of trouble to people who are now much older and who have served this country well in all kinds of skills and sometimes relatives of theirs have

their encouragement of small businesses and to the noble baroness opposite who initiated the small businesses group in this house <e> <s> nevertheless is the noble viscount aware of the billions of pounds from insurance companies and others that are now flowing overseas <e> <s> while i have no knowledge of this i would ask the noble viscount whether he can inform the house of whether there is

freedom to the scots <e> <s> because if we welshmen get up there some of us ultra-nationalists though i am not one myself we might demand to be taught welsh in scottish schools <e>", "<cs> my lords

amendment and particularly on the possibilities of the child that can benefit from this provision <e> <s> as i said earlier in a short speech and this will be short at one time those of us who knew

to pay a tribute to the men and women who for many years have devoted their lives to teaching the underprivileged and the handicapped children in difficult schools <e> <s> i should think that

this country and in their old age deserve to be protected from inflation <e> <s> without them britain might not have been what it was after the war <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord is

"<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that this question to some of us particularly since we are sending the welsh guards down to this part of the world with relatives in patagonia and

and their branches <e> <s> do they have to apply to the councils for this permission or by the scheduled year can the council bring these schedules into force to prevent these enterprising people from selling on the laybys and other parts of the country fruit vegetables and amenities and even providing snack bars which are very useful in certain parts of the country <e> <s> sometimes a caravan is fitted up by an enterprising person <e> <s> i would be interested to get the position straightened out <e>", "<cs> my lords have i got this right <e> <s> indemnification is not as easy as all that

put it up <e> <s> this needs clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not so sure about it <e> <s> what i was thinking of here is this <e> <s> supposing i was running a newsagents shop and somebody stands outside that shop they have had permission to set up and are selling newspapers <e> <s> i have had shopkeepers when i was a member of another place coming to me because they were suffering from

will try to find some formula that will give some satisfaction to my noble friend and the house and the country that these unattended areas will be supervised more than is the case at present <e> <s> i do not want to develop it because i think the arguments are pretty evident to all noble lords on both sides of the house <e> <s> i hope the government will try to give a constructive answer and if

watching television it influences the adults of the future <e> <s> children who do not really play when they grow up try to be children instead of men <e>", "<cs> unless the minister is going to answer that contribution immediately i should like to make a point <e> <s> i am sure the minister will bear in mind what has been said <e> <s> i have looked carefully at this and i agree that the clause put forward still does not provide for the payment to the corporation of the costs that they will incur <e> <s> there are hidden costs if you extend pipe-lines anywhere in the country <e> <s> while the gas corporation would be quite willing to take normal commercial risks when the corporation itself is assessing those risks why should the corporation be asked to take risks for the extension of its pipes <e>", "<cs> i accept that but let me explain the point using some elementary arithmetic <e> <s> let us say that my pipe-line is running at one point and the minister says to me i am pushing some of my gas through <e> <s> is the noble lord prepared to bear some of the cost of maintenance over the years because some of his property is now running through my pipeline or am i when something goes wrong going to have to protect him myself and my customers <e> <s> is he not prepared to take a share of the responsibility from his customers to pay for the maintenance of that pipe through which his gas is running <e> <s> it is as elementary as that <e>", "<cs> that is on the record now <e>", "<cs> and teachers with teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider it to be wrong of me to interrupt her <e>", "<cs> my lords while paying respect to the expertise of mr macgregor does the noble viscount not think that it may be an appropriate moment to review the ideology of this fanatic rush to the privatisation of much of public property <e> <s> does he not realise that private enterprise in some sections has had so much public money that we have now established a new principle we are subsidising private enterprise by public money <e> <s> in other words we are going in for the lakerisation if i may invent a word of all kinds of industry that pretend to be private and live on the public purse <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that splendid and hopeful answer <e> <s> in order that i may streamline my supplementary question will he again look at paragraphs and of the excellent consultative report so that track maintenance at least can be handled as practically as possible <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that if we want to move people it is absolutely necessary to have a first-class railway system <e> <s> finally could we not use some of the contingency fund immediately for track improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i remember a similar case that we had to deal with when i was in the ministry <e> <s> in the case of pneumoconiosis a man may not find out and the doctors may not assert that his lungs are sufficiently incapacitated for a long period of time <e> <s> it often takes a long time and many a coroner has given the result of death as pneumoconiosis contracted more than years earlier <e> <s> exactly the same situation can happen in the modern sophisticated world in which we are using new materials new plastics and particularly in wartime there are fumes that were not encountered in the old conventional days <e> <s> while i do not want to lengthen the debate there is a case for looking into this <e> <s> some maladies take quite a long time to activate <e> <s> it would have been worthwhile looking at years rather than six as in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords there are eight or nine circumstances in schedule where there would be no entitlement to sickness benefit <e> <s> what this amendment does is to clarify the situation by asking us to add the fact that a dispute is not official <e> <s> as matters now stand if one is sacked while taking industrial action one can still claim unfair dismissal unless the employer has discriminated against one <e> <s> but if a person is taken ill a day or two before a strike is announced will he or she be regarded as having supported the strike even if they were at home <e> <s> this needs clarification because ultimately <e> <s> it will lead to legal discussion <e> <s> if someone falls ill during industrial action an employer may be justified in assuming that he is supporting the strike <e> <s> but if someone is ill before official action begins difficulties arise <e> <s> clarification of this clause is needed would be adding only tautological remarks if i said more <e> <s> i have made the point <e> <s> it is a little deeper than superficially we are inclined to think <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the house because we want to get the business going quickly but i do not think that the point has been met at all <e> <s> with all due respect the noble earl is dealing with the attitude towards private enterprise <e> <s> my point is that we are dealing with oil which is a completely different commodity essential to the nations strength essential to the nations defence and we should know where the sources the shares and association go <e> <s> transnational firms could take part in these shares and once again break sanctions imposed on a country such as argentina if there is a long period of activity or hostility against it <e> <s> none of that has been taken into account <e> <s> so far the debate has been long <e> <s> we are taking such an opposite view to that of canada to that of west germany and to that of democratic countries throughout europe which are interested in oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with the remarks of my noble friend that we cannot leave this just to the consumer council <e> <s> in a two- or three-minute speech i want to spike down what i consider to be a fundamental point not mentioned anywhere in the bill <e> <s> having had experience of telephone wires and underground methods of carrying energy from point a to point b maybe hundreds of miles apart i know that an essential factor in protecting the safety of the users of that energy whether it is gas or electricity is that the maps giving the direction and the placing of pipes must be kept and secured for generations <e> <s> we know about old coal mines in various mining areas that have been found and nobody knew of their existence because of lack of keeping documents <e> <s> that is the only point i want to make in this short but important addition on this amendment that somewhere or other the secretary of state should take the responsibility <e> <s> the corporation and he himself should be responsible for authorising accurate documentation that must be at the disposal of local authorities and any people who are concerned with the safety of individuals in the usage of the corporations gas <e> <s> if i spoke longer i would be reiterating <e> <s> i have made the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> that means that it is on the record that that responsibility will be carried on <e>", "<cs> my lords we have talked rather pleasingly about a surplus of billion but is the noble lord aware that in certain industries such as the pharmaceutical industry trade marks and patents arc of paramount importance and can be easily cheated on <e> <s> there has even been talk in the common market for a long time that frankfurt should become a headquarters where discussion of these matters can take place <e> <s> i do not want to ask any further questions i just want to press upon the minister the fact that there is a definite urgency about the question asked by the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question through i am not sure whether or not it is relevant <e> <s> there is now a tendency for local authorities to borrow from overseas <e> <s> would this motion that we have had put before us which seems to have been accepted in any way affect borrowing from overseas <e> <s> no local authority in history has ever reneged on paying <e> <s> how would this affect foreign borrowing by local authorities <e> <s> if it does or if it has nothing at all to do with that will the noble lord please let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords i followed this matter with interest and also looked at the noble earls amendment which on the surface is saying in simple english that what clause does is to empower the secretary of state with the treasurys consent to make regulations requiring authorities to act on rent rebates <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that reality i should like to thank the noble earl lord avon for the explanation that he gave <e> <s> while i should have liked to have seen the other amendment on the marshalled list nevertheless this is a step forward <e> <s> the time may come when it is more appropriate for us to face this problem <e> <s> consequently in thanking the noble earl i say i am grateful at least for this being on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us do not like to press the noble lord the minister who we know is a kindly individual <e> <s> but is he not aware that there is such a disparity between the attention we give to police force increases and the attention we give to the nurses and i regard the nurses service to the nation just as well <e> <s> is he not aware that now with our young men in the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell me how much vat brings in in currency to the country and is it worth all the trouble that is taken over this <e>", "<cs> i am very worried about this <e> <s> i spent to years as a member of the statutory instruments committee in another place and i believe that the vital importance of a statutory instrument to democracy and to the houses of parliament is being overlooked <e> <s> i see a gradual tendency to say there is nothing to worry about no minister will do this no minister will do that be he labour be he sdp or whatever newfangled political parties come into existence <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene briefly i have listened to the debate and i also heard some of the second reading debate <e> <s> i would have thought that the paramount problem was safety and i am sure that that is agreed on both sides of the committee <e> <s> when we use the phrase approved testing stations we want to know whether it is private or public or how it may be formed that it is not a ragamuffins paradise that the people within those testing stations are qualified and know their job and have been properly trained in that job <e> <s> consequently whatever argument we are having across the floor at the present moment the vital thing is safety because of the growing importance of transport to civilisation and because of the increasing number of deaths on the roads which we want to keep down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that expression he has just used to revise the embargo lists is a vital necessity to britains trade <e> <s> is he further aware that i myself can vouch that we lost a contract for rolling stock in china because rolling stock was put on the embargo lists <e> <s> secondly is he further aware that the chinese ministers have now said that where they buy they have to sell <e> <s> last is he further aware that the third greatest dealing nation with china is the united states of america as vouchsafed this week by the national council for usa-china trade <e> <s> when is britain going to wake up and play a part and stop talking of the falklands spirit but build up the chances of international trade <e>", "<cs> i did not want to interrupt the <e>", "<cs> further to that point the noble baroness lady seear raised the point of the / million for xpenses <e> <s> have we been dealing with inflation accountancy <e> <s> am i right in assuming that the government would have to give at least an increase of that amount and that it would be part of the expenses of many of these cases which have been held up <e> <s> we are pushing judges more and more into a difficult situation relating to trade unionism <e> <s> the government and members on both sides of the committee know well that a worker who is dismissed for non-member-ship can claim compensation from both employers and the union in which case the tribunal will ultimately decide what proportion is to be paid by each side <e> <s> this would be temptation but under clause and other parts of the bill the union could ultimately be made to pay the whole amount <e> <s> this is a point which has to be remembered when one considers the attack on the unions <e> <s> this is a second attack which follows on from the attack in the last employment bill with which we dealt <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us are becoming more and more worried <e> <s> these days fundamental decisions are made without any opportunity of discussion by parliament <e> <s> this is a fact <e> <s> as a student i often sent an sos home that i was stranded on station <e>", "<cs> my lords were the welsh authority in discussion with the government before this action too took place <e> <s> also may i assume that democratically this house and another place will have an opportunity of debating this to the full and that agreement will come through the usual channels before this is implemented <e> <s> lastly does the noble earl the minister really believe that the more we have smaller areas the greater improvement there will be in what i concur is one of the finest water systems in the world <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that there will be trouble in wales unless there is proper discussion about their water supplies because over the years no proper attention has been given to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl has won that one <e> <s> is the noble earl aware nevertheless that if we could get without party bitterness an intelligent co-ordination of road and rail many of our meadows and sacred memorial spots from our history may be left alone and that transport and life on road and rail would be easier <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that in that case the house as a whole will be informed <e>", "<cs> as somebody who regularly uses the roads may i say briefly that this is very difficult <e> <s> of course i support the idea but for instance i was driving through banbury at oclock in the morning in a area that had an -mile limit <e> <s> there was not a soul about but a couple of policemen happened to be lurking in an alleyway and then blue lights were flashing and i thought my god <e> <s> what have i done <e> <s> there was not a soul about <e> <s> tech <e>", "<cs> i asked the policeman are you looking for alcos <e> <s> i said that i had pretty well had nothing to drink all day and my word was taken for that <e> <s> i think there is quite a possibility that at that time of night the police and others are looking for those who are driving dangerously and who are not aware of the fact because they are under the influence of alcohol <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that i was not <e>", "<cs> sometimes it is very difficult to say exactly what a dangerous place is <e> <s> may i give a concrete example linked with this noble house <e> <s> at night many of us drive out and have to wait and then shuffle into a stream of traffic but parallel with the fences around our parking area taxis and cars are sometimes parked <e> <s> so you have to creep out two or three yards into a positively dangerous position because you cannot see the oncoming traffic <e> <s> to judge what a dangerous position is is not so easy as one would expect <e> <s> i drive out of this place every night in the dark and it is a dangerous job to do so when there is a string of cars parked parallel with the bars which form the boundary to the car park <e> <s> it is the same on corners of streets <e> <s> if a car is parked just round the corner one can be in difficulty <e> <s> the judging of a dangerous position is not always easy particularly for someone who does not drive a car <e> <s> again it is left to the common sense of good people who drive cars to realise this <e> <s> the committee will have got my point and there is no need to give scores of examples <e>", "<cs> may i make a brief comment in passing <e> <s> the charge in schedule relating to failure to comply with traffic direction signs is more difficult to avoid in country areas than people think especially in the spring and in the summer time <e> <s> motorists who drive around the country districts of britain will realise that traffic signs are sometimes covered by herbage or trees if the motorist is going to be stopped for not appreciating that he has passed a traffic sign the local authorities and the police also should have a sense of responsibility to ensure that traffic signs are absolutely clear <e> <s> i am sure that both experienced and learner drivers have come across this difficulty when driving <e>", "<cs> with due respect i have listened carefully but on this point there was a case where after an election hundreds of thousands of people voted for a group of people to come to power who would reduce transport costs in london <e> <s> that was completely altered outside by cases in law <e> <s> in other words the very tenet that the noble lord puts forward to this noble committee was not sustained at that time <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord a question seriously <e> <s> under section of the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i have it now it is a movable feast <e> <s> these compensations or prices will move with the value of money or with inflation <e> <s> if they can be increased upwards can they be increased or decreased downwards if we go into deflation <e>", "<cs> may i ask one question <e> <s> the words used are <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the phrase that some of these problems are extremely technical is the noble earl aware that the first report of the committee on science and sir ian bancroft himself suggested that we should increase as quickly as possible the nuclear installations inspectorate <e> <s> may i ask whether any progress has been made since that scientific report was published and made available to both houses of parliament <e> <s> secondly is the noble earl aware that since the three mile island accident in the united states confidence in nuclear reactors has decreased <e> <s> nevertheless if we have to educate the public it is of paramount importance for the right honourable lady the prime minister not to move her chariot like the queen of the iceni through the quangos of scientific people so that therefore we have nothing available <e> <s> in other words we have been cutting down the scientific information that was of paramount importance <e> <s> in the beginning the nation already had a lead in nuclear reaction <e>", "<cs> clause is a little ambiguous <e> <s> one does not know where one really is once one starts driving around <e> <s> the position now is that where there is street lighting miles per hour is generally the maximum speed <e> <s> as has just been pointed out there is no penalty imposed upon a local authority if lights are not working <e> <s> however lights may not be working in most dangerous places <e> <s> but if i drove my car with one lamp out of order although in per cent <e> <s> of cases police officers who are intelligent individuals would just say that i should get my lights put right nevertheless i should technically be liable <e> <s> no penalty though is imposed upon local authorities who neglect in some places indeed in some very important places their lighting system <e> <s> i do not want to be awkward or to make a long speech although i could easily do so but this is a vital point <e> <s> i do not expect cataclysmic changes to the bill as a result of our discussion this evening but i think that the government ought to look again at the matter and try to find a constructive answer <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way for one moment <e> <s> a concrete example of the point he is raising occurs in that famous little town of banbury <e> <s> if one is driving through oxford to warwick and once gets on the banbury road watch out <e> <s> there is one stretch of it where there is a sign showing miles per hour in great big letters <e> <s> in your car purring away on a lovely evening when the sun is still shining or the moon is bright you come within a distance of a few hundred yards into a mile per hour area although both stretches of road are lit all the way along <e> <s> there will be a lot of expense on local authorities rushing to change mile per hour signs to mile per hour signs <e> <s> they had better be forewarned about the cost of this clause <e>", "<cs> i should like fully to support my noble friends amendment dealing with these speed measuring devices <e> <s> the amazing thing about man is that he is a gullible creature <e> <s> murphys law tells us that nothing is foolproof because fools are so ingenious <e> <s> i am sure that many of us have had elementary dealings with electronics <e> <s> i knew an old

that millions of pounds are being made by men who know how to use computers and diddle the public <e> <s> let me explain a little bit about this <e> <s> as the rac and aa say there has been considerable controversy in recent months and years about the use of radar speed measuring devices because that is what they are <e> <s> during the committee stage in another place unfortunately an opposition amendment to require such devices to comply with a british standard and as my noble friend said to be approved by the home office was defeated on a division <e> <s> that was rather sad

growing interest of people of all opinions in the importance of these inland waterways particularly the severn area which is in a river basin at the corner of a great industrial area of britain <e>

definition of civil defence which she has now given that it may be a worthy thing whatever we think of war to pay a tribute to organisations like the st john ambulance brigade and to ask schools to

abroad when the debate took place but we heard from a couple of shipping magnates who spoke knowledgeably in this chamber from the other side of the house from where most of the magnates come anyway about this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when figures are given for waiting lists can the noble lord tell us whether outpatients are included who normally go for a check-up once every two three or six months <e> <s> are those people included in the waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and interesting debate and quite certainly the maiden speeches of the noble lord lord rootes and of the merchant adventurer the noble lord lord kindersley as well as the speech of the noble viscount lord chandos were and i hope that i do not sound pompus or condescending excellent contributions to this debate <e> <s> all the speeches were worth listening to and being looked into by the government <e> <s> undoubtedly over the gamut of the debate there is quite a lot of information for the government who are now in power to sift out useful topics <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord and i thank him for his reply but i asked a categorical question about the fair wages clause in the international labour office which is going to be discussed in september and are the government prepared to withdraw that fair wages clause and what attitude will they take <e> <s> if i cannot get an answer tonight then perhaps i can be answered later <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very clever but i am asking this <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that it is being discussed <e> <s> that was a

conservative or not in four or five years from now will have a vast expense on its shoulders because there has been a lack of constructive spending on necessary social things like sewers omitting such items as social security throughout the years <e> <s> this never seems to be taken into account <e> <s> somebody will have to meet that expense with a contingency fund or something from the centre if the government do not hand more democracy to local ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly as somebody with an interest in this i do not think the government have thought this out in depth both

education it is essential and i know this from people who have come to me only in the last year or so for the - to -year-olds to have some supplementary monetary support because many of the families cannot support the - to -year-olds in further education unless there are generous understanding grants made to them <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an opportunity for me to draw the attention of your

minutes to this very important little debate concerning sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> i find it interesting that the national farmers union in the brief that it has sent out to many of

interruption <e> <s> i have been putting a question all along but i will sit down now because the noble lord knows my intention <e>", "<cs> my lords relating to the original question may i ask the

argument on this which could go on for minutes but i think that i have spiked down the point <e> <s> will he bear this in mind because it is important to the rural areas of britain and to the seaside

expensive to put on to lorries compulsorily to prevent jack-knifing <e>", "<cs> my lords without trespassing on the patience of the house much longer may i ask whether the noble earl is aware that
