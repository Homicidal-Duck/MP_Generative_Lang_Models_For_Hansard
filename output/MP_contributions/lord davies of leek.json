["<cs> my lords since the period i have watched in the hill farming areas and everywhere else the strength of the marketing boards <e> <s> as was rightly said by the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood originally there was the impetus of the conservative party for these marketing boards <e> <s> that is why we appeal that lines to should be omitted <e> <s> common sense shows that all the machinery for consumer safeguards and for all the other safeguards is there <e> <s> i do not want to make a party-partisan speech but i really do feel that friedmanism has gone mad here <e> <s> friedmanism is setting fire to a first-class thing that has helped the prosperity of british agriculture <e> <s> on both sides of this noble house per cent <e> <s> of us are interested in the health of british agriculture <e> <s> therefore without repetition i beg the government to look carefully at the consensus of opinion in the farming fraternity in the business fraternity and on both sides of this noble house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this is a new policy being adopted by noble lords opposite <e> <s> because the great winston churchill said that no party should be held to anything stuck in a manifesto <e> <s> since when was that stuck in the manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try not to reiterate the points that have already been made <e> <s> noble lords have had a busy day and there is a busy week ahead <e> <s> consequently there would be no purpose in repeating the cogent arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> first of all may i say how grateful i am and we are to the noble lord lord seebohm for raising this matter <e> <s> the length of the speeches is incommensurate with the value of the speechesin other words the value of the speeches is much greater than their length <e> <s> as a matter of fact i want this debate to be an example of brevity but of common sense to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the minister says about giving out money at this time but may i ask him whether when the statistics were worked out the return on that money including the invisible return on it was taken into account <e> <s> is he aware that it is not just a question of giving money with no return <e>", "<cs> i should like to put a point to the minister <e> <s> in a very rural area a boy living in a remote farmhouse either in wales or on the edge of the pennine chain and i know of both cases may he sent to a school which is only half a mile or a mile away in another area <e> <s> on the other hand if he is sent to a school which falls within his county or division he may have to go three miles and be moved around <e> <s> i know that the government want to save money but at the same time i hope they do not destroy the educational purpose of british education <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that they will look at this amendment with favour because although a school may be in another educational area if a legitimate percentage of children from area x go to school in area y it would be worthwhile to have some kind of representation in area y i do not think that it would be a waste of time to offer that facility because it could improve the amenities and the understanding in the area of those living just over the border <e>", "<cs> having listened to the last summary i find the governments attitude prosaic and anachronistic <e> <s> driving up today and listening to my radio i heard that new impetus is being given to teaching this generation of children the art of electronics how to use computers buying computers for schools and working out what they will cost <e> <s> if anything needs to be known today by nations it is that they have to keep up with the new impetus in industry <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the interjection of the noble earl but if he read the amendment he would see that it does not just say three teachers it says the governing body <e> <s> the governing body of a school does not comprise just the teachers <e> <s> it was therefore the governing body of a county or voluntary school or of a special school maintained by a local education authority <e> <s> i simply cited the rural areas the comprehensives also have their problems <e> <s> however i do not want to delay the committee <e> <s> the vast experience of the noble lord lord heycock has been mentioned <e> <s> the noble baroness has pointed out the place where you can drive a gambo through she should know that a gambo is a welsh hay cart <e> <s> despite that the spirit of the committee will have effused or perhaps i should say suffused this committee <e> <s> consequently i believe that it would be wise at this moment to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble viscount has a point <e> <s> the committee have heard my point <e> <s> having heard both sides i do not think it is as important as i may have thought <e> <s> i shall reserve my powers for more powerful amendments <e> <s> in view of that i will willingly withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thought there was something funny about that <e> <s> let us go back <e> <s> i quoted correctly subsection <e> <s> now let us get to the subsection that i should be reading <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> but i am dominated by the logic of subsection <e> <s> that says <e>", "<cs> that is a very neat answer from the noble baroness and really it is only saying what i said that subsection could cover it <e> <s> i am willing to accept the spirit of the reply <e> <s> in view of that and at this late hour it would be cruel to go on any longer seeing <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness aware bless her heart that the whole of this debate has been pillars of cloud <e> <s> i have listened to what has been said and i have looked at what the bill says <e> <s> the clause heading is parental <e>", "<cs> i have now come to the conclusion that in the governments desire to get rapidly something different before both houses a bill has been badly drafted <e> <s> first we are overloaded with possibilities of appeal <e> <s> there is a bonanza of appeals which will make a bonanza for small-town solicitors and lawyers <e> <s> secondly where does the poor parent stand in the local areas some of which are remote <e> <s> how is this marvellous machine going to get cracking <e> <s> are we pushing pelion upon ossa or ossa under pelion <e> <s> there is no need at all for this elaborate system of appeal <e> <s> the parent has not been thought about in depth <e> <s> how much is it going to cost the parent to see that the son or the daughter gets justice <e> <s> after one appeal is made subsection amends paragraph of schedule to the tribunal and enquiries act of to place appeal committees under the supervision of the council on tribunals <e> <s> the council is concerned not with individual cases but with the general operation of the bodies under its supervision <e>", "<cs> i think this is very important <e> <s> something has been completely omitted <e> <s> i am only drawing attention to this because in the course of time something should be done <e>", "<cs> there is a point here <e> <s> the minister knows this full well <e> <s> the minister was correct in saying that under subsection <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is not wrong he is just at the wrong place <e> <s> if i may i shall say to him you are absolutely scintillatingwe are not discussing that at the moment but carry on <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point <e> <s> according to the department there are maths teachers needed now in science <e>", "<cs> it was meant in a helpful way <e>", "<cs> i could not let this clause pass without saying a few words <e> <s> most welsh people will be delighted to see this clause <e> <s> i shall be very brief only a minute or two and i am grateful to the government for the notes that have been provided <e> <s> the clause enables the secretary of state to pay grants in respect of expenditure in or in connection with the teaching of welsh or the teaching of subjects in welsh which is a further extension <e> <s> however there are points here that need explanation <e> <s> especially in view of the phrase and other persons in relation to teaching i can see that perhaps any person could get a grant under this clause <e> <s> i hope that it is made certain that any person receiving a grant has the qualification to teach the language <e> <s> there are too many people around who claim that they can do these things when in fact they cannot <e> <s> i hope that sufficient regard will be taken back home to ensure that the tutors or others taking on this teaching have the necessary ability <e>", "<cs> i am counting the timei always do <e> <s> before i sit down may i say without any joking that i <e>", "<cs> what about television <e>", "<cs> i very much regret that this bill has now taken out <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that in scotland under another fiddling act <e> <s> the driver of the bus is also responsible for the childs mother who may be carrying a bottle of whisky <e> <s> this is an absurd brief <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind how commodity prices move as well as the international game <e>", "<cs> that is elementarywe all know that <e>"]
