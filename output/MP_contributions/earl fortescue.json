["<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord walston for initiating this debate <e> <s> when i spoke on this subject last year i complained that there was little or no reference to pigs <e> <s> i am glad to say that that omission has now been rectified although so far no speaker has specifically mentioned that commodity <e> <s> however i would hope to return to the subject of pigs later <e>", "<cs> my lords if in the event the british army does get some of these tanks can my noble friend give an assurance that it will not delay the introduction of the successor to the chieftain <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitated before adding my name to the list of speakers to this very valuable debate because i served in a reserve force for only a few years <e> <s> that was a long time ago and that particular reserve an air force one has long since been disbanded for the reasons which my noble friend lord glenarthur mentioned earlier <e> <s> however i should like to make one point and offer one suggestion <e> <s> first the point i was recently fortunate enough to go to germany with a parliamentary party to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the last costing published by the meat and livestock commission shows that all types of pig production are still running at a loss <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that further answer may i ask him whether the government are still pressing for a change in the method of calculating the pig mcas <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike earlier speakers i would question whether paragraphs to are strict enough and whether such regulations can be properly enforced to prevent abuses of the custom of arranged marriages <e> <s> before i go into detail i should perhaps say that have no objection whatever to the custom of arranged marriages <e> <s> it is the abuse of the custom to enable people to gain admission to this country which concerns me <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> may i say that i was fortunte enough to be in rhodesia as an observer and what the noble lord has said was not and i repeat not the impression that we had <e> <s> the noble lord has been speaking for minutes and i would suggest that he has been speaking with very little relevance to the question which he put down <e> <s> the question reads <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with others in thanking my noble friend lord campbell of croy for giving us this opportunity to speak on the post office <e> <s> i should like to speak briefly on one aspect only that of the telephone service <e> <s> i myself do not use the telephone unless i have to and then only briefly <e> <s> however i have a wife and three daughters at home and i find that the telephone bill is one of the largest i pay and certainly the one i most resent having to pay <e> <s> i suspect that the british system involves more wasted time and frustration than any other modern system in north america or western europe <e> <s> wrong numbers particularly irritate me <e> <s> not only do they waste time but one is having to pay for unwanted calls <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting late <e> <s> i intended to speak on two main points and my noble friend lord gisborough has already covered the first one namely chemical and biological warfare <e> <s> i shall not say a lot on that beyond the fact that i entirely agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord knows more about this subject than i do <e> <s> but it strikes me that if the russians breach any agreement there is no reason why we should not do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he agrees that the monitoring force made a major contribution towards the great success achieved by the leader of the house in his capacity as governor <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the opening speech by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i had intended to delete my name from the list of speakers <e> <s> as i understood it in his opening speech he stressed that part i of this bill and clause in particular were of a strictly temporary nature <e> <s> however when the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones spoke concerning clause i understood him to use this occasion to advocate the permanent removal of a courts power to imprison fine defaulters <e>", "<cs> i was speaking on the subject of fine defaulters my lords <e> <s> there remains a hard core of such offenders who can pay but will not do so until the eventual threat arises of immediate imprisonment <e> <s> many of them at that moment then pay when they are arrested while others pay within a few hours of arrival in prison <e> <s> it is only a very small minority who serve their full prison sentences <e> <s> fine arrears run into several millions of pounds and without this final sanction of imprisonment for default i am convinced that the number of defaulters and the fines outstanding will become even <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome part iv of this bill and agree with most of it <e> <s> i speak as a magistrate and i know that the magistrates association agrees with most of what i have to say on part iv <e> <s> my first point concerns the proposed totting-up procedure contained in clause and schedule of the bill <e> <s> other speakers have already touched on this new procedure and i should like to go into it in a little more detail <e> <s> this is intended to be fairer and more finely tuned than the present totting up procedure and i think that would certainly be so if courts had some discretion as to the number of points to be awarded for the more serious offences <e> <s> the gravity of such cases can and does vary enormously <e>", "<cs> i would also like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> it is considerably more severe than the present totting up procedure and to my way of thinking far too severe <e> <s> at present if a driver commits a number of endorsable offences as part of one incident for totting up purposes all those offences only count as one endorsement <e> <s> under this amendment no <e> <s> a which i only saw this afternoon each endorsable offence which is part of one incident would count and all the points for those offences in the one incident would be added together <e> <s> for this reason it might well be that because of one incident the driver would be either disqualified under the new totting up procedure or he would be within a point or two of being so disqualified <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment and in doing so i want also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe that the two offences of careless driving and driving while uninsured are peculiar in that the gravity of individual cases varies so much <e> <s> on second reading i gave examples of how such offences can vary and i shall not weary your lordships by repeating them again today <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i have in fact already spoken to it on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the worst type of case of driving uninsured involves a youth or very young man driving a very fast sports car <e> <s> he deliberately drives without insurance because it might cost him several hundred pounds to get the necessary cover <e> <s> at the other end of the scale is the person who has driven for many years and has been insured with the same company <e> <s> the company might fail to send him a reminder or the man might be away from home when it is sent <e> <s> so the insurance lapses for a few days or possibly even a week or two without his being aware of it and he then has an accident <e> <s> in such circumstances the offence of driving uninsured is comparatively minor and in many instances of that kind the client would be looked after by the insurance company <e> <s> he might well be charged with driving uninsured since he is technically uninsured but the insurance company will stand the loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment which seeks to give courts some discretion as to the number of penalty points that they can impose for the offence of driving uninsured <e> <s> in my own experience which is limited to one court and that not a very large one the penalties for this <e>", "<cs> i speak only as an individual magistrate in this matter and i do not feel very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my gratitude to my noble friend lord renton for initiating this debate which has produced some very fine speeches and in particular the maiden speech made by the noble and learned lord lord lane which could not have failed to impress anyone who listened to it <e> <s> in view of the number of speakers and the late hour i will confine my remarks to two points which i hope may help the police in fighting crime and improving upon the present low detection rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest in that i am an external member of lloyds and in i was what my noble friend lord strathcona called one of the blackmailers in the sasse syndicate <e> <s> however i will try to show later that he is wrong in that description <e>", "<cs> whatever one calls it a curfew condition would be most useful and particularly valuable in rural areas where there is a shortage of attendance centres <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend the minister whether it would be possible to make a curfew condition as part of a probation order or only in the case of a supervision order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very briefly in favour of this amendment <e> <s> i believe that it would provide a very useful non-custodial sentence which might be used on many children and many families but by no means all <e> <s> it will be particularly useful in rural areas where no attendance centres are available <e> <s> i would stress that obviously it will not be the right sentence for all children and all families <e> <s> the courts will get reports on the children their families and their background before they decide on such a sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak against the amendment <e> <s> i know that the magistrates association is against the proposal for several reasons <e> <s> first it would drastically reduce the sentencing power of magistrates courts to i should like to say a ridiculously low level <e> <s> the maximum sentence of imprisonment available to a magistrates court at the moment is six months <e> <s> if you deduct one-third of that for the automatic one-third remission and then this proposal would knock off another two months the maximum term of custody that a magistrates court would be able to impose would be a net two months <e>", "<cs> my lords they have come out officially against it <e>", "<cs> my lords in my experience a lot of court time is wasted in dealing with fine defaulters <e> <s> unfortunately i am not too well acquainted with the details of the attachment of earnings act <e> <s> if a man is brought before the court for failing to pay a fine and he is in employment by far the easiest way of getting that fine paid is to make an attachment of earnings order <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would be good enough to give way <e> <s> the offences which he has mentioned including careless driving and no insurance are not offences which carry a fixed penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the problem outlined by the noble baroness does not apply in oxfordshire which is the only county about which i am in a position to speak <e> <s> any reasonable request from the magistrates courts committee in that county is almost always agreed to by the county council <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a member of the select committee and i entirely agree with its conclusions as i also agree with what the noble lord lord foot and the noble earl <e> <s> lord listowel said today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak on one aspect only that is chemical warfare <e> <s> this subject has already been touched on by several other noble lords <e> <s> chemicals are covered by only one paragraph in the white paper and one paragraph in its annex <e> <s> a similar american government publication entitled <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down i wonder whether he could explain one point to me <e> <s> in view of amendment no <e> <s> will a plain clothes police officer be in a position to search an unattended vehicle <e> <s> it seems that a dangerous situation will arise if an officer in plain clothes is allowed to carry out such a search <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief as a number of the points that i had intended to make have already been made surprisingly many of them by the noble lord lord obrien whose career has been so very different from and so much more distinguished than my own <e> <s> may i be forgiven if it appears sentimental but i feel that a matter of national pride is involved here <e> <s> the note is more than just a piece of paper <e> <s> as the noble lord lord obrien pointed out on the note is written <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord reay for initiating a debate on a subject which is little discussed and about which many people know so little that they do not realise its importance <e> <s> chemical weapons and nerve agents are arguably as awful as nuclear weapons <e> <s> i offer no apology for repeating much of what i have said over the past three years as i feel more strongly than ever on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord mayhew allow me to say that the figure of tonnes was the figure given in last years defence white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate will be lengthy and there are many speakers <e> <s> i shall confine myself to four points only <e> <s> my first point concerns chemical warfare <e> <s> i have stressed my concern for the past four years about natos virtual absence of such a chemical deterrent against the huge russian chemical capability and the consequent lowering of the nuclear threshold as a result <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord boston i am delighted that this white paper gives chemical warfare the prominence that it deserves <e> <s> since the white paper was published i <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the government on this years white paper <e> <s> which is comprehensive and clearly set out <e> <s> i should like to speak on two aspects only first chemical warfare and secondly natos relationship with the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for explaining the order to us although i cannot entirely agree with it <e> <s> i agree with almost everything which the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> it is a pity that the order has been put through at such short notice in such a piecemeal way <e> <s> as regards the number of points for each offence i do not think one need worry at all about the maximum either as the points stand now or as proposed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will give way for a moment <e> <s> i had some experience of dentistry today and there was no horse and cart no extraction and none of the horribleness mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief particularly as most of what i have to say has already been said <e> <s> this debate certainly comes at a time following great change in europe <e> <s> i was surprised that some noble lords particularly earlier in the debate reproached the government for not foreseeing these changes and for not having made savings in our defence expenditure already <e> <s> other noble lords including myself believe that it would be a great mistake to take any major steps even now in the way of disarming unilaterally <e>"]
