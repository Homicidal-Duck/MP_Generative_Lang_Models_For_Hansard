rights which came earlier <e>", "<cs> my noble friend does not need refreshing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his lucid explanation of this highly technical matter and i am sure that we are all the better for having heard it <e> <s> it has the quality of being non-controversial perhaps in part because it is so highly technical <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said the bill is based on a report from the law commission which in turn acted upon a recommendation that was made jointly by the law reform committees of the bar council and the law society which in made representations to the lord chancellor for the reform of aspects of the law relating to charging orders <e> <s> therefore the house will see that the legal profession is interested in law reform <e> <s> in the bad old days it used to be said that it was no more likely to see lawyers urging law reform than tigers urging reform of the jungle <e> <s> that has been a wholly unwarranted observation at least in recent times as the activities of the law reform committees of the profession are showing <e>", "<cs> i ventured to say that there would not be a companies bill before us now were it not for the second directive <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is proper for me to do so i should like to make a few observations following the helpful statement if he will permit me to say so of the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> we are grateful to him for indicating how the government propose <e>", "<cs> that seems to me with respect to be a reasonable suggestion <e> <s> i can understand the desire of the government to avoid proceedings by way of indictment in regard to offences carrying penal penalties and in view of the assurance of the noble lord perhaps we can return to this matter when we see the colour of their amendment in the fullness of time <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord lord mottistone that i do not feel at all petulant <e> <s> i submit that what we have put forward here is so much in keeping with what responsible directors agree with anyway that i find it surprising that it is not acceptable to the government <e> <s> i have risen merely to affirm my view that subsection of amendment no <e> <s> should stand because in a sense it is protective of adventurous litigation by the barrack room lawyer who may think he can found a cause of action on the alleged breach of duty here <e> <s> therefore i would adhere to it and i should have thought it was a sign of grace on the part of this allegedly petulant spokesman that we are prepared to go so far on the road to reasonable compromise and i hope the committee will approve the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is understood <e>", "<cs> before we part with clauses and may i make a completely non-controversial observation namely to express my gratitude to the government that they have recognised the existence of the language of heaven the welsh language <e> <s> i was hoping we might hear the noble viscount lord trenchard or his noble colleague reading out the equivalent in welsh of public limited companybut for the record may i read it out myself <e>", "<cs> my lords the man himself the noble and learned lord lord pearson is here <e>", "<cs> my lords have there ever been any prosecutions in regard to those matters <e> <s> the statement of the law is correct but one does not hear of frequent prosecutions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a particularly happy task to be a principal mourner and this seems to he my role today hut i shall resist the welsh temptation to linger long at the graveside of the welsh act which we are finally burying today <e> <s> although lloyd george described the welsh as a nation of quarrelsome nightingales i think that one of the qualities that the welsh people have is that they do not nurse grievances and i certainly do not do so now <e> <s> i believe that the devolution debates at least showed that there is a welsh element in united kingdom politics which i believe it would be folly to ignore <e> <s> although the attempt to cater for it in the wales act failed the aim to increase democratic control over the machinery of government in wales was not an unworthy one <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord belstead has recognised this in what he has just said <e> <s> the need for increased democratic control i believe remains <e> <s> similarly there is a need to make the several nominated bodies in wales and there is a whole plethora of them more accountable and more democratic <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be possible for the noble lord to say if the select committee will sit in wales from time to time and have public deliberations if that is the right word <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords should not a distinction be made between peaceful law-abiding marches which have been a feature of our democratic practices through the ages

introducing this bill so enabling the house to consider whether the present provisions of the criminal justice act governing restrictions on the reporting of committal proceedings are working in the best interests and he used the attractive phrase of the act of the ends of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord help us as to whether my noble and learned friend lord gardiners pessimistic estimate that the report to coin an ancient phrase would be a matter more of years than of weeks is an accurate one or has he some more hopeful message that we may look forward to an earlier report <e> <s> because that would certainly influence my view on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to agree with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that the amendment is indeed drafting and technical <e> <s> the degree of detail and elaboration involved in dealing with the presumably exceptional case of successive thefts not only of the same object but from the same person must be piling

difficulty <e> <s> we have sympathy with him and he must not worry about the fact that he is not quite as consistently articulate as we normally have the pleasure of enjoying him <e>", "<cs> i cannot

inclination is to consider very carefully indeed their conclusions and unless there seems to be some good reason to the contrary on the whole to accept them <e> <s> there is after all as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said a fairly elaborate process of consultation and discussion with interested parties <e> <s> when one looks at one of the annexes to this report there is an impressive list of those who were consulted those with interests which might be affected and i am inclined to the view although i would not go the stake for it that probably the bill is right as it stands <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> why does he not pay up if he feels so virtuously about it <e> <s> there is nothing to stop him <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say i have a degree of sympathy with the approach of my noble friend lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> the questions that the noble and learned lord has addressed to me namely whether the labour party is fully in support of the amendment of my noble friend lord mishcon rather reminds me of serjeant sullivans famous answer when there was a great argument in the court about the <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether that brilliant piece of intervention is the product of the home office mind or what the lord chancellors department is pleased to call its mind <e>", "<cs> my lords happily i am not colour-blind <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for tabling these amendments <e> <s> they make the penalties realistic and more fitting to the offending conduct complained of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend who has the benefit of being a member of that great establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell having more than once assured the house that these amendments are drafting he does not need to repeat the assurance too frequently <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments flow from the acceptance by the government of the oppositions proposal that a number of the provisions included in the labour governments companies bill should be included in this bill <e> <s> unhappily we were only able to persuade the government on three items in the labour bill if i may call it that for short and some of the more important items in the labour bill they have presistently refused to embody in this such as insider dealing loans to directors and many other matters that are notoriously needing urgent attention <e> <s> but i shall not repeat that argument <e> <s> however it will be repeated most vigorously i am quite sure in another place when it comes along particularly at a time when i understand her majestys government are contemplating highly controversial legislation in the field of industrial relations <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the amendment is an improvement to the clause as originally drafted and i say the same perhaps it is a little out of order but it will save time about amendments nos <e> <s> and which will follow in respect of the same clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the view that has been expressed but it is most laudable of the noble earl lord lauderdale and i hope i do not get too confused by those two conceptions to express the need to emphasise energy conservation <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am inclined to agree with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that a great deal needs to be done in many companies affairs where the saving in energy conservation is thought to be fairly minimal compared with major operative costs of a companys activities <e> <s> for that reason very often that factor is not sufficiently taken into account <e> <s> i think there is need for a great deal more energy if the government do not mind my saying so on their part in emphasizing the crucial role that conservation should play in respect to our fuel problems at the present time <e> <s> therefore it is excellent that they should be prodded i was about to use an unhappy phrase from behind shall i say <e> <s> in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened with great attention to the speech of the noble lord lord hartwell <e> <s> while noble lords will appreciate the fact that he has come to make his statement i doubt whether they will have appreciated his attack first of all upon the motivation of the noble and learned lord lord wigoder suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to cross-examine the noble lord in the house <e> <s> it is always a painful thing to have to undertake but i still have not learned whether or not he thought that it was a contingent payment <e> <s> however the house will have heard what the noble lord said and no doubt in due course we shall hear some comment from the director of public prosecutions about this statement that apparently he or someone in his department gave a fair wind to what was afoot <e> <s> that is indeed a very remarkable state of affairs about which it may well be that we shall hear more in due course <e> <s> i make no further comment about it than that <e> <s> but at the end of the day i think that the public of our country have a deep sense of unease about what has been done not only in this matter but in the other instances to which the noble lord lord wigoder referred <e> <s> i think that this is a very serious matter which needs our careful concern <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene in order to explain one matter in this connection which i should have made clear namely there was no evidence in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be prudent to follow the advice of several of the noble and learned lords who made the speeches in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the views expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> i note his use of the word insidious <e> <s> i do not think anyone has suggested that the correspondence between him and the law society could even be capable of being suspected of being insidious <e> <s> however his assurance will clear the air and i entirely agree with the course that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have nothing to add <e> <s> i merely wish the bill which is of a highly technical but valuably reformist character a fair wind on the rest of its course <e>", "<cs> my lords while this is not the moment perhaps to seek the division of the house on this matter nevertheless i must repeat the complaint that was made from this side of the house about the total inadequacy of this bill which purports to be a bill to deal with the reform of the company law <e> <s> at committee stage we on this side sought in vain to use this opportunity for parliament to deal with some of the outstanding defects in the present state of the company law defects which are notorious like insider dealing like loans to company directors like the failure to accept that a duty should be placed upon directors to protect and look after the interests of employees <e> <s> all those suggestions were rejected <e> <s> i think her majestys government are going to pay a high price for the failure to act at this stage bearing in mind some legislation which will not be regarded by employees as being favourable to them on the contrary <e> <s> so while i am not proposing to seek the division of the house on this matter i think i would be neglecting my duty to my colleagues on this side if we did not continue to register our protest about the inadequacy of the bill grateful as we were for the three small morsels that were given to us during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say how much money there is in this fascinating kitty <e>", "<cs> my lords not having had the advantage of seeing that private correspondence with my noble friend and being a little in the dark about this matter may i ask whether broadly speaking this is a piece of benevolent retrospection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the foreign secretary whether it will be convenient for him to place a copy of the constitutional proposals in the library <e> <s> and may i having myself <e>", "<cs> would not a little modesty now be more prudent my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the traditional ragbag of measures for law reform of which the ministers concerned have taken full advantage and have put into it everything they possibly can <e> <s> it is uncontroversial and i can only hope that it will be of benefit to the people of scotland <e>", "<cs> having myself engaged in this fascinating patter on many occasions i congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on the speed with which he has accomplished reading out the incomprehensible and doing it so felicitously <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor described the bill as highly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes i wonder whether he can respond to the suggestions of the noble lord lord goodman and my noble and learned friend lord gardiner about the desirability of further consultations with people in the press council and with the persons who were mentioned by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i am sorry to burden him further and i am grateful to him for having covered so much ground <e>", "<cs> my lords may i welcome what the noble lord the foreign secretary has said and ask him to clarify the position as i understand it <e> <s> is it that the arrangements about a ceasefire are a pre-condition to the sending of the governor to salisbury and the return to a state of legality <e> <s> that is the first question that i wanted to ask and i think it is implicit in what the noble lord has just said that that is so <e> <s> but i want a little clarification on that if he will he kind enough to give it <e> <s> secondly will he give an assurance that when the relevant orders are brought before parliament they will be made subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> thirdly will opportunity be given for parliament to consider the constitutional proposals <e> <s> that is a little obscure at the moment <e> <s> i imagine that that will be so but it will be as well to get an assurance to that effect <e> <s> if i may say so the summary is a helpful one <e> <s> it has in fact been in the library only since a week today but that is a point of detail and is of no great importance <e> <s> but if the noble lord will give that assurance i think it will be very <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the bill itself will take the ordinary course of second reading committee stage report third reading and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will wish me to congratulate the noble lord lord wade first on his devotion to human rights which i think we all share but secondly on his persistence in his campaign in respect of incorporating the convention into our law <e> <s> i have forgotten whether it was the bellman in <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the committee under this administration also will be watchful to see that any proposals that come forward that are in derogation or contrary to the provisions of the european convention do not go through the watchful eyes of the legislation committee and i can recollect many occasions when that happened in my experience <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene is he saying that we are now enjoying the privilege of an elective dictatorship <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house has deplored the transfer of lancaster house arguments to this chamber but pray whose fault is that <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not say whether the noble lord deserves to be complimented or not <e> <s> it was a speech which was delivered with more vigour than enlightenment <e> <s> but let us not exchange discourtesies for a moment <e> <s> when the noble lords attention was temporarily distracted by compliments i was venturing to deal with his complaint about the transfer of lancaster house arguments to this chamber <e> <s> whose fault is that <e> <s> i think it is deplorable that in the middle of the most delicate and difficult negotiations this procedure has been necessary in parliament for the reason that the bill has been brought before parliament <e> <s> as my noble friends have said it should have been brought forward at the end of negotiations and when as we hope a settlement has been accomplished <e> <s> it would have gone through rapidly there would have been no difficulty from this side of the house <e> <s> we have sought to sustain the government in their attempts at a settlement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord having given the assurance that i asked for i do not press the amendment but beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i have no objection <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord can tell me whether in regard to the other constitutions which he has mentioned there were equivalent not the same of course or similar transitional provisions <e> <s> i am not aware of any but his knowledge may be better than my memory <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord was calling precedents in aid <e> <s> it is a good legal technique i have done it myself from time to time <e> <s> it is the bread and butter of the legal profession <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was showing a remarkable skill and now he resiles from it <e> <s> he had better forget that part of his argument i think <e>", "<cs> i am quite content that that should be done <e> <s> i was not absolutely sure what the full purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> i am very gratified with that assurance <e> <s> it was indeed implied if not expressly stated earlier in the speech of the noble lord but i just wanted it clearly on the record <e> <s> the noble lord has brought that into discussion but of course we shall not reach it for the purpose of the amendments being proposed until after the noble lord lord gridley has moved his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask two short questions <e> <s> first has consideration been given to the question whether the new rules are in compliance with the provisions of the european convention of human rights and in particular articles and <e> <s> i do not expect the noble lord to have those immediately in his mind <e> <s> perhaps we can be informed in due course whether that question has been examined and what conclusion has been reached because i greatly fear that the government and this country may be in grave difficulty under the terms of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that i enter the field of scottish legal practice with apprehension and i do so only because of the unavoidable absence of my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey who authorises me to say that he accepts constitutional responsibility for what occurred on the fateful date rd may of this year <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has indicated his willingness to accept responsibility for the circular but will he give consideration to its final paragraph

"<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> but learning very fast if i may say so for the statement which he has made in relation to the protection of official information bill <e> <s> there will i think be great satisfaction and not only on this side of the house that the government have taken on board the general view that the bill

on their late conversion to wisdom and their decision not to proceed with the bill <e>", "<cs> i have received the lord chancellors letter and of course we shall be giving further consideration to it

accept the assurance of the noble and learned lord that these are mere technicalities <e> <s> like so many technicalities they appear to be quite incomprehensible but i am sure noble lords will accept the assurance of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene merely to say first how valuable it is that the work of consolidation is being continued at such a rapid pace and secondly to congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on his gymnastic performance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord morris spoke to me about these amendments and i think that he ought to be congratulated upon his courage in plunging into the definitions field in the formalities of the bill <e> <s> what he proposes seems to me to make good sense and to add brevity and clarity to the bill both most valuable virtues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has been wise to be both prudent and tentative in this matter <e> <s> when i attended the council of europe recently

petition to the court of human rights from a prisoner i agree on a rather different matter but as this review and examination is now taking place into the limited field with which this case is

amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe i am right in thinking that this is one of the parts of the bill which are going to be permanent is it not <e> <s> therefore it is a matter of some significance more so

sympathy with what has been said by the two noble and learned lords who have just spoken <e> <s> i do not know what the additional cost on top of the court fees would be but it would probably be a matter of a few pence <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that broadly speaking the court fees cover the cost of the court expenses involved in the litigation <e> <s> i cannot swear to that but i rather think that they do <e> <s> therefore there would be no trouble for the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in cabinet on this point if he were to give way for i do not think that it

number of cases and would be a convenient way of solving this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord foot on his ingenious suggestion as to how to get over at any rate for the time being the financial difficulties that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has mentioned and with which i am very familiar in regard to the cost of legal aid <e> <s> with regard to the merits of the situation that calls for legal aid for a person who cannot himself afford the cost of going to the crown court i would point out that the person concerned is in custody from the magistrates court having twice tried to get bail from that court <e> <s> in the face of that it seems just that he be given an opportunity to have recourse to a higher court <e> <s> if there is justice and fairness in that in relation to procedures that are available in courts of higher jurisdiction then the suggestion that we are considering if it could be afforded would seem to be very meritorious <e> <s> while i am reluctant to add to the statute book a number of provisions which can come into effect at some indefinite future time i would hope that in the special circumstances with which we are faced only temporarily i hope of having to restrict expenditure considerably the suggestion of the noble lord lord foot will receive sympathy and support from the lord chancellor <e>",

noble and learned lord for having met the point that i raised at an earlier stage of the consideration of this bill with strong representations from the law society that it should be done <e> <s> the

it is right that ultimate control should remain in the court and i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for the care that has been given to the point that has been raised and for the way in

the recommendations of the home office working party during its inquiry into the sus law <e> <s> sir david i am reliably informed listed a number of specific proposals by the home office working party

in the commons amendment was approved by many speakers in your lordships house when we discussed the matter <e> <s> the view that i came to was that in the field of contempt of court where the law despite the clarity now given to it by this bill will not be straightforward what we are concerned with is essentially the public interest in the integrity of the administration of justice and on the other side proper facilities for freedom of the press <e> <s> in these circumstances the intervention of the attorney-general who is essentially the protector of the publics interests seemed to me after giving further thought to the matter to be the right course <e> <s> there are no political implications in my change of mind but i believe that the public interest is best served by this additional protection against frivolous oppressive and certainly vexatious preceedings in the field of contempt <e> <s> therefore we on this side of your lordships house agree with the commons in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with both the commons amendment and with what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has just said <e> <s> a provision which extended the law of contempt to the proceedings of all inferior courts tribunals and bodies however described and whenever established when it was impossible for those advising the noble and learned lord to identify them would

the lord chancellor will heed that advice and request <e> <s> i have previously addressed your lordships on this issue in support of my noble friend lord hutchinson <e> <s> it seems to me that

struck by an unusual mood of reticence <e> <s> but the reason for my decision and it may well be the reason for the decision of the noble lord lord aylestone was that certainly we on this side of the committee thought it was right and fitting that the initial discussion of this crucial clause in the bill should be in the hands of the bench of bishops speaking as they do in a very ecumenical mood and situation on behalf of all the christian churches in this country <e>", "<cs> it would seem that it is not merely any home office designation that has made this matter circular <e> <s> if one

amendment <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that that message would be a very depressing one to be heard in all the dependent territories <e> <s> i hope it will not become too widely known <e> <s> what is disturbing is that the noble lord the minister did not say whether there had been consultation with the government of hong kong or the other territories <e>", "<cs> it seems to have been the dialogue of the deaf so far as the communications that i have had from hong kong are concerned but i will ask leave to withdraw the amendment with the undertaking and the threat if that is the right word that i will return to it again in some form or another at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to give a provisional view of the outcome of the considerable consultations which have been taking place about the right of procession one of the particular matters in the report which led to the setting up of the appropriate committee <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible that their lordships in the appellate committee may not be in quite the same difficulty as the master of the rolls <e>", "<cs> he would say im going home again <e>", "<cs> we are sleeping like babes <e>", "<cs> i make no apology whatsoever for having moved this amendment <e> <s> the principal purpose was to achieve what at any rate the debate has achieved in rather more moderate terms than have been heard from noble and learned lords the allaying of the fears of in particular the minority people over the potential effect of the creation of a whole new conception of british citizenship and attendant rights <e> <s> this anxiety is very real and i hope that due publicity will now be given to what the noble lord lord belstead has said which is more constructive than the mere mockery that we have had from certain quarters about the raising of the serious question of the statement of the rights of the subject in this country <e>", "<cs> i have been interested also in the situation where after the matter has been referred to this committee new facts have come into the possession of the secretary of state which were not available to the committee <e> <s> i can quite see the force of the argument where the new facts might be beneficial to the applicant and might therefore result in the secretary of state in the light of the new evidence reversing the earlier decision to deprive him of citizenship but what if the later factual information was adverse in the face of a decision of the committee that he was not to be deprived of citizenship <e> <s> would there then be a fresh hearing <e> <s> i imagine that there ought to be because presumably the applicant would be entitled to be heard on the fresh facts <e> <s> i do not wish to push that too far but an interesting problem has been created by what on the face of it looks to be if i may say so a very powerful argument by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> in view of the advice given by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate about the procedural matters which i raised and which are not unimportant i apprehend that these problems could be dealt with in the rules of procedure which are to be introduced for the benefit of the committee <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how delighted we are on this side of the committee to hear of the intention of the noble viscount to persist with this matter <e> <s> this is absolutely crucial <e> <s> he has spoken as the considerable common lawyer that he is <e> <s> i am delighted to hear him and we shall support him in his endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the tribute that he has rightly paid to the noble and

learned lord has spoken would seem to be helpful and practicable and what finally fell from the lips of the lord chancellor will i am sure give satisfaction to solicitors in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i respectfully agree <e>", "<cs> my lords those who are dealing with these matters were with respect well advised to accept the advice of the noble and learned lord lord diplock who is probably the finest world authority on charter parties and kindred matters and i would certainly not quarrel with him or indeed with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether the big fish referred to will be very pleased with these amendments but it seems equitable that they too should be caught in the net <e>", "<cs> my lords seldom can such a proposal have been moved from the woolsack with such total lack of conviction and enthusiasm <e> <s> i have little doubt that had we enough time and the matter was of sufficient significance we might invite parliament

you may think of as a technical point is a point of principle which has been discovered by the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords to save the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor from utter exhaustion would it not be possible to move those amendments which are merely consequential together under the rubric of merely consequential amendments <e> <s> we would not seek to invite the noble and learned lord to put each one to us <e>", "<cs> i was tempted to intervene to make the point the noble lord lord rawlinson has just made in the light of what was said by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but perhaps as i see eagerness to deal with the statement it would be appropriate for us to deal with that matter when i move my amendment <e> <s> as to what has been said on the amendment moved by the noble lord viscount colville he will no doubt give his decision upon the matter <e> <s> i confess that we found somewhat disappointing the words of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in his response and in view of the great importance of this i wondered whether it would be possible before the actual day of the report stage if we could get some indication from the government by correspondence if possible as to what they have in mind <e> <s> because clearly this is going to the root of much of the anxiety that has been created by the bill namely the apparent rightlessness and parlous situation of people whose rights may be very seriously and adversely affected <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be the moment for us to come to a decision about this matter <e> <s> i regard it as quite fundamental <e> <s> what may have happened in the history of the bill is that subsection came in late in the consideration of the matter <e> <s> it was accepted by the government as of fundamental importance but of course they did not marry it with subsection <e> <s> on the contrary as the noble viscount lord colville has said and he attached most valuable weight to the juxtaposition element here and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter sought an answer from the noble and learned lord about the situation where an applicant claims to have evidence of discrimination

course it does <e> <s> if the circumstances justify the proceedings he ought to have a right to proceed <e> <s> accordingly i think that this matter ought to be tested <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the experience of community policing introduced by the splendid chief constable of devon and cornwall already shown provably that improvement in the various ways that he has introduced there cannot only improve relations between the public and the police but can actually reduce the incidence of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible to get some publicity for what is going on at this endless conference which i am sure we must keep going <e> <s> the public and the rest of us really do not know what issues are emerging and what is being debated <e> <s> the energy of my noble friend lord brockway lifts the curtain of ignorance from time to time but cannot something be done to publicise what the issues are <e> <s> they are obviously crucial issues and <e>", "<cs> my lords in serious cases does the director of public prosecutions advise prosecutors to release to the defence statements not tendered at committal by the prosecution but which may be of assistance in the conduct of the

maintain the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say thank you for the decision of the government and indeed for this particular amendment relating to the provisions of subsection which are a classic example of the bestowal of an entitlement <e> <s> it would have been extremely unsatisfactory for that to have been in some way restricted by the possible intervention of the secretary of state in circumstances where the factual situation of the individual case would merit examination by the court <e> <s> i confess that it might well be that in the course of my activities as attorney-general and lord chancellor i too have perpetrated the inclusion of words such as <e>", "<cs> oh no <e>", "<cs> my lords i had fully intended to support the noble lord lord campbell of croy on this amendment until he perpetrated the extraordinary observation that there were more gaelic speakers abroad than welsh speakers <e> <s> there are thousands of welshmen abroad who speak welsh

about publicity on this important aspect of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in some respects it would have been convenient if we could have discussed amendment no <e> <s> before this one because i confess that our inclination on this side of the house would be if i may coin a phrase to go the whole hog <e> <s> that is not always a wise expression to utter in this noble house but at present it is quite safe to do so <e> <s> it is a joke which has been made many times before <e> <s> we on this side of the house welcome this concession by the government so far as it goes following the representations of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and my noble friend lord pitt <e> <s> so without prejudice to what may be considered regarding the next amendment may i express the hope that in administering the provisions of the new amendment the home office will take a broad and sympathetic view of what constitute special circumstances and what cases are hard cases <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i wonder whether i could make a suggestion <e> <s> there does not seem to be any lack of goodwill regarding this matter but we are in a position of some confusion i certainly am about these

the words in subsection a which come after but on the fourth line to commencement <e> <s> that seems to be the area which is causing the difficulty <e> <s> we still have third reading and the passing stage of the bill <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if we had to have a division on this matter because it may be capable of remedy at least to the point of clarification <e> <s> i wonder whether i am asking too much <e> <s> i know that one likes to get points finalised at report stage but i think there is room for review of the words in this section to meet the point which my noble friend has made <e> <s> if that undertaking were given i am sure that my noble friend would not press the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords we are quite happy to approve these amendments which we have come to know on this side of the house as the gifford amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions of this bill have clearly caused a sense of anxiety and insecurity <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulties that the noble lord has mentioned do undoubtedly exist but they should have been thought about before this bill was brought before the house in my submission <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the citizens in the dependent territories would much rather still be classified as citizens of the united kingdom and colonies of course they would but the government have got rid of that concept <e> <s> that legal status does not exist any more <e> <s> if i may say so they are being reduced to this composite citizenship which the noble lord described which is to be common for all or so of these territories highly different in their history their constitutions and their power of self-government <e> <s> they are all to be included in this wide and i still submit meaningless embrace carrying no specific rights <e> <s> there is this reassurance which is good as far as it goes that they have promised apparently in the consultations that have been taking place with the governments that their immigration rules will provide for the people of those separate territories a right of abode <e> <s> i should be interested to know what is involved and what was said and whether those who have no right of abode elsewhere will be covered <e> <s> does that mean that all these separate arrangements will make it certain that there will be no statelessness resulting from this action <e> <s> we should very much like to know <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the words of admonition which the noble and learned lord addressed towards me when he was in this place <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house welcome this amendment which has been so persuasively moved by the noble lord lord geddes and whose significance in regard to hong kong with which he is more familiar than any of us he has underlined <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment would simply affirm an undeniable fact namely that all the various categories of britishness or if that sounds too pompous being british in this bill being a british citizen a citizen of the british dependent territories or a british overseas citizen have at least one thing in common <e> <s> they all denote persons who hold british nationality in some degree or other and this conclusion is indeed reflected in legislation to which the bill itself refers in schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of those assurances i would be surprised if my noble friend were not disposed to accept that advice <e> <s> one hopes that in some way the assurances and undertakings given by ministers in this house on these matters will somehow be communicated to those upon whom the duty of enforcing the law will lie <e> <s> whether there is any means of achieving that i do not know <e> <s> it is important that this at any rate is on the record <e> <s> the specific case which my noble friend has given may be of valuable guidance to those in whose power the immediate at any rate application of the law applies although i do appreciate the protections given in clause over and above the decision of the immigration officer concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to noble lords on this side of the house to be a modest but nevertheless useful limitation on the unfettered exercise of discretion by a secretary of state <e> <s> the noble viscount lord colville with his customary clarity explained its purpose but it may be useful repeating something of what he said for me to point out that the right of appeal that is given is extremely limited <e> <s> its aim is to give that right to applicants for naturalisation who are turned down because they fail to meet the requirements of residence sufficient knowledge of language and the future intention to reside all of which would seem with respect to be very appropriate for the kind of appellate machinery of the reference to the committee to which the noble viscount referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for that intervention which will be on the record of this house and i am glad to hear it is on the record of another place and that certainly increases the value of the discretionary procedure <e> <s> i confess that if that promise or undertaking was given it would have been more convincing if it had been made and embodied in the language of the bill <e> <s> for what it is worth and it is worth a good deal of course that must be so when one gets assurances by ministers on matters of this kind and no doubt the matter will be pursued <e> <s> i am grateful for that intimation <e>", "<cs> my lords no honest home secretary would do anything of the kind to concoct a good character excuse if there were other grounds in his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the use of the word control over the broadcasting authorities rather sinister and dangerous <e> <s> this does not i hope reflect the views of the front bench opposite <e> <s> however it is rather dismaying to hear it even from a back bench <e>", "<cs> my lords is not

social services department <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be much simpler and better for the child to be represented by a solicitor <e> <s> this second-hand procedure this hearsay procedure does not seem to be very convincing <e>", "<cs> my lords at least it can be said that this amendment maintains the total complexity of the bill <e> <s> the explanation that the always lucid noble and

government have evidence of any areas where the guidelines are not operating successfully and the organisations that have been communicating with us indicate that they have no such evidence that would be an argument for improving the operation of the guidelines in any such exceptional area and not for the introduction of this retrograde proposal <e> <s> i think that that is the answer to the query that the noble baroness has raised <e>", "<cs> i still maintain that the change in the law is a change for the worse <e> <s> i think that magistrates in practice will not be assisted by having merely to rely upon the circumstances of the case <e> <s> but having given that cassandra-like warning that it will make things worse i do not propose to press the matter to a division and beg leave to

rejection of this amendment by the minister <e> <s> that is not wholly true but i believe that the arguments that have been put forward for incorporating this part of the penal process in relation to

lengthy intervention may encourage others to follow suit at the report stage <e> <s> that worries me a little <e> <s> however i did invite the minister to apply his mind to this matter <e> <s> i am

lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating that statement <e> <s> may i ask him whether the purpose of making it today instead of enabling the whole matter to be considered in

have suggested i suspected that was the reason <e> <s> may i therefore assume that on wednesday this grave matter will be placed in its context in relation to the events which have caused such concern

able to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the minister for intervening in response to a specific question <e> <s> he must not take umbrage at my having taken him to task a little earlier for gilding the lily <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that when i discovered the facts to some of which the noble lord lord hunt has just referred and

actually doing what the overwhelming weight of opinion in the house has suggested they should do which is not a universal practice and we thank them for it <e> <s> obviously the need for legal representation of a child or young person in the circumstances set out in the new clause is of great importance <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon had the pleasure of supporting the noble baroness earlier on this matter and we are grateful that the light has dawned like a great flash if the noble lord the chief whip will not interrupt my purple passage as i am finishing <e> <s> we thank the noble lord very much for his acceptance of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will find this a helpful suggestion to involve the magistracy in this important stage of

criteria be published when they are decided and agreed upon <e> <s> we are very grateful to see the sympathetic approach to the process of cautioning the first offender who has confessed to his

the thames which is rapidly being turned into a kind of culvert with great buildings piling up on each side of it <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i agree that it is desirable that reclamation of derelict land should be tackled both in the public and private sectors <e> <s> we have noted the increase which has already been proposed by the government from a to per cent <e> <s> grant in this

propound distinguished observations in your lordships house <e> <s> we think per cent <e> <s> is about right <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps in view of that positive statement from the minister i will not take that matter any further at this stage but we shall have to give further thought to it because this important clause with important implications presented at the report stage creates

stories of those up to the age of being dumped in remote corners of appalling prisons <e> <s> we may assume from what the minister has said that that will not happen again and that for those children prison custody will be in a prison hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords the opposition is always delighted to enlighten the government <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are discussing here is the fact of the deprivation of the liberty of these young people between the ages of and <e> <s> there is no doubt that an order remanding a young offender to care can involve as much loss of liberty to that

service departments policies on secure accommodation has shown that children remanded to secure units may be there for as long as six months <e> <s> therefore we want to make absolutely sure that the courts should be under a duty to see that the remanding of a young offender to secure accommodation should count towards remission of a custodial sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether as

this moment <e> <s> the only trouble is that it is not a cause for applause but a cause for a second speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only for a brief moment to affirm and confirm the view which has been expressed about the necessity for proper availability of judicial review for the child to apply where his liberty is going to be taken away from him <e> <s> in a situation where all the relevant authorities who will have to handle such cases are strongly opposed to giving this authority to a single justice the objections of magistrates clerks the clerks to the justices and the british

able to meet what is a serious point in terms not only of the constitutional rights of a subject of this country but also of international law as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has very great respect for the noble lord but i do not think that he has increased this respect by an almost totally negative response to what has been said in the debate tonight <e> <s> for weeks we have been

called for from time to time not only from the government front bench but from the opposition front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords do not these exchanges indicate how fortunate the house is that it does not have to consider the details of finance bills <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate how many countries or governments have denounced the convention or have indicated their intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords that has not answered my question but perhaps it does not matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely asked how many governments have denounced the convention or announced their intention of denouncing the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lords explanation is obviously a wholly satisfactory one <e> <s> it may be necessary to establish priorities for defendants in custody as distinct from those who are not in custody and the amendments proposed give greater flexibility and indeed strength to the duty solicitor scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords this again is a helpful amendment <e> <s> the structure of the law and practice in regard to contempt is always subject to attack and it is very useful that in the limited category to which the noble and learned lord has referred legal aid should be available <e>", "<cs> my lords we and i suspect the whole house are pleased that the noble and learned lord has accepted the principle of a right of appeal in respect of the refusal of legal aid by a magistrates court <e> <s> the problem that worried us very much when we discussed this on a previous occasion was the vast variation in the refusal rates of application for legal aid orders as between one magistrates court and another <e> <s> indeed it seemed that success in regard to such application very often depended not so much on the merits of the application but on in which court the application was made <e> <s> we had the fascinating statistics that there were per cent <e> <s> refusals in highgate whereas in perhaps the more salubrious area of hampstead there were only per cent <e> <s> refusals <e> <s> looking at the matter statistically it indeed indicates a strange state of affairs because i hardly venture to think that the nature

importance of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree that these are beneficial amendments and we agree with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is also a beneficial change <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not something to be said for probing the possibility that a committee of - non-aligned is unattractive - non-committed

the other if this idea was launched to see what the response would be <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a case of power without responsibility or responsibility without power <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment touches upon a very important matter which we discussed at some length at the earlier stages of the bill namely the concern about the hundreds of children amounting perhaps to or more a year

infringement of the european convention on human rights that there is no such judicial review available <e> <s> the new clause a sought to remedy that situation and we are glad that after the matter

occasions so he may be not entirely without a modicum of prejudice in that regard <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for his support of the amendment <e> <s> what is crucial in this matter is that the secretary of state for the home office has an enormous involvement through the involvement of his department in the whole of the procedures we are concerned with and his constant

and that the government have brought forward no proposals save what has been elicited today by the question of the noble lord who was a distinguished member of the royal commission <e> <s> is this not a rather churlish way of treating the work of this royal commission whose deliberations extended over nearly two years and which was presided over by a distinguished high court judge in that no response apart from a brief answer at question time about eight months ago has emanated from the government and parliament has not been given an opportunity to discuss a matter which caused grave public concern when it arose <e>", "<cs> my lords most people expect some response from government <e> <s> this was an issue occasioning a great deal of public scandal and yet there has been no response by the government quite apart from failure of the usual channels in parliament to arrange discussion of this matter <e> <s> if the noble lord himself had been a member of this tribunal and i

noble and learned lord faces with legal aid <e> <s> judicial review could well give rise to legal proceedings which could justify an application for legal aid <e> <s> the procedure is not easy and one of the advantages of the whole tribunal set-up is ease of access in circumstances and an environment that are as informal as possible <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s>

and learned lord has indicated the importance and the difficulty of this issue <e> <s> there are obviously two sides to it but we will be returning to it again <e> <s> it is a constitutional question of very great importance and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord lord wigoder has spoken <e> <s> we have had eloquent support for this amendment from the law society <e> <s> i venture to think that the bar would be equally enthusiastic in support <e>", "<cs> it is really a matter of protest that high technicalities such as these were put down yesterday <e> <s> we have a great reputation in this house as lawyers and as members of this honourable house to take seriously the task of looking at legislation <e> <s> this sort of behaviour makes it impossible <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord takes due note of that <e> <s> i was referring of course to the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords while the prevention of abuse is no doubt important is it not also important as was implied by the last words of the noble lord that london should be encouraged to be the centre of so many of these great international organisations <e> <s> it brings nothing but advantage to this country as a counter to the odd or so which we may lose because they do not pay duty on their whisky <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been

chancellor knows <e> <s> as attorney-general it fell to me more than once to have a litigant declared vexatious to the great benefit of the hapless defendant who would otherwise have been at his mercy

learned lord will be willing to look at this <e> <s> the data user does not have a court that he can run to and it may be a useful thought to give the registrar power to give advice in a situation such as this <e> <s> i only put this forward for what it may be worth <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor inadvertently said that the registrar was the data users friend <e> <s> unless that should remain on the record i am sure that the noble and learned lord meant that the registrar was the data subjects friend <e>", "<cs> this is obviously a complex matter as indeed is so much in this bill <e> <s> i would like to consider the complexity try to understand it and if necessary return to the matter again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in following the advice of the table about the grouping of amendments and for the convenience of the committee i endeavoured to speak to a number of amendments together <e> <s> i doubt whether i really rendered service to the committee by doing so and indeed i may have weakened the force of the individual amendments to which we attach great importance by so doing <e> <s> but if by zeal to assist the committee and further business i have been in error i regret it very much <e>", "<cs> if i may do so i propose to follow the same course as i adopted in regard to the earlier group of amendments <e> <s> it may well be that when we come to the later amendments i shall be as brief as i was on the earlier occasion

observations that i have made generally <e> <s> that will not surprise the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that compliment but there is no mention at all of fraud in the subsection <e>", "<cs> with that observation i agree <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> as has been indicated by my noble friend lord hatch the importance of this matter and this provision in clause which touches <e>", "<cs> i have had a little experience in court of taking down what people said and it is always a wise precaution <e> <s> we shall look at the official record and the reference to fears played on by unscrupulous people which is what i dictated <e> <s> of course if the noble lord did not say that i naturally withdraw the implication of what i said <e>", "<cs> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i hope that in reviewing the position the noble lord will do me too the honour of reading what i ventured to say in introducing this combination of amendments since my remarks reflected communications that have been addressed to me <e> <s> i may say that the mailbag on clause has been almost as great as i was accustomed to receiving in another place on highly controversial issues <e> <s> there is great concern about this matter in not only the medical profession but other occupations as well <e>", "<cs> there are many bolts left in whatever part of the anatomy one keeps bolts <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that we shall return to the attack upon this matter at the report stage <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e>", "<cs> i am very content with that and in the circumstances and with that assurance i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am content to rub a tearful eye at the absence of the advisory committee from the provisions of the bill although i hope that we may return later to resurrect it <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether to cheer or not <e> <s> is the noble lord accepting the amendment without qualification <e>", "<cs> eureka <e> <s> hooray <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> may i be permitted not entirely out of professional loyalty to add our gratitude to the noble and

improvement in these amenities there will also be a railway system to make use of them <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the apparent confusion in his mind perhaps it will be a good idea if the noble viscount lord st davids will also read again what was said by my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos <e>", "<cs> my lords is not iran plainly in breach of those conventions which the noble lord has said its government ratified in <e> <s> has any complaint been made to the united nations commission of human rights which has some sort of supervision over breaches of this kind <e> <s> if that has not been done can her majestys government take some initiative in that regard <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind the quantity and speed of consolidation it is not surprising and it is forgivable that there

like a similar figure for the welsh national opera company and the welsh national theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who referred to this matter at committee stage will be grateful to the noble lord lord elton for meeting their anxieties that the bill as it stood did not comply with an important part of the convention <e> <s> i think it was my noble friend lord mishcon who initiated the debate on this in what if he will not mind my saying so was a record for him in almost the shortest speech i think that has ever been made in the house certainly the shortest ever made by my noble

i wish to say is that on the face of it the subsections we are considering are certainly far from being merely administrative <e> <s> clause goes to the very heart of a good deal of the bill and it provides for matters that go outwith the field of administration i would have thought <e> <s> i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in view of the adamant and determined refusal of the noble lord on the government front bench to contemplate at this stage an advisory committee of a statutory character and in view of the fact that we have a third reading stage yet to come when further amendments can be made to what is proposed it is desirable that the house should have an opportunity to express its view upon this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house see the value and force of these amendments <e> <s> the need for flexibility which is provided and the freedom of action which it responsibly gives seem to us to be a valuable change in the bill

registered person has materially contravened or is alleged to have materially contravened or is materially contravening any of the data protection principles <e> <s> the investigation of complaints of that character is i imagine it will be agreed an important part of the function of the registrar <e> <s> it seems to those who sit on this side of the house that that process of investigation is not really completed until the person who has made the complaint is informed and the registered person is informed of the outcome of the investigation <e> <s> we believe that this is a very important part of the registrars functions and that on this issue the opinion of the house should be sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself i am happy to do so for once with the noble lord lord mottistone in acknowledging the willingness and appreciating the willingness of the noble and learned lord to meet us on this matter <e> <s> it is a helpful amendment and i entirely support it

there is communication between the officer of the department and the secretary of state <e> <s> however if i may say so the issue is now fairly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord mottistone does not mind my speaking first because he had a bigger hand in this than i had <e> <s> we deal here with issues of law of high complexity and importance <e> <s> the fact that all who

mentioned i think that this is the right answer <e>", "<cs> now that we have amended the first part of clause my lords to make it the function of a judge to be <e>", "<cs> my lords if the chief whip

earlier amendments <e> <s> he then accepted the case for the principle we referred to and undertook to try to remedy the mischief <e> <s> it would seem that the mischief has now been remedied but we

was the phrase used <e> <s> a roomy jacket was better than to coin a phrase to go naked into the chamber or whatever it may be the registrar will have to enter <e> <s> my submission to the house is that the registrar will be far better protected and served in embarking upon his office to have these duties stated in those general terms as his protection and his shield <e> <s> that in my

disappointment at the obduracy of the government on so many of the issues which we have raised <e> <s> in regard to the participation of noble lords i would say that there have been efforts from all sides of the house to secure relief from the obduracy and the unfortunate consequence is that what seems to emerge from the discussions and the shape of the bill itself is that while there was an

that a large number of local authorities support this proposal the association of county councils of district councils and of metropolitan authorities and the convention of scottish local authorities

government have been suffering recently <e> <s> it is a most intriguing oberservation and we should like a little more light to be thrown upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hard to resist the

clarified <e> <s> i quite see the difficulty of pressing the view that there should be a decision between now and third reading <e> <s> as the noble lord has undertaken to draw this problem in all its

right of access provisions in regard to personal data in the fields that are indicated <e> <s> its effect would be that the disclosure of confidential personal data to law enforcement agencies would have to be notified prospectively on the register so that the public would know in advance in what circumstances those disclosures would be made <e> <s> the anxiety which the noble lord lord avebury mentioned is that the public would not know that and would fear that this right to disclose even matters they give in the most confidential circumstances may yet in circumstances remote from the commission of serious crime be communicated to the authorities without their knowledge and without their being informed <e>", "<cs> my lords i paused at this point merely to emphasise the fact that

availability of the court of appeal and if i may say so even occasionally of this noble house come in usefully to rectify severity of sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for introducing and explaining these legal aid financial conditions regulations <e> <s> two sets of them relate to england and wales and another two sets relate to scotland <e> <s> indeed it would be very astonishing and a very dangerous course for the government to differentiate between the respective scales for scotland as compared with those for england and wales <e> <s> they are the same and the need for the continued existence of legal aid and advice is of course common throughout the country <e> <s> we shall be interested to see when the northern ireland provisions arise that they conform to the same financial scales as apply to those that are being introduced today <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord elton for highlighting the important issues which arise on this bill and for doing so if he will permit me to say so with his usual competence <e> <s> i want to say at the outset that we on this side of the house and i suspect <e> <s> members in all quarters of the house welcome the decision to transfer the control of prosecutions from the police to independent crown prosecutors <e> <s> the aim must surely be for total independence in which the relationship between the police officer and the prosecutor will be one of mutual respect and acknowledgment that each is doing a separate but related task <e> <s> the model of the procurator fiscal in scotland shows that a relationship can be created which is effective and in the interests of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the force of that point <e> <s> what i said about it was couched in very reserved terms <e> <s> i should like to consider the matter <e> <s> private prosecutions are brought principally about <e>", "<cs> if my lords if the noble and learned lord will forgive me did not the house of lords overrule the decision of the court of appeal in that matter <e>", "<cs> unworthy my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the guidelines from the attorney-general be published or will they be interdepartmental and private <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this enduring powers of attorney bill with its rare but promising note of durability <e> <s> that is explained by the nature of the new power to which the noble and learned lord has referred rather than to any special qualities in this bill not possessed by all legislation introduced by this or by any other government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say where the reduction of million in the equipment grant for universities is to fall <e> <s> will this hit the scientific research departments <e> <s> what is going to be affected <e> <s> instead of an extra million there is going to be million <e> <s> it is a very substantial reduction in what was contemplated and confidently expected and on behalf of many noble lords here concerned with the state of the finances of the universities i would say that this is a matter of very grave concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating the attorney-generals statement <e> <s> however does the action taken by the attorney-general on behalf of the government as described in the statement not give rise to serious constitutional and legal questions with a number of which i must trouble the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many complaints have been received from recipients of letters who found they were opened before they received them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for taking up the suggestions of the law society so clearly explained by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> this has at least enabled me to say something in the course of these proceedings <e> <s> it may also be convenient to indicate that further amendments which purport also to be in my name will be moved by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulties on the opposition side were nothing to the difficulties of the unfortunate attorney general who was trying to get it through on the government side <e>", "<cs> my lords will the new regulations require parliamentary approval or assent of any kind <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now turn to less controversial matters namely the consideration of the newest of the recurring administration of justice bills <e> <s> may i on behalf of the house wish the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor recovery from the accident which he recently suffered <e> <s> i am bound to say that he looks dangerously well and we hope that may long continue <e>", "<cs> my lords but has not the power to suspend sentences of imprisonment been extremely helpful in a limited number of cases already <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was no doubt being helpfully interrupted <e> <s> i was asking whether it is not the case that in a number of cases the suspending of sentences of imprisonment has proved to be very beneficial <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord for having so carefully and in such detail paid due regard to the anxieties and points raised at second reading on the overall picture of the future set-up <e> <s> we shall obviously have to consider some of the matters to which the noble lord referred in some detail but it is right that he should have put us in the picture at this stage and i make no complaint that his speech was something in the way of a second reading submission <e> <s> we are grateful to him for having given us advance notice of what is in store in future <e>", "<cs> i think it would be convenient if the noble lord were to make a general response at the end attractive as it is to see him bobbing up and down like this or like that <e>", "<cs> if i may say so to the noble and learned lord this is one of the matters that i have been endeavouring to point out in my observations <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> requires the division of england and wales into areas <e> <s> that is mandatory <e> <s> but there has not yet been any amendment of subsection which merely empowers the director <e> <s> i should not be surprised if the noble lord in replying to me shortly may not be disposed to agree with my submission on this matter <e> <s> it is certainly extraordinarily inconsistent if there is merely a power given in subsection and not a positive duty imposed <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me may i ask him whether the guidelines will be brought before the house for consideration <e> <s> how will the matter be dealt with procedurally so to speak <e> <s> it seems to be of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> as i understand the noble baroness lady macleod she is not for a moment suggesting that if you have a case of a rape or murder by a year-old there should be some special dispensation and the ordinary processes of the criminal law should not take place <e> <s> that is not suggested at all <e> <s> i could not quite follow the intervention of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may conclude this major point which arises <e> <s> i do not think that i have any quarrel neither does the noble baroness with the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson about that <e> <s> what is essential is that in cases which fall short of the gravity of the kind of crimes that he had in mind there is the need for specialisation in dealing with the juvenile who to put the matter neutrally comes in contact with the law <e> <s> after all there is already in many ways specialisation in the criminal system in the treatment of juveniles <e>", "<cs> may i be permitted to make one observation <e> <s> may i say how much i agree with the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson with regard to the desirability that the director should be appointed by the attorney-general <e> <s> i am hound to say i do not know whether it was his experience that the previous existence was uncomfortable to use the most modest word to read the situation <e> <s> i congratulate the government on grasping this nettle and indeed the home office on its willingness to forfeit this previous plum to which it used to attach such importance <e>", "<cs> this matter would arise before the question of delivery of brief to counsel would occur before committal <e> <s> that would be the position <e> <s> i do not think it would encroach on counsels responsibilities <e>", "<cs> the experience of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson will confirm that last observation <e> <s> fortunately counsel in my own experience has stood firm occasionally and been allowed to offer no evidence at the trial <e> <s> the issue arising here is to some extent highlighted and made more detailed and perhaps more practical in the next amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but in my submission there is value at this point of time in inserting the provision in the amendment <e> <s> it is quite true and we did give consideration to this that far ahead in the bill we find clause <e> <s> if clause had been embodied in this part of the bill at an earlier stage we might have been more content but in our view the separateness of that provision from what we are now discussing in regard to the duties of the director make the amendment desirable <e> <s> at this stage when the prosecution can take a certain course in view of the unlikelihood of a conviction and the other factors which the attorney-general has spelt out surely it would he desirable that the director should apply his mind initially after charging and before committal to consider whether it is desirable that the proceedings should or should not be continued <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that it is useful putting it at its lowest that this amendment was put down to enable that powerful and authoritative statement to emerge from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to confirm and affirm what i ventured to say in my observations and what is in fact said in brief in the amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his all-embracing declaration of interest with regard to this matter and for the assurances that he has given <e>", "<cs> may i for my part having heard what has been said on these amendments express the view that the clause is much better as it stands <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord lord simon will not think me guilty of heresy if i venture to disagree with him in regard to his amendment <e> <s> he put it forward with his customary vigour and clarity but i regret to say i cannot agree with it <e> <s> as i understand it the proposal of the amendment is to open up all offences to the possibility of private prosecution <e>", "<cs> does that glimmer of light indicate that we may hope for good news hereafter from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> if so of course we should not seek to obtain the view of the committee on this matter but if there is not even a glimmer if it is only a shadow then we shall have to divide <e> <s> perhaps he can enlighten us further <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure to see and hear the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in a bounteous mood <e> <s> i am reminded of the practice of a certain scottish minister who had two graces before dinner <e> <s> if the meal was modest he would say we thank thee lord for this the least of all thy mercies <e> <s> but if it was a good slap-up meal it would begin oh bountiful jehovah <e> <s> this time i think we are in the presence <e> <s> it is a surprising role in view of earlier meanie observations about expenditure to find the noble and learned lord in a bounteous role <e> <s> we accept it with pleasure and await the good things to come <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee for giving careful consideration to this matter <e> <s> we are moving in rather curious waters if curious is the proper word to use in relation to waters in that parliament determines the amount of penalty that should be imposed for a specific crime <e> <s> we are told that that is mere shadow-boxing <e> <s> the real financial penalty to the pocket of the offender will lie not in the fine aspect but in the costs <e> <s> so the schedule of offences and penalties is rather more misleading we must forget about the amount of the penalty <e> <s> so often it is alleged and complained that costs awarded are excessive <e> <s> i suppose that the prosecution costs that are imposed are capable of being taxed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the lord chancellor would have another look at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems a hardship that a person who has been acquitted or whose appeal against conviction has been allowed should be subject to regulations which empower a court to order him nevertheless to pay costs <e> <s> this could be a great hardship for a person of limited means <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord not reconsider this to see whether in some way it cannot be limited or modified so that hardship may not be imposed on a wholly innocent person against whom ineffective and perhaps wholly wrong and unjustified proceedings have been brought <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister with the greatest respect whether he does not consider that in view of the life and death issues raised by euthanasia religious moral and theological question time may not be the best occasion for discussing those grave matters <e>", "<cs> i rise to propose that clause be left out of the bill <e> <s> the clause in effect enables the attorney-general to refer to the court of appeal for its opinion any sentence passed by the crown court for an indictable offence thought to be too lenient <e> <s> in brief the case against the proposal in the clause is that it is not only wrong in principle but that it is also unnecessary in view of the fact that the court of appeal already can and does lay down guidelines to guard against over-lenient sentences <e> <s> in my submission here we have a proposal which is not only wrong in principle but which is also wholly unnecessary a most unattractive combination indeed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> on the matter of practice is the noble and learned lord suggesting the criminal division of the court of appeal have been neglecting their duty up until now in stating principles clearly and well when they think right as the matter arises <e>", "<cs> without prejudice to amendment no <e> <s> which proposes to leave out clause the suggestions in the amendments do indeed seem to be sense <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may express my objection briefly but brutally <e> <s> the governments solution does not go anything like far enough <e>", "<cs> in spite of that active discouragement from my old and noble friend i should like to say that of course we sympathise with the home office in the appalling responsibility which faces it <e> <s> the bald fact is that there are more individuals in prison in this country per head of the population than in any other country in western europe <e> <s> whose fault is that <e> <s> it is partly the fault <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether there is greater perversity in the british population as a whole and i will not specify the foreign countries i have in mind in case it might add to international discomity rather than harmony but the fault is partly in the law which we are enforcing partly in the administration partly in the limited responsibilities which at the present time we place upon the prosecuting wing of government <e> <s> that is why we think it of value that these time limits should be imposed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that further elucidation <e> <s> i forgot to note with regard to the intervention by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson that it is to be hoped there will be a saving of resources and money if people are kept in prison for a shorter time <e> <s> this is one of the factors <e> <s> however in the light of what has been said by the noble lord the minister i ask leave to withdraw the amendment with the possibility of returning to the matter again before this bill has reached its ultimate destination and in view of the fact that there are some good provisions in the bill receives royal assent <e>", "<cs> i share that enthusiasm <e> <s> i did not know that there was that limitation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how the termination of hostilities in the far east will be celebrated <e> <s> we should not overlook that equally important event <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many persons under the age of who are on remand awaiting trial are held in adult prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> is it not deeply deplorable that remand prisoners many of whom will be acquitted altogether and some of whom will not receive custodial sentences are nevertheless held in prison at that youthful age <e>", "<cs> my lords would the public not be prepared to pay a little more by way of the licence fee for the pleasure of seeing the house of lords being televised <e>", "<cs> i was wondering whether some of this anxiety might be removed if an addition could be made to subsection <e>", "<cs> may i make a brief intervention in respect of what has passed <e> <s> in my experience there was never any difficulty if i may say so in an appropriate case in finding a solicitor ready and willing to take proceedings against another <e> <s> on the contary some solicitors revelled in the process <e>", "<cs> now that the noble and learned lord has committed the heresy of saying that in effect may really means shall why not say so in the clause and substitute shall for may <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> regardless of that interesting point i understand that between now and the report stage the noble and learned lord will look to making may read shall <e> <s> we shall then return to the matter unless we achieve complete satisfaction on that point <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think there is a general clause concerning unprofessional conduct but i cannot recollect at the moment whether that is particularised <e> <s> i am told by my noble friend lord mishcon who is a king-pin in all matters affecting solicitors as the committee by now well knows that that umbrella covers any possible misconduct that might come before the authorities <e>", "<cs> one can assume that the investigating committee will be made up of men of a generous and kindly disposition who will not go to absurdity and go back to ancient times in the career of a man <e> <s> these tribunals as we heard earlier although they can be severe are also on the whole pretty merciful <e> <s> i think we can rely upon their basic common sense and fairness not to push matters to an absurdity <e>", "<cs> our feeling about this matter is that at the very launching of a new profession there should be a provision of this kind in the bill <e> <s> in the circumstances we consider it right to seek the view of the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends view about this matter <e> <s> there is no reason why after the first reference to the licensed person that thereafter there could not be a reference to the said person as appears in regard to other professional provisions <e> <s> it is important in this matter to maintain treatment with respect for the members of a profession <e> <s> we are dealing here with internal disciplines and not with court proceedings in the ordinary court <e> <s> there there would be a case for maintaining the term defendant <e> <s> it is important to regard and treat the members of this new profession with the same respect which is due to members of any profession <e>", "<cs> maybe but at least cover it up <e> <s> that is the essence of all professional activities <e> <s> cover it up as best you can so with solicitors fees are called costs but the new licensed conveyancers are not allowed the luxury of that cover <e> <s> their fees are described as fees <e> <s> there is much to say for it both ways but let it not be a one-way traffic <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is what the noble and learned lord thought and said <e>", "<cs> if i may be allowed to interrupt again i believe that i may have done the noble and learned lord an injustice <e> <s> i believe that his remarks were in respect of the suggestion for a lay presence on disciplinary committees <e>", "<cs> as i understand it from noble lords they had it in mind to say in respect of the succeeding amendments up to and including amendment no <e> <s> that they were of such importance that they would like to move them on a different occasion at a different stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i dislike intervening again but may i confirm in terms that these matters will be opened again at the report stage <e>", "<cs> if it is the better course in view of what was commonly agreed i think that we should continue until such time as we conclude matters up to and including amendment no <e> <s> on such terms as noble lords who are moving those amendments think right <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be convenient to put a copy of the visiting forces act in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping for greater help than that from the woolsack <e> <s> i am only trying to assist the house that is all <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the intention and wish is that the noble and learned lord lord denning should speak <e> <s> there will be no lack of speakers on this matter i fear <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene perhaps the noble and learned lord will indicate by leaving his sedentary position when he proposes to do that <e>", "<cs> there was one observation of the noble and learned lord that was accepted by the committee <e> <s> that was the proposition that if a single judge refuses leave to proceed there ought to be recourse to appeal <e> <s> clause as it stands is a total negative and challenge to that proposition and we must begin by forgetting about clause <e> <s> if i may say so with great respect one wonders how anyone brought it to the marshalled list bearing in mind that in regard to the procedure of judicial review it starts with a number of proper restrictions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could put this point to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> if the committee should decide that clause should not stand part of the bill that would not prejudice a decision by the government to bring forward at the report stage of the bill some method of dealing with the problem that has been ventilated <e>", "<cs> i share the desire of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson not to add to the burdens of the office of attorney-general having myself carried them for a little while <e> <s> but there is support for the noble lords amendment in the evershed committee and in the benson commission report <e> <s> as the committee will remember in the evershed committee on supreme court practice and procedure recommended what is provided for in the clause <e> <s> that was on the grounds that legislation is slow and cumbersome and clarification of the law by judicial decision is swift that is sometimes the case but not invariably and sure that too may not be unqualified i do not seem to be doing very well out of that evershed quote so far and can go forward without regard to parliamentary time and quite independent of political considerations <e> <s> that latter part may be right <e>", "<cs> like indeed the administration of justice bill through your lordships house <e> <s> the present position is that the sheriffs officer or bailiff may in execution of a court judgment or order seize virtually all the goods of the debtor <e> <s> the only exceptions which are set out in section of the small debts act of and section of

response bearing in mind that this problem has been on the <e>", "<cs> those who have raised these matters with me feel restless that personal injuries actions are tending to be treated in the courts as a tiresome distraction from the real work of the courts to fight commercial cases <e> <s> it may be that that is not a fair summation of the situation <e> <s> i have ventilated the point but i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords remaining in the theatre context is the noble earl able to give some explanation of the deplorable decision to close the cottlesloe theatre <e> <s> did he have anything to do with that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the pilgrimage is finally terminated may i indicate that my silence shows no disapproval on the contrary support of this bill which is still enduring <e>", "<cs> my lords that translated into welsh means diolch yn fawr <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating the statement of the learned attorney-general in another place <e> <s> perhaps it is too early to hold an inquest on the ponting case with its vivid illustration of the independence of the jury in this country <e> <s> but the case does give rise to many questions which call for an early answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to what the noble and learned lord has said may i make it clear because perhaps his cheerful observations did not do so that there is no opposition from this side of the house to the protection of official information bill <e> <s> discontent about section has gone on for a long time i suffered under it myself as attorney-general <e> <s> now in the light of this experience in this trial is it not an urgent necessity to get rid of the wretched thing and to put something more liberal and more effective in its place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think amendment no <e> <s> goes with amendment no <e> <s> but it does not come in with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it is purely a question of convenience but i think that that would be a more practical arrangement than dealing with the points together <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to make too heavy weather of this certainly not of amendment no <e> <s> which i respectfully agree with the noble lord lord campbell of alloway is probably the more important of the two <e> <s> but with the conception that the noble lord suggested that the fact that an appointment was made by the attorney-general politicised the matter he is treading on very dangerous ground <e> <s> i submit that it is quite incorrect if he allows me to be blunt upon the matter <e> <s> one of the matters that i think perhaps the noble lord may overlook is that already the attorney-general in making appointments is enmeshed in the prosecution process <e> <s> after all he appoints the key prosecutors at the old bailey <e> <s> i have forgotten what they are called now <e>", "<cs> my lords treasury counsel <e> <s> they were sometimes called treasury devils but treasury counsel may be a more courteous name <e> <s> the attorney-general appoints them <e> <s> they are extremely important in that they have the responsibility of conducting the more serious cases at the old bailey on the nomination of the attorney-general <e> <s> therefore there is nothing politicising abnormal quaint or out of order if i may say so in what has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has approached this matter sympathetically and in the light of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course grateful for that unequivocal commitment and statement of the noble lord <e> <s> after many long sessions with him on the devolution bill i know how sympathetic he personally is to the aspirations of the welsh people <e> <s> we are this year celebrating the millennium of the law of hywel dda introduced by that great welsh prince in the tenth century <e> <s> it was a law which was the law of wales until the welsh tudors i regret to say put an end to it with the act of union <e> <s> but the traditions of the welsh language and the use of the welsh language is a precious heritage to the welsh people and is also i was glad to note it in the noble ministers speech acknowledged and <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we are deeply grateful and delighted at the readiness of the noble and learned lord to come forward with that generous response to the amendment <e> <s> in the circumstances while waiting with hope and expectation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not put the amendment forward in any partisan or party spirit <e> <s> it is nevertheless right that he should be publicly associated in this place with this excellent measure of reform <e> <s> it will cause great relief and give great satisfaction to the public at large <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what a bounteous and happy day it is <e> <s> the spirit of st valentine is pervading and obviously coursing through the veins of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we are grateful to him <e> <s> on similar terms i ask leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express gratitude for the immense progress that has been made in the field of consolidation <e> <s> hardly a day passes without the noble and learned lord announcing the content of pending legislation <e> <s> may i ask whether he agrees that consolidation of legislation in the housing field is of great practical importance and is urgently needed <e> <s> we trust that the hope he expressed nearly a year ago of achieving such consolidation within one year may be more or less realised <e>", "<cs> my lords although the format may be common i take it that there will nevertheless be a clear indication that the passports we shall be carrying are british passports <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord some questions about two important commitments undertaken by the secretary of state according to the statement <e> <s> one was that all parts of the country would benefit from the proposed expansion and the second was that no individual closure would take place until satisfactory alternative provisions had been identified <e> <s> unhappily the secretary of state did not condescend to give particulars about the detailed arrangements in different parts of the country <e> <s> the information that i have about west wales in general and my native town of llanelli in particular is to say the least deeply disturbing <e> <s> it may well be that there have been changes of mind since it was originally announced that the llanelli skillcentre was to be closed <e> <s> there have been discussions since then and it may be that there has been a different decision <e>", "<cs> my lords do the facts disclosed in these exchanges not point to the need for immediate and urgent action in this field <e> <s> is not this picture of children being injured at work and of being employed at hours of work which are illegal with a somewhat if i may say so casual reaction from the government most unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the house may i wish a speedy recovery for the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a moment to be remembered and to be thankful for because what is now proposed by the acceptance of the amendments which i had the privilege of moving at an earlier stage means that a serious error and fault indeed i would call it a fundamental injustice in our legal system is <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord elton will explain why it is deemed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bear with that period of waiting but having spent a happy day upstairs in another capacity i would not encourage any interference with rights of appeal to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before we say farewell to the bill i should like to join with the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson in thanking the minister lord elton for his competence care and courtesy in the conduct of the bill <e> <s> i was tempted to say that the bill is like the curates egg good in parts <e> <s> but that has been said so often about so many things that i wondered whether i should <e> <s> there are certainly good elements in it <e> <s> the most important of these the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson has already referred to it is the reform of the prosecution service in england and wales by the creation of an independent prosecution service <e> <s> concern was expresssed in some parts of the house at an earlier stage of the bill about the danger of over-centralisation <e> <s> we were assured and re-assured by the noble lord the minister stating that when the new service is established there will be not less delegation of decision-taking to local level but more <e> <s> he also announced the proposal to lay an amendment to the regulations to give greater flexibility in allowing cases to be left at the local level in the run-up to the introduction of the new service <e> <s> i am sure that those considerations will be very important <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has not got it quite right <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has done very well so far <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for explaining with his customary clarity and detail the provisions of the bill <e> <s> we on this side of the house welcome the bill <e> <s> i venture to think that it will be welcomed generally on all sides of the house <e> <s> it is very important that we should not fall behind in ratifying useful international conventions of the kind we are discussing which we have signed particularly when they are already in force <e> <s> a tribute is owed to the canadian authorities for the initiative that they have taken in this field <e> <s> a number of european countries have also given effect to the conventions which are in force in a large part of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baronesss answer mean that the government are determined to keep the public in the dark <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an interesting example of the way in which our rules of procedure enable us to correct our errors in however obscure a fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that a large number of applications for parole are turned down for safeguarding reasons <e> <s> can the noble lord give any figure for the percentage involved lest it be thought that parole is granted recklessly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson describes this amendment as being mere verbiage <e> <s> if it were mere verbiage it would be far more lengthy if i may say so judging from my experience of verbiage in this house <e> <s> however there it is i reject that critical view of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i find the noble and learned lords answer disappointing though basically his attitude is undoubtedly one of goodwill <e> <s> i believe that this particular issue in this proposal is separate and identifiable <e> <s> there is discrimination against the poor people who have to rely on the green form schemes early use of which prevents and inhibits much subsequent litigation <e> <s> it seems to me that it is very important that this matter should be put right immediately <e> <s> therefore it being a matter of such urgency and importance i think the opinion of

applications would come in from the individual citizen and that mps might resent it and feel that they would be bypassed <e> <s> however in practice what has been the experience of countries like new zealand which have allowed direct access as i believe to be the case from the citizen to the ombudsman <e> <s> we drew a great deal on the experience of new zealand when we evolved this concept of the ombudsman so i am not asserting that it has worked very well but if the minister had any information on that it might be of value and of great interest <e> <s> has there been such an indication that there would be a flood if the citizen were to write directly to the ombudsman or approach him directly i wonder <e> <s> i doubt it very much <e>", "<cs> i am concerned about the element of difficulty in added time that would be involved in what my noble and learned friend proposes namely the requirement of consent in this odd situation where almost inevitably the rule for the protection of privacy is being overruled by virtue of the same man performing different functions <e> <s> i wonder whether the suggestion of requiring consent would complicate matters unnecessarily ultimately possibly to the detriment of the person complaining <e> <s> perhaps that might be thought about <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that debates and discussions in this house show that we on this side of the house fully support the actions and attempts of the police to deal with crime <e> <s> what is lacking is particularity about crime prevention the degree of success it has accomplished and the results in regard to detection and prevention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my questions <e> <s> for example what has happened in the matter of the detection of crime <e> <s> what particular steps are now being taken in the field of crime prevention over and above what has been done before <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important that reasonable speed should be maintained in

important that such access should be rendered effective in view of the fact that this service is of great help to members of parliament and the public <e>", "<cs> my lords mr gladstone in introducing one of his budgets said that he would not call it a labour of hercules because hercules could not have done it <e> <s> the same might be said of the task of the minister in moving the second reading

debate and we look forward particularly to the maiden speech of my noble friend lord irvine of lairg cannot cover each and every clause of the bill although the minister has made a gallant attempt to cover a good deal of it <e> <s> if there is to be a committee stage and i gather from the assumptions of his speech that there is to be one it will be long and detailed and there will be an abundance of amendments that noble lords will wish to put forward in dealing with this important matter <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> it is not in the ec but it is a country which has more people in prison <e> <s> however with that one exception and i shall refresh what i am pleased to call my memory about it in due course our record is the most serious in that respect <e>", "<cs> my

of our agreement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hutchinson in his admirable speech indicated the traditional principle of the criminal law has been that the defendant is under no obligation to co-operate with the police or the prosecuting authorities and that at the trial he can require the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt without advance disclosure of the defence which the prosecution learns only as it gradually unfolds during the cross-examination <e> <s> however we accept that in serious and complex fraud cases of the kind with which the bill is concerned the defence should exceptionally make known in general terms the nature of its case in advance of the trial <e>", "<cs> my lords i omitted to congratulate the noble and learned lord on answering his first starred question <e> <s> i warn him that it will not be the last <e> <s> may i ask the noble and learned lord whether or not he agrees that the advice given by law officers bears special

think its opposition is explained by any selfish advantage which may be suspected to derive to the bar from the existence in a limited number of cases of the jury system <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord satisfied about the enforceability of judgments of the industrial tribunals <e> <s> there are cases of appalling failure to give effect to judgments of the tribunals in respect of underpaid workers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give attention to the observations of the noble and learned lord lord denning in regard to the legal aspects of the situation <e> <s> concern about costs which far exceed the likelihood of an award appropriate to damages in the totality of cases is becoming a scandalous feature of the administration of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not

position is it not high time that we repealed section of the official secrets act and replaced it with a protective measure more narrowly defined than section which is absurdly wide in its potential application <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to call this a lucky dip of a bill there are some good things in it but unhappily there are some things which are not so good <e> <s> from what we have been told by the minister this debate is a kind of preliminary canter <e> <s> i say without complaint that many of the most material matters for decision will be left until a later stage when the house resumes after the summer recess <e> <s> i should like to join with the minister in recollecting that during the first run of the bill through this house we at least passed some of the important provisions relating to fraud <e> <s> i was very happy that co-operation across the floor made that possible and that it is already on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of publicity

the very sombre statement made in another place by the home secretary <e> <s> it faces up to the crisis that we meet in our prisons today <e> <s> we debated this matter on tuesday and i am sure the noble earl must be regretting that he was not then given the information that he has given the house today <e> <s> obviously there have been immediate and recent discussions and decisions on this grave matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by joining with noble lords who have already congratulated the noble lord lord blyth on his delightful maiden speech <e> <s> it is good that he has broken the resistance of his family over years to holding forth in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble earls use of the term economical patriarch has he in mind the chancellor of

rise to support the amendment <e> <s> subsection is one of the most brutal and remarkable provisions in an act of parliament or in a bill that i have seen <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> may i put a matter very directly to the minister of state <e> <s> is it not the case that as the bill stands there is no requirement whatsoever that the secretary of state shall consider the evidence relating to the alleged offence or the alleged offender and there being no such requirement there is no room for judicial review <e>", "<cs> on behalf of this part of the opposition i should like to thank the minister for his undertaking to examine this as a whole and consult the house upon it <e> <s> in the circumstances i understand that the noble lord will in a moment or so withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether in view of the considerable room for difference putting it neutrally about clause and the notice of intention to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill this

crime and its continuing increase <e> <s> therefore in these debates today we touch upon very serious matters <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting question and perhaps the noble earl could comment on it <e> <s> it may be an additional risk involved in this whole operation <e> <s> i know not <e> <s> my noble friend has a little experience of contempt of court i believe and may be able to deal with that <e>", "<cs> consistency <e>", "<cs> now that that elementary matter has been clarified perhaps we may continue <e> <s> with regard to the proposal as to offences relating to vehicles and the particular offence in clause of driving whilst disqualified or taking a motor vehicle without authority i believe that the james committee to which the noble earl referred did take the view that driving while disqualified was a serious disregard of a court order and therefore warranted trial by jury <e> <s> i think that was the view that they formed so that there is some substance if he will not mind my saying so in the noble lords proposals <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl remember the opposition of lord morris of borth-y-gest and the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies who steals my purse steals trash and the rest of it <e> <s> wonderful <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee reject all the noble viscounts proposals and we do not intend to dignify them by any further

and learned lord the former lord chancellor whose dangerous practices with his guns everybody knows about <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has referred to the view of the police federation that it would hope for an increase in penalty <e> <s> that is precisely what the amendment does <e> <s> at present the law says years <e> <s> the amendment proposes years <e> <s> such information as i have suggests that the police are worried about what is in the bill for the tactical reasons that i gave <e> <s> i do not have any sympathy for those who carry firearms but we must not worsen the situation by exposing the police themselves to the dangers which would flow from equality of punishment for possession and actual use of a gun <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having heard that explanation from the minister i am bound to say that i agree that years is not an excessive maximum which is what we are talking about for the gravest type of case <e> <s> it really is a sad feature of our times although these horrors may have happened before that the public eye at any rate is more frequently drawn now to these abominations against our beloved children than has certainly been the case in my somewhat prolonged life <e> <s> therefore it is right that action should be taken <e>", "<cs> that is obviously a fair provision and i am glad that the minister has made that announcement <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl has any evidence of the incidence of corruption <e> <s> i see that the answer is no <e> <s> it would illuminate our discussions if henceforth when measures of this kind are brought before us the committee could know the extent of the mischief and the nature of the increased incidence if any <e> <s> subject to that i do not oppose the clause <e>", "<cs> once more i venture to support the noble earl on this matter <e> <s> this is an insidious crime which can be very damaging to the reputation of our commercial society <e> <s> i think that what is proposed is not excessive for the severest and the most pernicious cases <e> <s> it is a maximum penalty and that must be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> the parliamentary all-party group has reported upon the use of police cells for prisoners who have been sentenced or remanded to penal establishments <e> <s> it is

<e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness avoid de-comprehensivisation and promise never to use it again <e>", "<cs> i venture to think that few proposals for prison reform have commanded wider support within the criminal justice system than the prior committee proposals <e> <s> it is a matter of great disappointment that the government have turned down those proposals and indeed moved from their thinking in the earlier white paper <e>", "<cs> the matter arises in this way <e> <s> section of the magistrates courts act reads <e>", "<cs> i just wish to add that i have not suggested that it was any personal responsibility of the noble and learned lord lord denning who was master of the rolls and in charge of these courts at the material time <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree <e> <s> let me say now that i abandon the proportionality part of the drafting <e>", "<cs> i certainly give the withdrawal my support <e> <s> it was nevertheless right that the matter should be raised <e> <s> if the case of the arabian prince turning up in his rolls-royce and getting fined or whatever it was is grotesque there is a need for the matter to be looked at again <e> <s> it is not a frivolity <e>

very glad to get that assurance <e> <s> i am bound to say that great care has been taken in preparing the new clause to comply as exactly as possible with the actual language of the convention <e> <s> the only matter that is slightly in dispute is one very small part of paragraph when a person has by a final decision been convicted <e> <s> but i should have thought that was clear enough and that there is a clear obligation <e> <s> as the noble lord who has just spoken said to state that the government have endeavoured to comply with the spirit of the matter just is not good enough <e> <s> it may indeed in a certain sense go further but that is not what we have in issue <e> <s> there is a clear duty here <e> <s> we as a country take some pride in compliance with the obligations that we entered into on these conventions <e> <s> that is why we do not enter into too many of them <e>", "<cs> happily there are other stages ahead <e> <s> i do not know whether my presence in the united states celebrating the bicentennial of its constitution will enable me to be present on report but noble colleagues in different parts of the chamber have been listening carefully <e> <s> we shall come back to it stage by stage as the matter proceeds because there is a clear obligation with which a law-abiding government i hope will comply <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also support the right of the crown to call for stand by <e> <s> it is an ancient right but so is the right of the defendant peremptorily to challenge <e> <s> i understand that juries were established as part of the criminal trial process in the th century when pope innocent ii decreed the abolition of trial by ordeal <e> <s> one sometimes feels that a trial by jury is something of a trial by ordeal <e> <s> however since that time the right of a defendant peremptorily to challenge has remained <e> <s> as i understand the matter originally the defence could challenge up to jurors <e> <s> in that was reduced to seven and during my time on the woolsack if i may put it in that brief way the defence right of challenge was reduced from seven to three <e> <s> the kind of difficulties that have been explained and that come in the way of the prosecution and the crown in having to avoid explanations in embarrassing circumstances can equally affect the position of the defendant and those advising him <e> <s> while i am not terribly fond of a goose geese and ganders being introduced into the argument in my submission it is quite unjust and monstrous to continue the right of the crown to <e>", "<cs> a slowness in leaping to my feet in no way reflects a lack of confidence in the propositions that i am about to put forward <e> <s> in my submission what is proposed in this clause amounts to a serious limitation of the rights of a defendant in criminal trials a right i ventured to say earlier that has existed for hundreds of years <e> <s> it is for those who seek to make this dramatic change to prove first that it is necessary to prevent proven or provable abuse and secondly that the change would not be unfair to defendants in their trails <e>", "<cs> i am not speaking of the ethnic minority or of the people who were the first inhabitants of the island namely the welsh <e> <s> but is it not the case that in an attempt to show cause it has not been accepted

i am sorry but i have taken advice from where it should come from the table <e>", "<cs> i took advice and was advised that it was proper for me to make some observations <e> <s> we have been at it long enough and i shall speak only for a moment or two <e>", "<cs> i similarly <e> <s> it is a great pleasure to welcome what the noble earl says from time to time <e> <s> let it not be thought that

ground <e> <s> as i understand it in the sense that it proposes to apply to england the scottish system for childrens hearings <e> <s> however perhaps the noble baroness whose amendment it is and who has a considerable interest in this matter has some thoughts to contribute <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> i rise to support these amendments <e> <s> i am particularly happy about the inclusion of a reference to selling offensive weapons in the clause <e> <s> i understand from my son who has been involved in a protective capacity in this matter that the sale of these weapons in tobacconists shops has been taking place <e> <s> that is really quite monstrous <e> <s> what i also find quite appalling is the sending of catalogues through the post to young people giving a vivid description of these horrific weapons <e> <s> a measure to prevent that kind of activity is long overdue <e>", "<cs> in my submission what is proposed in this clause namely an empowering of the home office to give grants to voluntary organisations which run crime prevention schemes is excellent <e> <s> as has been said the value of nacros work and its initiative in different parts of the country

what is going on if the information is available <e>", "<cs> these are important matters for the press in relation to contempt of court generally and to the restriction of the access of the public to

whole house will agree with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor as to the sensitivity and importance of the matter that we are discussing <e> <s> my noble friends and i readily acknowledge that our country needs a security service to fight against international terrorism and espionage <e> <s> we also agree that its members and those who work for it should be sustained in that task <e>

safeguards of the liberty of the subject <e> <s> to sacrifice the latter for the former would not only be unacceptable it would diminish our security and not strengthen it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have discussed issues of great importance in the spheres of public policy involving as the debate has so graphically shown on the one hand the safety of the realm and on the other the right of the individual citizen and of parliament to the utmost information available <e>", "<cs> my lords has the united nations sub-commission on human rights been notified about those allegations <e> <s> what has flowed from its intervention if any <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord reay for enabling <e>", "<cs> strength <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale and i will i am sure be pleased to observe that the noble and learned lord has gone at least some of the way to meet our criticisms <e> <s> i am bound to say that what most shocked us was the intention to give to the secretary of state power to repeal <e> <s> that seemed to us to be a new concept and i am glad that that is to go <e> <s> the word modify also involves a considerable power <e> <s> some voices in the chamber were not even content to accept amend <e> <s> some amendments can be destructive and some can achieve the same purpose in different words <e> <s> i hope that what the noble and learned lord has in mind in the use of the word amendment in regard to what is a crucially important part of the bill schedule which provides particulars for local authority support for children and families will not be directed to reducing or eliminating some of the services that are set out in these important provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down can he enlighten the house on the kind of contingency that he and the government have in mind which may require amendment in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment in the absence of my noble friend lady david <e> <s> i am happy to be able to say that my noble friend is in hungary on parliamentary duties <e> <s> i thought i should make that clear in case there was alarm and despondency in the house about the possible political implications of her journey <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> is not language a much more specific identifiable and positive an element than cultural background generally <e> <s> having learnt to speak english at the age of four i know how important it would have been if my experience had cast me into the hands of purely english people at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said this is an important bill affecting as it does the well-being of a large number of children in our community and their families <e> <s> it is a complex bill with several inter-related clauses and pages of schedules <e> <s> it requires as my noble friend lord prys-davies has said sets of regulations to provide direction and guidance for practice <e> <s> those who have to follow and apply it hereafter face a herculean task <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with great respect it has been the successful achievement of a herculean task <e> <s> it brings to my mind one of mr gladstones famous observations when he introduced his last budget <e> <s> he would not call the task herculean because hercules could not have done it <e> <s> i suspect the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor may have felt that from time to time and we are grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord meston has indicated that it will be more <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to undermine the submissions of the noble and learned lord but i cannot refrain from expressing a little surprise at his objection to unravelling the parts of the provisions of a clause <e> <s> i should have thought that his expertise in unravelling parts of statutory provisions was one of his many outstanding qualities <e>", "<cs> the guidance that i sought concerned what was supposed to be covered by the power given to the security service by this clause to safeguard our economic well-being <e> <s> that is the question to which i sought an answer <e> <s> i should certainly not want any particulars of the kind which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter indicated it would be against the public interest to disclose <e> <s> we want to unravel if i dare use that word again the purpose of this provision which stands out somewhat starkly from the otherwise realistic provisions of the bill <e> <s> however i do not know whether the noble and learned lord can add to what he has said <e> <s> if not i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that it is disappointing that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has not given any indication of the willingness to associate some judicial reference in relation to this awesome power given to the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not know whether it is unprecedented but it is certainly an extraordinary power <e> <s> it issues warrants on the basis of a provision in an act of parliament which states <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will look again at this matter <e> <s> the importance that parliament and the public should know what use is being made of this extraordinary power is so great that i believe it is proper that it should be stated to be his duty to disclose it <e> <s> disclosure cannot damage a potential danger to the security of the country <e> <s> on the contrary the fact that these warrants are being issued would point out an effective deterrent operating effectively <e> <s> so far from any damage being caused to public security by the disclosure of the number of warrants issued it would i should have thought be beneficial all round <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will look at this again before we come to the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i see the discouraging sedentary position occupied by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we shall undoubtedly return to this point at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is a great fear of the extension of these provisions to cover perfectly law-abiding organisations which are worried by this kind of provision <e> <s> the provision is all-embracing and although the technical phrase of guilt by association may not be wholly appropriate it extends the strong arm of the security service rather far <e> <s> i shall examine the observations of the noble and learned lord and perhaps return to this at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while i do not for a moment share the motivation or the reasons put forward by the noble lord lord hutchinson in denigrating the undoubted merits of the legal profession and its ability fully to man such a tribunal there is some word of truth in the proposition that it should necessarily be a monopoly <e>", "<cs> one can only hope that that will be drawn to the attention of the relevant tribunals and that they will act accordingly <e> <s> one never has total confidence in those matters and it is better to see it set out as a duty on the face of the bill <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i confess that i was deeply dismayed at the immediate response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to this amendment <e> <s> the individual or fellow citizen he may be an immigrant or a foreigner has been given what is deemed to be something of a privilege to appear before this tribunal <e> <s> therefore one would expect that he would be given a reasonable opportunity to put his case <e> <s> but no because if he puts his case fully he may endanger security <e> <s> is he to sit there silent <e> <s> so far as i can see there is not a word in the schedule about the procedures of the tribunal as to the circumstances in which the individual is entitled to give evidence or to put his case <e>", "<cs> it is obvious that argument will not take the matter further <e> <s> one has a tribunal provided for in an act of parliament and a procedure that says not one word about the rights and facilities of the person who may come before it <e> <s> this is a sad moment at the end of a difficult day we shall have to return to the matter at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave sadly to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend lord dean of beswick referred to licensed thuggery in the england and wales game i think that he must have been looking at reports of a different match <e> <s> there was only one incidental loss of temper which ended in a moment <e> <s> is that not so <e>", "<cs> in the submission of members on this side of the committee this official secrets bill will achieve far greater public support and acceptability if the amendment which we are now discussing is carried <e> <s> perhaps it is as well that we should remind ourselves of the terms of the amendment before we get into waters with which it is not in any way related <e> <s> the amendment makes it a defence for a person charged with an offence under this bill to prove not to suspect in the case of a trial to the satisfaction of the jury that the information document or other article in question reveals the existence of crime fraud abuse of authority or neglect in the performance of official duty <e> <s> there then follows the strict limitations of the misconduct contemplated <e> <s> that is what needs to be proved <e> <s> a person who wrongly suspects that kind of misconduct would not have the beginning of a defence <e>", "<cs> as a former attorney-general perhaps i may say that to put the reliance for this matter on the attorney-general when the whole weight of opinion that has been expressed today and what has been said by ministers indicates that there ought to be serious damage is a curious idea <e> <s> if that is the conclusion of the committee please do not take shelter behind the fact that the attorney-general being a sensible man would bring proceedings only in respect of serious damage <e> <s> that is the most tortured logic if i may say so <e>", "<cs> come and join us <e>", "<cs> this is a glorious and memorable moment <e> <s> i am not sure this is not the first time that we have heard those encouraging words today <e> <s> it is better to hear them later than never <e> <s> i am delighted to accept the undertaking of the noble earl and in the circumstances i shall sit down <e>", "<cs> i shall not go into an adjectival description of the governments skin which seems to me pretty hidebound <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the governments action on the face of it look like a surrender to both terrorism and vandalism <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps as well to remember that what we are about here is to create a criminal offence and therefore if that is to be done it must be clear and comprehensible <e> <s> we are talking about a matter which must be considered by a jury <e> <s> also there will be public and press interest in the language of any new criminal offence that we create <e>", "<cs> naturally we shall consider very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> however in the light of his explanation of what is proposed i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the massive list of speakers a good cricket score of over half a century must have broken the record for the house as a whole and certainly for early morning sessions on a friday <e> <s> the number of speakers and if i may say so their authority and distinction reflects the importance of the many issues that are raised by the three green papers which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has introduced <e> <s> those issues are of great importance and not only to those involved in their various ways in the administration of justice the judges the barristers the solicitors several of whom it is a great pleasure to note are to take part in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon let me go back to square one <e> <s> they are suffering from chronic underfunding and that alas <e> <s> is the serious case <e> <s> in particular law centres have suffered long and still suffer from local government finance <e> <s> the governments attitude has been it is nothing to do with us <e> <s> local government must finance that <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and other noble lords will know i have had many long battles on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may be permitted to ask him to clarify first whether the government are willing to give an extension of time for further consultations to take place secondly whether he is prepared even at this point of time to enter into consultations with the judiciary the <e>", "<cs> my lords is there to be a white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord be accompanied on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government intending to take steps in the immediate situation with these hundreds of schoolchildren badly needing facilities in school <e> <s> there is accommodation for them but there are not enough teachers <e> <s> do the government intend to stand by and do nothing apart from conferring <e>", "<cs> my lords are the penalties which can be imposed on those who commit these criminal offences adequate <e> <s> should they be increased <e> <s> should there be a general warning in view of the threat to the public at large as noble lords have said previously of this malpractice which is what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the sombre statement of the home secretary <e> <s> the whole house will join with him in offering our deep sympathy to the bereaved families of the many victims and to those who were injured in saturdays terrible tragedy at hillsborough <e> <s> the whole nation shared and still shares in their grief and their suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless are there not considerable limitations to the role and value of the judicial review in dealing with alleged misuse of executive power and certainly as regards the possibility of the grant of compensation <e> <s> is there now not room for extending the role of judicial review which is largely directed to examining how the decision complained of was arrived at into an examination of administrative action which results in what might be claimed to be an actual misuse of executive power <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to what the noble earl has said <e> <s> however there is a serious point here <e> <s> when one thinks of <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i am saying <e> <s> it is why in that case there would be wide dissemination in regard to prior publication <e> <s> i must confess to paternity of the phrase wide dissemination which was so cruelly rejected by the noble earl <e> <s> it is a pretty good alternative to giving wide publicity <e> <s> however i shall not press that argument too much <e> <s> lest the blame should fall upon the ample shoulders of my noble friend lord mishcon i rush to confession but not avoidance on this occasion <e> <s> we shall certainly give further thought to the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to the noble earl for having met our objection to the indefiniteness of the earlier provisions with these precise terms <e> <s> we accept what is proposed with pleasure particularly as amendment no <e> <s> makes provision for the notification to be terminated at any time if those who are responsible for these matters think fit <e> <s> therefore i gratefully accept the amendment which the noble earl proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that him refers to the commissioner <e> <s> i am now on my feet if i had time i should be able to make the identification immediately <e> <s> however i think that that is the position <e> <s> the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is disappointing <e> <s> the initial point namely that the language <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we need to split any more hairs on that point <e> <s> clearly it is not exclusive of everything else but it is certainly inclusive of those three matters <e> <s> i still submit to the house that these are matters of great importance about which the public is genuinely concerned <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can indicate he may have had it in mind that to be effective the annual report could well and should include these matters without making it a statutory duty to do <e> <s> i detect perhaps too optimistically that that is the mood which has emerged from the discussion of these amendments <e> <s> i hope that i am right <e> <s> in that hope and possible expectation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only regret the response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> the field with which we are concerned responsibly today is an important and delicate one and we should be able to carry parliament and the public with us <e>", "<cs> my lords it was prior publication <e>", "<cs> my lords there is still no prior publication defence in the bill in regard to the most important and serious matters covered by it <e> <s> it was not i who introduced patagonia but a noble lord from the other side of the house <e> <s> i felt it to be my patriotic duty to come to the aid of the patagonians <e> <s> temporarily they were put under potential suspicion

stages <e> <s> indeed he dealt with it single-handed from the government side and all through the various long discussions that we have had moving with agility from the woolsack and <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that at any rate some if not many of those in prison on remand may be acquitted when their trials take place <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that it is therefore essential

deliberations of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the massive controversy which the proposals in the green papers have raised and bringing the matter somewhat nearer home does this not

made as regards the decision-making <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that of those remanded in custody per cent <e> <s> are either acquitted or given non-custodial sentences at their trial <e>
