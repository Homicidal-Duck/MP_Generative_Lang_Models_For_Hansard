["<cs> my lords during my last five years membership of another place i had the honour to serve as a deputy speaker <e> <s> most of my time in the chair was spent in coaxing and exhorting honourable members to curtail the length of their speeches <e> <s> therefore one of the attractions for me of member ship of your lordships house is that in the house resolved and i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the minister to indicate that in certain circumstances he is prepared to take action <e> <s> i wonder whether he would indicate to the house the nature of the action and under what circumstances it would be taken <e>", "<cs> i am sure that noble lords will know full well that it is universally accepted that every police force <e>", "<cs> i take it that the noble lord lord foot is proceeding on the basis of one detainee or one witness <e> <s> let us suppose that there is a fight and there are or witnesses <e> <s> how does <e>", "<cs> but the amendment says no more than half an hour <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate a question <e> <s> the person who is cited for precognition can be examined by the accused himself and show appearance with no one else present i presume but the accused examines the witness who has been cited for precognition and according to subsection if he fails to give evidence he is liable ultimately to days in prison <e> <s> will this individual be under oath when he is being examined by the accused <e> <s> if not how are we to establish that someone has committed an offence <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has any knowledge of or is in possession of figures showing the number of accused who plead guilty during the course of the trial itself <e> <s> it might help us make up our minds on this matter <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to deal with one or two points <e> <s> as i understand it one of the main concerns is that a proper trial should be conducted <e> <s> if an accused misconducts himself he can be removed from the court <e> <s> how can the appointment of counsel or a solicitor to represent the accuseds interests during his absence and while the trial continues result in a fair trial <e> <s> if a solicitor and counsel are pitchforked into a case and there is no mention of an adjournment of the trial it is to continue as i read the subsection except for time to allow for the appointment of a solicitor and counsel how can they be instructed by their client <e> <s> that would be impossible unless the lord advocate is to tell us that there will be an adjournment until such time as a solicitor is instructed and the solicitor instructs counsel so as to ensure that a proper trial is continued <e> <s> unless that is written into the subsection it will make a farce of the trial <e>", "<cs> but he would not be able to decide that point since he would have been out of court <e>", "<cs> as regards payment under the criminal injuries act can the noble and learned lord the lord advocate say what the position would be where compensation has been awarded to someone who has received personal <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble and learned lord has allowed me to introduce ideas which may arise later <e> <s> on the question whether everyone who receives criminal injuries would receive compensation under the criminal injuries act in a substantial number of cases substantial damages are awarded <e> <s> is it not the case that if a similar amount of damages or damages equal to the amount the individual could have made application to claim under the criminal injuries act are awarded the one would have to wait upon the other <e> <s> it might be a long while before he received any money money which might be urgently needed because of the severe criminal injuries which he had sustained <e>", "<cs> let us assume that was the sum which such a person could have obtained under the criminal injuries act and that compensation of <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord when replying would deal with a situation such as the one i am going to describe where a football supporters club own a bus and one member of the association drives the bus free of charge or they take turns at driving the bus <e> <s> how is the driver dealt with in a situation where they are carrying drink <e> <s> the driver is not an employee of the association and the bus has no owner except the association <e> <s> therefore how would the noble and learned lord the lord advocate or for that matter the noble earl lord mansfield propose to deal with a situation of that kind <e>", "<cs> the clause does not say driver it say employee <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is nothing really new so far as i see it <e> <s> in my opinion it is only an extension of what is present day practice so far as most trades are concerned <e> <s> quite a number of trades i know of have published their own codes of conduct and retailers and traders and people who buy or sell their appliances or goods are expected to conform to certain conditions suggested by the trades associations <e> <s> i see no possible difficulty if the minister or the director were called upon in following the practice of these trade associations <e> <s> it would be most helpful and most welcome to these trade associations <e> <s> some of the recommendations may be in conflict with the code of practice already utilised by the various traders and in that respect we can avoid the conflict by getting to know exactly what the director himself thinks of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to amend clause <e> <s> the marginal note states <e>", "<cs> my lords last thursday i had the good fortune to watch a television programme called <e>", "<cs> why then do the government still persist in putting forward clause <e> <s> why not drop it if it will have no effect <e>", "<cs> we are now dealing with transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief and i wish to refer only to clause about which i am uneasy <e> <s> it refers to <e>", "<cs> the noble earl in his opening contribution to this debate has said that it would be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it is a wrecking amendment but not to wreck the local authority which decides to offer certain houses under certain conditions for sale to tenants <e> <s> but it is a wrecking amendment in as much as it opposes the trend that many local councils and councillors are finding in scotland a trend now to centralise all the work that is being done and has been done over the years by local authorities into the hands of the government themselves <e> <s> the amendment rightly says that it will make arrangements <e>", "<cs> the noble lord fails to see that if one sells a house that house is removed from the realm of letting <e> <s> the person who is looking for a house is not in a position to buy the house but if it belonged to the local authority he may have been the lucky one to get it rented to him <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> i think that eight years is a more practical period <e> <s> i am afraid that there will be some people who will move in by way of business if the period is three years <e> <s> there will be people moving in who have no interest apart from making a fast buck by working some kind of dodge that they will devise and the house could be sold after three years <e>", "<cs> i imagine that those who will seek to buy their corporation or council houses will probably accept the valuation placed on those properties by the surveyor selected by the local council <e> <s> i do not like the idea of a surveyor being selected by the local council because there may be a tendency in order that he should get as much business as possible from the local authority for him to put a slightly higher valuation on the property than would say the district valuer <e> <s> i believe he should be a completely independent man not engaged by the local council <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made one point very clear to the committee and that is that the substantial discounts are the main attraction are the carrot which is being dangled in front of the sitting tenant but he goes on to try to soften the amount of discount by indicating that because it is the sale of a house with a sitting tenant the value for sale will be substantially less than if it had been a house which was untenanted <e> <s> does he realise then what a rush there could be <e> <s> because the individual if he is smart enough will be buying a house even below its market value because it is tenanted <e> <s> all right at the time he gets a lower discount than he would have got if it had been an untenanted house but all he has to do is to wait for the qualifying period and then he can offer an untenanted house at a far higher price than the one for which he got a reduced discount because of the fact it was a tenanted house <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has this evening given us the best possible argument for these houses being excluded from the provision compelling local authorities to sell houses <e> <s> he said that if we remove the words <e>", "<cs> i have just one point <e> <s> i was wondering whether the noble earl could tell us how it comes about that local authorities do not seem to experience any difficulty in arriving at what is a house specially designed for the needs of elderly or disabled people <e> <s> they do not let them out to physically fit people they have no problem in that respect at all <e> <s> why should there be any difficulty when it comes to the government including this particular type of house <e> <s> as i have already said the great danger lies in the fact that it passes out on sale from the use for elderly or disabled people and physically non-handicapped people take <e>", "<cs> one of the points which i wanted to raise earlier in reply to the noble earls difficulties has already been made by the noble earl who has spoken from the cross-benches <e> <s> it seemed to <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl ought to agree to this amendment <e> <s> as a practising advocate surely he knows that a solicitor appearing on behalf of a local authority to defend their reason for refusing the sub-tenancy would regard it as his duty to explain to the sheriff those sections of the act which had to be paid heed to in order to avoid overcrowding which would constitute a criminal offence <e> <s> that is the duty of the local authoritys solicitor or agent acting on their behalf <e> <s> but for whatever reason as i would hope that he would accept this amendment my noble friend lord ross has now agreed that sheriffs do have some wisdom because earlier he said you dont know our sheriffs in scotland <e> <s> i am glad that he now recognises that without this instruction or attention being drawn to this particular possibility they can use their own judgment and decide whether or not a refusal was justified <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down if the petitioner was failing in his duty towards his client i am quite sure that the client if it happened to be a local authority would make sure that that was his first and only argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord mansfield for noticing that i am here <e> <s> it will save me the bother of bringing in a cushion in order that my head should appear above the back of the seats <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord ross has repeated what is generally accepted as a very strong case it will not merely allow young people who have moved in and stayed there for three years to buy their houses but indirectly it will confer a very great benefit on them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to answer a simple question <e> <s> he has made great play of the inducement offered by the discount to attract a would-be purchaser <e> <s> i should like him to explain where he sees a financial or other advantage coming to a public sector tenant from purchasing his house by way of discount <e> <s> does he see the advantage arising from being a householder instead of a tenant or is the attraction that as soon as he qualifies to sell the house he will profit at least to the extent of the discount he got a few years earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl replies can he give an indication of the amount that will be awarded to the sitting tenant when he buys his house <e> <s> in other words has the noble earl any idea what price the average council house will fetch and what in financial terms will be the saving to a prospective buyer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for giving us that interesting figure but because i do not wish to do him an injustice may i also ask him this question am i right in concluding that what he has just told the house is that the main attraction for the sitting tenant of a public sector house to buy the house which he occupies which he rents is in order and i hope i have the words right to bear a greater share of his housing costs <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will tell that to all the tenants that he is inviting to become owners of their houses <e> <s> but it may be that i am doing him an injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully expected the minister to have circumvented a debate on this particular amendment this afternoon <e> <s> i thought he would readily agree to accept it and i still hope that he will <e> <s> i hope that he is going to give us all a very pleasant surprise this afternoon <e> <s> i spent almost years in the service of the glasgow corporation and the housing policy of that corporation throughout the whole of that period was and still is a desire to transfer widows or widowers from larger houses far larger than are necessary for their actual needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise the same point as that raised by the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> i fail to see the difference between the wording of clause and the amendment that we are moving <e> <s> the minister made great play of the difficulty to establish how a house is specially designed <e> <s> would he care to undertake to give us some indication how this clause would not allow as wide an interpretation as the amendment allows as to the kind of house that has been specially designed for elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the section of the community to whom we are going to make this offer of bargain houses do not embrace in their daily conversation and discussion the state of the stock market or the buying or selling of houses <e> <s> they know all about paying rent and about applying to the social security department but they are not interested in stocks and shares and they have not many friends who have been buying and selling their own homes <e> <s> in school they get no education as to what is involved in buying houses <e> <s> i hope that some day they will be given some tuition on that aspect <e> <s> i am sure the noble earl as a house owner realises the many problems which can beset the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested in what the noble lord lord drumalbyn has said <e> <s> he has read the standing orders of the house dealing with the question of the amendment submitted by my noble friend lord ross <e> <s> he himself reads the standing orders and tells us that it is undesirable <e> <s> there are many things i do which my wife says would be undesirable but she does not prohibit me from doing them <e> <s> the question is whether one is entitled to interpret the word undesirable as something which cannot be done <e>", "<cs> my lords coming from a different atmosphere into this one and having sat in the chair in the other place one could not argue there on a standing order <e> <s> that may be the practice here but it does not prohibit one <e> <s> the noble lord himself went on to argue the case <e> <s> he ended by arguing that my noble friend lord ross was wrong in submitting it <e> <s> he gave reasons for saying so <e> <s> he himself was doing something contrary to what he alleges to be the standing orders <e> <s> however the point is that if it is out of order then somebody must rule that it is out of order <e> <s> somebody should do that if that is the attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that somebody should rule that it is out of order and that that will finish it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the chief whip is prepared to rule that it is out of order i will abide by the rules <e> <s> if he is prepared to rule that it is undesirable means that you cannot discuss it i will accept that decision <e> <s> what i am trying to get at is the meaning of the word undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords all i wanted to say is that if we consider the circumstances this amendment is largely as a result of the contribution made by the minister during the debate <e> <s> he said that the earlier one was in conflict with clause <e> <s> it was put to him from several parts of the house that we could easily get rid of clause if that was his only problem <e> <s> we think that the noble lord lord ross of marnock has this afternoon produced an amendment that would be acceptable <e> <s> in my opinion that is what the minister was seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the minister for his kind reference to my health <e> <s> i hope i have not by virtue of regaining some of it unduly disturbed the activities of the house in what is happening this afternoon saying that probably somebody should rule me and my noble friend lord ross out of order because of something which is contrary to the standing orders <e> <s> i must say i have enjoyed very much indeed my first participation in a bill of this kind at all the various stages <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in view of some considerable <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble earl in his excellent opposition to the proposed addition after clause <e> <s> what has puzzled me throughout the whole of this debate is when the noble lord lord boothby said let us get rid of it this afternoon <e> <s> we will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat that i quoted what the late lord kilmuir said in this house on th may <e> <s> is that what the noble lord referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the noble lord lord boothby introduced a bill in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but i have been referred to as a former deputy speaker <e> <s> may i intimate to your lordships that slipped in is a parliamentary phrase it is parliamentary language <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether we could ask in view of what he has just said whether he and his party will now bring forward without any delay a similar bill for northern ireland <e>", "<cs> well there you are <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble earl lord mansfield a simple question <e> <s> does he really wish to help the elderly people whom we are trying to help by way of this amendment <e> <s> if he answers yes then his action is a very simple one <e> <s> it is to accept the amendment and enable the people for whom we are speaking to be allowed to occupy these houses and not have them being sold <e> <s> i speak on behalf of the hundreds of tenants in glasgow who are sitting in waiting for houses of a type not substantially different from ordinary dwelling-houses but which have facilities for occupation by elderly persons <e> <s> to me the reason for the insertion of the words substantially different gives a clue to what will be the yardstick for deciding whether a house that has been adapted for occupation really is to be excluded by way of sale <e> <s> if on the one hand one is going to argue that it must be substantially different then it seems to me that a house adapted for occupation or designed for that purpose will equally have to be substantially different whereas the type of houses that i know of in the <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened carefully to the noble earls statement of his case i am amazed to think that he believes and he quotes the situation in dundee i presume from the <e>", "<cs> i thought the noble earl wished to give an idea of how these additional houses were going to be sorted out from the ordinary municipal tenanted houses <e> <s> the whole question revolves round whether the government really wish to help the category of people who are clamouring for houses <e> <s> if we allow the bill to go as it stands without amendment it will mean that these people will end their days in misery without ever being able to get into a house which would make their lives more comfortable in their latter days <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the valuation increase can the noble minister state whether the devaluation in scotland will take place according to statutory requirement or is there any possibility of its being postponed <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down my lords is he prepared to answer the question i asked which was regarded as irrelevant at that point <e> <s> will he answer it now please <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether in view of the catastrophic situation which is about to occur on clydeside the scottish ministers are prepared to take any steps to try to influence by some economic advantages the datsun company to consider establishing their company in the linwood area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has agreed this afternoon that the local people desire public services but they have a greater regard for the incidence of the amount of rates that they have to pay for the provision of them <e> <s> we have heard this afternoon the statement that some local authorities have paid wages which are beyond the guidelines and far too high <e> <s> is it then suggested bearing in mind that the highest percentage of local government expenditure goes on wages and salaries that the wages and salaries ought to be cut <e> <s> furthermore in cases where local authorities carry out a sincere and genuine review for that is what they are being asked to do now irrespective of what has gone before and are unable to effect any cuts will the government or the secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the israelis have agreed to enter into cease-fire negotiations with the lebanese but not with the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords only a few weeks ago the workforce in the shipyard decided to carry on despite the fact that the contract with britoil had been lost <e> <s> today the workforce has come out on strike and left the factory as a protest against the method of handling the transfer of the effects of the shipyard to trafalgar house <e> <s> bearing that in mind will the noble lord ensure that british shipbuilders will be instructed to invite tenders for the transfer of the scott lithgow shipyard and that the period of time for lodging tenders will not be unreasonable <e> <s> i particularly ask about that because already in scotland in the instances of the transfer of the technical college at hamilton and the sale of the robroyston hospital great bargains were offered and in one case that was due to the fact that tenders were not even invited <e> <s> therefore will the noble lord see to it that a reasonable opportunity will be given to anyone who is interested in submitting a tender <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain to the house what we are to understand by the declaration by the leader of the other place that the government would test the strength of the other place against that of the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm a recent newpaper report to the effect that the ira contributed to the plo <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree in distinguishing between the two categories of creditors that the small trader has facilities through the trade for ascertaining the financial standing of the company which he proposes to supply with goods whereas the small man knows nothing of those circumstances or of the method of ascertaining whether his per cent <e> <s> deposit will be lost <e> <s> therefore he is at a distinct disadvantage as compared with the small trader who has trade facilities which can guide him as to the financial stability of the firm which he proposes to supply <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the construction of two additional courts in the existing high court buildings in glasgow would it not be advisable at least to obtain powers to increase the number to as suggested by my noble friend lord morton to be ready for those courts coming into use <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has acknowledged that this very important matter is before the scottish courts at the present time <e> <s> he says that the question of what will be the decision is hypothetical <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> it may be in favour of mr boveys submissions or it may be against them <e> <s> if the court is in his favour the noble earl explains to the house that certain steps will have to be taken by the treasury and other departments <e> <s> what is the urgency that prevents us saying that we should delay the whole business until we have an opinion from the courts <e> <s> after all as the matter has been dragging on for quite a number of years why can we not delay it a little further until the courts rule on the submission <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible that the court may decide differently on the effect of the act and that this is what is subject to consideration by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the noble lords explanation regarding the satisfactory promises which he has received as a result of his amendment being rejected <e> <s> however since he received the assurances a new situation has developed because the whole matter is now before the courts in scotland <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord a simple question <e> <s> is he against delaying this bill until such time as the courts have ruled on the submissions which are now being made to them <e>", "<cs> during the second reading of this bill references were constantly made to the position in scotland and many people accepted the arguments that if this position was good enough for scotland then it would be good enough to be extended to england and wales <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that in scotland where sunday opening has been operating for quite a number of years now per cent <e> <s> of the retailers open between and allowing half an hour only for the assistants lunch period <e>", "<cs> no but i do not think that we are discussing the question of petrol <e> <s> we have accepted the sale of petrol as being something which already entails sunday opening <e> <s> it is something which the entire british people accept without needing to have bills in that respect <e>", "<cs> in the city of glasgow the local authority already possesses powers to deal with the opening of shops <e> <s> in some parts of the city shops have abandoned the weekly half-day holiday <e> <s> in other parts the weekly half-day has to be observed <e> <s> but there is machinery for those that are closed at the present time to apply to the local authority for permission to open <e>", "<cs> i am referring to the powers possessed regarding the times of opening of shops <e> <s> in some sections of the city they have abandoned these and are allowed to open on a weekly half-day <e> <s> in other sections the local authority prohibits the opening <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the joint committee may i join the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside in paying a tribute to the chairmanship of the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour for her courteous and conscientious conduct of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have known that and i am sorry <e> <s> i am getting on in years and

cockburn association <e> <s> it is the honourable lord cameron kt <e> <s> the chairman of the council is the honourable lord cullen <e> <s> one is an office bearer and the other is an honorary

happen <e> <s> everything is all just projects theory and we do not know what will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i have always understood and i have heard it
