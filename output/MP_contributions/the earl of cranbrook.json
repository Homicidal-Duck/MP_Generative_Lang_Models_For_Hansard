["<cs> my lords at the very outset i wish to stress to you and i am sure your lordships will join me in recognising this that the draft directive which we are discussing is as the noble lord lord ashby has said laudable in its general objectives <e> <s> the substances whose discharge into the waters of community members is to be controlled are poisons as your lordships will very well know <e> <s> the effect of these poisons is cumulative and so may not be seen immediately <e> <s> it may in fact take many years to become apparent <e> <s> the poisons are absorbed into fish and other living organisms in the case of fish chiefly through their gills because the fish is unable to excrete the poison it has accumulated in its tissues <e> <s> the poison can be further accumulated in the tissues of predatory creatures whether birds or men who eat the fish <e> <s> the problems in this country in the past have unfortunately brought about death in avian predators rather than in man but this is none the less a problem of which we must all be aware and we must congratulate the commission on turning its attention to the environment and on tackling this one specific aspect at this juncture <e> <s> i feel it is the duty of your lordships house to support the commission and the council over this initiative in their efforts to reduce or to eliminate these substances from the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble viscount lord thurso in congratulating the noble lord lord ritchie-calder on having raised this important and topical subject <e> <s> i also join the noble lord lord ritchie-calder in hoping that we may receive hot news of the canberra convention which was signed yesterday <e> <s> i join with him also in anticipating what may be said by noble lords in their speeches during this debate though i feel it would be invidious to say whose words i shall value above all <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords who have spoken in congratulating the minister upon his very clear exposition <e> <s> i also welcome the intention of the government in inserting these two extra pieces in what by some curious coincidence both my noble friend the minister and the parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture fisheries and food in another place have termed a legal jigsaw <e>", "<cs> my lords my i ask my noble friend whether the regulations he has just outlined are applicable to england and wales only to great britain or to the entire united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak to your lordships at this rather late hour <e> <s> this matter has been very considerably drawn out <e> <s> but like so many of your lordships i have an impeccable agricultural background i sustain myself as a farmer and i also think i have a comparatively impeccable conservationist background in so far as i am a member of a large number of conservationist organisations <e> <s> these organisations agricultural and conservationist have lobbied me as intensively as they have lobbied many of your lordships <e> <s> i should like to say particularly to those of your lordships who pay great weight to the conservationist issues that i think the problem has been blown up <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord melchett would agree in his heart that he has expanded to a very great degree the problems that conservationists face <e>", "<cs> my lords i must perhaps apologise for addressing the house and also for the fact that an exceptionally busy day on your lordships select committee for the european communities has largely kept me out of the chamber and prevented me from having the opportunity of hearing much that has been said to great advantage this afternoon <e> <s> i join other members of your lordships house in welcoming this important bill <e> <s> in particular i echo my noble friend lord craigton in welcoming the extent of consultation that went on before this bill reached its present form <e> <s> nonetheless i am sure that all your lordships agree that there is a considerable sharpening of opinion through being presented with the actual text of a bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be appropriate to couple my amendment no <e> <s> with my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i feel that it would be since this is the point which the noble lord opposite has just taken into account and in regard to which i stopped rather abruptly before wandering on to it <e> <s> so with the permission of the committee i would point out that the biological difference to which the noble lord has drawn attention applies to of the species of birds listed in schedule <e> <s> that is to say of the species of birds in respect of which we are agreed it is the intention of the clause to apply protection to the young while they are still in a state of requiring the care and attention of their parents in order to survive young birds leave the nest as soon as they hatch <e> <s> they are then led shepherded by an attendant parent often for considerable distances from the nest <e> <s> in the case of water birds for instance the first journey of hatchlings might be of many yards from the nest site to the water <e> <s> such birds remain totally dependent on the parent bird for warmth at night by brooding or for simple instructions on how to find food and so on <e>", "<cs> i take note of my noble friends words which seem very much to encompass the greater part of my amendment no <e> <s> and in anticipation of seeing future action from the government i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would only like to make the point that as the noble lord lord sandys has said and the noble earl lord caithness has just mentioned if a famer knows that there is the nest of a protected species on pasture and again one can look at the list and see that there would would be comparatively few then it would be remiss of him to proceed with agricultural operations <e> <s> i take it that when the noble lord lord sandys referred to unforeseen he was discussing the general probability that if one knows that there are let us say little ringed plovers in the area and one is planning to take an agricultural operation during the nesting season over suitable ground there might possibly be a nest there <e> <s> in that case it could be said it was genuinely unforeseen <e> <s> but i should have thought that if he meant that in general probability there would be likely to be a nest in the area proposed for an agricultural operation then i feel there is a general sentiment that such action would be remiss <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord houghton has chosen to rake up some of the murky activities from my past before i was a member of your lordships house i feel constrained to say a few words to point out first that the document he refers to was concerned primarly with cruelty not conservation <e> <s> secondly there is more than one kind of airgun <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard has just mentioned there are undoubtedly airguns which are capable of killing animals <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble baroness upon very succinctly and concisely putting together what as the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has just said would be a very radical rearrangement of the bill <e> <s> that would quite adequately meet my own objections namely that the vulnerable species other than birds are not adequately catered for by the bill as it stands <e> <s> it would also be a uniquely british approach <e> <s> as the noble earl lord avon said in the committee last week in the conservation of birds the british have perhaps led the field and the reverse-listing procedure is an extremely useful step in taking care of species which are not necessarily pests and are not in any great urgent need of protection <e> <s> however having said that i feel that that proposal would be a great step forward none the less i am inclined to feel that to take this uniquely british approach at this stage might be so fraught with so many difficulties and objections that one would have to consider it rather carefully before being quite so radical in altering the approach which is laid down by the berne convention itself <e>", "<cs> i do not altogether share the attitude of the noble lord lord donaldson and my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton because the aim of the schedule as the minister clearly pointed out is to establish that there is a self-sufficient captive population that is that they are birds that are bred into aviculture caged birds born and bred laid and bred i had better say and are as cage-trained as canaries <e> <s> i do not wish to discredit the field of aviculture which attracts a great many people but which clearly must be legitimised and as i said at the outset the purpose of the schedule as i understand it is the legitimise the practices of aviculture where our native bird species are concerned <e>", "<cs> i also rise in defence of bats <e> <s> in regard to this bill all bats are in schedule and it is clearly the intention of the bill to protect bats <e> <s> the one point to stress initially is the importance of artificial roosting sites for bats <e> <s> this country in its unnatural deforested state and rendered uninhabitable for bats largely by the intrusive presence of man none the less can carry some benefits to bats in so far as those parts of the houses in which men do not live are in many cases highly advantageous as bat homes and it is to such parts of houses that the noble lord lord craigton was referring <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention in any way to ban the activities of the pearl fishermen of perthshire <e> <s> it is in their interests that their activities should be monitored and if necessary controlled <e> <s> if my amendment were accepted it would be necessary for them to apply for a licence <e> <s> there are not many people concerned <e> <s> the licence one assumes would be readily given but with the appropriate controls and returns this would enable our national scientific advisory body to control the pearl mussel to ensure that there was a continuous supply of pearl mussels of the right age bringing pearls on to the market <e> <s> this is a traditional activity which is one i regard as of cultural and commercial importance in scotland and also in parts of wales where the water is of sufficient purity to permit the pearl mussels to live <e>", "<cs> the adder is one of the pearls in the crown of the british islands and i am delighted that the noble earl has adders which he can show to us <e>", "<cs> before withdrawing the amendment i must make two points <e> <s> first if my <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on a point of clarification when i used those words i meant to say that the owners of these houses are very much aware of the colonies in their houses <e> <s> they very strongly support the presence of the colonies in their houses and are good friends of the bats <e>", "<cs> just briefly in answer to the noble lord who has just spoken may i once again draw attention to this pamphlet which is produced by the society for the promotion of nature conservation <e> <s> i am sorry to have misinformed your lordships <e> <s> there are three paragraphs explaining precisely how bats may be driven out of a building without harming them how bats may subsequently be excluded from a building and how buildings may safely be treated against rot without in any way injuring the bat <e> <s> these points have been thought of information is available <e> <s> clearly this information is not yet widely enough disseminated <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely delighted with that solution which is precisely the one i proposed <e> <s> i would only point out in self-defence that this curious word aurasian is taken directly from schedule of the bill <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely certain that if anyone was to use a mammal as live bait it would be under his control and it would be an offence under the cruelty to animals act <e> <s> equally i am sure that it does not occur <e> <s> i also believe that if my noble friend lord ferrers was to consult with the fishing community at large he would find that on the whole there is a general distaste for the use of live bait of any kind <e> <s> this he will be able to verify by reference to the representative voluntary bodies concerned with fishing and also by perusal of the fishing literature <e> <s> on those grounds i do not believe that he need fear the amendment of the noble lord lord houghton <e>", "<cs> that does not really answer my question <e> <s> i heard my noble friend very clearly refer to the killing of animals and i want to stress again that i am not discussing a trap which kills <e> <s> i am discussing a trap which keeps alive <e> <s> if the nature conservancy council wishes to be burdened with this excessively large number of licensing requests then that must be so <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that schools universities adult education centres and so on throughout the country which are making use of that longworth trap will find this a bureaucratic nuisance <e> <s> but if my noble friend is able to consult with his advisers and to stress the fact that i am not talking about the killing of any schedule mammals or in fact about the killing of any mammals at all i am talking about the kind of trap which catches them and keeps them alive i think he will perhaps be able to reassure me that this peculiar phraseology in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am greatly reassured to hear from my noble friend that there is no restriction on the longworth trap <e> <s> that fact now being on the record i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> just in case it makes it easier for my noble friend on the front bench may i point out to him that under article of the berne convention to which this country is a contracting party all appendix iii animals are to be protected from indiscriminate means of killing and all deer are included in the appropriate schedule <e>", "<cs> at the risk of boring the committee i should like to reiterate a point which has been made from the front bench <e> <s> it is a sentiment which i heartily support that this bill is about conservation that is to say about the appropriate management of our wildlife resources in this country <e> <s> the national trust has exercised its trust in an admirable fashion in managing the wildlife resource of an extremely small and fragile part of our national environmental heritage the farne islands which i hope many of your lordships have visited because it is an experience of extreme delight <e>", "<cs> do i take it that my noble friend was not going to resist the amendment or that if he is not given time to consider it he will resist it <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> i would remind him that there are a lot of people waiting for the answer as well as myself <e> <s> with those words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the form of words that has been suggested seems to me to leave the decision with the scientific authority which is precisely the request i make <e> <s> therefore in these terms i am glad to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the lateness of the hour led us into the delusion that we were addressing each other <e> <s> in fact i spoke inadvertently to amendment no <e> <s> and my noble friend spoke to amendment no <e> <s> i was sharp enough to notice that we were not talking about the same thing <e> <s> but under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw no <e> <s> the amendment to which i should have been speaking <e>", "<cs> it was simply consequential in fact on the amendments i withdrew <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i should have thought that the legitimate activities of zoos and museums would have been covered by licensing possibly by general licensing and would not have created the problems that he has suggested they would <e> <s> i note with interest the fact that he has informed the house that the movements of live specimens that are imported will be carefully monitored after their importation which is an interesting and valuable point to have had made <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the discussion so far has concentrated entirely on birds but if i am not mistaken we are also concerned with other animals including those which are in schedule <e> <s> we know that the red squirrel has been added to schedule and the schedule already contains seriously threatened mammals and other vertebrates and invertebrates <e> <s> may i seek assurances for the record that the licensing system will be equally particular where it is applied to non-bird species <e>", "<cs> when redrafting can i hope that it will be made zoologically literate by admitting that birds and mammals are included in animals <e>", "<cs> i wish to express a small measure of disquiet in so far as this clause is expressly concerned with birds <e> <s> i recognise first that the bill re-enacts the protection of birds acts and secondly that there is a european community directive on wild birds but i have previously sought assurance in particularly when we were discussing clause that the conditions of licensing exceptions to clause animals those coming under schedule should be treated with the same consideration as those relating to birds <e>", "<cs> may i pick up a phrase from the noble baroness and assert with confidence that unless the ncc however vastly it may spread however enormous its army of research workers may become and whatever funds may be given it keeps in close touch with the voluntary bodies the ncc itself will be unable to keep track of what is happening to the wildlife in this country <e> <s> it is the voluntary bodies who have their ears to the ground their noses to the grindstone or whatever one may call it <e> <s> these voluntary bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may draw your lordships attention from the broad perspectives that the noble lord lord taylor has just illustrated so well and bring your lordships down from the great open spaces of the highlands where most of the noble lords on this side of the house have their experience to the problem of small wood-lands in rural lowland england <e> <s> here i declare an interest <e> <s> the scope of my interest is hectares of dedicated woodland and i consider from that standpoint i am reasonably well acquainted with the problems that are faced by the small farmer and landowner in the english countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the timber marketing industry is more geared to importing exotic hardwoods nowadays than to dealing with our native species <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that research directed towards the possibility of eradication might also be fruitful <e>", "<cs> my lords the european community was founded on great ideals <e> <s> if we look at the map we may not consider that it is a natural geographical unit for environmental concern but it is a natural political unit for environmental concern because it has as has been emphasised by noble lords in the debate this evening the legislative teeth to implement its directives <e> <s> speaking personally i should like to associate myself with the thanks that the noble lord lord northfield expressed to the noble baroness lady white who unfortunately has had to leave us this evening for her past chairmanship of this sub-committee and express my own personal gratitude for the considerate way in which she eased me into the chair as her successor <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes without saying that this amendment has my hearty support <e> <s> it is essential to be absolutely precise about the latin spelling <e> <s> for instance amendment no <e> <s> a is relevant to draw to your lordships attention <e> <s> i still disagree with the government on the fact that this unnatural ordering of species is not convenient for biologists and is certainly not convenient for anyone in the international field who is trying to keep abreast of british legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow briefly the noble lord lord melchett in pressing the moral issue <e> <s> this country has led a movement which has enforced upon the unwilling nations of europe particularly italy the guardian of the alpine passes an eec directive which has prevented the italians from shooting birds which occur in myriads in their country but which in our country we protect that is to say the small migratory passerines <e> <s> the united kingdom with its rich shores carries the same kind of responsibility as do the mediterranean countries with their migratory passerines <e> <s> we are guardians of a large proportion of what is essentially an international bird population moving around on its migratory journeys and as such we have no right to claim the leadership or the capacity to lead unless we ourselves can show that there is no beam in our own eye <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is also down in connection with this amendment <e> <s> i listened carefully to the noble earl lord ferrers and i note he considers there may be alarm and concern among the general public if this amendment is allowed to go forward <e> <s> i believe that if he were to give appropriate publicity to it the general public would be reassured rather than alarmed and concerned because this amendment which has been so carefully phrased by the noble lord lord craigton is a final fallback on what seems to be acceptable <e> <s> it points a path whereby the public can get what is in fact a highly expert opinion <e> <s> the institute of terrestrial ecology has led research i would say europewide into the behaviour and habits of bats <e> <s> the ncc will undoubtedly have close connection with them and in following the provisions in the clause as devised by the noble lord lord craigton members of the public wishing to rid their houses of bats without contravening the law that is to say without killing the bats will be led instantly to the best advice obtainable anywhere in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government intend to proceed in this direction and if the government who are a signatory to the berne convention do not intend to complete the requirements of the berne convention exactly how will they then proceed to the ratification of the berne convention <e>", "<cs> my lords under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i confirm that in fact species that occur only in the channel islands are the proper province of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the time that i withdrew the original amendment i believe that this form of amendment will be widely welcomed by the scientific authority <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a technical point <e> <s> the noble earl has drawn my attention to the fact that i have failed to check the proofs of my amendments adequately <e> <s> in fact i was seeking to invoke the provisions of clause only <e> <s> i think my noble friend on the front bench realised this and he spoke to the amendment as if i had been doing what i intended to do there was very clearly no misunderstanding <e> <s> despite the slip your lordships house understood very clearly because i made it absolutely clear and i think the noble earl lord ferrers understood very clearly that i intended to invoke subsection that is only the control of sale <e> <s> following up the words of the noble lord lord beaumont i stress the fact that by controlling the sale by monitoring what is happening to these animals not only do we anticipate a disadvantageous or even dangerous situation which renders them more vulnerable which may occur through legislation in other countries over which we have no control we protect them in advance of what may occur if the inflow of imported animals dries up <e> <s> at the same time by this very minor level of protection we provide the very information which the scientific authority will require in order to be able to make the assessment that it is required to make on the instructions of the noble earl <e> <s> without adequate information on the trade in these animals it is impossible to discover what pressure mankind is putting on the amphibians and the reptiles of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am moving them all <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a brief intervention <e> <s> i should feel extremely disappointed despite the words of the noble lord lord houghton if i were to feel that there was absolutely no chance whatever of making any progress <e> <s> it would be extremely disappointing both as a supporter of the government and as a member of the sub-committee if i were to feel that the bill in its present form were a total nonstarter <e> <s> we know that the government have their eye on the council of europe and we intend to listen with extreme interest to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> but despite that the bill itself has great merits and can be pursued with a certain sense of realism and dedication <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that the debate has been one of quality and extreme interest to all participants <e> <s> i must draw the attention of the house to a small correction that is necessary to the report <e> <s> it has been brought to my attention that we have not correctly reproduced the draft directive <e> <s> on page xxix in article we have omitted consideration of the vegetable kingdom in other words the word flora has not been copied from the draft directive <e> <s> in fact the directive requires attention to be paid to plants as well as animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord gosford for raising this matter tonight and i am glad to take the chance to say a few words in particular in my position as chairman of sub-committee g of the select committee on the european communities in this house <e> <s> i should like to clear up a little bit the matter of the spaid evidence which was submitted to sub-committee g through the european legislation committee of the house of commons <e> <s> we received this paper in june <e> <s> the house of commons select committee in fact reviewed the evidence of spaid and they referred to this in the th report which was published on th june in which in order to save a little time for my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i might as well inform the noble earl he will see a foonote on page saying that a copy of the spaid evidence was placed in the library of the house of commons and is available to members there <e> <s> since the evidence was directed towards me rather than towards her majestys government it is appropriate that i should say here too that i am placing a copy of the same evidence in the library of this house where it will be available to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege for me to follow the noble baroness lady white with her very wide experience in this environmental field as a member of the royal commission on pollution responsible for the eighth report and also of course as chairman of the select committee on european communities <e> <s> i hope my noble colleague if i may call her that will not accuse me of an indiscretion if i reveal that the date of the debate tonight is a sign of a slight weakening of her negotiating powers but your lordships will agree that it is an honour to have her present on st davids day and hope that she manages to get away to join in whatever festivities there are for the welsh tribes this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to cross the indefinable barrier and from being a mere sound become an unwanted sound and therefore a noise <e> <s> i note that the noble lord lord bishopston spoke of the appeal of bells and my noble friend lord avon spoke of the appeal of decibels as a unit of measurement <e> <s> but seriously my lords i thank your lordships very much for a fruitful and useful debate <e> <s> the sub-committee will note with interest the remarks of noble lords on the other side of the house and i think they will note with particular gratitude two firm statements by my noble friend on this side first that the united kingdom government firmly supports the proposal for an advisory committee for exchange of information on developments in this field and secondly for the assurance that there will be a grant of million from the government which i sincerely hope will be matched by the million from industry if only to make true what we read in <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will consider going further than merely hoping that expertise in conservation would be among the attributes to be sought <e> <s> conservation is not in my opinion to be seen merely as one of several sectoral interests to be balanced when drawing up a water board <e> <s> conservation is as it were a screen or pair of spectacles through which all activities of the water hoard must be viewed <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord sherfield who so ably chaired your lordships select committee inquiry into the water industry <e> <s> i take his lead again and i shall refrain from quoting at large from the select committees published report which is available <e> <s> but i would draw attention to the key issue which is illustrated in among other places the series of questions and answers numbered to that appear on pages to of the evidence published with that report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to stress the point of view which i think is becoming increasingly prevalent and i undoubtedly hope that the success of the united kingdoms contribution to the world conservation strategy in any measurable form will be stressed that conservation is not one sectoral issue to be considered <e> <s> to that extent this amendment is not and i say this with respect to my noble friend lord stanley a divisive issue <e> <s> it is very important indeed considering the statutory obligations that by successive legislation including recent legislation have been laid upon the water authorities that there should be a total perspective of conservation on the authorities <e> <s> it is only if there is awareness of conservation issues at the highest policy-making level that the water boards will be able to exercise their statutory obligations <e> <s> unless there is this awareness when critical issues arise it is only too likely that the conservation viewpoint will be neglected <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the lead very kindly given to me in her admirably interesting and reflective contribution by the noble baroness lady white i think it is perhaps right that i should take this opportunity to expand somewhat on the one theme in which she and i share a very strong interest that is to say environmental issues <e> <s> although as has been remarked by noble lords who have spoken earlier the terms of reference of this inquiry were very broad indeed in fact attention was concentrated particularly on the engineering activities of water authorities and this approach is reflected as the noble lord lord sherfield has indicated in the topics chosen as the main subject headings of the six chapters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be misleading the noble lord and your lordships house if i left any impression that the greater london council was in any way enthusiastic for the scheme <e> <s> it was my enthusiasm and interest in it <e> <s> i was given a very clear briefing on all the reasons why it was perfectly impossible at the time that the planning took place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the wide-ranging and thoughtful speech of the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> she raised many points which if time allowed and it would take a long time i would dearly love to follow to their conclusion <e> <s> in particular she asked members of the committee who were present why they ignored noise <e> <s> i think i can quickly reply that the committee has not ignored noise as a pollutant <e> <s> in fact not long ago it investigated the whole issue of noise pollution control within the community and issued a report <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that i can speak for other members of the committee in saying that we regard noise as a serious pollutant which must be subjected to the same general rules as other forms of pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that there is a certain grammatical error <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie correctly interpreted the intent of the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am heartened and grateful to hear the words of my noble friend the minister particularly his winding-up peroration <e> <s> on his previous exposition so far as i can see there is complete agreement between the select committee and the government which makes me feel that perhaps let us hope we both have it right <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie referred to the one point that has not as it were been fielded the definition of the term stabilise <e> <s> i reiterate that in the view of the select committee it felt that these terms which are practical words should he left undefined in terms of the directive to be defined by use in the field by the practitioners themselves <e> <s> i think that that is the best general approach <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of particular interest to me as a member of the select committee to hear the noble lord lord nugent speak from his special expertise and to hear his opinion of this report <e> <s> as the last man in from the back-benches it would be inappropriate and rash of me to attempt anyhing like the wide-ranging and diverse reviews that your lordships have heard from previous speakers <e> <s> i shall try simply to hit again a ball throught an opening in the field identified by the noble baroness lady white when she spoke of land use surveys <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of the debate so far this evening one or two hobby horses have been put out to browse within the red leather environment of your lordships house and the noble lord lord middleton has loosed a particularly intriguing hare <e> <s> on the other hand as a member of both sub-committees i feel that i have had the opportunity to voice my opinion in general terms of both inquiries under the very able chairmanship of the two noble lords lord greenhill and lord adrian <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord flowers himself a past chairman of the royal commission on environmental pollution of which i am a present member <e> <s> as a present member it is gratifying to note the quality and number of your lordships who are contributing to the debate this afternoon <e> <s> i should like briefly to pay a personal tribute to the leadership of sir richard southwood the chairman of the commission who has played such an important part in tracing the course of the compendious report which is the subject of this debate tonight <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord nathan for his able chairmanship of the report of the european communitys committee of which i am also a member <e>", "<cs> my lords after having been brought so refreshingly home to our political base by the noble lord lord hooson perhaps i should apologise to your lordships for reverting once again to a scientific intervention <e> <s> i speak as a member of the natural environment research council and not i must emphasise from the elevated position of chairmanship as have two noble earls who have spoken previously from this side of the house <e> <s> i do not in any way speak for the natural environment research council which has not put forward to me any particular points that it wishes to be made <e> <s> i speak from my personal experience <e>", "<cs> in framing any preambling phrase of this nature i think that particular stress must be put on the useful word which has been introduced by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> this is the word non-target <e> <s> it must be the aim of an efficient farmer not to waste his pesticides on non-target organisms and it must also be the aim of those engaged in pesticide research so to manufacture their products that these are efficient in so far as they work selectively against only those organisms which are their targets <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment with the leave of the <e>", "<cs> a relevant point without drawing attention to the obvious revolves upon the resolution of amendment no <e> <s> which has already been withdrawn <e> <s> the whole of this part of the bill is <e>", "<cs> i still think that my noble friend on the front bench need not be the slightest bit apprehensive about allowing the little word export into this position in the clause because the power will be discretionary and will give him a weapon which he may or may not wish to use in the future but it will still give him a power which he could use if eventualities came to make it necessary <e> <s> i do not believe that he need make an issue of this particular point or that he need have the slightest apprehension that

amendment no <e> <s> za i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords they are entirely compatible because amendment no <e> <s> za deals with the situation after the residuary body <e> <s> it looks for a final solution <e> <s> we have agreed that in the terms of the bill the residuary body taking on these services is an interim measure for providing continuation over a transitional period <e> <s> but amendment no <e> <s> za is important because it provides a final repository for these services at a later date during the winding-up period of the residuary body or after it is wound up <e>", "<cs> my lords on the matter of the single word forthwith in the amendment it was of course a concern that there would be such a delay in the presentation of a report by the residuary body to the secretary of state that the intentions might be nullified <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his amendment <e> <s> i appreciate his reasons for not wishing to insert a firm date in this context into the bill <e> <s> i believe that his amendment which will require great promptitude quite clearly will have the desired effect <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that as the noble baroness lady birk has said amendment no <e> <s> incorporates one of the options that was envisaged by your lordships select committee when its report was prepared <e> <s> however perhaps i may speak for myself for once and not for the select committee and give a personal view <e> <s> i believe that quite a lot of water has passed under bridges since then <e> <s> my noble friend has made accommodations in amendments nos <e>

this side of the house i am clearly less suspicious of the assurances that are given by members of the government from the floor of either this or another place than perhaps the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> nonetheless i am obliged to agree with the noble lord lord ezra that the counter-proposals to your lordships amendment introduce a series of confusions of apparently new issues which i feel need some very clear clarification from the floor of the house if the amendments are to be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the noble lord lord nathan on his very able chairmanship of the sub-committee and on his excellent introduction to the report this evening which i think leaves nothing further to be clarified <e> <s> it was fascinating to hear from the noble lord lord nugent of his own personal recollection of events surrounding the beginning of <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the kind words that have been said i found it extremely difficult to introduce this large report and i was not able to do so fully to my own satisfaction <e> <s> i was therefore grateful to those fellow members of the committee and also to those noble lords which term of course includes noble baronesses who picked up issues upon which i should have liked to have an opportunity myself to enlarge had there been time <e> <s> i should also like to give my warmest congratulations to my noble friend lord skelmersdale with his difficult job on the front bench for the way he so ably attempted to field the very large battery of questions that were thrown at him <e>", "<cs> my lords ignoring income tax and sticking to the subject in question i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord gregson as chairman of the sub-committee and the two members of that committee the noble and gallant lord and the noble baroness who have spoken just before me on what i consider to be an extremely important timely and comprehensive report <e> <s> taken with the two volumes of evidence which are of equal importance i think that this set of volumes provides a unique and valuable review of marine science and technology at this present time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great pleasure to open the debate by congratulating the noble lord lord nathan and the select committee on a masterly and very valuable report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the regret expressed a moment or two ago by the noble baroness lady white that the -mile provision has not automatically been extended to encompass marine nature reserves <e> <s> whatever at present may be the intention or the wish to designate marine nature reserve areas we must look forward to a time when they can be selected on genuine biological grounds grounds whereby we can have regard to the natural topography of the seabed the natural flow of currents the natural quality of the sea waters and other characteristics without the imposition of an artificial linear boundary of this nature which could be entirely disastrous in biological terms <e> <s> i hope that we can have some assurances from my noble friend that she will look sympathetically at all possible opportunities to allow marine nature reserves to be established when they are finally created on genuine biological grounds <e>", "<cs> before she sits down may i ask my noble friend whether she knows of any real scientific objections to allowing full freedom to establish marine nature reserves within the -mile limit <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were not for the fact that i feel i speak for the whole house it would be almost presumptuous of me to congratulate the noble lord lord dainton on the calibre of his maiden speech <e> <s> in a way what the select committee did has sprung from work that he initiated <e> <s> he was of course chairman of the council for scientific policy working group on which the noble lord lord flowers and i believe the noble lord lord kearton also sat which in reported on the future of the research council system and which was effective in setting up the abrc that we now have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> in considering the future of the london scientific services and the likely demand for the services can he say to what extent the london residuary body has been able to take into account the probable value of these services to local authorities other than london boroughs and successor bodies <e> <s> can the minister confirm that such options are not ruled out by the terms of schedule to the local government act <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the committee may i thank the noble baroness for thanking us <e> <s> however really all the congratulations are due to the noble lord lord nathan who has so ably chaired that committee for the past four years in a very decisive clear and helpful manner and he has turned his attention to the very wide range of different environmental subjects that have been brought before us <e> <s> i have been constantly astounded by the depths of his learning and the speed with which he manages to research each subject that comes before us <e> <s> he has served the committee extremely well during his period of chairmanship and there will be many of us who will be sorry to see him rotated <e> <s> that happens to the best of us from time to time <e> <s> i also congratulate him on the extremely capable way in which he ranged over the full scope of the committees report <e>", "<cs> i envisage that the payments will be related to the loss of income consequent on reduced production which inevitably would have to depend on some base line determination as the noble lord lord carter said <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has referred to a consultative document which is very shortly to be produced <e> <s> i shall be most grateful if she can assure us that this document will be available before consideration of this bill reaches report stage <e> <s> i think it is extremely important that we should have this document available to us for consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am forced to say that speaking for a department which is required by law to take into account conservation i am extremely disappointed by my noble friends reply <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gibson said what other opportunity shall we have <e> <s> my noble friend has said that the government retain an open mind <e> <s> however an empty mind is not an open mind and there is an extreme vacuity in the consultation document which we have before us <e> <s> it fails totally to approach the problem which has been aired <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have spoken this afternoon for their support in a long and very productive debate <e> <s> i congratulate the minister on his usual brilliant treatment of so many issues that arose from so many directions <e> <s> his reply was concentrated on the nature conservancy councils success in site protection and in safeguards for habitats <e> <s> i should just like to reiterate that i do not consider that i am being alarmist when i stress that there is now hard scientific evidence of the vulnerability of the environment in air land coastal and marine waters which in many <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the way that this debate which was initiated on a topic of fairly narrow scope has been widened to cover so well and so broadly a field of great importance in environmental concern <e> <s> i welcome the words from my noble friend the minister and i commend the motion to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords although she is not in her place i shall remain grateful to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend has been informed by his advisers that some of the work carried out into bat populations by dr stebbings among others indicates that since which marked the passing of the wildlife and countryside act the population of small bats in this country is considered to have declined from about million to about million <e> <s> that is a decline of about two-thirds <e> <s> does my noble friend believe that that represents a true safeguarding in the sense of what he referred to as the bat base <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious that a specific question was asked of me by the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> i would not wish him to feel that i left it hanging in the air <e> <s> he asked me what we meant in paragraph by the misapplication of resources <e> <s> in essence that was answered subsequently by the noble lord lord rugby who made it clear that we were worried that the chase for perfection with ever multiplying demands put upon nuclear organisations could lead to very expensive controls which did not achieve any great advantage and thereby was a totally unnecessary expenditure <e> <s> that was the purpose of those words <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no personal feelings on the matter one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords for the past couple of years i have been a non-executive board member of the anglian water authority <e> <s> i was appointed by the secretary of state for the environment and have special responsibilities for environmental issues <e> <s> as such since the beginning of this year i have been a member of the nra working group of that authority <e> <s> i have lately transferred <e> <s> i am now a member of the plc working group and if the bill becomes law i have expectations of being appointed with the same remit to the board of the plc <e>", "<cs> my lords from what i have heard this afternoon i assume that the treasury is breathing hard down the back of any secretary of state all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend please give any clarification concerning responses to the extremely helpful document <e>", "<cs> that was indeed one of our candidates <e> <s> however the noble lord lord bridges who may be a better educated man than i in the end overrode me because he maintained that the words to which the noble lord referred just now were not strictly grammatical <e> <s> one of them would have to be an adjective <e> <s> there was the additional consideration that the initials are wepa <e> <s> we felt that it was a less attractive acronym <e>", "<cs> we have heard a variety of opinion round the floor <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said this is not a decisive issue on which the committee should be divided <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will ruminate on this proposal during the course of the bill and will perhaps change his mind towards the end so that this body can have a name which in my view will better indicate the functions of the authority <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much for giving way <e> <s> is he aware that we are dealing with a high technology industry which will given sufficient incentives develop new processes new ways of providing clean water new ways of treating foul water new means of sewage treatment and new ways of returning foul water to the environment in an acceptable fashion <e> <s> that will inevitably mean adjustments in the property which is part of the core business <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lords amendment also captures that land which is available under the terms of the bill at present to be sold and in this way provides proper incentives for development and giving what i believe the public want which is a good water supply and first-class water treatment <e>", "<cs> i think we need to know whether there are precise examples of such agreements <e> <s> i have sought information from anglian water <e> <s> so far as i am aware there are no such agreements with the local authority in existence in anglian water which is the largest water authority in the country to provide recreational or amenity facilities <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct <e> <s> the present definition of inland if we follow the act and as i have read my papers extends to low water of ordinary spring tides <e> <s> of course the anglian water authority is concerned with the control of those tidal waters that the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his assurance that these points will be considered because they are material <e> <s> our law should be clear to the ordinary man in the street in the way that it is not at the minute <e> <s> i would also remind my noble friend that a moment or two ago i pointed out that long sea sewage discharges are well beyond the estuarine limit that is to say well beyond the ordinary spring tide low water mark <e> <s> they must have an effect on the conservation of aquatic life <e>", "<cs> i ought to mention that i am a member of the broads authority and that i sit on the environment committee of that authority <e> <s> i should like to draw to the attention of my noble friend two points which have come up and are of general concern in the broads authority although i am not speaking on behalf of the broads authority <e>", "<cs> i heard my noble friend clearly say that he had taken on board the concerns which i voiced when moving the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for agreeing to consider the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend considers whether to withdraw the amendment will my noble friend the minister say how many existing non-domestic supplies have such terms already written into them <e>", "<cs> it is more than a technical point <e> <s> the argument put forward by my noble friend depends upon the fact that such terms would exist <e> <s> i understood him to say that unless such terms exist the provisions that my noble friend lord balfour is trying to arrange cannot be met <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend makes that decision i wish to ask the minister a question <e> <s> i believe there has been a misunderstanding between the terms trunk main as used by the noble baroness and the term bulk <e>", "<cs> i am very interested in the response that my amendment has aroused on all sides of the committee <e> <s> i reiterate the point that i was making <e> <s> in my view the duty should extend to the limits of our territorial waters <e> <s> in response to the noble lord lord mcintosh it is not just any old limit it is the limit of our sovereignty <e> <s> the limit of miles is a very clear one about which we debated <e> <s> there was a very considerable amount of international action on this subject <e> <s> it was a very important point <e> <s> our national territorial limits were extended enormously <e> <s> if you add nine miles around the perimeter of an island nation such as ours you add enormously to the national sovereign territory over which we acquire benefits <e> <s> in my view and <e>", "<cs> i think that before the noble lord sits down i had better clarify the function of the amendment <e> <s> the problem about which he is worrying does not in fact arise <e> <s> i do not think that it is simply because i am a biologist rather than a lawyer that i understand the term fresh water to mean water which excludes salttherefore clause b defines coastal waters as waters <e>", "<cs> i still feel that there is a serious confusion especially when i look retrospectively at clause <e> <s> it would be preferable if we were able to replace the term inland waters in this subsection with the term fresh waters <e> <s> i must say that i cannot think of any inland upland lake in this country which is salty <e> <s> if that replacement was achieved we would then have a much clearer definition of inland waters we would be allowed <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend was speaking the first time i made a mental note that not being excluded is not the same as being included <e> <s> if we were to give a ball tonight there would be a rather different guest list <e> <s> i do not see the harm of including nature conservation as proposed in my amendment if it is already intended to be included in the broad range of points to be considered <e> <s> i heard my noble friend say that ultimately the schemes on which the secretary of states criteria will be based will be subject to approval in parliament <e> <s> i thought that that was an important point <e> <s> i hope that the minister might consider that to put in the words including nature conservation is not impossible <e> <s> perhaps i should give him time to consider the issue <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have had a quick look at clause and i see that it gives powers to the nra to take remedial action and to recover the expenses reasonably incurred in doing so from any person in this case the potential polluter <e> <s> that is not exactly the same as requiring the potential polluter to take the action <e> <s> in the circumstances it might be effective but it is not exactly the same thing <e>", "<cs> clearly i welcome the governments initiative in this way <e> <s> equally clearly it is necessary to look closely at what has been said <e> <s> however in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is of course by the use of by-laws that the broads which were disgusting at one stage have been cleaned up <e> <s> however i do not feel that there should be a general freedom for yacht owners to defend themselves or even to claim an ancient right to pump ship anywhere within controlled waters <e> <s> i believe that under marpol v that the north sea is now declared a protected area and it is in fact contravening the marpol regulations to throw waste overboard from any vessel whatever in the waters of the north sea which after all covers a considerable proportion of the coast <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for those assurances <e> <s> in the future many water and sewerage undertakers will be the same plc <e> <s> but there will still be areas where the sewerage undertaker is not the same organisation as the water supply undertaker <e> <s> under such circumstances i can see that there might be difficulties if the information was not available to the sewerage undertaker <e> <s> i look forward to a government amendment coming forward at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we agree to this group of amendments i should like to draw my noble friends attention to certain problems that could arise when we consider that in future the plc and the nra will be totally separate organisations within the plc operation <e>", "<cs> i agree that there is merit in the amendment and that it is much more likely that polluting matter would be passed through a sink than a bath or shower outlet <e>", "<cs> while welcoming the power which the nra has to make by-laws of this nature i feel that it is rough justice and that the owner of the reservoir if a plc should at least receive the same sort of notice as does a local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with deference that my noble friend has not been very fair <e> <s> the provision in the bill is not a re-enactment of the act <e> <s> it introduces new terms and conditions by the word new which the amendment seeks to delete <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking in the wrong order on the last amendment <e> <s> this is an issue which is felt to provide quite severe operational difficulties for the future water supply companies <e> <s> for example if there was a problem on a service pipe connected to any kind of bulk main supply whether of treated or untreated water the undertaker might have to stop the bulk main supply in order to deal with the problem of one user <e> <s> inevitably that would create severe problems for a large number of other premises supplied with water from that main <e> <s> therefore for operational reasons this is a serious problem <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will consider the amendment in that light <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak to amendment no <e> <s> c which stands in my name <e> <s> i should like to raise one further point <e> <s> in committee the noble lord lord hesketh said on th may at col that to the best of his knowledge there were no problems with a similar provision in the existing legislation <e> <s> from the operational view of a water authority the current equivalent provision is contained in section of the water act immediately following the provision in section which gives the water undertaker power to cut off supply following non-payment of charges <e> <s> in practice section has always been regarded as requiring notice solely in respect of disconnection for non-payment of water charges <e> <s> that is one of the aims of amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> it so happens that in this bill the powers of disconnection for all purposes are contained in clause along with the notice provision <e> <s> so there is need for an amendment to make the position clear <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he used the words freely available <e> <s> under copa it is the present custom for water authorities to require a charge for extra costs incurred in providing such information <e> <s> did the minister mean free <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the undertakers cannot ignore the need to provide for trade effluent <e> <s> however there could be problems with the undertakers if an industrialist can demand additional sewage treatment capacity and if the undertakers were obliged to receive this additional effluent <e> <s> environmental protection can only be obtained by the control of emissions into the sewage system <e> <s> there are certain serious contaminants that cannot be abstracted from the sewage sludge once they are present <e> <s> it will be increasingly imperative for this country to meet the international obligations to which it has agreed to be able to control the composition of sewage sludge and in particular to eradicate pollutants from it <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems clear from my noble friends reply that any sewer can be treated as a separate exercise and whether or not there was an existing sewer the new sewer would require a separate charge and a separate calculation <e> <s> as i said earlier this is different from the present custom of existing water authorities but no doubt they could accommodate it <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a put forward by my noble friend lady blatch and myself deals as the noble lord lord mcintosh said with very much the same subject <e> <s> perhaps i can bring it down to ground level by saying that there has been a problem in the anglian water authority area where a few weeks ago a trading standards officer received a query from a mobile home owner who felt that he had been overcharged for supply of water <e> <s> this amendment refers to tenants who have sub-meters <e> <s> it will be a more frequent occurrence as metering becomes more widespread in the country <e> <s> it applies to any caravan site and no doubt also to marinas <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand that aright it means that the paragraph from which i copied the terms of the proposed amendment was effective in the very case which i had under consideration <e> <s> i should like to read what the noble lord said but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the anglian water authority i have been extremely <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read clause with the activities of the water authorities in mind i understood that the term reasonable time meant a reasonable time of the clock or a reasonable time of the day <e> <s> except in an emergency it would be normal practice to consider it unreasonable to exercise the power of entry other than between let us say the hours of nine oclock and five oclock <e> <s> in an emergency occasionally it will be necessary to go in at any time of the day <e> <s> there might be variations as the noble baroness mentioned in relation to the nature of the premises <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment refers to time duration rather than to time oclock which is what i take to be the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few remarks from the operational point of view <e> <s> land may be compulsorily purchased let us say to create a reservoir <e> <s> it would be natural for the plc to be required under the terms of this legislation to run recreational facilities and fisheries on that reservoir and to do so on a commercial basis <e> <s> that situation appears to be caught by the very wide reference to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the words of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> there are circumstances in which a satisfactory water supply and sewerage arrangements are of paramount importance and essential to public health <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it may make it easier for my noble friend to accept this amendment if i point out that some excellent conservation work on river courses and riparian work is already being carried out by the prototype nra sub-unit of anglian water and that the conservation of land associated with such waters and land is already very much part of the duty of water authorities as they exist at present <e> <s> therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important for the undertaker to pay attention and to take note of those words which occurred towards the end of the speech of my noble friend when he said very clearly that no court of law would consider the undertaker to be at fault if anything was to happen in that part of the service pipe which does not belong to the undertaker but to the customer <e> <s> the essential point of the amendment was to make it absolutely clear that there is a section of the service pipe which is not under the control of the undertaker and for which he cannot therefore be held responsible as regards any damage or anything that goes wrong in that service pipe which causes a failure to supply water at the correct pressure or under other appropriate conditions to the building at the end of that pipe <e> <s> provided that my noble friends words are absolutely clear i am content to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been two threads in the debate this afternoon one concerning nature conservation in the united kingdom and the other appropriate action at the european community level <e> <s> i do not wish to pick up the first thread but in thanking all those who have contributed to the debate i should like to wind up with a few remarks on the second particularly in response to the speech by my noble friend lord reay from the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make further provision for the integrated protection of the environment of great britain for the definition of duties to this end for controlling the import production use keeping and disposal of articles and substances including wastes hazardous to the environment for the establishment of an environment protection commission and an environment protection executive and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in opening the second reading debate it may be useful if i first discuss four principal matters the purposes of the bill the background to it the responses i have received and its future prospects <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this evenings debate and recognise that a great deal of skill and experience has been applied far exceeding anything that i could muster <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for his kind words although i am afraid that i cannot accept them <e>", "<cs> i hope that it will not be considered improper if i draw the attention of my noble friend to the fact that there are also occasions when the nature conservancy council should be consulted <e> <s> i do not at this juncture have an amendment to that end but i hope that i may be able to raise the matter at a later date <e>", "<cs> my name has already been mentioned and my position in this committee is clear <e> <s> since st april i have been a member of the nature conservancy council i am the current chairman of the existing advisory committee for england and my name has been mentioned today as the chairman designate for the new agency for england <e> <s> in that capacity i am a member of the shadow joint nature conservation committee which has already met once <e>", "<cs> that amendment simply picks up the countryside commission aspect <e> <s> the amendment which we have yet to discuss brings into the welsh council its countryside commission inheritance <e> <s> there is a conflict which needs to be sorted out <e>", "<cs> it is no surprise to me but the term needs clarifying <e> <s> my second point is that taking on board this series of amendments i have been discussing with countryside commission members exactly what is the main difference in the activities of the joint committee that would be achieved <e> <s> the joint committee would inherit the overall united kingdom activities of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> if we look at a document that is already available the latest annual report we can see what the nature conservancy council is already doing <e> <s> we can consider its publications <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first it seems important that the new countryside council for wales should have very clearly its own independent and somewhat unique terms of reference laid down on the face of the bill <e> <s> secondly it provides a particular definition which has functions only within this clause of the phrase natural environment <e>", "<cs> the intention in this series of amendments is to bring into the realm both of the new national nature conservancy agencies and bodies such as english heritage a common interest in archaeological features <e> <s> it is a truism in england to say that virtually all the environmental features which the nature conservancy council today wishes to preserve are man-made <e> <s> however the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> as the foundation to this series of amendments is to list the features as <e>", "<cs> i wish to draw my noble friends attention to the fact that recently the nature conservancy council has been involved in several petitions <e> <s> it was involved in the petition on the cardiff bay barrage which will result in the loss of the taff-ely sssi <e> <s> many other barrages are proposed for british estuaries including the severn which will affect the sssis <e> <s> it is always possible that the private bill procedure will be used in such cases <e> <s> the ncc was involved in petitioning against a bill to reopen the montgomery canal which affected a nationally important wetland sssi <e> <s> there is also the problem of hybrid bills which perhaps i should have mentioned earlier <e> <s> the ncc petitioned against the channel tunnel bill <e> <s> it appears likely that the second severn crossing will also be a hybrid bill against which the ncc is likely to be interested in petitioning <e>", "<cs> having heard that helpful statement from my noble friend on the front bench i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we recognise that it is important in order to carry out nature conservation under the proposed system that we should be protected against distortions in the different ways in which different councils will operate <e> <s> the two amendments proposed by the noble baroness lady nicol examine possible distortions through directions given by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble fiend for those remarks <e>", "<cs> under those circumstances <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> simply on the ground of practicability i cannot see how this amendment can work <e> <s> i do not want to expound at length on the processes by which sssis are notified but there is an enormous amount of casework involved and legwork on the ground <e> <s> the whole system by which the process is organised depends on the active deployment of assistant regional officers and staff on the ground <e> <s> it is work which the joint committee simply will not be equipped to undertake <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say for clarification that i was referring simply to amendment no <e> <s> a in the names of the noble baroness and the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> that amendment does not mention marine matters <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the information about the act which had not previously been drawn to my attention <e> <s> having heard what my noble friend has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the ncc or its successor bodies are to operate the designation process <e>", "<cs> again having heard the words of my noble friend i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> in practical terms i do not know who advised the noble lord on this amendment <e> <s> i cannot for the moment see the practicality of a three-day stop order in a process which takes several months to operate <e> <s> the minimum notice required under section c is three months and during that process naturally the nature conservancy council is obliged to try to obtain a management agreement <e> <s> if such a management agreement is not obtainable clearly the officers of the ncc become increasingly edgy as time proceeds <e> <s> in general however it takes about three weeks to issue a nature conservation order <e> <s> there is plenty of time within the notice period for this to happen under ordinary circumstances <e> <s> given the length of the notice period i cannot see what the provision of three days extra is intended to achieve <e>", "<cs> since my amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with this amendment it is appropriate that i speak to my amendment now <e> <s> we are venturing into the general area of marine conservation which is extremely important <e> <s> in this connection unfortunately the act has not proved to be as successful as was hoped by those of us who supported the moving of the original clauses which were concerned with marine nature reserves <e>", "<cs> i note that my amendment no <e> <s> has also been grouped with this marine collection <e> <s> this is an alternative approach to bring the sssi system out as it were into the waters <e> <s> treasury counsels present opinion is that sssis are tied to planning law and the land to which they can apply is therefore restricted by the application of that law <e> <s> one of the implications of that is that sssis may not be notified below mean low water in england and wales and mean low water springs in scotland <e> <s> that has caused considerable difficulties in as much as nature conservation interests do not terminate at mean low water or mean low water springs nor are they restricted to local planning authority areas <e>", "<cs> that is not fair because i did not place that interpretation on the response to amendments nos <e> <s> and which i believe are under discussion <e> <s> however i wish to point out to my noble friend that his right honourable friend in another place was a signatory to the final declaration of the third international conference on the protection of the north sea on th march where he agreed along with other ministers to give further protection to marine wildlife in the north sea <e>", "<cs> i should like to make absolutely clear my opinion that for the conservation of nature and the natural resources of this country in the end a limited site specific strategy will be not be enough <e> <s> an extension into the wider countryside is immensely important <e> <s> the amendment proposed is in accordance with the voluntary principle and i commend it <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up on behalf of my fellow members of the sub-committee who undertook this inquiry i thank those of your lordships who congratulated us on our work <e> <s> i thank those members of the select committee who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i particularly welcome the contributions of others of your lordships <e> <s> despite several repeated disclaimers i welcomed the fact that your lordships have once again demonstrated your perceptive analysis experience and wide knowledge <e> <s> i welcomed the contributions relating to the rain forests in amazonia and africa about which i have no experience or claim to expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i too suggested that a joint declaration by the ncc and the appropriate bodies rather than an amendment to the bill would be the right way to go forward <e> <s> i am glad to acknowledge that the joint declaration is now in an advanced stage of drafting and is as far as i know satisfactory to all parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have taken a correct role throughout the passage of the bill in that i have only spoken on issues where changes to the bill will improve the operation of the future councils or the delivery of nature conservation in this country <e> <s> obviously i have an interest in so far as i am the chairman of the advisory committee for england on the nature conservancy council and as everyone well knows i am chairman designate of the future body <e> <s> i do not believe that on those aspects my interventions have been involved with any kind of interest <e> <s> therefore i can repeat what i said at committee stage that the nature conservancy council would welcome an amendment along the lines proposed by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend on the front bench answers that very interesting intervention by my noble friend lord campbell of croy i should like to refer to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord peel because there is a great deal to be said in amplification of his very able introduction to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are now moving into designated areas i should like to take this opportunity to thank my noble friend lady blatch for the statement she made which assured the nature conservancy council that powers exist to enter into agreements with the lesser right holders including commoners <e> <s> she also promised that at some stage she would be making a statement about the powers of the nature conservancy council to denotify sssis <e> <s> i look forward to hearing that statement in due course <e> <s> it is important for us to have note of such statements on the record <e>"]
