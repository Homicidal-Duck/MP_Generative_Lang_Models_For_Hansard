["<cs> my lords i should like to begin by adding the congratulations of these benches to the noble viscount on his maiden speech <e> <s> i think that the best tribute i can pay to him is to say that i am sorry it was a maiden speech because i should have loved to join in the arguments he raised <e> <s> but i will follow convention and postpone those discussions for another day <e> <s> as a member of the committee i should like also to thank the noble lord lord gregson for the way he guided our deliberations <e> <s> i do not know whether we should have got through that enormous pile of evidence and on one occasion my wife measured it it was a stack two and a half feet high that we were then wading through without his guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect south yorkshire <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a private members bill <e> <s> it was introduced in another place by my honourable friend the member <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> all of them of course have supported the bill <e> <s> there is only one slightly controversial issue <e> <s> it would be most inappropriate of me to pursue it now <e> <s> all i can say is that i still do not like the two clauses that were introduced in the other place and maybe not only should there be consultation with this enormous number of organisations that the government are now talking to or asking opinions from but it might be worthwhile having consultation with the sponsors of the bill <e> <s> after all it is an all-party bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i understand from my reading of the first amendment that it is defective because the provision to which it refers was repealed from the food and drugs act by the weights and measures act <e> <s> that places us in some confusion and therefore it might be helpful if the minister would give us the benefit of his advice on how we should proceed <e>", "<cs> in view of the undertakings that we have heard from the noble lord lord sandys i think that it would be inappropriate to continue any discussion on the bill rather we should hope that the noble lord lord mottistone will withdraw the amendments and thus allow us to speed the bill on its way to the statute book unamended <e> <s> since i am not going to say much more i want it to be clearly understood that i do not agree with any of the views expressed by the noble lord lord mottistone on behalf of the interests for which he was speaking <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but i have been shocked by the last statement that was made by the noble lord lord sandys <e> <s> i think it utterly inappropriate to base a constructive review of section of the food and drugs act on replies to the kind of letter sent out inviting comments <e> <s> i invite the noble lord to look at that letter again <e> <s> it is a positive invitation to many of the organisations who received it to reply favourably to the governments propositions <e> <s> apart from that to try to measure arithmetically the letters that were sent to trade associations and some nine to the local government authorities the professional associations of environmental health officers and trading standards officers seems to be altogether inappropriate <e>"]
