is leased the minority geographically is ceded to the united kingdom and certainly the vast majority of the population live in that ceded territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join the plaudits to the government front bench for the considerable courage that they have shown in tabling this amendment in response to the very long and serious debate which we had in your lordships

sure that all in your lordships house most sincerely hope that a similar fate does not befall this bill to that which befell that amendment <e> <s> i most warmly support this bill not only because of recent events in the south atlantic to which other noble lords have referred much more eloquently than i ever can but also for the reason that i and many other noble lords expessed in october of last year that once the gibraltar amendment had been approved there was little or no logic in withholding british nationality from the other british dependent citizens of whom the principal were those of the falklands and hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the immediacy of the talks in peking <e> <s> would not my noble friend agree that this question is somewhat inopportune <e>", "<cs> my lords
