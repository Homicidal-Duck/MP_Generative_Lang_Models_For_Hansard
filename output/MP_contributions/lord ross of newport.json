["<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by very briefly thanking everyone for all the kindnesses shown to me on taking my seat in this noble house <e> <s> i can only say that i shall do my best to live up to the honour bestowed upon me <e> <s> may i also congratulate the noble baroness <e> <s> i totally agreed with a lot of her speech especially when she finished up with her compliments to the housing corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence as this is my first attempt to speak on a bill on report <e> <s> however i should like very much to follow the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey whose experience in local government as a former member of the late lamented glc is rather greater than mine as a former leader of the smallest county council in england on the isle of wight <e> <s> but from my experience as leader of that council in the years <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble baroness i was pointing out that the direct labour organisations in my particular part of the country are at such a low ebb that they could disappear altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak very briefly <e> <s> i pay tribute to the noble lord lord renton who played quite a part in civil defence work in the other place <e> <s> it would be a pity if after all the effort of the noble lord and others including i must say myself the compliance of local authorities which is quite hard to get in some cases in the whole area of emergency planning and civil defence was to be put in some disarray by the procedures under the bill <e> <s> i await the reply of the minister with some interest <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that having achieved what we have on civil defence and emergency planning it is important to keep the goodwill of local authorities in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very briefly in support of this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister appreciates the situation now pertaining in quite a large number of authorities round the country <e> <s> frankly they are punch-drunk with the new requirements that are being placed upon them <e> <s> there are many more to come with rating legislation education changes and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill is supposed to be saving ratepayers money although it will do so not quite so much in some places as in others <e> <s> here however we have an obvious case where it would be a nonsense to put cleaning out to tender and yet still keep the caretaker <e> <s> in many cases the caretaker is in residence and has been appointed to that job <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that we are considering a village school with a maximum of pupils <e> <s> i do not think we ought to write that in <e> <s> it is the one job where an appointment has been made of a caretaker-cleaner and it would be daft <e>", "<cs> my lords from the comments made in this debate it appears to me that too many noble lords reside either in lambeth or camden <e> <s> the exception is my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> i speak as a very new and junior member but i think that it is time we stated our position from these benches <e> <s> i hope that is not unfair but i shall be very brief <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord lord marsh that he might like to take a bit of bedtime reading home with him and re-study layfield because layfield should have been followed by whichever government was in power <e> <s> the layfield committee studied the whole problem of replacing the rating system <e> <s> we have of course funked quinquennial reviews <e> <s> successive governments have not carried them out and that is why things are in such a mess <e> <s> the rent acts have had a disastrous effect on the rents being paid for residential homes and that is why the present rating system is in such disarray <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment already moved and i speak also to amendment no <e> <s> which is in my name <e> <s> that takes local income tax further down the path towards the sort of tax which we have it in mind to introduce into this bill <e>", "<cs> most people did not accept the inland revenue figures but i believe that the noble lord will agree that the figure of has been quoted on many other occasions in many other bills and is a common number to quote <e> <s> it was not accepted by the national union of ratepayers which also did not understand the idea of the difficulties of a place of residence because in it said <e>", "<cs> he would know what he was spending because the money would be taken from his weekly pay packet if he was a paye earner <e> <s> he would also know by comparison <e> <s> i am sure that the government would be only too pleased to publish comparisons between one authority and another on the per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> and which authorities were keeping the lid down at a reasonable level and which were going above <e> <s> we have those tables now so i cannot foresee any difficulty about that <e> <s> they will see the rest of the situation with their own eyes <e> <s> they will see the state of their roads and the state of their education street sweeping and so forth <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness to say that it is not just the charities that are concerned in some cases it is the local authorities themselves <e> <s> i have a letter from a community service volunteer who is working in a home for the mentally retarded located in my former <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because in my part of the world there are over homes and goodness knows how many nursing homes and we have planning restrictions on any further developments <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a loophole here where people with extreme wealth can dodge paying poll tax and i do not think that they should be allowed to get away with it <e> <s> i understand the point made by the noble lord lord jenkin that there will be an extra charge on them through the rates being paid by the home in which they are resident but what is their main residence <e> <s> we know that they can go in for a considerable amount of time can then be looked after by the family and then go back in again <e>", "<cs> surely <e>", "<cs> surely by next year the government will face the situation where people in scotland will not pay their taxes and rates <e> <s> is the minister saying that they will not be committed to gaol whereas people in england and wales will be <e> <s> i represented a constituency that has three prisons <e> <s> it is daft to say that people who do not pay their poll tax should be committed to prison <e> <s> that does not make any sense <e> <s> for gods sake take the money from their wages or whatever income they have <e>", "<cs> may i speak to amendment no <e> <s> a as it is listed in the same group of amendments or do i wait until the minister has replied <e>", "<cs> the government are missing a golden opportunity to take a step in the right direction and require people who have acquired second homes in many parts of the country in cornwall in wales in the isle of wight in devon and in the lake district to contribute <e> <s> under the provisions of the bill such people will in fact pay far less <e> <s> at present such homes are rated so these people are at least contributing towards the rateable income of the local authority <e> <s> i imagine that even two-times multipliers will mean quite a big cut for people with second homes <e>", "<cs> we are promised that the secretary of state will by regulation set out the multipliers for specified classes of property <e> <s> i just think heaven help us all <e> <s> the regulation that will come from central government is unbelievable <e> <s> cannot we occasionally trust local authorities to do what is right <e> <s> i am saddened by the governments whole attitude to local authorities these days <e> <s> there is little point in people standing for councils any more because they have no discretion over anything <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i appreciate the comments he has made <e> <s> can we take it that under clause we shall get regulations at some time specifying classes of property which may be liable to the standard charge of rating between and <e> <s> is this one area where the diplomatic service might look for some assistance <e>", "<cs> i think we have aired the subject <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a strong supporter of local government i speak fervently in favour of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly as the noble earl lord lytton has dealt fairly fully with these amendments <e> <s> it is rather a shame that we are dealing with this matter at am because these are rather important amendments and i am sure the minister himself will agree that they come from a very responsible institution of which he i and the noble earl lord lytton are members <e>", "<cs> does material change of circumstances include change of ownership <e>", "<cs> i made a point in an intervention which i believe is very important <e> <s> it concerns whether material change of circumstances includes change of ownership <e> <s> rates are generally paid by the occupier <e> <s> it is true and has been stated tonight that when there is a change of occupation there will be a chance for the occupier to appeal against that assessment whether the previous occupier has or has not appealed <e> <s> but if there is a change of ownership it is in the interests of the owner <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly because i intend to speak in rather greater detail on the next amendments <e> <s> i think that the document which i received at lunch-time from the ncvo which gives on its back pages some of the figures which they fear they will face from the increase in rates which will descend upon them is fully justified <e> <s> i hope to show this when i speak the next time if i am called in the next debate <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord jenkin is here in two years time if there are not adequate transitional arrangements for small businessmen because i believe we shall be facing a situation here that faced us in at the time of the last revaluation which of course is the reason why the mayhew committee was set up <e> <s> there were indignation meetings attended by many thousands in places like manchester and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> can the minister give some authoritative indication of when that might be <e> <s> one hears that there are problems within the revaluation office such as a shortage of staff and the rest <e> <s> can the minister give some idea when information will be available <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord rippon of hexham and lord weinstock have spoken to amendments nos <e> <s> and za <e> <s> the latter appears under my name <e> <s> i am very glad to have the support of the noble lords <e> <s> i think they are right and i totally support the words of the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> in the past ten years or so the rating of empty properties has led to necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that that response satisfies my colleague on this bench who has much more knowledge of the oil industry than i i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must make a protest about the ministers comments concerning local government <e> <s> it really does not help when the government constantly criticise local authorities that are trying desperately to comply with the governments diktat <e> <s> god knows they are implementing any number of things at the moment to try to save money particularly cutting back on the arts and that sort of thing which i think quite frankly is proving disastrous for the country <e> <s> it is not clever to stand at the box and constantly gripe about local authorities and incidentally some of the local authorities in which the alliance party has some interest have actually had a lower rate increase this year than those that are controlled by conservatives <e> <s> let us have that put on the record although i do not want to make party political points on this subject <e> <s> the breakdown of the relationship between central and local government in this country is an absolute disaster <e> <s> why do not the government abolish local government altogether <e> <s> that is what they really want to do <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness agree that one of the biggest growths in the costs of bureaucracy to local government will come from implementing this very bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and for reminding us of his earlier reply as regards another instance which has already been debated in this bill <e> <s> i hope very much that what he said is taken on board by valuation officers and that people particularly in the licensed trade if they believe that information is being sought from them that they regard as unreasonable arc not obliged to pursue the case through the valuation court to the lands tribunal <e> <s> i think that would be unfortunate and i am sure the minister would agree that they should not be put to that expense <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord saw the brief from the institute of economic affairs <e> <s> i shall try to find it and send it to the minister <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers courtesy in allowing me at least to air the principles behind amendment no <e> <s> ab <e> <s> this was prompted to some extent by the exchange which took place the other evening between the minister and his colleague the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> it concerned the question of the rating of residential homes and nursing homes which are now eligible to qualify for a per cent <e> <s> rate rebate under the provisions of section a and c of the rating disabled persons act <e> <s> i am told that such provisions were first thought to apply only to such premises as homes for the mentally ill or physically disabled <e> <s> however it has become apparent that most establishments caring for and accommodating the elderly can he shown to qualify for the rebate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a <e> <s> i totally support everything that has been said from the opposition front bench by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> quite frankly these are totally undesirable powers which we are being asked to grant to the secretary of state in quite substantial quantity <e> <s> there are clauses which are very complicated <e> <s> they are a total bureaucratic nightmare and i do not know how local authorities are supposed to survive with such restrictions being placed upon them <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister can comment on this matter <e> <s> two years ago due to some quirk in the rate support grant formula gillingham bath and one or two other towns had an absolute bonanza and gillingham decided that there would be no rate increase for that year <e> <s> it was cited as a very sensible authority <e> <s> this year gillingham presumably because the rate support grant formula has somehow been put right has had a rate increase of per cent <e> <s> does the minister consider that to be excessive and would it be rate-cappable <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can also speak in support of the amendments moved so ably by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey to one of which i have put my name <e> <s> as he so rightly said the amendments give the committee an opportunity to give effect to the thrust of the widdicombe proposals and at the same time to give much needed reassurance to many beleaguered voluntary organisations <e> <s> we wish to see their valued contribution to society and to the community continue <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> za is very sensible because it offers a lasting solution to the section issue by introducing the idea of a multiplier related to the retail prices index <e> <s> that would negate the need constantly to update the <e>", "<cs> what position does that put the chief executive of the local authority in <e> <s> he is the chief officer <e> <s> he is the man who reports to the chairman the leader of the council and all the councillors <e> <s> here the government are giving this extra power to the chief financial officer <e> <s> any council worth its salt has a representative from the treasurers department if not the county treasurer or the <e>", "<cs> the chief officers team is supposed to be the executive of the officers who report to the council <e> <s> that is the team which was set up by the baines report <e> <s> those are the people who meet together make their own recommendations and bring forward new ideas to the council <e> <s> what on earth is the use of the chief officers team if one does this kind of thing in local government <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful that the noble earl has returned to the bench <e> <s> i do not wish to throw a fast ball at him <e> <s> i received a letter only today <e> <s> i have not had a chance to give him notice of the point i wish to raise <e>", "<cs> i feel that i would be letting down my profession if i did not make some comment on amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the government are not being very generous to industrialists and others who have found through economic changes a diminution in their rentals and capital values and in their resource income <e> <s> i happen to think that the law lords probably had it right in that decision and to say that to have to wait five years for a revaluation is <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> it comes a bit rich at a time when the government have had to admit obtaining a report from outside experts that the cost of collection will be at least double their original estimates <e> <s> we have thrown at us constantly the inefficiency of local authorities <e> <s> in the price waterhouse report reference is made to the variation in cost of collection in raising from something over million down to million <e> <s> even in the case of the most efficient local authorities the report says that the cost is likely to be million by <e> <s> i accept the point made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak briefly in support of the noble lords lord jay and lord mcintosh <e> <s> the wording of this amendment which comes in very late in the passage of this bill ought to be looked at carefully <e> <s> the secretary of state has only to believe that the information would be useful to pass on the information and the only limitation will be what he himself will prescribe <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord meston who has been unavoidably delayed i will attempt to speak to these amendments <e> <s> i believe that the minister gave a clue in his response and i am very grateful to him for it <e> <s> he said that the government will be giving advice or words to that effect to local authorities to pursue the departed spouse where money is still due <e> <s> that is the fear and that is the object of these amendments <e> <s> i am glad that at long last the minister has given some credit to the sense of local authorities <e> <s> this is the first time that we have had praise for local authorities which use their initiative <e> <s> our fear is that they will do just that <e> <s> it is one of the reasons why these amendments have been tabled <e> <s> if they are given these <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak very briefly on the situation in which many local authorities will find themselves if this amendment is not accepted by the house <e> <s> those of us who work in the arts or have anything to do with charities already know that there is great difficulty on the part of local authorities to fund the arts <e> <s> in my part of the world we have an arts centre and it was faced with impending closure <e> <s> in fact it still is <e> <s> it is something that i believe most of the public would wish to see remain but in fact the local authority now finds itself in such a position that it cannot give it adequate funding <e> <s> as a result the southern arts says that it will withdraw its contribution and what is known as the visual arts centre in newport isle of wight will almost certainly close unless there is a change of mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in support of the amendments so ably spoken to by the noble earl lord lytton <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is only equitable because it relates to clause where a valuation officer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond first <e> <s> i apologise if i have misled the house on the question of costs in valuation courts <e> <s> one would certainly award costs on frivolous planning appeals from which i have suffered <e> <s> if there is no provision regarding frivolous appeals on valuations i suggest that is one way in which the government could get round the problem <e> <s> if i have misled the house i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> i am still not terribly convinced by it <e> <s> i admit that the concessions were given in the first instance for the highest motives <e> <s> i think that they have been abused <e> <s> i think the time will come when the government will appreciate that this concession was generous and ought to be withdrawn <e> <s> it certainly upsets local authorities in a very big way particularly in my part of the world <e> <s> however i accept that this explanation has been given and there is no point in dividing the house at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches very much welcome this change of heart <e> <s> the situation was too complex <e> <s> i think that the government have come to the right decision <e> <s> we are delighted with the announcement that has been made this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by readily acknowledging that this is a much improved measure when compared with the first published version <e> <s> for that i am sure that much credit is due to the minister of housing himself certainly not to his boss who has been prepared to listen to the critics and to introduce sensible amendments and concessions that go some way towards alleviating our worst fears <e>", "<cs> i referred to the activities of mr hoogstraten in my second reading speech <e> <s> i expressed the hope that the committee would take the opportunity to strengthen the bill to make sure that actions taken against such persons would be successful <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed as i said on second reading about the demise of the role of the rent officer <e> <s> i gave my name to these amendments because in respect of shorthold tenancy i thought that an alternative might be to go to a rent assessment committee <e> <s> i believe the government are wrong in their belief that rents fixed amicably between landlord and tenant will not be sky high <e> <s> in effect this could swamp the advice of people like rent officers who have abundant experience and knowledge of what sensible rents should apply <e> <s> this should be done in stages <e> <s> i do not think that it will help anybody in the borough of kensington or anywhere else if the rents are something like or a week as i suspect that they probably will be <e> <s> such tenancies will be taken up by short-term visitors to these shores holiday lets to people coming from overseas wanting temporary accommodation <e>", "<cs> i am very much in support of these amendments because i fear that we shall be seeing the introduction of premiums on assured shorthold tenancies particularly in areas of greatest stress almost certainly in london brighton and other of our great cities <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl will know what is happening on leasehold tenancies in shops and commercial properties at present <e> <s> quite extraordinary premiums are being paid key money <e> <s> one cannot really say premiums it is key money to get in <e> <s> some people paying these huge sums will get a nasty shock when the rating lists are published in months time when the new business assessments are published <e> <s> nevertheless these amounts are paid now <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put the point to the minister that what often upsets decent landlords is a tenant who is in an assured tenancy and charges a premium for the transfer of the tenancy <e> <s> presumably that is what will happen in this case <e> <s> a tenant may well after six months turn around and demand a premium from someone else who is coming in <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with the amendment and interesting questions have been raised during the course of the debate <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to answer some of them <e> <s> we read in the housing weekly bulletins particularly those in the housing association movement that certain councils in the country are already negotiating for the sale of the whole of their council stock <e> <s> torquay was said to be in a very advanced state of selling the lot <e> <s> gloucester was another city that was mentioned <e> <s> anglesey has a scheme of its own and no doubt there are others <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i was brought up in north finchley <e> <s> i am going to crouch end next week for a fortnight <e>", "<cs> the noble earl seems to be well briefed about bare licensees <e> <s> i was trying to be even-handed so there was a case the other way round <e> <s> however i accept what he has just said <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord lord coleraine is that anybody wanting to take a property for six months or more enters into a shorthold tenancy under the bill and i totally support that <e> <s> i bow to the knowledge of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> he and i used to sit in another place and i would not want to take issue with him <e> <s> i remember that long ago the first real holiday i ever had was in scotland <e> <s> i took a cottage for a whole month right up in the north-west of scotland <e> <s> the lady who let the cottage said that if i took it for more than a fortnight i could have it a lot cheaper so i did and thoroughly enjoyed it <e> <s> we were trying in the amendment to define what is a holiday let <e> <s> i fail to see the noble lords argument against adding at the end of subsection the words <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton has walked out of the chamber <e> <s> for someone on the opposite side of the committee to say that it is wrong to impose this and that on local authorities is a bit rich when the present administration impose all kinds of restrictions on local authorities <e> <s> however i must say that the reply of the minister was rather better than that of his noble friend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have exempted oxford and authorities in that part of the country <e> <s> but even in my own authority the cooperation did not work or at least not after a certain time <e> <s> therefore i think that the idea that someone should have responsibility to deal with harassment has merit <e> <s> i accept the answer that has been given nevertheless and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to support very strongly the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh who has highlighted the problems that still exist <e> <s> there are anomalies the situation should be tightened up <e> <s> i used to live not very far from this chamber in rented accommodation <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as i said on second reading i accept that the bill is <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> housing associations will be faced yet again with two regimes <e> <s> existing tenants will have rents fixed by agreement with a rent officer <e> <s> however new tenants will pay what is loosely called an affordable rent <e> <s> that will be based on a market rent <e> <s> we are already seeing what some of those rents are likely to be <e> <s> figures have been published recently by the national federation of housing associations <e> <s> i believe that the department of the environment might well agree those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i rise to support what has been said by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i suppose that if he were thinking of some comparable body the london residuary body might come to mind <e> <s> it has an enormous financial responsibility that does not seem ever to be coming to an end <e> <s> however i agree with everything he said <e> <s> there is a massive increase in the bill of the powers of the housing corporation <e> <s> it must be democratised to a reasonable degree <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> i have no objection to the secretary of state appointing the chairman of the housing corporation but i believe that it should be up to the board to appoint the chief executive <e> <s> the hoard should appoint its chief executive and the regional boards should appoint their chief executives <e> <s> i should like to put that on record <e>", "<cs> obviously i also speak in support of this amendment <e> <s> i know from the housing association movement that relations with local authorities have been close and good <e> <s> certainly in days gone by local authority funding was probably regarded rather more highly than that from the housing corporation <e> <s> that has changed as years have gone by as money has become very tight within local authorities <e>", "<cs> i was speaking to the amendment and i pointed out that the inevitable result of passing this amendment means that clause will have to be drastically rewritten <e>", "<cs> we have had a lengthy reply and many of us will want to study it because it was given at a fair old pace <e> <s> i am an auctioneer and i speak far too quickly <e> <s> when i left the other place the <e>", "<cs> i recognise that we are in a very tricky area and that mistakes can easily be made <e> <s> i hope that the official opposition will accept amendment no <e> <s> which seems to me to go a long way to meet the concerns expressed <e>", "<cs> i very much support the amendment <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord lord somers that the secretary of state lives in cirencester and not in the next street which is probably the situation in most areas which have been designated housing action trust areas <e> <s> councillors usually live locally and the tenants of those estates are able to see their local representatives <e> <s> some may even live in the next street possibly even next door to them <e> <s> tenants can go to the council chamber they can see the housing officer their complaints can be dealt with <e> <s> if their councillors are not satisfactory they can kick them out <e> <s> i note that the other day the secretary of state refused to meet a delegation of people from berkshire who had gone to cirencester he sent his agent to see them <e> <s> they were concerned about a different matter <e>", "<cs> may i draw the noble lords memory back to the early s <e> <s> why does he think that we have all the high rise flats and high density housing that we have in the inner city areas <e> <s> it was forced upon the local authorities by the department of the environment <e> <s> i remember going to a seminar addressed by the noble lord lord joseph <e> <s> it was an rics seminar in cambridge at which we were asked to support this very kind of design <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment as the progenitor in the other place of the housing homeless persons act as it now is <e> <s> if housing action trusts do not accept their share of responsibility for housing homeless people then that act will be in even more disarray than it is already <e> <s> as has been repeated many times in this house there are now over homeless people in london alone and the numbers are growing <e> <s> the amendment would create a legal right for local authorities to nominate new tenants to vacancies occurring in property they formerly owned which has been taken over by a housing action trust <e>", "<cs> i wish the case was as put by the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> all that we are asking for in these amendments is that the majority of those who are eligible to vote should be clearly seen to vote and vote in favour of change <e> <s> there should be a majority of at least per cent <e> <s> of all those eligible to vote before a change takes place <e>", "<cs> will the minister answer a point to which i wish to come back <e> <s> is he aware that meetings are already taking place which are turning <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway is right to raise those questions <e> <s> however i do not for one minute expect an answer from the minister because i do not believe that there is an answer at present <e> <s> we are just not building enough houses to rent <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord agree that what is really happening is that we are returning to a pre- situation before the housing homeless persons act in conservative party thinking <e> <s> at that time the then minister for housing mr hugh rossi introduced two circulars <e> <s> one was in i forget the date of the other <e> <s> they asked local <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of these amendments <e> <s> while i have some sympathy with the governments aim to make local authorities get on with the job and not hang around nevertheless i think that we must be realistic <e> <s> i am back in private practice as a chartered surveyor <e> <s> all i can say is that at the moment it is difficult to get even an answer to a letter from local government in under about four weeks <e>", "<cs> i believe that that is a generous offer <e> <s> i accept it in the spirit in which it is given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly support these amendments and in particular amendment no <e> <s> c which deals with subsequent disposals <e> <s> it is very important that these matters should be taken into account <e> <s> i hope very much that the minister will be able to confirm that they are matters which will concern the secretary of state before any approval of the subsequent disposal is allowed to proceed <e> <s> i beg him at least to give some assurance on that point <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i put a question to him <e> <s> there have been cuts in the number of rent officers in this country <e> <s> for example we no longer have a rent officer resident within the isle of wight but the population is increasing substantially <e> <s> we rely on rent officers from either portsmouth or i suspect southampton and winchester <e> <s> they tend to have separate

rent officers who come from southampton <e> <s> this was reported to me by the director of our housing association of which i am a member <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has had a fair go <e>", "<cs> i believe that the minister is a compassionate man and i hope that what has been said in earlier discussions of the bill will bring home to him the serious situation of the homeless that many of us feel is developing <e> <s> it is becoming steadily worse <e> <s> i genuinely wish that i could believe that the bill will result in more property coming on the market <e> <s> when it does come on to the market however i think that it will be way beyond the ability of the homeless ever to consider paying the price <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> in a statement or in an <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support to what has already been said <e> <s> we are moving into uncharted waters with the bills provisions relating to housing associations <e> <s> the management of charitable housing associations has become extremely complex <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh has said tenants under the new regime will not understand why they have rights

am conscious that i exceeded my ration last time <e> <s> i apologise to the house if i was out of order <e> <s> however i hope that i may speak briefly in support of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly interrupt in this debate to say that i hope very much that local authorities will still be able to play some part in financing housing association schemes <e> <s> that has been very valuable in the past <e> <s> i can vouch for the fact that certainly my own housing association has enjoyed very close relations with both of the two local authorities in my part of the world that have from time to time financed some of its schemes <e> <s> it wishes to see that close relationship remain <e> <s> i know it is not the intention that local authorities should finance much of housing association work in the future <e> <s> perhaps the minister can refer to that when he replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that members on the other side of the house will agree that there is now a suspicion in the country that patronage under this administration has got somewhat out of hand <e> <s> the secretary of state has enormous powers under this bill <e> <s> he appoints all members of the corporation chairman vice-chairman and so on <e> <s> there is a need to write into this bill at least a direction to consult in particular those in the housing association movement before appointments are made <e> <s> it is necessary to make sure that a real cross-section of people who know about financing and housing are considered and that the names do not all come out of the list of the good and true in smith square <e> <s> that is the suspicion <e> <s> and quite frankly it has been proved correct time and again <e> <s> that is why i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that we did not get very far with the last amendment <e> <s> however i believe that this amendment has merit <e> <s> if we are to have a housing corporation totally appointed by the secretary of state let us at least have some kind of tenant advisory agency which can make representations to the corporation and which the corporation can look to for advice on occasion <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i hope that we shall not hear the minister criticising local authorities again <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> mentioned the borough of sandwell <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the borough of sandwell and the way in which it looks after its elderly and disabled <e> <s> i know because i see some of those tenants who visit the isle of wight in the early and late part of the year <e> <s> it is quite magnificent what the borough does for those people <e> <s> i am sure that the proprietors of the savoy holiday camp to which they come for a fortnight in the spring and autumn would confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are making an awful complication of something which should be quite simple <e> <s> that is why i support the amendment from the opposition front bench <e> <s> why can it not be the case that if a simple majority of per cent <e> <s> vote in favour the deed goes through <e> <s> i am sure vast numbers of tenants will not wish to transfer to a private landlord and i cannot see vast numbers of private landlords queueing up to take over the housing estates in the first place <e> <s> there is so much opposition building up towards some of the new housing associations and the rents that people will be facing that i think the vast majority of tenants will wish to stay under their local authority landlords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can ask the minister to clarify a matter which has worried me and also i believe the noble baroness on the other side of the house <e> <s> is it not true that if an ordinary council house tenant votes against the transfer then that property will remain in the ownership of the local authority and he remains a tenant <e> <s> it is only as regards flats where there is the lease-back arrangement is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made a concession <e> <s> i think that is something we ought to look at to make sure that a vote can be given perhaps to people who may be working temporarily overseas and who may be occupying a council house when they are at home <e> <s> i feel they ought to be able to register their vote by post <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting there slowly <e> <s> there is a point of difference here <e> <s> surely one instance of a tenant transferring against his or her will is one too many <e> <s> that is the real argument <e> <s> i would also say to the house that if a tenant who fails to register wishes that he had actually transferred he is almost certainly going to get a second chance whereas if it is the other way round he will not get a second chance <e> <s> that is the difference and that is why i believe we should pass this amendment <e> <s> i would ask your lordships to imagine the outcry if this procedure were applied to compulsory purchase orders <e> <s> quite rightly the newspapers would be filled with horror about it <e> <s> i must press this to a division <e> <s> i understand that the minister has gone part of the way but he has not gone far enough so far as i am concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i must support everything that has been said by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i too have seen this document <e> <s> it is a lengthy one and honestly i fell asleep reading it but it certainly caused me concern <e> <s> there is a great deal of concern among local government officers and rent officers as to just how this is going to pan out <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope with all my heart i really mean this that the minister is right when he interprets the legislation as meaning that it will not lead to any weakness in the position of the homeless in the future <e> <s> i do not share that view because he is not putting a legal obligation to house on the successor landlords they have to use their best endeavours or words to that effect <e> <s> that is not the same as saying that they must give priority to the limited number of people in our society to whom the housing act and the housing homeless persons act its predecessor gave priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i think that he is in fact saying that there will be no undue delay in the process <e> <s> i accept that and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am in order if i speak now before the minister sits down <e> <s> surely it would be the wish of the government to wind up a hat after it had done its job <e> <s> then if the local authority has disposed of all its properties surely the tenant has only the choice of whoever is taking over those properties from the hat <e> <s> it does not mean that the tenant can really stay with the hat if it has been wound up <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> we have discussed this issue on a number of occasions <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly said i think that the matter has sunk in more and more both inside the house and certainly outside the house that the current situation set out in the bill is unsatisfactory <e> <s> that one person who does not vote <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister canvassed any big blocks of flats for example in the east of london where time after time knocking on the door brings no response <e> <s> people will not even open their doors there at night <e> <s> that is the problem we are facing <e> <s> tellers can go back time after time but very often they will not find a tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that when the inquiries into the homelessness legislation take place he will also take into account the enormous amount of money that is being spent at this time on bed-and-breakfast accommodation which can sometimes last for as long as a year <e> <s> it is quite outrageous that public money should be spent in that way and not in putting a more permanent roof over the heads of those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply unhelpful though it is <e> <s> is he aware of the great concern felt by parents who are british citizens working for the government or this country in munich in the patent office or for serc in geneva whose children because they were born between st january and december do not have full british nationality with all that that entails <e> <s> they are faced with the problem of requiring visas to move within the ec and also with costs which apply to them when they come to this country <e> <s> the parents cannot even pass on their british citizenship to their children <e> <s> surely that is an anomaly that should be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to the noble lord lord somers for initiating this short but important debate <e> <s> as one who in recent months has spent many long hours on cross-country routes two in particular i have some observations to make later that have been boiling up inside me for some months <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister will forgive me for interrupting but he referred to the marches route which i use <e> <s> i can tell him that unfortunately on that service every so often there is only one coach and one has to stand all the way to hereford <e> <s> i hope that he will take that fact on board because he may be considering further closures and i am quite convinced that more can be done to keep some of our rural lines profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will agree that this is a long statement which takes time to assimilate <e> <s> as he will be aware we are opposed to the uniform business rate for reasons similar to those which have just been expressed that it takes total local control from authorities and it is purely arbitrary now as to what the government decide to distribute to local authorities <e> <s> one has the impression when talking about the to per cent <e> <s> phased increases that in some cases these sums could be very substantial particularly for the smaller businessmen <e> <s> coming on top of what undoubtedly are to be sharply rising water charges and electricity charges and per cent <e> <s> on vat on new building the business community should be warned about what is likely to happen over <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should start by declaring an interest in that i have the honour to be chairman of an organisation known as wildlife link <e> <s> it is a small umbrella organisation the membership of which includes almost all the large and small bodies involved in environmental issues for example the rspb the worldwide fund for nature the royal society for nature conservation cpre the national trust and many others including the zoological society <e> <s> i must say that i happen to be a very poor successor to the noble lord lord melchett who has moved on to greater things with greenpeace <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by frankly admitting to your lordships that my credentials for contributing to the debate are minimal <e> <s> i have come here today more to listen and to learn rather than to put forward any firm proposals <e> <s> i must say straight away that i greatly enjoyed the speeches made by the noble earl lord cranbrook and by the noble lord lord nelson <e> <s> i also enjoyed the speech which has just been made from the labour benches <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a long debate and practically everything that can be said about this measure has been said and repeated on numerous occasions <e> <s> however there remains the fact that only a few speeches have expressed total support for the bill in its present form and i suggest that they have come from the sources that one would normally expect <e>", "<cs> the amendment may not be the ideal solution but if the committee passes it as i trust it will the government will certainly have to think again <e> <s> it is a sad fact that rather late in the day we are having to claw at whatever is available <e> <s> therefore the suggestion that the land should be placed in the national rivers authority is a late and perhaps a desperate solution <e> <s> however if it does not happen in this way and if the water companies are not acceptable to the government a great deal of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene here for a moment <e> <s> i must say that the situation was not like that indeed it was a whole history of events <e> <s> in fact a great battle had to be fought by vast numbers of people in order to achieve that effect at the end of the day <e> <s> the whole process took nearly a year <e>", "<cs> i used to have a private water supply <e> <s> i took a jar of the water to my local water authority <e> <s> it said that the authority would not test it but that i should go to the environmental health officer <e> <s> i went to the environmental health officer in south shropshire and was given a report on the state of my water <e> <s> will such practices continue or will the expertise of local authorities be ignored altogether <e> <s> that seems absolutely daft <e>", "<cs> i rise in order briefly to support everything said by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> frankly i believe that this part of the bill is vague although i suspect that we are trying to keep open a gate which is already virtually closed most of the appointments have been made or are in draft <e> <s> i should however like to support the view that certainly the statutory and voluntary bodies in the conservation sector ought to be represented and that that ought to be spelt out <e>", "<cs> having defended the private water companies from nationalisation in and and having seen for myself at that time the very good job they did because i visited a number of them before agreeing to support them i have no difficulty in saying that we have no problem in supporting the amendment put forward so ably by the noble lord lord nugent this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it is a limited request <e> <s> i understand that there will be only one committee for each region <e> <s> i am in the severn trent area which covers a huge area of anglia and more and the amendment asks for only three members <e> <s> in the undertakings that were given in local authorities were given a majority on the executives of the regions <e> <s> so the amendment is not asking for a great deal <e>", "<cs> i speak briefly in support of the amendment <e> <s> clause will alarm anyone who looks at it closely <e> <s> it is lamentably weak <e> <s> it is full of sentences such as having regard to taking account of and having regard to the desirability of <e> <s> that does not satisfy anyone who has an interest in conservation <e> <s> i do not think that it can be said that so weak a bill will conserve <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to speak for very long or to be repetitious because much of what i wanted to say has already been well said by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> perhaps i can answer the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i do not think it is right <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend who is a lawyer and therefore takes a legal attitude to these matters one of the arguments i put forward is that we are seeking to strengthen the clause for the very reason that the noble earl has just mentioned <e> <s> there is a grave risk <e> <s> we know the new companies will hive off land to subsidiary companies <e> <s> they will do it immediately <e> <s> that is what they did in the isle of wight when we stupidly allowed bembridge harbour to be sold to private individuals <e> <s> they immediately set up two companies put all the properties into one of them and then put the rents up <e> <s> they even made people pay rent to park next to the beach <e> <s> that is what will happen <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that subsection is a positive encouragement to levy a charge <e> <s> why on earth it is there i do not know <e> <s> why cannot we just leave it out <e> <s> if it is there it seems that the authority would be encouraged to charge and i should have thought that a great mistake <e> <s> no one objects to water authorities charging as they already do for certain recreational facilities such as sailing car parking in certain areas and so on but to put this subsection into the bill seems totally unnecessary <e>", "<cs> that is more than i had thought <e> <s> the position is that people are not yet convinced that the government are telling the whole truth <e> <s> they do not believe that it will happen but they think that they may have to leave the issue to local planning authorities of one kind or another <e>", "<cs> the committee should appreciate that our planning authorities are under enormous pressure at this time <e> <s> many of the planning officers i know and i have been practising in the business for some time would quite like to retire early <e> <s> they have lost large numbers of their staff to the private sector because the money available has been far more than the local authorities have been able to provide <e> <s> trying to fill some of those jobs has been very difficult certainly in my part of the world <e>", "<cs> i listened intently to the minister but i do not think i received a real answer <e> <s> i think that the minister was saying that he believes the present arrangements are satisfactory <e> <s> on the face of it that is not what i read into the bill or other people outside this committee read into it <e> <s> however the hour is late and i withdraw the amendment but i give notice that i shall certainly raise it again <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> is linked with amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i may speak to that amendment <e> <s> i go along with everything which the noble lord lord greenway has just said but i hope that he will agree that amendment no <e> <s> is preferable because it makes clear that the code should be subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> i think that the code which has been greatly discussed in committee tonight is accepted but perhaps not by the minister as leaving much to be desired <e> <s> we want to be able to have a say in the matter <e> <s> given the continued disquiet it would seem sensible for this chamber to reserve to itself the opportunity to review the code when the final draft is produced <e>", "<cs> the fact is as the noble lord lord mcintosh said most of the water authorities are very proud of their response to their environmental duties <e> <s> on second reading i produced a newspaper which the southern water authority sends out quarterly saying exactly what it is doing to improve the environment and to provide habitats and things like that for wildlife <e> <s> i think that is a marvellous idea <e> <s> i do not see any reason why there should not be some part in the annual report devoted to environmental responsibilities <e> <s> i wholeheartedly support this suggestion <e>", "<cs> one of the problems of following the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is that ones brief has been very fully put to the committee <e> <s> i support the amendment because i believe it is only right that these penalties should be written into the bill <e> <s> i suspect that the rights of individuals which come at a later stage are too uncertain of being effective <e> <s> in this case the secretary of state or the director will impose fines on companies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak briefly in support of the amendment which i agree is probing <e> <s> it seems to me that the bill gives a marvellous opportunity to put right some of the problems which still exist <e> <s> i am not too aware of private sewers going into the main sewers but obviously they exist <e> <s> i am very well aware and i am sure that the noble earl with his experience as a land agent will also know of many instances where private water pipes come off the mains <e> <s> that causes a lot of problems because in some estates they have not been properly maintained and there has been a refusal on the part of the water authorities and water companies to do anything about the problem <e> <s> that is perfectly fair because they are not responsible but they provide the water <e>", "<cs> we have exposed a fairly delicate area in which the government do not come off very well <e> <s> i wish that the noble lord lord harris were present <e> <s> he might be very much in support of this idea <e> <s> i certainly think that the boss of the noble earl the secretary of state himself might be quite interested in it <e> <s> i hope that it will be drawn to his attention <e>", "<cs> this amendment is well worth pursuing <e> <s> it is wide open for the secretary of state and the director general to do exactly as they like with regard to public information <e> <s> let us tie it down a bit more <e> <s> we know that the government are bringing forward an amendment at report stage to deal with the concerns that have been expressed earlier about environmental problems areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks <e> <s> let us tie it down a bit more by accepting this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to make a great deal of sense and to put some vim into the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trafford pleads eloquently for us not to set firm dates but the directive goes back to <e> <s> surely our job in this place is to look after the interests of consumers and to be honest with investors who may wish to take shares when the authorities are <e>", "<cs> it seems extraordinary to me that the government are not prepared to allow local authorities to enter into proceedings where there has been pollution possibly deliberate of water which could have been avoided <e> <s> it is a bureaucratic way of going about things to say that they must report the matter to the secretary of state or the director of public prosecutions and that that is the only way to proceed <e> <s> i see this as another way of saying to local authorities we dont want you any more <e> <s> that seems to be the complete analysis of what is going on in all government thinking at the present time <e> <s> the government simply do not think that local authorities should play any role in the matter but local authorities are the natural people to institute proceedings <e> <s> they have the enforcement officers <e> <s> they do the testing of water in most cases at the present time <e>", "<cs> i find that a very reassuring response <e> <s> i do not wish to cast any slight on the ability and professional knowledge of the many water consultancy firms in this country whose work is of a very high standard indeed <e> <s> i am only too well aware of that fact <e> <s> i am grateful for that response <e> <s> it is reassuring and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i seek to intervene because although the minister made a fairly comprehensive reply which seemed to suggest that all the necessary legislation to deal with these problems was in place i do not believe that it is for one minute <e> <s> that may be the fault of local authorities <e> <s> it may be the fault of water authorities <e> <s> i am not sure who to place the blame on <e> <s> it may even be the fault of the national <e>", "<cs> as someone who has for many years lived in a seaside area on an island which is a real island unlike anglesey but which has the same problems i support the noble lords arguments <e> <s> however if we change the outfalls now god help us all because our water authority has recently spent a fortune extending the sewer outlets at ryde and sandown and on the western end of the isle of wight <e> <s> large amounts of money have been spent extending the outfalls further into the solent where there are strong tides <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may confirm that i am quite certain that if there are not thousands there are certainly hundreds of them and they concern more than just a few houses <e>", "<cs> i agree that the government have gone part of the way but it is a great pity that they did not stick to their original intentions particularly at a time when the property market was boiling over <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that we should not bend over backwards to developers because they should do the job properly in the first place <e> <s> the same applies to sewers water supplies and roads <e> <s> we are suffering from so many unmade roads in this country which on frontages will cost so much to put in order that it just will not happen <e> <s> i believe that the same has happened as regards some of the private sewers that have been constructed in recent years <e> <s> it is sad and in the end it leads to untold problems which generally finish up on mps desks <e> <s> the government are going some way and i do not intend to press the amendment at this time <e> <s> it is a pity that they did not stick to their original purposes in <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i received a fairly good explanation of how the government see this working out <e> <s> i do not intend to press the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be the case that amendment no <e> <s> a will appeal to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i wish to speak to that and also to <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised by that answer <e> <s> however i do not believe that the government are being consistent in their attitude to the public or the private sector <e> <s> i believe that when the government privatise this industry some of the authorities should be obliged to go out to tender <e> <s> i did not expect a different answer and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i understand from my ex-constituents that one can in fact put a separate meter in between the boundary where the undertaker provides the water supply to the house at a cost of <e> <s> in that way one can check whether there is a leak in the pipe between the mains and where the water comes into the house <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one or two remarks <e> <s> the isle of wight has been mentioned in connection with the experiment one of taking place <e> <s> i believe that it is too early to answer the questions being raised because the trials are only just getting under way <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said about the new development <e> <s> however one would be more at ease if one knew the rate of charges about which we are talking <e> <s> for example i had a commercial building in which there was a burst pipe <e> <s> we could not replace the pipe because it would have meant digging up the concrete foundations <e> <s> therefore i had to pay over to the water authority in order to make a new <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what we are seeking in this amendment <e> <s> i accept the earlier comment by the government that we are going back to the secretary of state and to regulations and i accept that that is not what we are after <e> <s> we are looking to what happens when the local authorities send out rate demands <e> <s> they pinpoint on that demand where the money has gone how much to the county council how much on education how much spent by the borough or district council making the rate demand and so on <e> <s> we are seeking assurances that when the water undertakers send out their bills similar information will be given to consumers so that they know exactly how the charge is made up <e>", "<cs> it took a long time to get there but i am very grateful because the minister has confirmed what i was seeking to clarify <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that there will be inequities both ways <e> <s> there will be people up to the year who will still be paying on the basis of the old valuation list and others who have had their houses built from now on who will be metered but not in all cases <e> <s> we know already that the welsh authority will not be metering so there must be some other basis of charge <e> <s> whatever the government say about inequities there will be inequities <e>", "<cs> i prefaced my remarks by saying rather what the noble lord has just concluded <e> <s> however i shall certainly want to read what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee for more than a minute or two longer <e> <s> i think that we are in some difficulty in any event since we do not know how the government will put through their privatisation <e> <s> will they privatise the full per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> will they split it up into different authorities <e> <s> i do not know and i hope that some day we shall find out <e>", "<cs> before

minister for his interesting and informative response <e> <s> like the noble lord lord gallacher i want to study it <e> <s> i believe that it was helpful <e> <s> i also welcome the ministers assurance on amendment no <e> <s> d the role of the riparian owner that he will look at the point to see whether there is a gap in the common law and that someone might have the right despite all the controls

that reply <e> <s> i am afraid i am unaware of the fine limit so perhaps he could answer this question <e> <s> is there a fine limit of for breach of these terms or is the limit open to the courts to decide <e> <s> personally i do not know <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall not start putting too many people in prison <e> <s> i am pleased to hear that there is that provision and i also accept the fact that the amendment could be criticised because the directive numbers could change and problems of that kind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to cross swords

amendment no <e> <s> f and the requirement which i consider absolutely essential that water authorities should make public their intention to seek permission to sell land <e> <s> i do not necessarily support the actual wording of amendment no <e> <s> f because the obligation should be put on the companies themselves <e> <s> when they are seeking permission they should be obliged to place a suitable advertisement in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not suggesting that we start playing football in a field of wheat <e> <s> i used to farm myself and i should not have been very happy with that situation <e> <s> i did not read that into this amendment but other people have done so <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton shot me down on this amendment but he supported my last amendment <e> <s> i noted that with pleasure and delight <e> <s> i think that there is something which the government should consider <e> <s> although i accept immediately that my amendment is defective there is something to be looked at again and something should be done before we complete third reading <e> <s> i hope the government will do that <e> <s> there have been pleas from both sides of the house on that point <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at oclock on saturday night i lost my private water supply <e> <s> a pipe burst and i was without water in my household for seven to eight hours and i realised what a problem that is <e> <s> the farmer next door said weve been going to the wells in the field a few hundred yards away for the last years and youd better start doing it now <e> <s> there is a mains supply within yards of my cottage <e> <s> i am trying to persuade my farmer neighbour and a contractor to connect to that supply <e> <s> at the moment they are unwilling to do so because they think that the charges will be much higher and that it is better to retain the very faulty supply which comes from the hill behind us <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord ezra perhaps i may thank the noble lord for the concession that he has made <e> <s> my noble friend is grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be a sledgehammer to crack a nut that one has to leave prosecution solely to the secretary of state or the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> i should think that this is one way in which at local level people can react and get others to act on their behalf when a disaster occurs such as that which happened recently in cornwall and elsewhere in the western region <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will consider this amendment seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have understood this amendment properly <e> <s> i have listened very carefully <e> <s> i can say from the point of view of someone who pays sewerage and water charges that it has always annoyed me intensely that on a building in which i have no water connection and no sewerage i pay a charge to the water authority for taking my rainwater <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak very briefly before the minister replies <e> <s> he will be delighted to know that i do not intend to move amendment no <e> <s> but to withdraw it because i believe it is defective <e> <s> in that amendment we thought very much on the same lines as the noble lord lord graham except that we considered the appeal should be to the director of water services and not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not see the word connection in this first part of clause <e> <s> there is no mention of connection <e> <s> the clause reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is helpful to have that statement from the minister in the <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may apologise to the noble earl lord radnor <e> <s> i could not remember who moved the amendment at committee stage although i realise that i heard the debate <e> <s> i am grateful again for his support this afternoon it was he who raised the matter in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems with following the noble earl is that he always sounds so reasonable but members on this side of the house do not believe that he has sufficiently answered the forceful arguments submitted by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> whatever else may be said about the bill there can be no doubt that it is universally unpopular <e> <s> its principal sponsor the secretary of state for the environment whom i will pan is without question the most disliked and distrusted member of the present cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords yes he is <e> <s> for confirmation of that statement one has only to recall the size of the green vote in the recent euro-election and more particularly the result in the cotswolds where the green candidate polled exceptionally well <e> <s> for those of us in all parties who have pursued environmental issues consistently during our parliamentary careers the size of the support for the greens is frustrating to say the least but understandable <e> <s> yet under this measure far too much of vital importance is being left to the discretion of the self-same secretary of state and the provision of future regulations of unknown content <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also declare an interest in that i survive on a private supply and am hoping to god at the moment that the spring does not run out <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what has already been said <e> <s> it is a major concession in respect of sssis and i congratulate the government on giving that power <e> <s> i am worried about the ability of conservation bodies such as the rspb to find the money to acquire such sites if they are put on the market <e> <s> i am also worried about the market price which will be put on them <e> <s> already we know that the nature conservancy council has reported to the government who are considering a loan about whether some of the reservations which they now control and own should not also be sold to some of the voluntary bodies <e> <s> with the best will in the world their finances are limited as i well know <e> <s> if suddenly vast tracts of land are to be offered to such bodies they will have an awful job to find the money to acquire and subsequently manage them <e> <s> on the other hand the concession is greatly to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for his kind remarks <e> <s> i also thank my noble friends lord ezra and lord addington sir john bates and our own researcher mark <e> <s> we congratulate the minister on achieving his bill <e> <s> his patience and willingness have been greatly appreciated on all sides of the house and especially on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords months ago i was in seoul in south korea where hanyang university was establishing a chair in local government with the laudable intention of preparing a draft system of democratically elected local administrations most suited to the needs of that country which has not seen much democracy in recent years <e> <s> it was the koreans belief that west germany and the united kingdom were the best sources of advice because of our considerable experience in this field <e> <s> i am afraid that i had to say that to my mind local government in england and wales was in terminal decline and that only a completely new structure probably based on the directly elected mayoral system could possibly bring it back to life <e> <s> i have floated that view for many years <e> <s> i believe that to be the case if local government in britain is to work again as it should <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the comments made by the minister in another place <e> <s> is it the intention of the government to move an amendment so that that is on the face of the bill while it is in this house or do we have to wait for regulations <e>", "<cs> i believe that the person concerned in hillingdon was quite a senior officer in the glc <e> <s> i can see the former leader of that authority nodding <e> <s> certainly in the other place there are a number of instances of former civil servants who have been elected to parliament and who had much to contribute in the house <e>", "<cs> one further point occurs to me <e> <s> if we are not careful we shall stop any local government officer of any standing from helping any charitable or voluntary body <e> <s> those officers will make the excuse that this act of parliament places them in some difficulty and therefore they cannot help <e> <s> county treasurers or their deputies may help local causes <e> <s> chief officers or their deputies may give legal advice freely and willingly <e> <s> bank managers often become treasurers of local bodies <e> <s> if we are to say that there will be problems in defining exactly what is political activity and what is not the situation will be clouded <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief because the amendment covers the whole scene <e> <s> as the minister will know the amendment in my name and that of my noble friend lord winstanley applies to clause and not clause otherwise they are effectively the same <e> <s> all we are asking the minister to do is to have due regard to the civil service regulations <e> <s> when he replied to the last debate he mentioned that <e> <s> i hope that he will accept the amendment if not in this form certainly in some other guise <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and standing in my name and the name of the noble <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything said by the noble baroness lady blatch and i therefore do not understand why she does not want to add this provision to the clause <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the minister that that is a pretty ripe reply <e> <s> the secretary of state is interfering all over the place with local government <e> <s> to say as an answer that it is to be left to local discretion after all the regulations that he has laid down is beyond belief <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that intervention <e> <s> it had occurred to me that the monitoring officer might be the person to turn to but having already criticised the role of the monitoring officer i thought it better not to mention that possibility <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that example is absolutely correct and i support it <e> <s> i received a fair reply from the minister <e> <s> i realise that a slight problem could arise with my amendment <e> <s> i should put it on the record that we recognise the steps the government are taking with the bill to give rights to minorities <e> <s> we welcome it very much <e> <s> with those words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that detailed and helpful reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is worthwhile having that on the record <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while i have some sympathy with the amendment i do not wish the regulations to be held up <e> <s> i think it is right that there should be declaration of interest and that regulations should be drawn up for that purpose as regards local government <e> <s> however i was staggered both in another place and in this chamber to find that members are entitled to speak on subjects in which they have very large financial interests <e> <s> they are never obliged to sit down and keep quiet <e> <s> in local government however that does not and cannot happen <e>", "<cs> as that was an intervention perhaps i may reply to it <e> <s> i accept that members of this chamber as far as i know always declare any interest when speaking on a subject but they go on to address the chamber on that subject <e> <s> i was trying to say that that is not permitted in local government or at least not in the local authority in which i served <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he went at a fair pace to start with so i shall need to read his words rather carefully <e> <s> he came to the point which i raised <e> <s> i welcome that <e> <s> it clarifies the position to some extent <e> <s> as i said earlier it was a probing amendment <e> <s> i felt that it was probably wrongly drafted and he has confirmed that it should have included community councils <e> <s> i shall study with interest what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness wish to speak first <e> <s> she has great knowledge <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> i shall listen to the governments response with some interest <e> <s> my experience agrees very much with that of the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> with regard to a health matter the ombudsman was so disgusted that the area health authority would not pay compensation of about that he took the matter to a committee in another place presided over by sir anthony buck the member for colchester north <e> <s> it is a committee which has some strength <e> <s> i vividly remember the chairman of the health authority and the chief executive sitting in the corridor outside one of the committee rooms worried that they were going before the committee <e> <s> in the end the authority paid up <e> <s> it was absolutely ridiculous that the matter had to be taken to such length <e> <s> if it had not been for the ombudsmans initiative it would not have gone that far <e>", "<cs> on first seeing these clauses i welcomed them very much <e> <s> in many parts of the country it is to local government that people turn at times of difficulty <e> <s> it could be the closure of a major business or sudden high unemployment <e>", "<cs> i do not know how the noble lord lord mcintosh will respond to the ministers reply <e> <s> however it is important that such aid as the noble lord outlined should be allowed to continue and that there should be flexibility <e> <s> having fought successive governments over the designation of assisted area of rural development area status where part of ones constituency was inside but another was not i know that the local authority knows where the stimulus and help are needed <e> <s> some of the schemes outlined by the noble lord lord mcintosh are worth while and it would be tragic if they were put at risk <e> <s> parts of the ministers reponse gave me hope and i hope that the noble lord lord mcintosh will pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> i have no objection to these amendments <e> <s> however i have to say to the noble lord lord jenkin that to oblige authorities in some areas to discuss with chambers of commerce that are totally moribund is a bit much <e> <s> i set up an enterprise agency <e> <s> i was advised by the industries involved in the enterprise agency i wanted it to be taken over by a chamber of commerce that no such thing should happen <e> <s> the chamber of commerce was so decrepit that it was not worth consulting <e> <s> i am a non-domestic ratepayer <e> <s> to say that we have to consult people whom we know have very little to contribute is not very clever <e> <s> they may be stronger in some areas but that is not my experience <e>", "<cs> i regret that i did not give notice that i wished to speak on clause stand part <e> <s> i apologise for doing so at this late hour <e> <s> i draw attention to what i believe is a total nonsense in clause where it reads as follows <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> i shall not be raising this matter on report <e>", "<cs> i rise to add my support for this amendment <e> <s> for many years i was a county council representative on a charitable trust <e> <s> i understand that such a trust is not in fact covered by this part of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to say that on that trust there were four people <e> <s> i was a county council representative and i comprised one quarter of the directors of that trust <e>", "<cs> i am becoming more confused <e> <s> i am not entirely sure that the government themselves understand the position <e> <s> i wish to raise one case in point <e> <s> i established a buildings preservation trust <e> <s> a small amount of money came from the private sector but the vast majority came from the county council and two district councils <e> <s> the trust was originally chaired by the lord lieutenant <e> <s> the trust continues today and the representatives on that trust are making grants to people of little means who wish to make repairs to properties that it is considered worth preserving <e> <s> the majority are local authority nominees from the county council and two district councils <e> <s> one or two people have been brought in from outside for their expertise <e> <s> the current chairman is the former county planning officer <e> <s> presumably unless has done four years he is involved <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu has answered the question which i posed on the previous amendment <e> <s> he is telling the chamber and it is a very serious matter that a building preservation trust such as the one i outlined although it is a fairly small one i think he probably has personal knowledge of it would almost certainly be caught by the terms of the bill <e> <s> that is so stupid that it would be ridiculous <e> <s> local authorities themselves are now referring cases which they think are deserving but which they <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps he could clarify one point <e> <s> he used the term subsidised housing sector <e> <s> he was obviously referring to the public sector and local authority housing <e> <s> i think he would agree that the private sector is also subsidised through mortgage tax relief <e> <s> it is is it not <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will accept my view as one who once chaired meetings of a superannuation fund which was invested only with the greatest care through the advice of city experts that in or even per cent <e> <s> of cases supernnuation funds of county councils and other authorities are run very carefully indeed <e> <s> i do not believe that he wishes to imply anything less than that <e> <s> there might have been one or two bad examples but i do not know of them <e>", "<cs> we have spent half an hour on this subject and ought not to spend much longer <e> <s> i hope that when he takes up his new post in the treasury the minister who has considerable knowledge of the housing problems of the nation will at least fight the battle for more expenditure on housing both in the public sector and in the housing association movement <e> <s> i am afraid he is likely to become subsumed into that terrible department which controls everything <e> <s> i hope at least that he can <e>", "<cs> i very much support this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will explain to the committee the governments exact intention when they talk about interlining council tenants rents with the capital market values <e> <s> what basis will they take as being the market value <e> <s> will it be the price at which for instance properties of the former glc have been sold in large blocks to various housing associations <e> <s> will it be the basis on which sales are taking place in some areas to housing associations <e> <s> will account be taken of the enormous variations that have arisen through house prices being slashed <e> <s> in shropshire only the other day a builder slashed off two-bedroomed bungalows reducing their price from to <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps he can tell me what is the difference between reasonably expected to pay and affordable <e> <s> they do not seem to me to be very different <e> <s> i also beg him to simplify the forms on which people have to apply for housing benefit <e> <s> i tried to help someone to complete one the other day and i nearly gave up because it was so complicated <e> <s> i wonder whether that is understood in government circles <e>", "<cs> i want to put a question to the minister <e> <s> under part iv of the housing act tenants who do not wish to transfer to a new authority i remember debating this point can have their properties leased back to the council and remain as tenants <e> <s> in that instance where the local authority still has some responsibility can i assume that it would not be the judgment of the secretary of state to allow the housing revenue account to be wound up <e> <s> they may have sold the stock but local authorities lease back housing where tenants have not voted in favour of a transfer <e> <s> does that remain a requirement for a housing revenue account <e>", "<cs> well we have managed to deal with the tit for tat <e> <s> because of his agricultural experience i am sure the noble earl will agree with me that the term ring fence actually meant an asset it was an asset to have the land ring fenced <e> <s> i do not think it is necessary for local authorities to have such an asset <e> <s> i may be that the government are being too rigid on the matter but as the noble earl rightly said there are other amendments to be discussed and we shall listen to the governments further explanations with interest <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we also very much support the amendment <e> <s> we greatly prefer it to those coming up later which the government have tabled and which will allow people occupying local authority homes that have been specially adapted for them to acquire them <e> <s> those homes have been adapted at considerable expense and are in limited supply <e> <s> i do not think that that is the right way to go ahead <e>", "<cs> i should like to put one point to the minister <e> <s> obviously i support very much what has been said on this side of the committee <e> <s> one of the suggestions put forward by the noble earl was that local authorities should not pay out grant money until they were satisfied that the work had been completed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to the later amendment in my name amendment no <e> <s> a since it seems to me that we are all talking about the same subject <e> <s> i do not wish to waste the time of the committee and i shall move that amendment when we come to it <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee <e> <s> as i understand it the covers total assets <e> <s> on the same basis i believe that is the limit below which one qualifies for social security <e> <s> however that may have been changed <e> <s> the figure of per cent <e> <s> was rather picked out of the air but it constitutes one-fifth <e> <s> i know that the minister has great agricultural experience so he may know that a figure of per cent <e> <s> has encouraged some farmers to take up grants <e> <s> therefore the figure was chosen as being an incentive to take up a grant <e> <s> i am grateful for the ministers response and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to divide the committee but it would seem to me and i think to many others more appropriate to have the specified period of time which would surely be more in keeping with the governments attempt to target public resources and ensure the best use of them <e> <s> the noble earl would i think say amen to that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord dean and my noble friend lord russell for their contributions <e> <s> they have both shown that certainly this side of the committee and i am sure some members on the other side believe that while the government pay lip service to energy saving they do not actually do anything seriously about it <e> <s> certainly they do not do enough <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not going to divide the committee on the issue <e> <s> i point out to the minister that we state in the amendment that it was the governments primary objective to deal with the maintenance and improvement of the nations housing stock <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble earl will receive an answer to that point <e> <s> i said that the amendment was a probing one <e> <s> the minister should listen to the noble lord lord dean because he has had substantial local government experience <e> <s> the noble earl lord balfour has also had some experience of taking up improvement grants on his estate <e> <s> there is no question but that there has been fraud <e> <s> the amendment is saying to the government that they should tighten up a bit more <e> <s> we are trying to look after the nations coffers <e>", "<cs> i support everything said by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> it is a great pity that at this time of night we should be debating energy saving <e> <s> there are other debates to come which should also not take place when so few noble lords are present <e> <s> those debates relate to the new commercial rating clauses <e> <s> it is wrong <e> <s> we should be giving much more attention to energy saving <e> <s> i give notice that we shall raise these matters <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene at this late hour but i believe that this is an important amendment <e> <s> we are being addressed at a pace of knots <e> <s> but as i understand it local authorities in england and wales will be able to set a standard charge up to a maximum of multiple of one and a half but in scotland authorities may apply a multiple of up to two <e> <s> i welcome the flexibility that means that they do not have to charge as much as one and a half and can opt for less <e> <s> am i correct in saying that that is the maximum <e> <s> that is what i understood from what the minister said and from what i read in the amendments on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i welcome that response and i shall certainly have to think about it but the government had here a system which they could have used to better ability <e> <s> i am satisfied with the response <e>", "<cs> at an enormous gabble the minister has proposed amendments extending from page to the top of page <e> <s> it is an enormous amount to try to take in <e> <s> while the proposals may be basically along the lines that have been outlined in government press releases and earlier statements i suggest and the noble earl is a practising member that it is a bit much to take these matters on board at oclock at night <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that this group of amendments was tabled only last friday <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the minister for coming to the house to make this statement <e> <s> does he agree that even the most fair-minded observer will undoubtedly comment that the government have a distinct attack of the jitters <e> <s> they must be regretting that they ever embarked on this stupid policy of the poll tax which will prove to be a most bureaucratic and costly nightmare <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord renton whose efforts in this direction should be applauded on all sides of the chamber <e> <s> in the other place and in this chamber he has constantly pushed proposals for a proper co-ordination of the various bodies involved in emergency planning <e>", "<cs> i must heartily congratulate the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> nobody tries harder than the opposition front bench to get something out of the government on occasions such as this <e> <s> i welcome the noble earls last statement and hope very much that we shall hear at report stage whether it is possible to do something to help these people <e>", "<cs> i wish to put on record the fact that we welcome this move on behalf of the housing association movement <e> <s> i think that it is right and i therefore congratulate the government on having made it <e>", "<cs> the government are now and have been for some time reviewing the workings of the homeless persons legislation <e> <s> if the review is concluded is it intended that in future local authorities will not be responsible for housing the elderly and vulnerable <e> <s> they are the two classes of people who are entitled to be housed under the homeless persons legislation <e> <s> local authorities normally take the age of for women who have a priority for housing under that legislation <e>", "<cs> i could not agree more <e> <s> if we can get private property built by individuals to let that is fine <e> <s> but what sort of rent does the noble lord think those properties will require at todays capital values <e> <s> does he think most elderly people would be able to pay those market rents <e>", "<cs> i believe that the contribution of the noble lord lord vinson should be paid great attention <e> <s> as i well know in my part <e>", "<cs> i did not move amendment l <e> <s> that is lord mcintoshs amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply which no doubt will be studied by those most interested <e> <s> it does not always work out that people get joint tenancies <e> <s> i agree that that is one of the solutions and i hope that the advice will be taken <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure the ministers response will be studied with interest by the lawyers who draw up these amendments <e> <s> no doubt they will want to return to the matter another day <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with respect i cannot say that that is a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> i thought that for once i might get an amendment accepted <e>

for that response which was a little more helpful than usual <e> <s> there has not been too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what the noble lord lord mcintosh said <e> <s> my name should probably also be attached to amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept the amendments which seem to be highly desirable <e> <s> i should have thought that the government would have no difficulty in accepting them <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been described is a bureaucratic nightmare <e> <s> some exemptions have been granted and we welcome that <e> <s> however there are a host of bodies which will be caught up by this clause despite the small amount of flexibility which the government have introduced since the bill was first published <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls believes that these matters should be left to regulations <e> <s> i should have thought he would support the view that it would be better if the voluntary organisations were not affected by the bill at all which would be so much simpler <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the minister who is to reply is unfortunately wearing a treasury rather than his former housing hat <e> <s> it might have been better if he were still in his former role <e> <s> it is not just local authority housing which we know the government wish to phase out

the fact if it is true that the new secretary of state for the environment has managed to obtain f million from the treasury to do something about the homeless situation in particular about bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> that is costing the nation million a year at the present time and the figure keeps increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say put out the flags <e> <s> however i am grateful for that offer and i totally accept what the minister said in reply namely that they accept the amendment now but will possibly be drafting a rather different amendment for consideration on third reading <e> <s> on that basis i thank the government for making such a sensible decision <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support this amendment moved so convincingly by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> i would have thought that his statistics certainly vindicate what we are seeking to do <e> <s> as the minister may recall i had a fairly similar amendment down at the committee stage which was trying to protect elderly people whose long leases which contained onerous repair clauses were coming to an end and they were liable to face dilapidation claims especially in certain parts of london and in kensington in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly never said that my noble friend was included <e> <s> but it is a fact that as one grows older one does not want

will study with interest what he said <e> <s> it is a pity that we removed the word reasonably from the bill last year <e> <s> it is too late <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly may i support the right reverend prelate because i was a founder member of the isle of wight housing association in <e> <s> i attacked the church at that time because they wanted to build executive-type homes in the grounds of our rectory <e> <s> as i was a sequestrator for years i fought that very hard and then the archdeacon at the time said form a housing association <e> <s> we did so and he became our first chairman

option of buying was not available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords our support for the amendment was clearly stated by myself and by my noble friend lord evans in committee <e> <s> i believe that there are times when this house must act as the conscience of the nation and i hope that it will do so tonight in respect of this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pity that we have to raise this matter at in the evening <e> <s> of course the government are satisfied and believe that tenants who transfer have this security <e> <s> however it is not quite good enough to rely on that and say we think it is all right but we may have to reconsider that situation if the case came before the courts <e> <s> we have counsels opinion on this and it cannot lightly be set aside <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that i heard the same remarks about a week ago <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with that invitation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs>

grateful to the government for their co-operation and i also express my thanks to my colleague simon hughes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask a point of clarification <e> <s> i heard him say that when the restrictions come into force next march sitting members will be allowed to stay until the end of their term <e> <s> that means that county councillors elected last year will be able to see through the remaining two years of their term <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment <e> <s> it is rumoured i believe that it is correct that the secretary of state has managed to obtain something like million to deal with the bed-and-breakfast situation which is particularly costly in london but applies also elsewhere <e> <s> i understand that we may have a statement within the next days or so on the homeless review <e> <s> i do not ask the minister to give me the answer today but i believe that a statement is coming <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord rippon for intervening on this matter because he will know as i am sure the minister will also know that while we hear about avoidance schemes by local authorities local authorities likewise feel very aggrieved at the way in which the treasury has over a number of years dealt with the principle of additionality <e>

the paymaster general could at least ease that situation it would be a great step forward <e> <s> why should local authorities not receive the money for which they qualify under european grant systems

been made on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the chairman and members of the committee on an excellent report and also on their choice of a well qualified adviser mr robin grove-white

about the bonn convention the berne convention the directive on birds and the ramsar convention <e> <s> they are all described fully and explained in this excellent document <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the establishment of marine nature reserves is a tricky business as i found out when i tried to support one on the isle of wight <e> <s> but is it not also a fact as indicated by the noble lord lord cledwyn that the break-up of the ncc is bound to make matters that much more difficult <e> <s> will the noble lord take that into account before a bill is put before the house on green issues <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the shortage of teachers does the minister accept that there is an acute shortage of qualified planning officers who have been inundated with applications of one kind or another over the past three or four years <e> <s> what do the government have in mind to help local authorities over that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords pursuing the subject of food it has been reported today that in romania there is a vast shortage of meat <e> <s> there is also a report that the french in particular are sending very large quantities of food from the marshalling yards

<e> <s> the house has been collapsing rather rapidly tonight and i apologise to him but he had the courtesy to advise me of some of the points he intended to raise <e> <s> he certainly raised them in the part of his address that i heard and they are very pertinent questions <e> <s> we await the ministers reply with interest but i do not intend to pursue them much further than that <e>", "<cs> my

the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> what is the standard tax on second homes if they are not beach huts if it is not a roof tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will come to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reconsider his actions after the outcome of the elections next month <e> <s> is it not up to the public to decide whether they want additional services and if they are prepared to pay for them they should vote for them at the ballot box <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one point <e> <s> in my part of the world there are still liberals and it is not the deepest part of wales <e> <s> our local chairman of the area health authority did not know until about seven days before his term of office expired whether or not he would be reappointed <e> <s> certainly everyone who served in that authority felt that that was outrageous <e> <s> i put great pressure on the successor of the noble lord lord jenkin to make a decision one way or the other <e> <s> the chairman was reappointed for two years <e> <s> expedition in the making of appointments is an aspect that ought to be discussed during this debate <e> <s> one knew that a search was being made to appoint someone else who held rather different views <e> <s> in fact someone else could not be found and he was reappointed for two years <e> <s> after the two years expired sure enough he was ditched <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the undertakings given by the minister today most reasssuring <e> <s> however does his response depend on the fact that we maintain a proper scientific base in the nature conservancy council in great britain as a whole <e> <s> does he agree that the ill thought out ideas of the government contained in the environment bill that is soon to come before this house do not hold out much hope for the future and that we shall split our old britain attitude to such matters which is so important and admired by our colleagues on the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to the minister for his lucid introduction of the bill <e> <s> he went through it very clearly and we understand what it contains <e> <s> on these benches we give a qualified support to most parts of the bill <e> <s> it is a hotchpotch of measures but they are welcome nevertheless <e> <s> the criticisms of the exclusions listed by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey are fully justified <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to cover energy conservation and transport problems <e> <s> those matters will have to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord taylor will kindly wait i shall come to that point <e> <s> i am speaking on behalf of the party <e> <s> all the points i now make were actually made by my honourable friend mr malcolm bruce in committee in another place <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord mcintosh whether the relevant clause is not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the response of the minister <e> <s> the noble lord lord parry has been involved in the picking up of cans from lands end to john ogroats he is now an expert on cans <e> <s> however he had perhaps better go north to the shetlands <e> <s> i spent a holiday in the shetlands years ago before the oil boom <e> <s> one could be miles from lerwick in the midst of the most barren countryside yet if one stepped out of the car one automatically stood on a mcewans beer can <e> <s> there are probably millions of mcewans beer cans all over the shetlands <e> <s> people obviously went into town filled up the car with cans then threw them out on their way home <e> <s> i am afraid that there is a large problem in the shetlands <e>", "<cs> i correct the minister <e> <s> we do not say that a report should be produced every six months but we say that one should be produced within six months of the bill becoming law <e> <s> we then talk about a report being made periodically <e> <s> i believe that there has been a blow-your-own-trumpet session in the department of the environment before the minister came here today <e> <s> if that is what the answer is to be throughout the passage of this bill i warn him that he will be on his feet for a long time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his response <e> <s> it is on record and available <e> <s> a study of our exchanges may help in formulating the environmental white paper <e> <s> the noble lord may have noticed that i have on a green tie and there is a green handkerchief in my pocket a suitable colour i thought in which to be attired today <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must counter that observation by saying that we had a very jerky system so far as concerns local government and improvement of housing over the past or more years <e> <s> a few years ago the government introduced a system whereby people who owned properties built prior to could obtain per cent <e> <s> grant to reroof their homes <e> <s> however the trouble was that the availability of this offer was not made obligatory upon local authorities and in any case they were told initially that the offer would last for only one year <e> <s> therefore many local authorities did not adopt the scheme <e> <s> that is why i spent reroofing my old house i received no grant <e> <s> however afterwards everyone else on the isle of wight who had a house of that type seemed to have received such a grant <e> <s> but what a ridiculous way of going about the matter <e> <s> why on earth did we give per cent <e> <s> grants <e> <s> if we had given per cent <e> <s> grants vast numbers of people would have taken advantage of the offer <e> <s> that is the kind of thing we must do <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble lord lord lucas can argue in such a fashion when it seems that we are to get a lot of propaganda from the front bench opposite about what they are doing with british rail and goodness knows what else <e> <s> i think that the government must be horrified that the noble lord lord clinton-davis has come into this chamber and told us a few brutal facts about what has been going on when he viewed it from brussels over the past few years <e> <s> i very much welcome his comments this evening <e> <s> i think that it is about time that some of those things were debated in this chamber <e>", "<cs> the amendment states that <e>", "<cs> we have given the whole subject of emissions a fairly good run <e> <s> i agree with the minister that this is a very serious matter <e> <s> it is up to us all to keep up the pressure <e> <s> i agree that the government have had a change of heart in recent months and years which is much to be grateful for but we have to go a little faster than we are doing <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i add my support to this amendment <e> <s> it is important that an amendment of this nature should be written into the bill so that there is no misunderstanding <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord norrie on tabling this amendment <e> <s> i very much hope that we will receive a favourable response from the minister because that would set many minds at rest <e> <s> it is desperately important that the situation is not weakened by this measure <e>", "<cs> i have a fairly lengthy brief on this subject but because the hour is late i have not quoted it all <e> <s> i assume so far as these amendments are concerned that the local authorities have in mind and this came from a local authority source a situation arising when a development takes out an estate and money has to be deposited to make sure that the road is made up to the proper adopted standard <e> <s> what happens if in this case somebody is applying to carry out a process in which some liquid is likely to be released for example if a building gets half built and something starts oozing out of the place and the company goes bust <e> <s> it is a terrible job surely to try to get some compensation from some source to clear up the mess left behind <e>", "<cs> i did not anticipate a very favourable response <e> <s> however the point has been aired to which i received a reply <e> <s> i still believe that there is a problem <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that response <e> <s> i repeat my former remark that it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that is a generous offer and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> that was a very full answer and i am grateful for it but i am not entirely sure that it covers the situation of countries to where the waste is being exported in other words that we make sure that the people receiving waste are similarly qualified to deal with it in a proper manner <e> <s> however i will study the ministers reply and i hope that i shall find it totally reassuring <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is a great waste of money for housing associations to get projects off the ground and then to have to suspend them <e> <s> properties that could be occupied therefore lie empty damage is caused to them and the whole programme is put back for a year or more <e> <s> does he not agree that that in itself is a substantial waste of public money <e>", "<cs> i have added my name to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i wish to support what the noble lord lord mcintosh had to say particularly about

lord lord renton for his support <e> <s> the government response is good news <e> <s> i know that the minister is particularly pleased with what is shortly to happen in kent because it will put a bottom into the market <e>", "<cs> i was attracted to this amendment not because of paper but because of used tyres <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord lord jenkin that recycled paper is very good for toilet rolls and also it provides a great deal of writing material <e> <s> i hope that many more people will use it <e> <s> at long last i have got my wife buying it <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that news and i congratulate the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i wish to place on record the fact that in tabling the amendments the government are carrying out a promise made in another place and that therefore we welcome them <e> <s> my only criticisms are that the arrangements may be difficult to work in practice and that the payments for third parties will be discretionary <e> <s> that may be one of the less attractive aspects of what has been put before us <e> <s> however we on these benches as well as the outside waste authorities will welcome the governments action in this respect <e>", "<cs> that act was passed in <e> <s> factory farming took off in the s and s <e> <s> i wonder whether the point which the noble lord has raised is a matter which we ought to look at again <e>", "<cs> i wish that my noble friend lord hampton had been present to hear that response <e> <s> i believe that the minister is on my side and i congratulate him on some of his responses in the debate <e> <s> it is a tragedy that we must follow tradition <e> <s> obviously i shall not divide the <e>", "<cs> i take from that reply first that the amendment may be defective in that it refers to the wrong clause in the bill <e> <s> i accept that criticism <e> <s> i shall of course study what the minister has said as also will local authorities <e> <s> i cannot understand why this cannot be written into the bill <e> <s> when i was in parliament i represented an island which had run out of landfill sites and we were thinking of having to export our wastes to somewhere in oxfordshire <e> <s> however we put in some equipment which is dealing with the incineration and total regurgitation of all our waste <e> <s> i do not know whether it has been acceptable or successful or not <e> <s> however i feel it would be much simpler if we actually said that we will ban imported waste from landfill sites <e> <s> i understand the government are saying that in all probability they will ban it but that is not written into the bill <e> <s> i shall study what the minister has said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of the amendment <e> <s> although it may be believed that this is a problem that occurs in urban areas i can assure the committee that it also occurs in rural areas <e> <s> i live in an area where the farm buildings are floodlit all night long <e> <s> i do not know why <e> <s> it may be to help fowl to lay more eggs <e>", "<cs> this is not just a problem in urban areas it also exists in rural areas <e> <s> as i believe someone quite rightly said during the second reading debate farmers are also guilty of littering the countryside and their own land leaving fertiliser bags and feed bags blowing all over the place <e> <s> such matters would be covered by the amendment and i support it <e>", "<cs> there is another example and that is the new forest where there are often pigs in the road <e> <s> when the noble lord lord stanley gets the chance to move his amendment if he has not already done so he will talk about that <e> <s> i hope to agree with him <e> <s> i would not wish to penalise farmers who drive their sheep down the road <e> <s> it has to be done <e> <s> it would be impossible to clean up afterwards <e>", "<cs> i have an enormous regard for the tidy britain group <e> <s> i have played my part in helping that group over many years <e> <s> we filled a shop window in newport high street with loads of rubbish to show people what we had picked up <e> <s> i got my councillors out on sundays and they were photographed tidying up the countryside <e> <s> about years ago with the world wildlife group we went miles down a road with lorries and put all the litter into sacks and took it way <e> <s> it is all back there again <e>", "<cs> that is a very fair reply and as good as i could have expected <e> <s> i should like to point out that the canadian government cancelled the release

will prevent local authorities from enacting their own by-laws <e> <s> in westminster they have done just that by introducing fines for dropping litter <e>", "<cs> i accept that helpful response <e>

resist the request of the japanese and norwegians to resume the catching of minke whales <e> <s> the government are doing a good job and i congratulate them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from wildlife link and some other organisations plus prominent individual conservationists concerned with the protection of the environment which prays that this house will delete part vii from the environmental protection bill pending further discussion and consultation on the future arrangements for nature conservation and countryside protection in the context of the environment white paper <e>", "<cs> this is a probing amendment <e> <s> as a result of a rumour that the noble earl might not be able to attend the committee this afternoon i added my name to it yesterday <e> <s> i believe strongly that it goes some way towards establishing the kind of structure which might have resulted from the white paper promised this autumn if only the government had given it a chance and had not been so quick to dismember the ncc without any discussions with bodies outside this committee which are anxious about what is happening <e>", "<cs> or edinburgh is not the headquarters of the forestry commission in edinburgh <e>", "<cs> some of the amendments are tabled in my name and i shall speak only briefly because i do not wish to repeat what has already been said <e> <s> if the government cannot accept the additional responsibility of the joint committee to cover countryside and wider issues they should at least give the matter consideration and come back on report <e> <s> i hope that they will do so because their answer to the carver committee at paragraph referring to the amalgamation of the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council indicates that the option for institutional change across the whole range of bodies concerned with the environment is being considered in the context of an environment white paper and that the government are considering the question of furthering that context <e>", "<cs> the minister has certainly kept his cool <e> <s> this is a chamber where we are not supposed to be rude to each other but if a member of the opposition were putting forward this proposal the first thing the government would say would be what will it cost <e> <s> we are now told that the government do not know what it will cost and we do not know whether the treasury will come up with the goods <e>", "<cs> we know from the bill that the cost to date will be between million and million <e> <s> we have had the ministers response that he believes it will be less than million <e> <s> if it is less than million and if as we suspect the treasury says that we can only have <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to support the amendment <e> <s> perhaps

something <e> <s> this may be a very naive question who will carry out the quinquennial review which is due next year <e> <s> will it be done by the joint committee or by the individual country councils working together <e>", "<cs> one of the problems is that our amendments were put down before the ministers which were only put down last friday <e> <s> i am having great difficulty in deciding whether the ministers amendments cover all the points <e> <s> having heard the advice of the noble and gallant lord lord carver it is clear that they do not <e> <s> i believe that in some respects the government have not gone far enough <e> <s> however they have gone a long way and i congratulate them on the fact that it is now fairly clear what the role of the joint committee is to be

name and in the name of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> it deals with grants and loans by the joint committee <e> <s> the amendment would give the joint committee statutory powers to provide financial assistance in the form of grants or loans <e> <s> the ncc already has the power to make grants <e> <s> each year it processes around applications from landowners schools and conservation organisations <e>", "<cs> this is an important point <e> <s> i realise that the minister is trying to avoid giving the joint committee executive powers <e> <s> however will he at least state that it is the governments wish that the three country councils should jointly set up a body so that they can consider as one applications from such organisations as the rspb <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment so able moved by the noble earl lord peel <e> <s> it is a very worthwhile extra facility to provide to the nature conservancy council <e> <s> it could have a very desirable effect in the

reaches of the thames from possible flooding <e> <s> there were very high tides this weekend <e> <s> we know what happened in north wales earlier this year and how those people have still not recovered from the disaster which hit them <e> <s> we also know that east anglia is equally vulnerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support the amendment <e> <s> it is extraordinary that the

books cost a great deal of money as i know because i am always buying books <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> which appears also in my name <e> <s> this amendment would add an extra clause a to the bill where the secretary of state may give directions to the enforcing authorities as to the conditions which are or are not to be included in authorisations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government can take pride in the fact that they have made a very sensible decision in making a tax concession on lead-free petrol <e> <s> almost overnight the filling stations in

perhaps the minister can bring us up to date on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble earl said could we not take back all these pence coins and get rid of the horrible new pence coin which i do not believe anyone likes <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support everything that has been said by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it would be preferable if the words of the amendment or other similar words were added to the bill <e> <s> that would cover the point made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lucas was supporting the amendments so ably

adequate time to discuss these matters which are complex <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems absolute nonsense to break up very good schemes in places such as richmond just because everything has to be done

months it will be deemed to have rejected the application <e> <s> presumably the matter then goes to appeal <e> <s> it seems to me to be commonsense to make a little more time available because these

<e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> it might have been better if i had said in the first instance that we should try to take the amendments separately <e> <s> i attempted to set the matter in the right direction <e> <s> i am aware that there has been a great deal of concern about the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord byron <e> <s> in letters i received only this morning i was asked to support it <e> <s> many solicitors are concerned about the issue <e> <s> the matter was raised by the noble lord lord mcintosh at committee stage <e> <s> i cannot say whether or not we have the right answer <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments came up at a late hour and i must admit to the house that i was dozing at the time <e> <s> however i am grateful that the government have tabled the amendments <e> <s> if the noble baroness will look again at amendment no <e> <s> a and perhaps accept it on the whole the people who have been writing to us complaining bitterly about changing the procedure from criminal to civil should be satisfied with what the government have brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly to amendments nos <e> <s> and to which my name is attached <e> <s> i wish to make clear to the noble lord lord mcintosh that i very much support his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we now know that the jncc will have as many as employees <e> <s> therefore its finance must be secured <e> <s> there cannot be terrible arguments between the three country councils as to how the organisation is to be financed <e> <s> i believe that amendment no <e> <s> is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i also protest <e> <s> i went out of my way to say that i thought that the noble baroness has behaved superbly since she took over her role <e> <s> if the former minister were sitting on this side of the house i wonder whether he would be satisfied with the situation as it has been put before the house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support to these amendments <e> <s> earlier this afternoon we heard the noble baroness speak about countryside matters in relation to the role of the jncc and i believe that this is a perfectly adequate definition which i hope will be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the intervention from the chairman of the national rivers authority was helpful <e> <s> i do not wish to delay him too long but i have an amendment coming up amendment no <e> <s> and i hope he will be here to listen to the debate on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her response and i shall study her reply <e> <s> if she has any influence on her department i am sure that she has because her heart is in the right place perhaps she will introduce legislation on common land in the next session of parliament <e> <s> i believe that it has been promised in conservative manifestos from a year or two back <e> <s> i think that that would be very helpful <e> <s> she will know from her previous experience in local government that compulsory purchase is a hazardous procedure and local governments do not embark on it if they can possibly avoid it because they generally become unstuck <e> <s> i think the noble baroness is saying that the remedies are there but that they are not very straightforward <e>", "<cs> my lords i honestly believe that that is a totally nonsensical reply <e> <s> i am sorry to say this but i do not think that these matters will work out as the government seem to believe they will <e> <s> the majority of the farmers who live near me are living in england but they are mostly welsh <e> <s> however they do not go around parading the fact that they want to be governed by the welsh office they regard themselves as being in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i quoted the select committee in my support <e> <s> i also quoted the law commission <e> <s> we quoted from different paragraphs of the report but it did say that <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not receive an answer to the scottish problem <e> <s> it may have to come another day <e> <s> i am grateful for the answer <e> <s> there is legislation on the statute book which should be able to deal with the problem <e> <s> i suspect that it is much worse than we appreciate and the nra is most anxious <e> <s> i shall not pursue the matter further <e> <s> i am grateful for the response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the amendment which has been so ably put forward by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it was suggested that perhaps i ought to table the amendment on the affirmative resolution that i had put down at report stage <e> <s> however in all fairness although we did not vote on that particular resolution when we voted last wednesday most people agreed that that was a test of the opinion of the house <e> <s> had we carried that vote the government would have accepted the purport of what we were trying to say <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the whole argument <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord has been present half the time <e> <s> that is the real argument that it was all arranged on the back of an envelope about two years ago between the then secretary of state for the environment and the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> perhaps he would talk to the cpre the rspb the rsnc or any of those bodies <e> <s> they would like to see the ncc as it was organised in a more <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an important statement in response to the point so ably put by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> it means that whoever is the chief executive of the jncc will be appointed for his knowledge of science and that the jncc will be involved in continuing scientific research for great britain as a whole <e> <s> it will be a national role <e> <s> am i right in that assumption <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord renton believes that we have to cross the floor of the house to get our amendments accepted i am afraid that he will be disappointed <e> <s> i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i like the noble lord lord mcintosh believed that the government had covered these points <e> <s> i received many letters as he did <e> <s> i cannot believe that the law society would issue a press release as it did funnily enough just after midnight on sunday <e> <s> i did not know that the law <e>", "<cs> my lords for the most part the bill is greatly to be welcomed <e> <s> when it was first introduced i described it as a bit of a ragbag but it is a major piece of environmental legislation <e> <s> i too congratulate the noble baroness and her colleagues the noble lords lord reay and lord arran and her predecessor the noble lord lord hesketh on the way in which they have piloted the bill through the house in its many stages <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the minister for her explanation and welcome her indication of further amendments which on the whole we look forward to they appear to be on the right lines <e> <s> it is a bill which for the most part appears to command almost universal approval among the various interested bodies <e> <s> i suspect the minister must be greatly relieved following her ordeals with part vii of the environmental protection act that this bill is not so controversial <e>"]
