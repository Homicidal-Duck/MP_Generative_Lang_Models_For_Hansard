["<cs> my lords it would be a very over-confident and rash person who did not feel a keen sense of apprehension in addressing your lordships for the first time but in my case my apprehension is increased by the fact that the subject for debate today is northern ireland and the custom of your lordships house is that maiden speakers should be unprovocative <e> <s> nevertheless i feel that there are a few points which it is possible to put forward in an unprovocative way and which perhaps come appropriately from the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by joining other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow and his committee for this immensely interesting and valuable report <e> <s> it is all the more valuable for dealing with a complex and technical matter in such a clear and concise way <e> <s> it has attracted a great deal of interest and a large number of speakers which for me has two consequences first i must be selective in what i say and secondly i fear like the noble lord lord walston i may be unable to hear the closing speeches so i shall read them with great interest <e> <s> i apologise for that <e>", "<cs> my lords a lot has been said this afternoon about the pacifists whose views i respect and about the fellow travellers with whom i disagree <e> <s> but rather less has been said about a section of our communities which i think is more disturbing that is the number of sensible moderate ordinary intelligent people who have always felt a loyalty to the alliance but who now feel that things are getting out of control that we do not know what we are doing and that war in europe is more likely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to congratulate the noble lord lord hanson on his excellent maiden speech which was if i may say so a model of clarity and lucidity <e> <s> lord hanson is known widely for his successful entrepreneurial interests but he also has a wide range of social and cultural interests <e> <s> i know that we all hope to hear him speaking often in this house <e>", "<cs> leaving aside possibly some of the commercial interests involved i think everyone who has looked seriously at this question is agreed about three things first that the maximum available british material should be shown on cable television secondly that the introduction of cable television should be used to encourage the british programme industry and thus to make more british programme material available and thirdly that the cable authority will have a vital role in seeing that this is done <e> <s> the question is simply how <e>", "<cs> my lords the maintenance of the morale of our fighting services is clearly absolutely crucial <e> <s> but i will say nothing more about that because the noble and gallant lord lord lewin has expressed what i feel so much more authoritatively and eloquently than i possibly could <e> <s> but i do find it very difficult to believe that a prime determinant of morale is organisation at headquarters in whitehall <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware and i speak as chairman of the disasters emergency committee that five british charities oxfam the red cross save the children christian aid and cafod have raised over million for ethiopian relief since july <e> <s> if that is an indication of what the ordinary british voter thinks would the government bear it in mind not only in deciding their own contribution but in seeing that what goes to emergency relief is not at the expense of longer-term development <e>", "<cs> my lords i also must apologise for the fact that i shall be unable to stay until the end of the debate although i am going neither to see my portrait unveiled nor to a private dinner party <e> <s> for years i was a civil servant and for the last six of those as secretary to the cabinet serving four different prime ministers from both main political parties i was in a somewhat unique position to understand the need for the british civil servant to serve the government of the day to the utmost of his ability and with loyalty whatever its party political complexion <e> <s> before that i had some good jobs and some less good jobs but i was always proud to be a civil servant <e> <s> i am therefore very sad that there seems to be an unease enveloping the civil service or parts of it at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak about that section of the green paper which concerns provision for retirement <e> <s> i must begin by declaring an interest in that i have recently become the chairman of the prudential corporation which is one of the bodies that could expect to benefit from a policy of greater reliance on the private sector for pension provision <e> <s> however i can give only a qualified welcome to the green paper and i shall explain why in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in congratulating my noble friend and former colleague and predecessor lord armstrong of ilminster on his maiden speech which was interesting informative and helpful <e> <s> i used to think that the collective noun for a group of former secretaries to the cabinet was perhaps a silence but nowadays we have moved on and perhaps a discretion is the right word <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend succeeded in achieving that admirably <e> <s> i hope that i can do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords when we debated the white paper last july i welcomed the general approach but argued that the blanket protection for information provided in confidence by foreign governments and other international organisations was too sweeping <e> <s> therefore i am glad that the bill includes a test of damage <e> <s> i wish today to return solely to the question of a public interest defence or what i have called the robin hood argument that it is all right to do wrong provided good comes of it <e> <s> many people are worried about the absence of this defence and i have thought a good deal more about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have personal reasons for welcoming the initiative of the noble lord lord greenhill in introducing this debate <e> <s> i began my civil service career in in the old dominions office <e> <s> very shortly afterwards as the noble lord lord bottomley has said i had the pleasure of carrying his ministerial bag around parts of the world <e> <s> over the following years i had regular contacts with my opposite numbers in commonwealth countries and i accompanied four different prime ministers to heads of government meetings in different parts of the world <e> <s> i mention that simply because experience over a long period gives one a feeling for what the commonwealth is and what it is not <e>"]
