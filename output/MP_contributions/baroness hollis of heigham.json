["<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to make my maiden speech on a bill so ably moved by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs and following the eloquent and persuasive speech <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of a local authority may i say how much the ministers statement will cause very great distress to local authorities who have invested thousands of hours and thousands of pounds in planning community care <e> <s> there will also be very great distress to members of this house some of whom like myself have recently arrived but who nonetheless have spent many hours taking part in and listening to debates on this subject <e> <s> above all there will be real distress to the patients and carers who were expecting to see some relief in the immediate future <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord underhill were here he would have referred to his own experience <e> <s> he is alas away ill <e> <s> appointments at the westminster hospital have frequently been postponed because the hospital has been forced to close beds to meet department of health requirements <e> <s> has the minister seen the letter that was sent to my noble friend lord underhill which states that the hospital has no option but to reduce further the number of staff and out-patient clinics <e> <s> has she also seen in that letter that because of similar financial pressures the majority of london hospitals are now in the same position <e> <s> does the minister agree that waiting lists have lengthened as wards have been closed and would she care to explain to waiting patients many in pain why their suffering should be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the gracious speech contained no mention of local government finance <e> <s> as your lordships will know local government finance is now composed of the poll tax the uniform business rate and the revenue support grant a new financial map designed to increase local accountability <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to explain <e> <s> i said that the percentage increase in poundage was per cent <e> <s> but that that would generate a per cent <e> <s> increase in yield from billion to billion in one year <e> <s> that is a burden about which local industry and commerce is complaining and which no local authority sensitive to its business community at these times of high interest rates would seek to raise that is a per cent <e> <s> increase in yield <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that permitting local authorities to recycle the housing receipts into new housing would <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that although as-levels may have been well-intentioned very few schools can afford to run a-level and as-level courses in the same subject <e> <s> they have different curricula and as a result very few schools can offer more than two or three as-levels <e> <s> consequently they may offer or a-levels and the hope for breadth therefore is not being carried by as- levels <e>", "<cs> my lords a year-old girl i know who attends one of the best comprehensive schools in norfolk was asked to do a biology project on blood <e> <s> there were no textbooks to take home so she went to her school library <e> <s> there were no relevant books there <e> <s> being a resourceful girl she went to her central public library only to find on increasingly empty shelves one relevant book an elderly tome on anatomy <e> <s> she took it home copied out large chunks of it confessing that she did not really understand very much of it <e> <s> such incidents are replicated up and down the country <e> <s> at primary level at secondary level and at higher education level our education system is starved of books <e> <s> as headmasters will testify after dedicated teachers and supportive homes it is books that contribute most to childrens progress <e> <s> it is on that subject that i should like to make a few remarks today <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a welcome bill <e> <s> the house enjoyed a most helpful introduction from the minister <e> <s> the planning system in a mechanical sense is somewhat under strain <e> <s> despite the deregulation of planning applications to local authorities increased by per cent <e> <s> in and by per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> this increase may now be easing off but such a number of applications delays decisions <e> <s> as a result only about per cent <e> <s> of local authority planning decisions are determined within the eight-week period <e> <s> that is far short of the guidance offered by the department of the environment which suggested that per cent <e> <s> of decisions should be made within that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> but it is not the case that disabled people are hurt twice over by the poll tax <e> <s> with low incomes and high outgoings they are hurt as are other poor people but also under the poll tax disabled people have lost the rate relief on adapted buildings which per cent <e> <s> of them previously enjoyed <e> <s> in other words does she agree that disabled people are being penalised both for their poverty and their disability <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not feel uncomfortable that a family which paid a year in rates because of disability rate relief is now paying a year in poll tax and according to radar as a result cannot afford the electric wheelchair that it needs <e> <s> is the minister comfortable about that <e>", "<cs> how do you know <e>"]
