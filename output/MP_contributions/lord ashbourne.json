["<cs> my lords as this is the first time that i have had the honour of addressing your lordships i am naturally somewhat concerned that i may not live up to the high standards that your lordships rightly expect <e> <s> as i mulled over how i should open my address today i recalled that charles james fox when asked how it was that he had improved from being the worst speaker in the house to becoming the best replied that it was by speaking on every possible subject and on every possible occasion <e> <s> on the other hand mr asquith when he was asked how he became an accomplished speaker in another place replied by speaking only on subjects about which i am knowledgeable and feel comfortable with <e> <s> by this time i was in a thorough muddle and was feeling that i should have asked the whips office not only for notes for guidance for maiden speakers but also for a large pair of l-plates <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for that correction <e> <s> i was trying to give examples <e> <s> may i say what the professionals think <e> <s> i see that i cannot <e> <s> i will continue <e> <s> may i say what the press think <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i seem to be out of luck today <e> <s> may i finally state and i think i may get the same answer but this is final so it is quite an exciting moment what the right honourable member for finchley said <e>", "<cs> i cannot <e> <s> misery <e> <s> i think i must withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting late and i will try to get into top gear as quickly as may be so as to weary your lordships as little as possible <e> <s> as i studied the white paper i rapidly came to the conclusion that it contains a great deal with which i agree <e> <s> it talks of cutting out waste <e> <s> it talks of avoiding duplication between the services <e> <s> it talks of increasing efficiency and streamlining the ministry of defence <e> <s> that is all thoroughly commendable and the government are to be congratulated on a white paper designed to ensure that the taxpayer gets full value for his money <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how grateful i am to the noble lord the minister for putting down this motion and thereby giving your lordships an opportunity to debate this warnock report <e> <s> i had intended to raise the subject in the debate on the queens speech but i think it much better that we should have a separate debate on such an important subject which could have a material bearing on the lives of our children for generations to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i reflected for some considerable time before deciding to speak in this debate but as i studied the issues involved the argument against this bill became so compelling that i could see no alternative to making a brief intervention <e> <s> as your lordships are aware the law does not permit a man to marry his mother-in-law <e> <s> therefore one might expect there to be exceptional circumstances if this bill were to become law <e> <s> it is of course for your lordships to judge whether exceptional circumstances exist in this case but for my part i cannot see that there is anything fundamentally exceptional about the case before us <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i must thank the noble lord for making the position clear and i am sure that all your lordships are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords before discussing the various factors relevant to this bill i should like to make it clear that i do not know either norbury billington or sonia ann billington personally <e> <s> i have obviously studied the various papers made available by the personal bills office in relation to this case and my remarks are therefore based on the facts as presented <e>", "<cs> my lords as a large number of noble lords decided to speak in this debate i shall be as brief as possible and am minded to touch on only three points <e> <s> first i am concerned about the support arrangements for northern europe mentioned just now by the noble earl lord attlee and specifically about the replacement of our two ageing assault ships hms fearless and hms intrepid <e> <s> this is particularly critical as hms hermes flagship of the falklands campaign is now in reserve without <e>", "<cs> my lords as a large number of your lordships are speaking today i shall be as brief as possible but i am deeply concerned by the likely social consequences of this bill <e> <s> the widespread opening of shops on sundays will affect the overall character of <e>", "<cs> my lords i was encouraged to speak in this debate by the final paragraph of the report of the select committee on defence in another place printed on th november the paragraph read as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i respectfully suggest that return on capital employed is a very poor criterion for evaluating the efficiency of the dockyards <e> <s> one can no more quantify in financial terms the improved military capability that one has put into a well-refitted ship than one can attribute a financial return to ones stock of submarine torpedoes <e> <s> the real return from the cost of conferring an improved military capability may be vast or it may be nothing depending on what calls are made on it in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount the minister for his helpful reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he will consider having a word with his right honourable friend in another place to see whether this whole process could not be expedited because in practical terms until the act is fully in force it is extremely difficult to walk into a video shop if that is the right term and evaluate exactly whether the proprietor is or is not breaking the law <e> <s> it can be done but only with a lot of research <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether he will ask his right honourable friend to consider allocating possibly public funds perhaps on a loan basis so that the bbfc can employ more personnel to get this whole operation done more speedily <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister replies i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> if this bill becomes law in the form that the government clearly envisage i feel that seven years is much too short a period <e> <s> running a dockyard is not like running a commercial enterprise or commercial shipyard and never will be because there is the defence of the realm at stake and all the arguments which are well known in this committee <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting late and i promise to be brief partly because many noble lords have spoken in the debate and made many wise pronouncements leaving little left to be said at this <e>", "<cs> however my lords i should like to touch on two points and i thank the noble lord on the front bench opposite for that encouragement <e> <s> the first point is manpower <e> <s> perhaps here i should congratulate the authors of the white paper on the article entitled the service life which appears on pages and of the defence estimates <e> <s> i thought that that gave a balanced and accurate description of service life as a whole and listed both the advantages and disadvantages with great accuracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish also to support the noble and learned lord lord denning but in so doing to examine the problem from a completely different angle <e> <s> as we get buried further in the minutiae of this i almost said incomprehensible bill it is clearly a bill that some of your lordships including myself find pretty difficult to understand it is easy to lose touch with the overriding requirement transcending all other considerations namely that the dockyards should give the best possible service to the fleet <e> <s> i believe that paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to speak in this debate until it became clear to me that literally hundreds of thousands of parents and possibly millions are deeply concerned about the way in which sex education is going in this country <e> <s> i welcome the improvements that the government are trying to make in this sphere but nevertheless at the moment there are literally hundreds of thousands of caring responsible parents who are deeply concerned about the matter <e> <s> that is why i felt that i should address your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord kennet i too was delighted that the gracious speech opened with a reaffirmation of the governments determination to stand by our obligations to the nato alliance <e> <s> this was referred to by the noble baroness lady young when she moved the humble address on thursday <e> <s> the gracious speech also refers to the modernisation of the independent nuclear deterrent through the introduction of trident and if anyone is still in doubt as to the validity of this programme i would commend to them the admirable article entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say at the outset how grateful i am to the noble baroness lady cox for putting down the motion and thus permitting the exchange of views on this important topic <e> <s> i find myself largely in agreement with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his brief and helpful reply <e> <s> can he tell the house why her majestys government are making no effort to encourage local authorities to enforce the shops act as they have a statutory right to do <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to simplify the problems of sunday trading are the government considering exempting certain types of shops as is done in west germany the netherlands and italy rather than exempting goods as is done in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to speak very briefly this evening as time marches on <e> <s> i was disappointed that no steps are to be taken by the government to strengthen the family <e> <s> it is my perception that one of the problems of modern society which most concerns the ordinary british citizen is the state of law and order in this country <e> <s> that point has already been focused upon by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones the noble lords lord harris of greenwich lord moran and others so it is well understood in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for originating todays debate and thereby giving us an opportunity to discuss this important issue <e> <s> the debate is both relevant and timely <e> <s> i trust that the government will find themselves in a better position to make up their mind as a result of your lordships wise deliberations today <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord home for putting down this motion and thus giving us the opportunity to discuss the global balance of power in particular the importance of the western alliance <e> <s> it is timely coming just after the successful visit of president gorbachev to london earlier in the month when the special relationship which he appears to have with the right honourable member for finchley was further cemented <e> <s> let me say how much i agreed with the weighty and imaginative speech of the noble lord lord pym <e>", "<cs> my lords which of the services is most acutely affected by this problem of retaining skilled personnel which is a very acute problem in my view <e> <s> are the government taking fully into account the attitudes of wives when they grapple with this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> will he confirm that provided schools outreach can obtain local authority funding for per cent <e> <s> of the wages of any workers it employs the des will provide the other per cent <e> <s> observing that the sums involved are small <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear that the government intend vigorously to pursue policies for reducing crime as i believe that the law and order enigma is one of the major concerns of many citizens of this land today <e> <s> the fact that noble lords may feel unsafe in certain often deprived areas is deeply disturbing <e> <s> indeed there are probably many more areas where women feel vulnerable <e> <s> that is not far short of the no-go areas of ulster which existed during the early days of the troubles <e> <s> it must surely be wrong for citizens to feel fearful of visiting those so-called danger spots at night or at any other time <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to begin by saying how grateful i am to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for putting down this motion today and thus letting us all have an opportunity to focus on the central position of the family in society in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by letting the house into a secret <e> <s> i must admit that when i saw the order in which we were to speak today i felt a little unnerved at discovering that i was to speak after the noble earl lord halsbury who is a very distinguished scientist and a fellow of the royal society <e> <s> i had already a feeling that i was two or three chapters behind many of your lordships in the matter of teach oneself obstetrics <e> <s> i knew that i was light years behind the noble earl <e> <s> having listened to his speech i am quite convinced that i was right in that assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the noble lord lord houghton for introducing this bill and thus giving us an opportunity to discuss the abortion issue quite separately from the embryo bill to which your lordships gave a second reading last thursday <e>", "<cs> may i say how grateful i am to all noble lords for taking part in the debate on this amendment and particularly to the lord chancellor for explaining the views of the government so cogently <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to all noble lords particularly my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for taking part in the discussion which seems to be central to the bill <e> <s> i am extremely glad that her majestys government are committed to the family <e> <s> i suspect that the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs who recently introduced a debate on the subject will also be glad to hear that <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness for having risen a little too speedily <e> <s> i commend these amendments to the committee <e> <s> in my opinion they are both moderate and balanced <e> <s> personally i would have preferred them to have gone further but i do not think that the committee need have any worries in supporting them <e>", "<cs> perhaps <e>", "<cs> i am in favour of the amendment <e> <s> it is another case of removing an ambiguity <e> <s> i am always in favour of removing ambiguity from legislation and on that basis i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> the committee has to decide whether it will put first the interests of the child or the interests of the sperm donor <e> <s> i entirely agree with my noble friend that we should put first the interests of the child <e> <s> therefore i am in favour of giving a child who has reached the age of access to the truth if he seeks it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to all noble lords who took part in these <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment of the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge <e> <s> the issue seems to me to be very simple <e> <s> either one tells the truth or one does not <e> <s> in committee i was very moved by the most pertinent point that got through to me after three long afternoons of discussion in your lordships house <e> <s> the noble baroness lady macleod of borve and the noble lord lord renton said in effect when i was at school i was brought up to tell the truth and my advice to the house is to tell the truth now <e> <s> that is what my advice to the house is now <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment on the basis that the house must decide whether the limit should be included in the bill or in the code of practice <e> <s> my opinion is that the matter is sufficiently important to be in the bill rather than in the code of practice <e> <s> on that basis i commend the amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i accept that undertaking and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment and say how grateful i am to the noble and learned lord for moving it <e> <s> it will undoubtedly reduce the number of fatherless children being created <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to welcome the bill as it introduces an element of regulation in an area where regulation is sorely needed <e> <s> if noble lords will cast their minds back they may remember the debate which took place on the warnock report in the summer of <e> <s> i recall the occasion well <e> <s> it was on the last day before the summer recess <e> <s> the bishop of norwich as he was then maurice wood said how remarkable it was that there were or noble lords who had put their names down to speak in the debate when it was the last day of the session and when in normal circumstances people would be slipping off to their castles in scotland <e> <s> indeed i expect that the noble baroness lady phillips would certainly have slipped off to fill her moat or oil her drawbridge <e> <s> and yet the interest was such that there were or members in your lordships house <e> <s> i have been disappointed <e> <s> as the bill has gone through this house it seems to me that it has developed into what i may describe as a medical extravaganza <e> <s> by that i mean that we have gone into the medical details in incredible detail <e> <s> it is quite clear to me that many of your lordships are three or four volumes ahead of me in teach yourself gynaecology obstetrics or whatever it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords that was my view <e> <s> as i say noble lords must judge for themselves but that was my judgment on the matter <e> <s> i felt that that <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and then say a brief word about amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> i shall try to spell out clearly what i am speaking to when dealing with this huge gaggle of amendments <e> <s> i am confused as many other noble lords may be <e>", "<cs> i rise to urge the committee to oppose amendment no <e> <s> because too much emphasis is already given to religions other than christianity <e> <s> the whole basis of most broadcasting is agnostic and founded on secular humanism <e> <s> no special place needs to be created in law for these viewpoints because they already flood through our broadcasting system <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting late and i intend to be extremely brief <e> <s> your lordships may regard it as something of a bonus because i intend to be back in my seat within seconds <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment highlights the argument between religious and christian broadcasting and it is not new <e> <s> a bbc broadcasting policy statement in asserted that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have put down my name to this amendment perhaps i may be permitted to say a few words <e> <s> if it is not accepted are we not saying in effect that all seriously handicapped people are valueless expendable and may be wiped out at will <e>", "<cs> that seems an appalling situation when we compare it with the supreme worth put on the value of one human being by the saviour of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my welcome for this bill especially the fair and acceptable religious broadcasting freedoms introduced by the government <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord thomson when he says that he can seldom remember a bill which has been so improved since it started its passage through parliament <e> <s> however i am disturbed to hear that the radio authoritys draft guidelines for religion contain the following clauses <e> <s> i shall now quote from paragraph of the guidelines <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted to hear in the gracious speech that her majestys government <e>"]
