["<cs> my lords as this is the first time that i have had the honour of addressing your lordships i am naturally somewhat concerned that i may not live up to the high standards that your lordships rightly expect <e> <s> as i mulled over how i should open my address today i recalled that charles james fox when asked how it was that he had improved from being the worst speaker in the house to becoming the best replied that it was by speaking on every possible subject and on every possible occasion <e> <s> on the other hand mr asquith when he was asked how he became an accomplished speaker in another place replied by speaking only on subjects about which i am knowledgeable and feel comfortable with <e> <s> by this time i was in a thorough muddle and was feeling that i should have asked the whips office not only for notes for guidance for maiden speakers but also for a large pair of l-plates <e>"]
