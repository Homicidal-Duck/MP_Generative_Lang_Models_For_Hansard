["<cs> my lords i was asked by my noble friend lady seear to support her in this debate because i imagine i am one of the small handful of members of this house who are at present serving on the delegation to the council of europe <e> <s> i only hope that when i have finished she will not be asking herself with support like this who needs opposition <e> <s> <e> <s> but of course the real answer is that after the masterly way in which she introduced this debate she clearly needs no support from any quarter <e> <s> my few remarks will deal only with document r// about cultural workers <e> <s> i mention this in case brookings addicts might find this a convenient moment to refresh themselves <e> <s> but i shall not take very long <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e> <s> i shall quote only the very last sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we must of course first thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it may be a merit of the statement that so far from adding very much to the press reports it tends on the whole to subtract from them <e> <s> secondly we should like to congratulate mr lini on his election victory in the new hebrides and on his appointment as prime minister designate <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the time i have decided not to make a speech but to put one detailed question to the noble lord <e> <s> may i draw the attention of the house to paragraph of the white paper the paragraph entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking this afternoon about a far-away country of which we know little and that fact alone ought to put us on our guard <e> <s> i am not playing the historical analogies game which i believe to be more often than not misleading <e> <s> i use those sadly unforgettable words quite literally <e> <s> the new hebrides are very far away from here and far removed from the present foci of international attention and tension and if we are to judge only by the astonishing brevity of the speakers list it does appear <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are very grateful to the noble lord for giving us this statement <e> <s> we have great sympathy for him in the appalling situation which he has inherited from a number of governments even going back to the last liberal government <e> <s> we appreciate the complexities of the situation <e> <s> may i ask him whether he can tell us when the company of royal marines will reach vila <e> <s> can he assure us that the gendarmes and marines who will be on vila <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the noble lord and welcome these regulations from these benches and also put one question <e> <s> the noble lord has mentioned under-registration of year olds and has also mentioned the bilingual form in use in wales <e> <s> can he say whether there is any evidence of under-registration among other citizens who may not understand english but would not understand welsh either <e> <s> i am thinking chiefly of people of asian origin <e> <s> can anything be done for them to simplify the task of filling in the registration form <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord wigoder i beg to introduce a bill to amend the criminal justice act to restrict reports of committal proceedings in magistrates courts in cases where there is more than one defendant <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord ritchie-calder on his luck in the ballot and no less on a magnificent speech <e> <s> i am particularly glad that he covered in his speech so many of the things which i am all too conscious of being about to leave out <e> <s> in framing his motion he asks us <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is one explanation of this and that is that last year included not only their regular contributions but special donations that they made in response to appeals later in the year <e> <s> so perhaps their regular contributions have not gone down as much as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind at the hague that a sum of only million dollars would enable unwra to keep the schools open in the occupied territories and a further million dollars would take in the lebanon as well <e> <s> may i suggest to the government that this should be the minimum target at which western europe should aim <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friends were drawing up this motion i was in strasbourg and my feeble back-bench voice could not carry from there <e> <s> but if i had been present though it would probably have made no difference i should have urged them to cast the net a little wider and perhaps to draw attention to the political events of the last three months including the publication of the -point programme something like that <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking his question my noble friend and leader lord byers said he spoke on his own personal responsibility <e> <s> so do i because on a matter of this importance i do not know any other way to speak <e> <s> i have listened with interest and admiration to all that has been said so far and i agreed with nearly everything the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts said as has often hitherto been the case <e> <s> in listening to the other speeches i have at times had the strong feeling that i was listening to a very able exposition of one side of this essentially two-sided question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to begin by apologising to the noble earl that i was not able to be in my place at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i had to take the chair in a eec sub-committee upstairs <e> <s> i am very sorry that i could not hear the speech with which he introduced the bill <e> <s> i have no doubt he made out a good case for it with his usual eloquence <e> <s> i am equally sorry that i was not able to hear the speech of the noble baroness lady jeger which may perhaps have given a slightly different impression <e>", "<cs> if i have the temperature of the committee i think that a very short speech from me might be welcome rather than a long one <e> <s> the noble earl has put me in a difficult position <e> <s> he came a long way to meet me to start with and he has now come further <e> <s> my feeling is that it would be churlish on my part if i were not to accept what he offers <e> <s> but clearly he knows the strength of feeling in this house about the forest of dean he can be under no misapprehensions about that and some magnificent speeches were made in support of my amendment for which i thank noble lords <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl has offered until the report stage i shall for now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by apologising to the noble lord lord sandford as i was not present to hear the beginning of his speech <e> <s> i went upstairs to get my papers and was trapped on the telephone <e> <s> in the bulk of his speech which i heard he explained the amendment so clearly that there is no need for me to add anything to it <e> <s> on the question of the legislative propriety of the procedure that he suggests i am certainly not qualified to express an opinion except that if it satisfies the noble lord lord renton it satisfies me <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was saying i shall not again inflict my speech on the house but i think that for the record it is desirable that we recapitulate very briefly the reasons why we believe that the forest of dean is a special case <e> <s> we believe that the people who live in the forest of dean are uniquely disadvantaged and therefore uniquely endangered by the bill as it stands because for various historical reasons they have no legal rights of common or of access <e> <s> instead they have customary privileges which are fully recognised by the forestry commission and it is difficult to see how these <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> of course i fully accept his offer and his assurances and beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his very comprehensive answer <e> <s> as i moved this on behalf of a noble friend i hope he will not think i am being difficult if i reserve the right for my noble friend to reintroduce this amendment should he wish to do so at third reading <e> <s> by that time he will of course have had a chance to read the noble earls speech <e> <s> for the moment on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming this amendment which i most certainly do i want to make it quite clear that my acceptance of it and support for it is whole-hearted and unconditional <e> <s> in saying that i know that i am reflecting the feelings of the authorities in the forest of dean <e> <s> i make that point because i want to go on to say that there are still some small residual doubts in some of our minds about the precise statutory definition of the forest of dean <e> <s> i wonder whether it is possible for the noble earl to say a little more about that because it might bring some comfort and tranquillity to some of the more suspicious and perhaps more legal minds in the forest <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for that information <e> <s> it completely clears up the anxieties that we had <e>", "<cs> my lords somebody had to have the misfortune of trying to follow the noble lord lord shackleton on this subject and it seems to be my unlucky day <e> <s> we hear him all too seldom <e> <s> on this subject he is of course the acknowledged expert <e> <s> it has occurred to me that as the number of our colonial dependencies decreases it ought to be possible for her majestys government to give an increasing amount of attention to those which remain <e> <s> in my necessarily rather hurried study of this subject i find very little evidence that that is actually what happens <e> <s> i will leave it to other more qualified speakers particularly the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton to say what is the strategic significance of the geographical position of the falkland islands but i assume that at least in the negative sense of denying that base to any potential enemy they must be of some importance <e> <s> however that may be i am basing my speech on the assumption that we do intend that the falklands shall remain british <e> <s> it would surely be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe i need to withdraw anything i said but i am grateful for that amplification <e> <s> i think it is true that in addition to owning almost half the sheep-bearing land the falkland islands company markets the entire wool-clip from the islands and has a substantial stake in the company which is the principal buyer <e> <s> i believe that this is known as vertical integration and i have no doubt that it makes very good business sense and brings considerable comfort to the shareholders <e> <s> but the consequences on the islands you can see in the low morale the steady drain of emigration and the difficulty of attracting the right sort of new immigrant <e> <s> i am not and i want to emphasise this imputing any villainy to the falkland islands company <e> <s> this is not a scandal like the treatment of ocean island by the british phosphates commission some years ago <e> <s> but surely it was a mistake in colonial administration to sell those acres to the falkland islands company in <e> <s> they had enough already <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer so far as it goes may i hope to get a little more information out of him meanwhile <e> <s> in particular may i ask him about the money <e> <s> does he remember that his noble friend lord trefgarne told us on th march that their investment portfolio now has a current market value of three-quarters of a million pounds <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that recently a consignment of supplies and equipment destined for pitcairn island was lost in a shipboard fire an apparently uninsurable loss and that when the island council was considering whether to apply to the commissioner for money to replace this order they decided not to on the grounds that they did not want to seem to scrounge <e> <s> can the noble lord assure the house that the three-quarters of a million pounds really belongs to the pitcairn islanders and they know it and would it not be sensible to put a fraction of this perhaps i per cent <e> <s> into a float or a petty cash fund which the island council could use at its sole discretion without any fear of being thought to scrounge <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps in conclusion i may ask the noble lord about two specific points <e> <s> first on the reservoir as i am sure the noble lord is aware in the last year they have had a water crisis on the island in spite of their abundant rainfall <e> <s> this is because they have no way of storing water <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that all that seems to be needed is a simple reservoir such as one has on many farms <e> <s> would it be possible for major jason-smith if he is still there to advise them on how to construct this and what material to order <e> <s> lastly is the noble lord aware of what one might call the henderson island project which involves the construction of an airstrip on henderson island which is relatively near and which would not use up all the arable land on pitcairn island <e> <s> if the noble lord is aware of this project which i believe the governor discussed with the island council can he tell us whether her majestys government would regard it with sympathy if the islanders proceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make it clear that i am not speaking on behalf of my party <e> <s> whereas i found myself in agreement with my noble friend lord gladwyn and expect to agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness a question which may be peripheral but which i hope she will not find irrelevant <e> <s> according to my information which of course comes only from the press and from the statement the unfortunate wife of this spy is showing a commendable resistance to the lures of what we might call cheque book journalism <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that this is commendable and can she assure us that whatever agency there is that looks after the dependants of convicted offenders it will keep the case of this woman and of the step-children of the convicted man sympathetically and continually under review <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that it is the policy of her majestys government that no iranian bahai shall be repatriated against his or her will from this country to iran <e>", "<cs> my lords i came to this debate equipped not with a speech but with a list of questions <e> <s> i have been ticking them off as other noble lords have asked them until i think only three or four remain <e> <s> before i put my questions to the noble lord lord elton may i make one general point <e> <s> like other speakers i feel an infinity of pity for this unhappy man <e> <s> if half of his life story as i have been given it is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that clear and forthright answer which is only <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the sole purpose of this force may be may i remind the noble baroness of a subsidiary function which it is in fact carrying out <e> <s> if you drive through the shatila camp every one or two hundred metres you see a sandbag emplacement manned first by italian and then by french soldiers <e> <s> the house will readily imagine how reassuring this is to the inhabitants who are the survivors of september <e> <s> we can easily imagine what they would feel if they saw those troops being withdrawn <e> <s> therefore may i ask her majestys government in any discussions they have with our allies about withdrawal to undertake not to withdraw until alternative arrangements have been made for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have come very late to this problem <e> <s> in fact when i came up today i did not even know we were debating the bill but i have received some information from the locality of the fosdyke bridge <e> <s> i should like to put some points of view <e> <s> whenever we talk about a bridge we are balancing the interests of two groups of people the people who go over the bridge and those who go under it <e> <s> the noble lord lord wise devoted most of his speech to the former group <e> <s> i do not dispute that the bridge apparently needs to be replaced and that many motorists need to use it <e> <s> we are not suggesting that it should be done away with <e> <s> however my information does not entirely accord with that of the noble lord the minister on the use of the river at present <e>", "<cs> my lords when you look at the list of speakers and you find that the luck of the draw compels you to speak immediately after the noble and learned lord lord scarman you feel a certain alarm but my alarm turned to something like panic when i heard the noble lord lord mishcon unconsciously perhaps confusing me with my father describe me as another distinguished lawyer <e> <s> may i say in self-defence that although my veins are awash with legal blood not enough of it ever reached my head to enable me to study the law <e>", "<cs> my lords that was very gracefully put <e> <s> i hope that the noble viscount lord buckmaster will not think i am stretching the terms of his motion too far if i speak about one of our ethnic and religious <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can promise at least to make the shortest speech so far and i shall only speak about one small aspect of the lebanese problem <e> <s> yesterday i attended a meeting of officers of some of the voluntary agencies who either keep in touch almost daily with their operatives in the lebanon or in some cases have themselves recently come back from there <e> <s> as this meeting was at the british refugee council we focused our attention chiefly on the palestinian refugees and particularly on those in the camps in south beirut <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have always thought of myself as a feminist by which i mean simply one who believes that to deny choices or opportunities to half the human race must be not only very unjust but idiotically wasteful <e> <s> i probably owe this very sensible attitude as it seems to me <e> <s> not to any innate wisdom which i lack but to my upbringing <e>", "<cs> my lords how very lucky i am to be able to be the first to congratulate her here in this house and to pledge to her my wholehearted support <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure the house that no diplomatic recognition or immunity is granted to so-called students who from time to time take over the libyan embassy or whatever it is called <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that warm clothes and food are just as important in keeping warm as is fuel <e> <s> therefore will he agree that a cost of warmth index should reflect the price of those items <e>", "<cs> my lords from this part of the house we thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> may i open with as it were a supplementary question to the question put from the dispatch box by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the taking of hostages cannot be condoned but is it i ask the minister the correct term in this case <e> <s> i thought that what happened in an ordinary military operation was that these people became civilian prisoners of unita and unita appears to have done everything it could at least to get them after a very uncomfortable journey to a place from which they could be repatriated <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that answer which i do not think could be improved upon <e> <s> i wonder though whether she could widen the scope of her answers to my very narrowly-drafted question by giving the house some indication of the governments general attitude towards this very important conference the theme of which as she will know is a time for solutions <e> <s> does she not agree that in africa there are now about million refugees being looked after by some of the poorest countries on earth <e> <s> does this not mean that aid should be directed not only towards the refugees but as i think she indicated also towards their host countries in order to avoid ill-feeling between refugees and the surrounding indigenous populations <e> <s> in conclusion can the minister tell the house at what level her majestys government are represented at the conference in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that there is in the house at the moment an unpleasant smell of a witch-hunt <e> <s> would he not agree that one mans cult may be another mans therapy and that it is grossly unfair to condemn as a cult everything other than the established church <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome this draft statutory instrument as a step towards ratification of the international tropical timber agreement which i understand will take place in august <e> <s> if i may i will dwell on the agreement rather than the order itself which merely gives that legal personality to the organisation which article of the agreement requires <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said the agreement is part of the unctad integrated programme for commodities <e> <s> previous agreements in this series have included those on rubber tin cocoa coffee and jute <e> <s> unlike previous agreements with the exception of jute this one does not include any provision for buffer stocking in order to stabilise the market <e> <s> it is very largely a non-interventionist agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord treating this matter in a rather parochial manner <e> <s> the question refers to the european elections <e> <s> do we not have an obligation to agree an electoral system with our partners in the eec and will not the noble lord take it from me that it is quite impossible to find anyone on the continent of europe who regards our electoral system as anything but daft <e>", "<cs> my lords had we a bill before us this afternoon and were this at second reading i do not think i would have dared to talk about these highly technical matters <e> <s> but we are only asked to take note of the warnock report <e> <s> i hope that that opens the door wide enough to admit some observations of perhaps only peripheral relevance to the report <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion that this bill was debated at second reading my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley gave it his general support but he had one reservation <e> <s> although i must not commit my noble friend i rather think that in its new form the bill would get round what was his objection on that occasion <e> <s> in general from these benches we are very much in favour of allotments <e> <s> many noble lords spoke about the surprising quantity of food which comes from them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness assure the house that it is quite impossible for anybody in this country to export to either of the belligerents anything which could possibly be used for military purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i convey the apologies of my noble friend lord tordoff who has had to attend a funeral this morning <e> <s> i think that i have the sense of the house if i say that a long speech from me would not be particularly acceptable <e> <s> therefore may i echo all the words that have been spoken by the government chief whip and all the words that have come from the opposition bench and from my noble friend and wish everybody a very happy christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords i applaud the initiative of the noble viscount lord buckmaster in calling our attention today to the situation of the refugees in the third world <e> <s> i congratulate him on his patience and eventual luck in the ballot and also upon his excellent speech <e> <s> i should also like to utter a heartfelt hear hear <e> <s> to the tributes which he paid to the unhcr and the british refugee council <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> may i ask him first on average how many patients per gp list are the government aiming at <e> <s> because clearly until you have decided that you cannot decide how many doctors you need <e> <s> i believe the average figure is about and there is a view that a figure of would be better <e> <s> can the noble earl when he replies tell us whether the government have a particular figure in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord taylor i wish to say that unless some noble lord wishes to speak it is my intention not to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have half a minute in which to support with all the force that i can what was said by the noble viscount lord buckmaster about the refugees <e> <s> also may i put to the noble baroness lady trumpington what may be the easiest question that she has had today <e> <s> as she is well aware the way we look after refugees and asylum-seekers is a home office matter <e> <s> has there been consultation between the dhss and the relevant ministers in the home office and the british refugee council <e> <s> if there has not been such consultation can she please promise that there will be before these regulations come into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised by noble friends who know much more about northern ireland than i do but who are unavoidably absent today that on these benches we have no objection to this order <e> <s> to save myself and the house my saying this three times i would add that it applies to the second and third orders as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady masham of ilton is surely to be warmly congratulated on her courage in taking up sponsorship of this bill <e>", "<cs> all the amendments except my own no <e> <s> have one thing in common that is they all seek to exclude mental health altogether as a justification for the legitimate operations which we want to leave lawful <e> <s> on the whole two reasons have been given for this desire to exclude mental health <e> <s> the first is that by including it we build a loophole into the bill through which the wrong people may creep out <e> <s> the answer to that is that if the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists tell us clearly that for them mental health is necessary as a criterion we have to take their opinion seriously <e> <s> they are the people who are in touch with the patients they know better than any of us and so far as i am concerned if they feel that mental health is an essential criterion then we must provide for it <e> <s> in that case we must of course block the loophole which otherwise mental health builds into the bill <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> as i said the surgeon will probably be relying on claiming that it is of a minor cosmetic nature <e> <s> minor it almost certainly will be and the practices we are seeking to render illegal are minor surgery <e> <s> i do not think there is any doubt about that <e>", "<cs> in view of that i think the simplest reply for me to give is that i shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment and then bring it back at report stage <e> <s> i hope by that time we shall have had further conversations <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make two quick points <e> <s> first the changes in the law suggested by this bill have also been part of the official policy of the party to which i have belonged for some years <e> <s> we therefore congratulate the noble lord lord rodney and i think i can guarantee that my noble friends will do nothing to impede the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the meaning of this amendment is that the doctor in assessing the mental health needs of his patient who as we were reminded at committee stage by the noble lord lord richardson may be of any colour race or type must exclude non-medical factors <e> <s> i am not sure about this but i think that when the noble lord lord hatch comes to read what he has just said he may find he got tied up in his own double negatives <e> <s> i think he said that a doctor might claim presumably in court oh it is all right <e> <s> i did it for non-medical factors those are what he is excluding <e> <s> that is a small point and i do not want to press it because i may just as likely be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i am puzzled by one thing <e> <s> the bill says <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to reply to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> we have discussed his speech at all the stages of this bill <e> <s> i should like to extend my congratulations to the honourable lady in another place mrs roe <e> <s> i should like to pay a very warm tribute to the noble baroness and perhaps i may bend the conventions of the house and say the noble and gallant <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may help the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> i think she has done herself far less than justice and has put herself into an impossible position <e> <s> that vote about which i spoke which i raised as a procedural matter was on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can i start by assuring the noble baroness lady trumpington that i do not feel at all jealous because she writes to the noble lord lord ennals and not to me <e> <s> besides she does sometimes write to me <e> <s> i would like to start by refreshing her memory and informing your lordships of a passage in a letter that she wrote to me on rd may <e> <s> she wrote <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord read the article on the back of <e>", "<cs> my lords do not be too alarmed at the spectacle of somebody speaking in the gap in the speakers list <e> <s> i only do so because my noble friend lord winstanley is indisposed and will not be speaking at all <e> <s> moreover the point that i wanted to make to the house has already been very able put chiefly by my noble friend lord winchilsea and it was also touched on in the cogent letter from which the noble lord lord underhill quoted from the long-distance lorry driver <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the united states there is at least one commercial training establishment where if you have enough money you can learn all the techniques of sabotage and guerilla warfare <e> <s> if he is so aware have any representations been made to the government of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness assure us that in principle the government will be as generous to the inhabitants of pitcairn island who are no less loyal than the st helenans <e>", "<cs> my lords my debut in the unlikely role of a pseudo-spokesman on transport is due entirely to the absence of my noble friend lord tordoff in the falkland islands <e> <s> it is difficult to be in two places at once especially if one of them is the falkland islands and my noble friend greatly regrets his absence today <e>", "<cs> it is very late and i shall be very brief but i should not like the noble lord lord renton to feel that he has no support from this corner of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in addition to the library proper the bta houses personal archives which have been bequeathed to it by people whose names read like a roll of honour of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> can she confirm that there is an anti-meningitis vaccine at present being manufactured <e> <s> does she know whether this is yet available <e> <s> if it is available would the ministry recommend its use in the stroud district <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that islington borough council which is the successor authority has refused all help to sadlers wells and if this is so whether the government foresaw this as one of the consequences of abolition of the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me whether her majestys government have received representations from the government of the usa for assistance in preventing the onward transmission to iran of material illegally acquired in the usa <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness answer the question that the noble lord lord cledwyn put about the civil service <e> <s> many reports suggest that the most urgent need is to reconstruct and remotivate the civil service <e> <s> is there anything we can do to help towards that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that of course we on these benches welcome these regulations <e> <s> may i also from a position of abysmal ignorance ask the minister one question <e> <s> do these regulations cover products which are normally used in the garden or do they cover only products used in the kitchen <e>", "<cs> my lords we too thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> with regard to the conversations with the syrian ambassador we support the action that the government were trying to take and which they did take <e> <s> we deplore the not unexpected refusal of his excellency to waive immunity in order that the allegations against certain members of his staff could be further investigated <e> <s> we deplore also the ritual tit-for-tat expulsion of our diplomats from damascus <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the usual masterly question from my noble friend lord banks whose grasp of this subject never fails to astonish me <e> <s> for me it has been a pleasure to listen to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i have not had that pleasure before and i shall look forward to a repeat of the experience whenever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the people who will be affected by this bill will be among those citizens of this country who were a little surprised and in some cases perhaps mildly outraged to be told the other day that they were having a better time than they had ever had before <e> <s> i want to speak briefly i hope about a very small fraction of the potential victims of the bill who are not citizens of this country but who have come here or may come here in the future with great <e>", "<cs> we seem to be making this bill up as we go along <e> <s> we have had three or four very important announcements this afternoon <e> <s> i certainly must be grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> however i am not very good at taking things in on the wing as it were <e> <s> i should very much like time to read under a microscope what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me whether the report which the government have received refers to the shorter barrage or the longer one from weston-super-mare <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount to tell me whether the monitoring of cattle to which he referred includes the monitoring of milk and if so with what results <e>", "<cs> my lords in general we also thank the minister for introducing the order so clearly and we welcome it <e> <s> i think the minister has satisfied me that it is desired by a substantial number of people engaged in the industry <e>", "<cs> potatoes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we too thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> we regard the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first occasion and i am sure it will not be the last on which the house finds itself very much indebted to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for bringing before it an interesting subject and one which is of deep personal concern to a considerable number of people <e> <s> she has covered the ground so comprehensively that she has not left a lot for the rest of us to say but on past form i doubt whether we shall find that too inhibiting <e> <s> there will be many specific areas in the much wider area that she has covered that we can amplify or underline <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay the house for longer than is necessary but i must admit that when i read this motion standing in the name of the noble and learned lord i wondered how many of your lordships had read it to the end <e> <s> i came to the last three lines with some astonishment <e> <s> i am sure that the beginning is entirely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord hatch not just on his luck in the ballot but on his speech with a good deal of which i was delighted to find i could agree <e> <s> i also owe him an apology <e> <s> i may have slightly misunderstood his motion <e> <s> i hope that neither he nor the rest of your lordships will find my speech too esoteric because i want to remind the house and the government of our commitment to one particular international institution <e> <s> it is called unrwa <e> <s> for the benefit of noble lords with long memories i should explain that it has nothing to do with an earlier unrra which did its essential work among displaced persons in the chaotic aftermath of the second world war <e> <s> that was the united nations relief and rehabilitation agency <e> <s> the one about which i want to speak is the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east which was established originally in as a purely temporary institution <e> <s> it was the collective response of the united nations to the painful consequences of our relinquishing the mandate in palestine and the creation of the state of israel and of the unsuccessful attempt by israels arab neighbours to prevent its creation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give the house some information about prisoners of war in the following respects <e> <s> have iran and/or iraq signed the geneva convention about prisoners of war <e> <s> whether or not they have done so are they treating their prisoners of war decently <e> <s> in the case of the boy soldiers to whom reference has already been made is there any possibility that those who are lucky enough to be captured could be handed over to unicef the red crescent or some other organisation better suited to children than a prisoner of war camp <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness fully appreciate the symbolic importance of what is done by us <e> <s> is she aware that there are other countries where there is an actual need for immigrants which are looking to us <e> <s> therefore even a semi-generous gesture by the british government might lead to a solution of this problem once and for all <e>", "<cs> my lords it has never before happened to me to find myself sandwiched between two maiden speakers <e> <s> of the speech which is to follow i can say only that i look forward to it keenly as do all noble lords <e> <s> but of the speech to which we have just listened i can say more <e> <s> it occurs to me first that it must be a very long time since your lordships house has had an opportunity to welcome a recruit of such immense distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords in this house there is a very narrow line between courtesy and hypocrisy <e> <s> i think that i should be crossing that line in the wrong direction if i were to thank the noble lord for introducing this bill because frankly i wish that he had not <e> <s> however i recognise that he is acting under orders being grossly overworked and only doing his duty as he sees it <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will accept that there is nothing personal about my ingratitude <e> <s> when i first saw the bill i immediately recalled the famous hackneyed phrase of thomas hobbes about the life of early man because it fits the bill exactly <e> <s> it is poor nasty brutish and short <e> <s> a more perfect example of the maxim if there is such a maxim legislate in haste repent at leisure could hardly be found <e>", "<cs> these amendments have the general support of the main agencies caring for refugees whose interests i shall chiefly be defending in my interventions at this committee stage <e> <s> therefore they have our support <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone has correctly identified the quite impossible problems which will be caused for the operators of ferries crossing either the channel or the north or irish seas <e> <s> i should perhaps add that i would be more devious than i should wish to be if i did not admit that i also like these amendments because they tend to show what an appallingly hurried muddled and ill-considered bill this is <e> <s> but those are by no means my only reasons for supporting them <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon perhaps i may first associate myself and my noble friends with his opening remarks <e> <s> i think i made clear at second reading my loathing for the racketeers who exploit human misery and who should be the true target of this bill <e> <s> i yield to no one in my loathing of such people <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said it is the genuine refugee we are seeking to defend <e> <s> when i read that article in the <e>", "<cs> i do not think i used the word refugee in my speech <e> <s> i am speaking about people who are in grave or immediate danger <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the threat to the palestinians in the beirut camps comes from the amal militia <e> <s> is she aware that the amal are armed with tanks and artillery and that quite apart from its mandate unifil would as at present constituted be quite unable to provide the protection which we should all like to see provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a small point on this amendment but before raising it i must say how very sorry i am that the noble lord lord mulley was not able to be present with us last thursday <e> <s> the point about this amendment concerns multiple landings <e> <s> it seems to me that a carrier might well feel it right to bring or even people of one category at one time <e> <s> i cannot believe it is right that the carriers fine should be multiplied by the number of passengers <e> <s> this would be punishing him for one miscalculation or perhaps one act of mercy in a quite excessive way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down let me explain that i said i had shifted my ground perhaps i should have said that i was playing a different role <e> <s> i have not changed my mind at all <e> <s> on thursday last it happened that i was speaking on amendments where i was defending refugees <e> <s> the amendment that we are now considering was always put forward from the point of view of carriers <e> <s> i did not speak about it on thursday <e> <s> that was all i meant by saying that i had shifted my ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pretend to be altogether happy with the answer that we have had <e> <s> i am particularly unhappy that the noble earl has said nothing about the case of the refugee in orbit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that very full answer <e> <s> i am not quick-witted enough to take in all the implications of the answer as he read it out so i shall look at it with great care tomorrow in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in wishing this bill not so much <e>", "<cs> my lords after thanking the noble lord lord lyell for explaining the order with his usual clarity and attention to detail i ought perhaps to explain to your lordships that my noble friend lord hampton who has contributed so much and so well for many years years i think to these discussions has at last felt obliged to lay down his portfolio and to ask to be relieved of his spokesmanship <e> <s> i know that this will be a matter of regret to the body of regular ulster-watchers who have come to appreciate the essential reasonableness and moderation of his speeches and with the exception of the lebanon i can think of nowhere in the world where such qualities are more needed or in shorter supply <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it this order with one or two exceptions brings the procedures for adoption in northern ireland into line with the rest of england and wales <e> <s> it seems to us to be entirely sensible and the order has our support <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am the first speaker on this subject who took part in the original debate in which led to the independence of tuvalu <e> <s> that was at a time when the late and sorely missed lord goronwy-roberts was speaking for the foreign office of the day <e> <s> i well remember the conflicting feelings we had at that time <e> <s> we had doubts as to whether such a miniature population would be able to sustain the burdens of full national sovereignty <e> <s> we hoped that with determination and hard work they would make our doubts look silly <e> <s> above all there was tremendous good will all around this house towards this fledgling democracy which we were launching in the pacific ocean <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may mention very quickly one practical point that oddly enough i do not think has been raised <e> <s> i hope that i am not depriving the noble viscount lord mersey of one of those issues that he was saving up for report stage <e> <s> these fire engines are allowed to exceed the speed limit <e> <s> thus it is obvious that firemen must have confidence in the man who maintains the braking system <e>", "<cs> in general i support both the amendments but i have niggling worries about them which suggests to me that it might be better if they were withdrawn tonight and introduced later <e>", "<cs> my lords does that confirm my suspicion that the three percentage figures that the minister gave in his original answer do not add up to <e> <s> if i am right what sort of staff receives salaries and wages in the national health service that cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be better if we returned to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> otherwise we shall get into a terrible confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first immigration bill we have been asked to consider since the immigration carriers liability bill to which we devoted what time we were allowed in april and may of last year <e> <s> during the passage of that bill several of your lordships drew attention to the dangers which it posed unintentionally i am sure to the genuine refugee or asylum seeker who might find himself swept up the in the net and deported amid the generality of illegal immigrants against whom that bill was aimed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his original answer to the noble lord lord molloy has our full support <e> <s> would he perhaps also agree that the camps in the lebanon are every bit as deserving and perhaps more so than those in gaza and the occupied territories <e>", "<cs> the amendment has been movingly and lucidly moved by the noble and learned lord and supported by the right reverend prelate and the noble lord lord hylton and i was delighted to hear by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> there is not very much more to say but when matters of such profound importance are under discussion involving the most fundamental human rights and quite possibly human lives i hope that i may be allowed a minute or two of the committees time <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said the amendment was carefully worded in such a way as to remind us of our obligations under the international convention <e> <s> those are obligations that we voluntarily willingly and i hope enthusiastically undertook <e>", "<cs> would not the noble earl agree with reference to this fascinating discussion that if he is right the addition of the words in the amendment do him no harm at all and simply confirm that he is right <e> <s> therefore he might as well include those words and then we can please all sides of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend lord falkland may i add my support for the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble viscount will take the amendment all the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the seasonal wishes which have come from the noble earl and the noble baroness <e> <s> in this house we are protected serviced and refreshed by a host of people some of whom as the noble earl said we never see <e> <s> we are most grateful to every one of them <e> <s> i hope that they as well as your lordships will have a very enjoyable easter <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which i so hesitantly moved a long time ago has received powerful support and not only from this side of the house <e> <s> i must admit that the noble earls somewhat deadpan response has not encouraged me <e> <s> to hear those administrative arguments when we are discussing the most fundamental human rights matters is profoundly depressing <e> <s> i have always felt that the convention on refugees was perhaps the noblest and most unsordid collective act of the governments of the world that there has ever been <e> <s> i regard our adherence to that convention and to the principles underlying it as perhaps the most important test of our national reputation <e> <s> i feel obliged to ask the house to agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think i can clear this up <e> <s> i only referred to the amendment of the noble lord lord hylton as a courtesy to the absent noble lord because he had asked me to do so <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that i am moving amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has said and that we are not considering the later one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl for that reply which i should like to study and consult about with those who know more about <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in a debate like this one is lucky if one can make one point <e> <s> the point that i wish to make is that the bill poses a deadly threat to latin and the classics as school subjects and that they must be saved <e> <s> i was grateful for the implicit support on that point that i received earlier from the noble lord lord blake <e> <s> the threat that hangs over all minority subjects not just the classics comes not from the idea of a national curriculum as such <e> <s> properly framed after real consultation with real teachers that could have been something we could all support <e> <s> the threat comes from the inflexible national curriculum as we see it in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in her deliberations will the noble baroness give due weight to the fact that the horniman museum is situated roughly speaking in dulwich <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask a factual question about the amendment which is puzzling me <e> <s> in the fourth line as printed it refers to the beginning of that year <e> <s> will the noble lord explain to me to which year that refers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord craigton made one of the best speeches on second reading and i was determined to support him on this amendment <e> <s> i cannot help thinking that a more wide-awake and forward looking drafter of the bill would not have overlooked the obvious fact that our stewardship of this planet will be our major preoccupation during the next to years <e> <s> i shall leave aside the speech that i had intended to make in support of the noble lord <e> <s> however i am sure that a provision along the lines proposed should be put in the bill and that clause is the place <e>", "<cs> clause is a very odd clause indeed <e> <s> it reads more like a model homily or a sermon than the opening of an act of parliament <e> <s> if this is to be the pattern for legislation from now on i cannot wait to get my hands on a copy of the local government finance bill <e> <s> another very odd thing about the clause is that it is apparently the curriculum and nothing but the curriculum which is expected to promote the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i am repeating noble lords when i say that if i receive letters from real people i pay more attention to them than to letters i receive from organisations <e> <s> i should like to confirm what the noble baroness lady david said <e> <s> in my experience what is becoming known in the country as the test of seven has produced more mail from real people than any other topic in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with this amendment and i should now like to speak to it <e> <s> we are talking about a situation in which either the lea or the governing body wishes to admit more than the relevant standard number or even more than some other number greater than that proposed <e> <s> the authority to which such a proposal is made has two months in which to reject it <e> <s> if it does so the proponent body if unwilling to take that rejection lying down can apply within days to the secretary of state for an order under clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a has been grouped by the powers that be with the amendment that the noble lord lord irvine of lairg has just so ably moved <e> <s> therefore i take it that i should speak to it now <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us whether a gull suffering from avian botulism is capable of laying an egg which might later be consumed in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that we take the advice of the two chief whips and listen to the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the very best speeches at second reading was made by the noble lord lord craigton who has moved this amendment <e> <s> i should like to assure him of the support of these benches <e> <s> a more wide awake and forward-looking drafter of the bill could surely not have overlooked the painfully obvious fact that in the next quarter or half century our wise stewardship of the small planet on which we live will

like to let this opportunity pass without saying that we are grateful for what the government have done <e>", "<cs> my lords that was one of the most predictable utterances to which i have ever had to listen <e> <s> the government accept that we have a point but will do nothing to meet it <e> <s> to say that anybody can write to the secretary of state is no answer <e> <s> of course anybody can write to the secretary of state <e> <s> we can all write to him <e> <s> however that is not the way in which parents normally express their opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support what the noble lord said <e> <s> as far as i know on thursday of next week our amendments will be considered in another place <e> <s> when is the bill to be reprinted for that to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being very pedantic will the noble baroness agree that her amendment would make more sense if the word of in the penultimate line were spelt if <e> <s> or have i misunderstood <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord said about the teaching of spanish does he regret that when i moved an amendment which would have had the effect of encouraging schools to teach more than one foreign language his noble friend lady hooper dismissed it in an almost perfunctory manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord peston in thanking the noble earl for explaining the scheme to us <e> <s> on the assisted places scheme in general i have very little disagreement with the noble lord <e> <s> when this order was thrust into my <e>", "<cs> my lords if the draft is already in circulation is it not possible for the noble lord to tell us how it defines a parent <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a brief word in support of the amendment to

from the noble and learned lord perhaps may ask whether the minister and the government agree that some improvement in the position of the kurds should form an integral part of any settlement of the gulf war <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount remember that on th july a mrs rumbold in another place said that per cent <e> <s> of the teaching force would continue to come through the normal

a certain number of mums for the labour force but also the preparation of children especially those from less educationally-minded homes for their impending entrance to proper schools <e> <s> further will the government bear in mind the importance of there being some quasi-educational element in the pre-school provision <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a brief intervention in the form of a question to the noble earl <e> <s> would it not be better if instead of water protection and environment authority we talked of the water and environment protection authority <e> <s> as the amendment stands it sounds as though this authority is in charge of the entire environment whereas it is concerned only with that part which has to do with water <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord russell couched his question in fashionably monetarist terms and it seemed to me that he answered it in the negative <e> <s> i am going to suggest that the answer was and is bound to be no <e> <s> that is because so

it was the iraqi forces which carried out the attack <e> <s> if not who else could possibly have done it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree i am sure that he must if he has ever visited a palestinian school that the cruel irony of the situation is that those children unlike some nearer home have an avid hunger for knowledge which means that for them exclusion from school is a real punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me whether these road assessment studies are anything more than an attempt to buy time during which the problem of londons traffic will get so

place and the noble lord has more or less repeated what was said there <e> <s> it is like a parent asked by a recalcitrant child why should i <e> <s> replying because i say so <e> <s> there is little

element is greatly preferable to the word medium <e> <s> on second reading i noted the strange and strained definition of the environment given on page of the bill <e> <s> it is difficult to see why the government have gone to such trouble to invent a new definition when those in the dictionary are so simple and straightforward <e> <s> it may be that they have phrased the legislation in such a way so as to link up with the responsibilities of the different authorities in connection with pollution control for example the national rivers authority with regard to pollution in rivers and the local authority with regard to pollution on land <e> <s> i do not know whether that assumption is correct it is just a guess on my part <e> <s> however if that is the case then i fear that this separation carried through even to the very definition of the word environment would cause problems when pollution from a landfill site leaches through the ground into the water table and thence into
