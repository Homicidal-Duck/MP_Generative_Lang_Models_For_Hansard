["<cs> my lords this evening and in fact for most of the day we have been discussing two enormous subjects but i hope to be as brief as usually i am <e> <s> i do not intend to cover a routine world <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never yet tried to preach a sermon and i am sure that your lordships will be very glad to know that i am not about to do so now <e> <s> however as the holder of the wooden spoon in the order of speaking and also as the wearer of a now rather wilted carnation i can assure your lordships that i have been waiting with bated breath and that i have heard many deep and serious thoughts from some of the very eminent speakers whom we have <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to take his information solely from a newspaper i am afraid i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the provisions of the betting gaming and lotteries acts to in relation to the number of races on which betting may take place on dog racecourses on any day and in relation to the number of special betting days <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i should like to say how grateful i am to noble lords on all sides of the house who gave the bill such a good welcome <e> <s> i am particularly indebted to my noble friends lord ward of witley and lord mancroft who with their great experience and knowledge have shown that this is a worthwhile bill <e> <s> i was very encouraged by the welcome given by the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> i think we can all agree that this bill does not go far enough and that there is a long way to go but we must take it step by step to cover the things which we think can be dealt with satisfactorily <e> <s> i was interested in the historical aspects that the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for his answer <e> <s> may i congratulate him upon what i think is his first reply from this side of the house <e> <s> first may i ask my noble friend about the long term future of this establishment <e> <s> secondly could he say whether he is satisfied that the co-operation between our allies and industry in this country is of the highest order in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief but before i begin perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of my noble friend the foreign secretary demonstrating considerable expertise in diplomatic skills is it not now time after six years that he could probably achieve a great deal in the cyprus problem which would make a lot of difference in the whole world <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me enormous pleasure to be able to follow the noble baroness lady jeger and to compliment and congratulate her on her maiden speech <e> <s> she has shown a knowledge of the subject and her moving choice of words is as apt as the quality of her writing which many of your lordships will have read <e> <s> her breadth of interest which includes work on councils and in many government ministries will undoubtedly give us a new member who can hardly fail to add substantially to the expertise which is already here in strength <e> <s> no doubt as chairman of the labour party she will have her hands very full of other matters nevertheless we hope to hear her on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe the house an apology for not putting my name down on the list of speakers but i was not sure that i would be back in town in time for the debate <e> <s> i must admit that i agree with every speaker so far <e> <s> i live in a very small village in the country quite near to where my noble friend sitting on the front bench lives <e> <s> we do not have a school we do not have a pub we do not have a shop and now they are talking of closing down the school in the next village <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to reveal the name here <e> <s> perhaps we could speak about it afterwards <e> <s> it is a fact and i have it on good authority though i have not seen it myself <e> <s> so far as india is concerned there is something good to say <e> <s> we have an agreement with them that they will manufacture british-designed tanks under licence <e> <s> i think that we could do much more and i consider myself extremely fortunate that less than two weeks ago i was able to raise this question with mrs ghandi in delhi and discuss defence sales with her on a broad basis <e>", "<cs> no my lords there are many anomalies in the whole thing <e>", "<cs> my lords with half an hour left of the two and a half hour debate there is a small temptation for me to go on a bit and say all the things i wanted to say and perhaps pick up some of the pieces <e> <s> i can assure noble lords there is no chance of that happening <e> <s> i think that the subject of defence sales is undoubtedly a very controversial and emotive one <e> <s> we have heard some good speeches <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part although like my noble friend lord strathcona i am rather sad that we have not had a fighting speech from somebody who thinks that the whole thing is totally wrong <e> <s> everybody who wanted to speak has had the opportunity <e> <s> many points have come out which i hope the government will study <e> <s> i am quite sure we have a long way to go before we get the picture right <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual my intervention will be very brief and while thanking my noble friend for introducing this order and congratulating the government once again on the pay and conditions that they are providing for her majestys forces i should like to make one point <e> <s> that is on part of the conditions being the equipment that our people have to use <e> <s> in talking to some servicemen in the past they have told me that they feel like second-class soldiers when they go on nato exercises when comparing some of their equipment with the equipment of their neighbours from different countries <e> <s> i would suggest that if we were able to streamline our defence sales structure as i have mentioned to my noble friend in the past and if we were able to sell more arms as the french and the italians and many other people are able to do it would enable us to have more money available to improve other parts of the conditions which are so vital to our servicemen these days <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that these increases cause considerable hardship to passengers and should not perhaps a cooling-off period be thought of to allow the enormous excess charges which tour operators charge passengers to be deferred for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend know whether the actual increases are factually given to the government before they give their approval <e> <s> if the reasons for the increases are given why could they not tell the public so that the public could make their determined choice and know the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether despite the enormous additions to various complicated equipment he can say more about equipment such asbvehicles like the land rover which are sometimes below standard in the auxiliary forces <e>", "<cs> may i say one or two words in view of what the noble baroness lady birk has said in suggesting that there is not very much support against this amendment <e> <s> i have a lot of respect for my noble friend lord duncan-sandys and for many others who spoke in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i am amazed by some of the things i have heard <e> <s> there is one massive point which my noble friend lord drumalbyn mentioned <e> <s> there seems to be no difference made between the areas of special control and the other areas we have been talking about <e> <s> the special control areas were <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of making a lengthy speech <e> <s> i put my name down merely so that i could support my noble friend lord crawshaw who so ably moved this bill <e> <s> in doing so i should also like to thank my noble friend lord mancroft for his kind remarks on the bill on greyhound racing which of course has nothing to do with this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those extended to my noble friend lord dilhorne on his rather witty and instructive speech and i am sure he will be able to improve on that even when he has full range <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord gregson and his committee on an excellent report although i do not understand it all because i am not a scientist <e> <s> i should like to apologise and ask your lordships indulgence if i may have it for having to leave before the end of this debate due to a long-standing engagement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a rare honour to follow the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> far be it from me a retired captain to risk a charge of insubordination by crossing swords with a field marshal so i will not follow him exactly in the realms of higher strategy <e> <s> my noble friend the minister has in his <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her very kind answer <e> <s> would it not have been better to have a wider spread of british interests in this organisation in order to improve our balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his very full reply <e> <s> is it not clear that possibly the army is losing a great many good potential officers <e> <s> as they are all perhaps under such great stress at sandhurst <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the provisions of the betting gaming and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> three my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in this short debate not least to my noble friend lord westbury who obviously to my mind spoke his own opinion and was able to bring in that he had some support from his friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether among all this gloom and doom my noble friend the minister is aware that having taken some soundings among gps i have discovered that they are most happy and very satisfied with the proposed list fully realising that there is some need for this measure <e> <s> they will be very satisfied with what the government are proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that the second reading of the betting gaming and lotteries amendment bill was approved on th january of this year <e> <s> at that time the government indicated that while they were in sympathy with the concept of deregulation of the number of betting days for both horse racing and greyhound racing certain reservations had been expressed regarding some potential problems in relation to the legalising of carry-forward pools for greyhound racing as in horse racing <e> <s> i am pleased to say that with the most helpful co-operation of the home office agreement appears to he imminent to retain the provisions of the carry-forward pools albeit on a reduced basis details of which i shall mention in a moment when i move other amendments <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in everything he has said and to remind the committee that this amendment will make an enormous amount of difference to the sport of greyhound racing <e> <s> i hope your lordships will see fit to approve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope noble lords will forgive me for not having put my name down but i did not expect to be here today and i had given notice that i intended to speak <e> <s> as usual i shall be extremely brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong the arguments at all but as greyhound racing has been mentioned by the noble lord lord monson i must declare an interest here <e> <s> i must make it clear to your lordships that greyhound racing would not disagree with anything that was looked into there because it is family entertainment <e> <s> people take their families and to my knowledge there has never been any trouble <e> <s> but it raises the question whether it is a sport in the strict sense of the word because there are no people involved <e> <s> all the sports that have so far been mentioned have involved people taking part <e> <s> as we know in greyhound racing only dogs run round the track and the people watch <e> <s> there is no fear in greyhound racing which is family entertainment as to the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that there are two precedents for the government intervening one in for fish farming and one in for broiler houses and that action is needed urgently <e> <s> may i ask him also whether he is aware that if he does not take action immediately many small breeders will be put out of business and so damage the horse industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the ministry of agriculture is advising farmers who have had milk quota difficulties in regard to their cows to go into horse breeding <e> <s> is it not a dreadful anomaly that now they should be overrated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that many of these land sites albeit admirable from the point of view of nirex and bnfl are always going to involve this terrific problem of public outcry as has already been proved in the case of billingham <e> <s> is he aware that there is a very good alternative in using off-shore drilled boreholes <e> <s> that has already been mentioned in many publications considered by the government and in the latest environmental study it has been proved to be the best possible option <e> <s> would it not save an awful lot of trouble if only that study could be looked at more closely <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the duty of nirex is to find the best possible option <e> <s> in a recent best possible option study by the department of the environment it came out quite clearly that using bore holes offshore is a much better option than burying the waste on land <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everyone including myself will be most grateful to the noble lord lord willis for introducing this subject <e> <s> it comes at a very timely moment when so many leading newspapers are carrying articles about this very subject and have been doing so since june <e> <s> the visit of mr denktash also alerted us to the situation <e> <s> with his usual command of the language the noble lord was a pleasure to listen to and i disagreed with him not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord wyatt for introducing the sunday sports bill which i hope will take us further down the road towards the deregulation of laws governing sport and leisure <e> <s> we have heard a great many speeches <e> <s> i should obviously like to add my congratulations to my noble friends lord fairhaven and lord head on their excellent introductory speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider having the mileage registered in the normal vehicle document which used to be a registration book so that one can tell how many miles the vehicle has done <e>", "<cs> my lords almost everything has already been said but i should like to add one further element to this argument <e> <s> i speak as the chairman of the british greyhound racing board which is involved in this matter <e> <s> we all know what this amendment says there is no need for me to go through it again <e> <s> however the approval for the races <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to introduce a bill to amend the betting gaming and lotteries act in relation to charges to bookmakers on licensed tracks <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i wish to declare my interest as the chairman of the british greyhound racing board which is the elected representative body for greyhound racing that operates under the rules of racing of the national greyhound racing club <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for the time and trouble that she spent in doing her research <e> <s> i was extremely interested to hear what she said as well as what my noble friend the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness and to my noble friend for their remarks <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point in going any further <e> <s> there is nothing more to be said <e> <s> therefore i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for explaining his reasons <e> <s> the amendment gives the secretary of state the power to lay an order under the bill <e> <s> i gather from legal advice that the power to do something means power to do it from time to time <e> <s> that is according to strict legal interpretation <e> <s> therefore in my view the government are incorrect to say that the secretary of state can only exercise it once he can exercise it more than once <e>", "<cs> if the government always tried to get both parties to agree half the legislaton on the statute books would not be there <e> <s> that makes it clear to me that there are many times when the government will not make a decision <e> <s> however in view of what my noble friend has said i am prepared to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that after further legal advice and discussions with the appropriate bodies we may bring forward an amendment in a slightly different guise on report <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for the trouble that he has taken to explain the governments position yet again <e> <s> obviously i am unhappy that he cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> we shall have to agree to disagree <e> <s> however as he undoubtedly has the whip hand i feel that discretion will be the better part of any contemplated valour on my part <e> <s> as i wish to see the main thrust of the bill go forward to another place i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> perhaps i may ask whether she is aware that there are voluntary youth organisations in london and that when the boroughs take over responsibility for the running of these youth clubs they are bound to give them a low priority <e> <s> that will mean thousands of young people being allowed to go on the streets and turning to crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> we have had some interesting and useful exchanges and i am grateful to him and to the opposition for their support <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for repeating what she has said to me on many occasions before apart from the nice million for those who are entitled to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the villages of transylvania where the hungarians are in the vast majority they also have a majority on the council and that it is not the hungarians who are being oppressed by the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the case of mr salman rushdie the government paid a great deal of attention to threats and such things <e> <s> why because this matter did not receive <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are youth clubs which are already closing down due to lack of funds <e> <s> therefore will he look further into the subject <e> <s> it is most important as regards crime in london <e>"]
