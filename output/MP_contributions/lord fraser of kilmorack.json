["<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord underhill i had not originally intended to intervene in this debate i only do so because i think we tend to be losing sight of one particular point and that is all i really wish to talk about <e> <s> i am warmly in support of the government in their general industrial relations policy and in relation to these codes of conduct <e> <s> i have some sympathy with what was said by the noble baroness lady seear about the ultimate limitations of codes of conduct they can obviously be carried too far and can be used as an alibi in certain cases <e> <s> but i think that in this particular area of industrial relations they are at least well worth trying <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start as other noble lords contributing to this debate have done by thanking my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale for giving us this opportunity <e> <s> i have found it a most fascinating debate <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord bridge of harwich on an excellent maiden contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add my strong support to the information given in the statement by my noble friend lord gowrie declaring an interest as a director of a british-owned company that has operated in japan for at least years <e> <s> this is not a one-way movement <e> <s> we live in an extremely flexible world and we must recognise that <e> <s> i believe this is an encouraging thing in so far as we know what it is about <e> <s> on the evidence of my own company one can grow in other places as well <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i say that while i do not in any way disagree with anything he has said or that was said by the noble lord lord boston and while i am entirely in favour of the objectives of the bill would he not agree that it is a matter of keeping things in perspective <e> <s> judged on any international comparison whether in relation to spirits wines or beer we are still a relatively abstemious nation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mishcon sits down may i just put one point to him and ask a question <e> <s> it has always seemed to me that it is the advocate not of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure for me to follow my noble friends lord holderness and lord drumalbyn with whom i normally agree almost totally but on this occasion i am afraid that the amount of agreement must be strictly limited <e>", "<cs> we will all wait my lords <e> <s> meanwhile all over western europe almost without exception even some of the more stable systems have been showing cracks recently <e> <s> other systems based on proportional and preferential plans have been displaying their weaknesses all too evidently to the growing embarrassment of our neighbours and friends in the eec and elsewhere both large and small <e>", "<cs> i had no intention of intervening <e> <s> however the word watchdog brought me to my feet because every time i hear the word watchdog i feel the same as i do in economic debates when people say there is light at the end of the tunnel <e> <s> although i would be the first to admit that there have been some notable and good exceptions to the rule in my experience when the word watchdog is applied to committees councils and other bodies of that kind they have usually either been asleep on the job or biting the hand that fed them <e> <s> one way and another i do not think that this is quite the right answer <e> <s> there may he a need for something but i would not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord blake for the brevity clarity and care with which he introduced this bill <e> <s> the bill as he indicated is a re-run with a few drafting amendments and one or two changes of intention of a minor sort of the bill introduced some two years ago by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and which was debated in this house on th february <e> <s> some noble lords may consider that the re-run is perhaps a bit premature <e> <s> i think so in one respect to which i shall refer later <e> <s> but i do not think that is really very important and it is not a real objection to having the re-run <e> <s> after all we live in a rapidly changing world and in such circumstances a change of mind if people wish to make it can sometimes be as necessary and as salutary as a change of linen <e> <s> therefore i have no objection to the bill in its present form coming here again <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no intention of intervening in this debate but i must say a few words i shall not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> i have the greatest respect for the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord graham of edmonton both of whom are good parliamentarians and always worth listening to <e> <s> i must admit that i have listened with interest to everything that has been said by the noble baroness and others <e> <s> however i think we take it a bit narrow <e> <s> this is after all a liberating rather than a restrictive measure and if we in this country are going to continue to pass or to fail to pass bills of a liberating and not restricting character on the basis that they must be for nothing more than an experimental period of three years then we shall sink beneath the waves and we shall deserve to do so <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments strongly <e> <s> i declare an interest as a trustee of queen elizabeths foundation for the disabled development trust <e> <s> i have not been a trustee for very long and my knowledge is only recently acquired <e> <s> however as a result of that experience i have a reasonable amount of knowledge of the subject <e> <s> i therefore strongly support the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that while the increase in startups in small businesses is most encouraging there is a need for small businesses to export more <e> <s> does the minister not further agree that if necessary the government should encourage them to do so <e> <s> it would be a great help to the balance of trade if this were so <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that what must be avoided at all costs is a situation in which by some mischance we have made europe safe for another conventional war <e> <s> there are many noble lords in this house who are old enough to remember that conventional weapons can be quite unpleasant too <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships this evening because much of my original speech when i thought there would be fewer speakers has already been made by other noble lords <e> <s> it has been an impressive debate so far and i merely wish to make one or two remarks in support of the amendment for which i shall vote if we vote on this matter this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree with my point <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems fair and proper <e>"]
