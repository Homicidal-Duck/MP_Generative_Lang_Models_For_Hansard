["<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships house for the first time it is the greatest privilege for me to make my maiden speech on a subject with which i am passionately concerned <e> <s> i must declare an interest because my brother is the owner of an historic house <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord winstanley for mentioning his wife <e> <s> perhaps here i might just speak for one moment and thank those many wives and recognise them who look after our beautiful houses throughout the country <e> <s> they are not just the <e>", "<cs> my lords we both took great pleasure as many of you my lords might do in visiting the chateaux of the loire <e> <s> i particularly remember one visit when we had been to that lovely chateau azay-le-rideaux which is perhaps the most furnished of the french chateaux and we drove on full of enthusiasm <e> <s> as we went along we saw a little chateau or manor house with a drive up to it <e> <s> it looked very beautiful and we saw a notice saying that it was open that day to the public <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the retention of possibly the word memorial but certainly something which would bring to mind the original reasons for this fund <e> <s> i believe that the children of the future would also like that not only for that reason but because i believe that in the future people might wish to leave or to give money to this fund if they know that it is a memorial fund for those who died in the last war <e>", "<cs> i have to make the confession that i am a foundation governor <e> <s> i also find if i am unlucky enough to be rung up by the press that their first question is what is your age <e> <s> i am tempted these days to make it older and older <e> <s> i make it now but i think it might get older <e> <s> i have never had any feeling whatsoever of difference in voting <e> <s> it had never occurred to me to vote in any way except for what i believed was for the best interest of the school <e> <s> it had never occurred to me until your lordships brought it up this afternoon that there should where the welfare of the schools is concerned be a difference in the voting between foundation and other governors <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord reigate <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave your indulgence being such a new member i can only speak from personal experience <e> <s> i have in mind the faces of three children <e> <s> a very short time ago i was asked to award prizes to spastic children and they were absolutely amazing in what they had achieved <e> <s> i shall never forget the faces of all those children but particularly the face of the winner <e> <s> secondly i should like to speak about a school that i knew well <e> <s> it was not perhaps a very intellectual school but it had taken the precaution of having a farm attached to it <e> <s> i remember that there was a sort of victor ludorem for the pupil who did the best this particular pupil had done especially well in lambing and he was brilliant at it <e> <s> thirdly i remember the face of a child whose father was an electrician and formed a small business of his own <e> <s> he happened to have a very brilliant son and he entered him for the scholarship for eton from a little remote village <e> <s> i believe there were in fact places and it needed this humble and shy man to go with his wife for the interview <e> <s> this boy in fact missed getting a place by one mark <e> <s> this was a little while ago when schools were still independent and they put him in for a school which was perhaps more ancient than eton an ancient grammar school <e> <s> he got in and he has done brilliantly <e> <s> in the intervening time this child would not have had that opportunity <e> <s> i know i have diversified a little with my first two children but their faces are so vivid in my mind <e> <s> i believe that we are thinking not only about the brilliant children we are thinking about the others as well <e> <s> i crave your lordships indulgence because i know this afternoon we are speaking about assisted places this is what i wanted to say that the brilliant child a few years ago would not have had the chance he has and i hope that in the future another such child will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply which is not perhaps unexpected may i pursue this matter <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that when my husband was in the house of commons he fought for over years for the release of hess <e> <s> and may i also ask the noble lord whether he is aware that my husband had an exceptional experience of the nazi rgime and evils <e> <s> he also had exceptional experience of hess because not only did he see him as some of your lordships here present also did day after day at nuremburg but he saw him frequently in his cell and had many conversations with him <e> <s> i know that if my husband were here he <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak as the noble lord lord charteris of amisfield has in such splendid picturesque language given our thanks for all the advantages that the other place granted to us in the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> but as your lordships have so kindly indicated that i may do so may i say that in every way i support everything which he has said today <e> <s> we are in business and we shall do our very best to save all the treasures we possibly can with the cockleshell which we hope will be filled to greatest advantage in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for his reply particularly the last sentence may i ask him whether he is aware that there were a large number of omissions and that many letters have been received about this <e> <s> may i ask that a fund should be set <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to put down a question on the situation of the other ranks on this matter would the noble lord the minister be kind enough to inquire what the views of the government would be on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to speak in this most important debate in regard to which so many of your lordships who are taking part <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord may have misunderstood what i was meaning <e> <s> i was talking more about subversion and the way in which we must counter this if for instance there should be an attack on our children through the schools <e> <s> i think perhaps i did not make myself quite clear <e> <s> in that way i felt parents ought to have a very good relationship with teachers so that there should not be misunderstandings in the teaching of our children <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask him to give high priority to an assurance that an improved assisted house purchase scheme will be brought in as soon as financially possible so that members of her majestys forces may enjoy benefits similar to those of council house tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all be very grateful to the noble duke for asking this unstarred question this evening for giving us such an explicit and first hand description of the country which he knows so well and for telling us of the difficulties which have to be overcome <e> <s> we have also been told this by the other noble lords who have spoken so eloquently this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to speak this evening on the subject of poland which was briefly mentioned earlier this afternoon by the noble lord the foreign secretary and which i think could come under the headings of both defence and foreign affairs <e> <s> some of your lordships might have had friends comrades in arms during the war and you might feel pity for the plight of their country at the moment <e> <s> i speak on two accounts from a personal point of view and i shall not keep your lordships long on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having added my name to the list of speakers but i shall not speak for more than a minute or two <e> <s> while sharing in the concern of so many noble lords that the external broadcasts are to be discontinued to spain italy and malta i congratulate her majestys government on keeping the external broadcasts to somalia particularly since the recent alliance between libya ethiopia and the south yemen <e> <s> it has always been a dangerous part of the world but i believe that that alliance has made it a very much more dangerous part <e> <s> i am therefore particularly thankful that we shall continue our external broadcasts there <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords the great honour and pleasure or congratulating the right reverend prelate the bishop of hereford upon a most inspiring and instructive speech falls to me this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to <e>", "<cs> may i following this speech by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter mention that i recently had a letter which is very much the same as he has just mentioned <e> <s> it is from <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is great anxiety in the region mentioned by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> is he also aware that the success which we anticipate and which we all pray for in the falklands will establish our reputation for defence for peace in the world <e> <s> may i ask that attention should then be increased in this area which includes egypt somalia oman pakistan bangladesh and saudi arabia all of which are threatened by soviet strategy in that region <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be very grateful to my noble friend lord ailsa for asking this question because the debate has thrown up such a wealth of information of an alarming nature <e> <s> i would like to ask my noble friend the minister whether he does not agree that the situation in the falkland islands at the present moment is a classic lesson that prevention is better than cure <e> <s> surely that is what we should be thinking about this evening <e> <s> what we have heard about is a very dangerous situation <e> <s> i would like to concentrate my remarks primarily on somalia because that is what i know most about <e> <s> that is because it is in conjunction with something about which my late husband felt very deeply that is freedom under the law <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether vat is charged specifically on those objects which are on view to the public <e> <s> do her majestys government not feel that this will cause people to hide away their best and most valuable objects and not give the public the benefit of seeing them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just come from the heritage meeting and therefore my heart is with the heritage <e> <s> the city of london is our living heritage and i would like to underline that word living because where there is a gap or possibility some people would seek to rebuild with some sort of idea of the past <e> <s> maybe they would like to have a sort of wren building a wren church or some such building on a site like this <e> <s> i fight hard to preserve the heritage of the past but our children must live and work in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill and i should like strongly to support the speech of my noble friend lord charteris who is as your lordships know chairman of the national heritage memorial fund of which i am also a trustee <e> <s> he has mentioned many subjects upon which i would have spoken and i totally agree with what he has said <e> <s> therefore i should like to associate myself very closely with what he said <e> <s> i should also like very much to congratulate my noble friend lord geoffrey-lloyd on his absolutely splendid maiden speech <e> <s> there is no one who could have made a better speech on a more perfect subject <e> <s> he is what one might call the guardian of that queen of castles the castle of leeds <e> <s> it has i believe been called the ladies castle <e> <s> i would very much agree with that because anybody who has visited that beautiful castle whether on business or pleasure or both together has an overwhelming feeling of enjoyment whatever his occupation may be <e> <s> the fact that the noble lord was able to tell us that added to this great pleasure he has a very good record of profit was a matter for great congratulations from all of us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord raglan has emphasised the very point i was about to make <e> <s> there have been a number of instances recently of loans to museums i was interested to hear lord raglans comments about there having been some uncertainty as to whether it was a loan or a gift where because people have been in great difficulty perhaps needing to repair their houses or meet such an expense they have felt they must sell those objects <e> <s> in several cases of that sort the national heritage memorial fund has come in to help and has bought the objects for the museums <e> <s> did my noble friend say he would think about the matter again <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may speak for a moment when i cited the case of lyford grange i may say that it is an extremely isolated building but attached to it and about half a mile away are some ancient almshouses so that although it is isolated it is an enclave as one might say quite apart from its historical context which is the important point i am making <e> <s> it is as the noble baroness lady birk was saying very much in the country and could not possibly have been a conservation area but it has very particular historical associations <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted a very few words <e> <s> we should not give comfort to our potential enemies <e> <s> what we discuss in this house is published and will be read with great interest in russia and in other countries which may have sympathy with her <e> <s> i speak from a very vulnerable position as both a mother and a grandmother <e> <s> noble lords can therefore imagine that my sympathies are to a very large extent with those who have spoken <e> <s> however i do not feel that this is the way in which we shall best deter what we most fear <e> <s> everything has shown in the past and will in the future that by being prepared and by not saying too much we shall be in a far better position to counter what we most fear <e> <s> therefore i believe that we should not in any way play into the hands of our potential enemies <e> <s> i feel very deeply that over the past years we have had the good fortune to have peace through strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord charteris <e> <s> if we use the word heritage there are already two organisations one besides ours and everyone knows the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> surely if we had a third one using the word heritage there could be great confusion <e> <s> i do agree with my noble friend that what we have grant-aided goes extremely wide <e> <s> i should like to add to the things that he has mentioned for instance wimpole avenue an aeroplane and the famous vehicle bluebird which everyone knows about and also the manuscript of tennysons in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down is it in order for me to ask a further question about historic buildings <e> <s> where cottages of great importance are attached to an historic building so that they form an historic whole is that preserving the whole of an historic situation an historic place <e> <s> would that be preserving or conserving <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment particularly so far as the planning of roads is concerned <e> <s> if there were such a register which included important landscapes as well as gardens possibly designed by such designers as capability brown it might influence the planning of a road which could spoil a landscape <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> all your lordships will i think agree that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the noble earl lord cathcart for instigating the debate in my opinion not a moment too soon <e> <s> there have been many different opinions expressed about different parts of the world <e> <s> i should like to speak mainly about the horn of africa <e> <s> i should especially like to associate myself with my noble friend when he paid tribute to mr louis fitzgibbon for the immense amount of work that he did in assembling his three reports and book that won the first airey neave memorial prize <e> <s> perhaps i am allowed to tell your lordships that the theme of the prize was freedom under the law <e> <s> i have noticed listening with great interest to so many speeches today that there is the underlying feeling that whatever ones opinions freedom under the law is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to second my noble friends motion for a humble address in reply to her majestys most gracious speech <e> <s> i should like to express my sincere gratitude to the noble viscount the leader of the house for inviting me to undertake this task <e> <s> he was a friend of long standing of my late husband in another place and it is a great pleasure to have this very special opportunity of congratulating him on his new duties in your lordships house <e> <s> may i at the same time express my gratitude to my noble friend the chief whip not only for his welcome to me in your lordships house some three years ago but also for doing me the great honour of inviting me to undertake this task this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord caithness and i ask my noble friend lord kinnoull not to press the amendment to a division <e> <s> we have heard many views and if the minister feels that he can leave the door open with all the negotiating parties perhaps my noble friend lord kinnoull will not press his amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may think it strange that i should speak on a motion such as the one which is being debated this evening but the congratulations which have been extended this evening to my noble friend lord lauderdale to which i should like to add mine show how very wide-ranging is this motion <e> <s> speaking as i do rather late in the debate it has struck me forcibly that many brilliant speeches have been made from the heart this evening and even more from experience by men of great knowledge in this particular field <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how often hess is allowed to see his near relations <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain advantage in speaking towards the end of such an important and erudite debate because so many things have been said which one would have liked to have said oneself <e> <s> therefore i shall be extremely short <e> <s> i should like first to thank the noble lord lord fanshawe for giving us the opportunity of this debate and to add my congratulations on the excellent maiden speeches that we have heard this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask how much of the taxpayers money has been spent on services and parts in anticipation that the pwr will be chosen <e> <s> what will happen about this money <e> <s> how much will have been wasted if the agr is chosen as i hope it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the defence white paper contains a paragraph about the armed forces and the media <e> <s> i am not sure that this aspect has been touched on this evening unless it was while i was away from this chamber <e> <s> from the point of view of the services it is of the greatest importance and to some extent <e> <s> it is a completely new problem <e>", "<cs> if i may say so noble lords have spoken entirely about a drug this evening <e> <s> i should just like to mention for one moment the question of poison <e> <s> i do not know whether it has been established how goering came to hide poison in some manner and for so long as a prisoner at nuremberg <e> <s> if someone can hide poison for themselves they could hide poison for someone else <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard this evening some very important arguments from noble lords who have great experience in this field but i should like to put it to your lordships that as my noble friend said just now things boil down <e> <s> i should like to say that this argument really boils down to two matters which i believe are of great importance to our country at the moment and those are the defence of the country and employment in this country <e> <s> so when we are are thinking about what should be chosen by the secretary of state i should like to remind your lordships of those two very important matters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether vat is or will be applicable to building repairs to churches <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the secretary of states statement on economy in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend the minister whether if at the end of this immensely long sizewell inquiry which has been commented on today by various noble lords and as we have just heard is extremely costly the american pwr is ordered it will not be the end of the british nuclear industry with the consequence of the loss of many jobs of those associated with british gas-cooled reactor technology <e>", "<cs> my lords having the honour of being a trustee of the national heritage memorial fund i should like to join my noble friend lord charteris in expressing deep gratitude especially to the minister for the wonderful sum of million <e> <s> i have to admit that to me and i am also an innocent financially it really does sound absolutely splendid <e> <s> but i am equally grateful to my noble friend lord cottesloe for explaining so clearly how that sum should have been very much greater if it had been left for the purpose for which it was originally intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord fanshawe for having introduced this debate at such an auspicious moment <e> <s> perhaps i may also with other noble lords congratulate my noble friend lord teynham on his very excellent maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords having been much involved in industry through my late husband <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking this evening to the white paper on defence estimates i should like particularly to draw your lordships attention to the demise of the distant-water fishing fleet <e> <s> this has been touched on by several noble lords this evening but i wish to emphasise how bad is the situation <e> <s> it can be said that comparisons are odious but in such vessels were requisitioned and used as minesweepers <e> <s> today this particular class has only one it is called the pict although i understand that there are of course or so middle-water trawlers and a considerable number of smaller off-shore supply vessels and further fishing vessels <e> <s> but the reason that this alarms me so much is that all these vessels are suitable for conversion to minesweepers <e> <s> i consider and i am sure many noble lords will agree with me that it is important that we should have the services of minesweepers <e>", "<cs> my lords culham has played a large part in my life for more than years and although it was just over the border of my husbands constituency a very large number of the eminent scientists who worked there lived in our area what was then north berkshire and is now mostly called oxfordshire <e> <s> we had many friends among them <e> <s> i have therefore listened with particular interest to your lordships learned speeches this evening and i join with many other noble lords and i am sure with the noble lords who have yet to speak in thanking my noble friend lord bessborough for introducing this unstarred question this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether there are many schemes such as that of the yes organisation which i think was started by mr angus ogilvy <e> <s> this organisation is no charge on the government and i believe is largely subscribed to by private people or firms <e> <s> it is particularly for young people <e> <s> i also believe that this has been expanded to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is aware that i am speaking as a trustee of the national heritage memorial fund and that we work very closely with the historic buildings and monuments commission who have been very helpful in expert advice and constru <e>", "<cs> i speak with experience of being a governor of what was a girls grammar school in fulham which became a small comprehensive school <e> <s> it was suggested that there should be pupil governors and of course the girls were rather excited about that to start off with <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble kinsman for introducing this important subject this evening <e> <s> i speak with great humility in view of the vast knowledge of other peers who will speak this evening <e> <s> i can speak only from my personal knowledge i had the privilege of sitting on sub-committee f to which my noble kinsman referred <e> <s> last week we heard evidence about sweden <e> <s> i found it enormously interesting because mr gustaffson told <e>"]
