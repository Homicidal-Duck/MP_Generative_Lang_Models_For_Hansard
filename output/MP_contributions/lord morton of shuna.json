both by the police and by the courts who should not adopt the attitude that this is just domestic violence that it is just a normal case of a husband knocking the wife about a bit <e> <s> but in spite of that i think it would be highly dangerous to give an instruction that in any circumstances a police constable shall arrest <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that there is some proposal for legislation on the public sector side of this matter i would beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is the normal position that parties to an action are at arms length and not <e>", "<cs>

to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for this amendment which i think goes a long way to meet the criticisms which i endeavoured to put and which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey did put at committee stage and i also commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would fully support the spirit behind this amendment in the sense that i think it is recognised on all sides of the house that there is far too much violence in the home and that unfortunately there have been many cases where sometimes very severe violence would have been prevented if the police who had been called to the situation had in fact taken the person involved into custody <e> <s> but in my view this amendment is not the way to go about it <e> <s> the general position of a police officer is that he has a duty to see that the peace is kept but attached to that duty is that he shall interfere

the person from being kept in custody <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for having accepted the intention behind my amendment to take out frivolously and vexaciously <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for improving what i had suggested <e> <s> therefore i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take up a moment of time just to repeat my thanks to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for making this amendment which i believe to be of some importance <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for taking on board the intention of an amendment which i suggested in committee <e> <s> i should have thought that it was fairly clear that drugs such as amphetamines and cannabis are drugs from which traffickers make very large profits <e> <s> it is appropriate that they should be penalised also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am getting repetitive but perhaps your lordships will not object to my thanking the noble and learned lord the lord advocate yet again <e> <s> i welcome the governments change of heart <e> <s> at the committee stage my amendment was directed particularly to the question that it seemed to me wrong that the secretary of state would be entitled to order someone to be put into detention and that that child would have no recourse to anybody and no method of challenging the exercise of that power <e> <s> the amendments that the noble and learned lord has proposed certainly improve the amendment i had suggested and go further and i welcome them wholly <e> <s> i also accept it is much more suitable that it is the parole board which has the supervisory power rather than that a court should do so <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again i thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for taking on board my amendment and making the wording of it more appropriate <e> <s> considering that it was given as an undertaking by the secretary of state some years ago it seems strange that it has taken until the report stage in this house before it has come forward <e> <s> nonetheless it is welcome for all that <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> at report stage the noble and learned lord the lord advocate stated that this new contract had the substantial agreement of pharmacists <e> <s> it certainly appears from strong representations made to me and i understand to numerous other noble lords that there is a vociferous body of pharmacists who are strongly opposed to this measure and who claim to represent at least per cent <e> <s> of the pharmacists in practice <e> <s> if that is the position surely it is wrong suddenly to add to this bill a form of rationing of premises which is not to apply to england so that one has the curious result that certain small chemists in scotland will be paid less per prescription than the chemists in england <e> <s> that will certainly raise anger in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the bill in general <e> <s> it has been improved in the last few minutes <e> <s> i should like to deal with two or three points two of them perhaps of greater interest to more members of the general public in scotland than some other parts of the bill <e> <s> the first is the small claims procedure which i think will be generally welcomed <e> <s> i would however like to sound a warning note which i trust that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is also aware of <e> <s> it is that the effectiveness of the small claims procedure will depend crucially on the rules that the sheriff court rules council will formulate <e> <s> if these are complicated too rigid and legalistic the whole procedure will just not work <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another instance which shows the value of the work of the scottish law commission <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside is to be congratulated on presenting this bill only four years after it was drafted by the law commission <e> <s> it can do nothing but good to make the crime of incest as defined by the statutes

stepchildren who if the bill of the noble lord lord meston is passed marry in england are protected by whatever it becomes a <e>", "<cs> with that invitation as i do not think it would be appropriate to divide the committee as at present constituted and disturb various peoples digestions i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may come back with amendment no <e> <s> after consultation with the noble and learned lords the lord advocate and lord wilson of langside as to the wording that would be appropriate <e>", "<cs> i consider that section c has some value and i do not see all the difficulties that appear to be in the mind of the present chairman of the law commission <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be fairly easy either to define what is meant by a position of trust or authority in the bill or to leave it as a matter for a jury to work out whether a certain person was in a position of trust or authority <e>", "<cs> i had virtually finished <e> <s> all i was going to suggest was that i personally and all i can do is to speak for myself prefer section c as it exists to the rather convoluted way of dealing with the problem that is otherwise suggested as the alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords if the bill is to improve the provision of legal aid those on this side of the house would fully welcome it <e> <s> legal aid is a very important means of ensuring that people have access to justice by providing that the services of lawyers are available when necessary <e> <s> the bill should be judged on whether it assists access to the courts by ordinary people as citizen consumers and i am very far from certain that it does <e>", "<cs> as a scot i find this new clause rather difficult to understand because in scotland we do not have a county court <e> <s> the high court in scotland is simply a criminal court and it is far from clear in what court the elector or ratepayer is to sue if he wishes to do so in scotland <e> <s> is it the intention of the noble lord moving this clause that scottish electors and ratepayers shall have to go to carlisle to sue in the nearest county court <e> <s> if so what is the jurisdiction against the local authority <e>", "<cs> with respect if one looks at clause of the bill one sees that it applies to local authorities <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome this bill which will do much to remove the slur and stigma which has attached to people whose parents were not married to each other <e> <s> for too long as the noble earl has said society has put disadvantages and discredits on the child who could do nothing about his birth while leaving the father scot-free usually and the mother suffering to a lesser extent than the child <e>", "<cs> the title is perhaps of less significance and i do not intend to press amendment no <e> <s> or to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however amendment no <e> <s> contains a crucial point of significance which it does not seem to me that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has really answered <e> <s> a variety of committees look at various different aspects and that is precisely the difficulty <e> <s> they do not coalesce <e> <s> one looks at the criminal procedure but does not consider the effect of anything it does on the cost of legal aid for any alterations to the criminal procedure <e> <s> the same applies to civil procedure the committee does not look at the effects on the cost of legal aid <e> <s> it is for that purpose that amendments nos <e> <s> and were intended and i regret that i cannot accept the noble and learned lords invitation in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord selkirk has said everything that i should have said in much more persuasive language <e> <s> it is of vital importance that before the board is constituted it should know what it is to do <e> <s> we have been told by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that the secretary of state will accept one of several tenders as i understand it to appoint management consultants to consider the legal aid system <e> <s> that has already happened in england <e> <s> in england and wales messrs coopers and lybrand were the management consultants and they recommended that legal aid should remain where it was and under the same administration <e> <s> if that were to be the result of the management consultants exercise where would the government be with their bill <e>", "<cs> i oppose the motion that the clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> in the debate that we have heard there have been powerful criticisms of the bill from all over the committee <e> <s> it is no part of my wish to repeat them <e> <s> to a large extent they were suggestions that the clause should not stand part of the bill and that the government should take the bill away and consider it in the light of the management consultants report that they will eventually have <e> <s> it appears to me that the best way to do that is if your lordships committee agrees that clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wholly support the amendment <e> <s> in a sense i have spoken on the principle of it at an earlier stage <e> <s> it appears to me that the amendment would provide the board with some idea that it would be looking at something to do with the administration of justice and how it would affect legal aid <e> <s> i wholly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has in that answer shown quite clearly that this board is to be a creature of the secretary of state <e> <s> however in the light of his answer i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as there is a certain welsh element present i should like to remind the committee of a hymn which starts at least in its english translation guide me <e> <s> guidance is a fairly definite phrase there <e> <s> i do not wish to divide the committee but perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would consider whether rather than the words have regard some such words as the board shall consider such advice might be a happier phrase <e> <s> in the confident hope that the noble and learned lord will at least think about it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment though i may return to it <e>", "<cs> i also support this amendment which has not only been requested by the original committees that set up legal aid but has been recommended by the royal commission and requested by the law society and by the consumer council <e> <s> if the government refuse to accept it they are showing an attitude that they in the shape of the home and health department always know best and that nobody in scotland can ever give them any useful advice or make any useful suggestion <e> <s> this sort of nursemaid complex would be totally unsuitable <e> <s> i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps in one minor matter i may have a slight advantage over the noble and learned lord in that i have been a solicitor <e> <s> most lay people with a problem do not know what law is to apply <e> <s> they go to a solicitor in their own town with their problem <e> <s> it is a matter of scots law for the solicitor to be able to say in glasgow your problem is a problem of english law <e> <s> if there were no legal aid problems about it what would happen is that rather than the client from somewhere in drumchapel finding a solicitor in leeds newcastle or wherever his solicitor would write to a solicitor in england and get advice <e> <s> that is the problem <e>", "<cs> in that friendly spirit i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again this seems to be a very unsatisfactory situation and i hope that the government will take this away and think about it if for no other reason than the fact that as i have recently discovered one can be a widow of with children and receive as a widows pension from the government less than the same person would be entitled to receive as a single-parent family under supplementary benefit <e> <s> such a person would not receive representation <e> <s> i suggest that this really should be looked at with more care than it appears to have received <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps we have explored this amendment as much as possible and it would obviously be inappropriate to divide the committee on it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in this committee at this stage it is obvious that one has to take what is offered <e>", "<cs> if and when and in the hope if not the very great hope that there will be something coming i ask leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> this again shows that the brief of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate does not apparently recognise the problems <e> <s> if one has a limit which is too low people apply to the board for an extension of the limit and that costs more <e> <s> the fact that the limit is set at does not mean that each solicitor will get the fact that it is set at does not mean that each solicitor will get <e> <s> it only means that if they spend up to they do not need to go to the board to ask for an extension of the limit <e> <s> it reduces administration and makes the situation easier for the board which can still require the solicitor to justify the details of his charging <e>", "<cs> we may be at variance <e> <s> no doubt it would be better if i withdrew the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the dinner adjournment has at least meant that something is perhaps coming later <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for the assistance of the views of the noble and learned lord lord denning who puts the matter much more clearly than i have been able to do <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has not <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may repeat what has been a fairly frequent position of mine that is to say that i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wheatley for putting me right on the law <e> <s> however having said that i would ask leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> by saying that this is just repeating what was in previous acts shows the lack of insight in the drafting of this bill because presumably the purpose of a new act is that one improves any wording difficulties or unfortunate wording that occurs in the previous act <e> <s> one does not just take chunks and put them into the new act without thought <e> <s> but if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is willing to consider it i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would support this amendment <e> <s> your lordships will see from the next amendment that i have the same intention although putting it in a different place in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the industrial tribunals are as the noble and learned lord lord denning said extremely important <e> <s> apart from those cases which are occurring at this time out of the mining dispute it has been the experience of the industrial tribunals that they are now getting very few cases where the applicant is supported by a trade union because those cases are usually settled by acas before they reach the tribunal <e> <s> the vast majority of cases coming to the industrial tribunal in scotland are cases in which the applicant has no professional body or trade union available to advise him <e> <s> it is a very important sphere of litigation and one in which legal aid should be available on whatever qualification is considered appropriate <e> <s> i beg to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would urge the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to reconsider this <e> <s> does he really think that it is possible for any ordinary lay person unrepresented fully to understand the terms of the employment protection acts and the difference between for example re-engagement and reinstatement and to know exactly what he is doing wandering through that terrible morass of legislation which is even worse than the legal aid regulations themselves <e>", "<cs> i agree with the last remarks of the noble and learned lord lord wheatley but i cannot see why it is so difficult to allow defamation actions considering that under clause before granting legal aid the board would have to be satisfied that there was a probable cause and that <e>", "<cs> i spoke only on the civil side earlier but the difficulty on the criminal side referred to at second reading was that there was a divergence of view and approach and practice among the sheriffs granting legal aid <e> <s> i presume that the person who will be granting legal aid will be some sort of delegated person in portree inverness glasgow ayr or wherever and there is exactly the same risk of a difference in approach and standards <e> <s> therefore it is all the more essential that there should be some method for achieving a quick review or appeal <e> <s> the need in criminal applications for legal aid is an even more necessary principle <e>", "<cs> although we have heard various unsatisfactory replies from the noble and learned lord the lord advocate i have never heard a reply more unsatisfactory than the one he has just given <e> <s> we could have a very expeditious and uniform system <e> <s> the easy way to achieve that would be to refuse all applications <e> <s> what is needed is a speedy method of granting summary criminal legal aid applications <e> <s> in cases where legal aid is refused there must be some method of review or appeal <e>", "<cs> for every small relief we give great thanks <e> <s> in these circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> after that discussion i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as usual i regret to say that i regard that as a wholly unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> if a person wishes to defend proceedings raised against him in order to get legal aid he has to satisfy them that he has probable cause in his defence <e> <s> if he does not have probable cause and the legal aid fund has made a mistake they should bear the penalty just as much as if they gave legal aid to somebody who started the action <e> <s> if somebody wants to recover their own property and the defender wrongfully refuses to allow this to happen without going to court and the legal aid fund decides to back the defender why should the legal aid fund if it is going to cause severe financial hardship to the person recovering his own property not compensate him for it <e>", "<cs> we do not seem to have progressed very much since th march <e> <s> subsection seems to me to be in an entirely different frame of mind from section of the legal aid scotland act which says <e>", "<cs> this seems to me a very unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> i am told we have to look at clause <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord is going to adopt that friendly attitude certainly <e> <s> i assure him that i should not have put down the amendment if i had not thought that there was a possibility that the matter was not covered by clauses and <e> <s> however if he will look at it again i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances and with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> subject to the observation that there are appeals to the high court before a plea of guilty or not guilty is tendered and in the light of the noble and learned lords remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to divide the committee on this amendment <e> <s> subject to the remark that i may possibly return with this later i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i regret that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate seemed entirely to have missed the point of the amendment <e> <s> it was not a case where the man would make an application it is where the sheriff would consider it in the interests of the witnesses or the court that the man should have representation <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has not really dealt with that situation <e> <s> it is where you have say a person accused of molestation of children <e> <s> you do not want him to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses who are children <e> <s> that is the type of situation which the amendment has in mind <e>", "<cs> under those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have already virtually had a vote on this matter and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it clearly would be better to have the factors if we must have factors in the bill <e> <s> on <e>", "<cs> this is a wholly unsatisfactory position but i do not wish to take up more of the committees time <e> <s> who says that this scheme which was produced by the legal aid authorities is impracticable <e> <s> if it is only the home and health department have they told the people who put forward the scheme that it is impracticable <e> <s> the schemes proponents certainly consider that it is perfectly practicable <e> <s> my understanding is that nobody has ever asked the writer of the scheme any questions whatever about it <e> <s> i think that the best i can do is to say that i may well return to this matter at report stage and ask leave now to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had thought that up to now criminal legal aid was not granted by the law society at all but was granted by the court except in the case of applications for criminal appeals <e>", "<cs> this only applies to criminal cases as is obvious <e> <s> if the person is given the benefit of the doubt as to whether or not he is guilty it is very difficult to see why he should not be given the benefit of the doubt when one is considering at an early stage whether he has a reasonable chance if i can put it in non-technical language of succeeding in beating off the accusation of the crown that he is guilty <e> <s> i really cannot see why it can be fair that in england where a doubt arises as to whether criminal legal aid should be made available to an accused person the doubt should be resolved in that persons favour yet the same citizen of the same united kingdom who happens to live in scotland should have the onus placed the other way <e> <s> it seems to me to be a totally unsatisfactory situation to which i may return at a later stage but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of the lord advocates position i beg leave to withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> in that situation i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the clause states <e>", "<cs> with the intention of assisting us to make rapid progress i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly oppose this amendment which seems to me wholly misconceived and totally out of place <e>", "<cs> i oppose the question that this clause stand part of the bill on the basis that there are many situations in which legal aid is granted only for part of the proceedings <e> <s> from the way in which this clause is framed it appears to prevent payment of the non legally-aided part <e> <s> it is on that basis that i oppose the clause <e> <s> in the hope that the nods that i see on the other side of the committee may have some effect at a later stage that is all that i intend to say on the matter <e>", "<cs> not at all but i shall withdraw it at this stage <e> <s> i shall certainly come back to the amendment <e> <s> i see no reason why the basis should not be fair remuneration for work actually done and nothing that the noble and learned lord has said convinces me otherwise <e> <s> however rather than deal with it now i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again the noble and learned lord has shown the total dependence of the board which he asserts is to be independent because whether it is the tail or the dog they are connected in his simile <e> <s> if it is necessary or desirable to make regulations that surely would cover the situation whether it was an abuse or otherwise <e> <s> however i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is part of the aim of parliament to improve a bill but in the light of what the noble and learned lord has said i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> though it is a triumph to have had amendment no <e> <s> accepted <e>", "<cs> i can see no difficulty if the board knows its report is to be laid before parliament in it drafting a suitable report <e> <s> but with the prospect of returning to the matter at a later stage i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> no doubt we shall be told by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that this was in the and acts but things have moved since then and the general situation is that people who are married do not consider that the income of their spouse is their income or

there is no way that the legal aid authority can assess whether it is a genuine or a made-up case <e> <s> but if it is a made-up case the person on the other side of the litigation can suffer very extreme hardship if he is just beyond the limit of legal aid <e> <s> yet as the provisions stand a person can get no relief at all in a court of first instance unless the proceedings were instituted by the legally assisted person <e>", "<cs> my lords if the intention of this clause is that the secretary of state may define that legal asssistance by way of representation should be available instead of criminal legal aid in certain classes or stages it might have been more clear if that had been the provision <e>", "<cs> my lords all i am trying to say and no doubt am not saying very effectively is that it could have been put in a better way <e> <s> as stated the bill gives power to cut out criminal aid without replacing it with assistance by way of representation <e> <s> however

year you will naturally have cases which are on the borderline of being satisfied or not being satisfied <e> <s> that must happen in any real situation <e> <s> all i am suggesting is that where there is a doubt as to whether the board is or is not satisfied by the evidence or the factors produced to it that doubt has to be decided in the accused persons favour <e> <s> it is a fairly reasonable provision it is a provision that does not appear to have caused any difficulty in england or wales and the provisions though different are as precise <e> <s> at this stage of the evening i beg leave to withdraw the amendment while not promising not to return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to have been mentioned a great deal <e> <s> i looked up what i said in committee and found that it seemed to take up rather less than a full column and only about five lines dealt with abuses <e>", "<cs> my lords this is clearly not the time or place to divide the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is far too late to press an amendment at this stage and for that reason alone i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that little red riding hood saw granny in the bed and it turned out to be a wolf <e> <s> it may be that we are all looking at something that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate assures us is a very gentle and uninimical bill <e> <s> perhaps those who have spoken against it are right and it is a very dangerous bill <e> <s> it seems unusual that the only one who cannot see its dangers is the noble and learned lord the lord advocate because nobody else has spoken up in favour of the bill <e> <s> but at this stage i would ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall accept the noble and learned lords remarks in regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and but i am disappointed that he does not consider it possible at least to consider amendment no <e> <s> in theory and the question of where it could be more conveniently made <e> <s> however in the confident hope that somebody in another place will read this debate perhaps it is unnecessary to press the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that under clause an order can be made only after paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment relates only to regulations made under section which states <e>", "<cs> my lords on several occasions i have spoken on the theme of an appeal against refusal of legal aid <e> <s> i do not want to repeat what <e>", "<cs> my lords this situation can only arise when someone has been acquitted at the first trial and the court decides that something has gone wrong in the procedure and that he has to be tried a second time <e> <s> even if one is dealing with someone who could perhaps afford to be tried twice it is so unusual and unreal that it is appropriate that there should be automatic legal aid <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord wheatley pointed out at an earlier stage the situation only arises because the court system has gone wrong somewhere <e> <s> however in the light of the lord advocates assurances on behalf of the government i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot be as complimentary about this bill as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> on this side of the house we certainly accept that it is proper that legal aid in scotland should be run by a board which is independent and which is more representative of non-legal interests than of legal interests <e> <s> however there i fear we differ <e>", "<cs> i have difficulty in understanding the noble lord lord gray and i wonder whether he has ever lived in one of the cities <e> <s> where are the stone tenements in scotland built after <e> <s> there are plenty of council multi-storey flats and one can see why perhaps they have to be made specially attractive <e> <s> but the whole purpose of the governments proposal is to make flats more attractive so as to facilitate their sale and to make a distinction <e> <s> this amendment would remove from that distinction the flats which are already attractive which are the flats in the old tenement blocks which have been restored <e> <s> it does not appear to me that the noble lord has answered the point at all <e> <s> i certainly know of no tenement flats in the style of the pre- ones that have been built anywhere in scotland since then <e> <s> they are a completely different type of flat <e>", "<cs> it was a very long explanation but it was clear and i think that even i managed to understand it <e> <s> i am very much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> however as he explained so clearly the new powers to make regulations cover very much wider areas than the previous powers <e> <s> under the last few lines of subsection they cover powers making <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord is no doubt well aware if a potential purchaser thinks that a condition being imposed upon him is unreasonable he can go to the court or to the lands tribunal to get it put right <e> <s> it seems to me entirely unnecessary that the secretary of state should have to issue directions <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i can also add myself to those whom the noble lord lord gray considers cannot understand what is written surely the secretary of state is only interested or should only be interested in this matter in questions of principle which are in the public interest <e> <s> if something is not a question of principle and not in the public interest what special considerations are there which would justify the secretary of state doing anything <e>", "<cs> it is unsatisfactory legislation even if it is necessary <e> <s> what do you do if you are the employee of a housing association and you are told that you will get the sack if you comply with the order <e> <s> what sanction does the secretary of state have <e> <s> there is no penalty under the bill <e> <s> it is unusual to place an obligation on someone to obey the law when there is no penalty <e> <s> is the housing association or the individual to be fined <e> <s> we can deal with the local authority under the act but there is no penalty here <e> <s> the noble lord would be better to take away this clause and consider where it is leading <e>", "<cs> what happens if he is in default <e> <s> where is the penalty <e> <s> it is unfortunate that when the secretary of state has power to issue orders anyone in scotland can defy him because no penalty can be imposed <e> <s> it is odd legislation <e>", "<cs> i was hoping for an answer <e> <s> is there any penalty on the defaulting officer who is not employed by the local authority <e>", "<cs> it is always surprising but pleasant to have some sign of movement from the other side <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the best thing i can do is to withdraw these amendments at this stage and wait and see <e> <s> i must say that i think there are difficulties in the date of publication of the bill <e> <s> it may be that it should more properly be the date that the bill is passed because that might be more suitable <e>", "<cs> now that i have permission to do so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in adding my voice to those who extend a general welcome to this bill i wish to raise certain matters of purely scottish interest <e> <s> i also apologise to the house because another commitment will probably make it necessary that i cannot stay for the conclusion of the debate <e>", "<cs> in the hope that i might be described as a purist i support this amendment <e> <s> it seems essential that things that come under paragraph should not be under paragraph as well and <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the basic idea put forward by this amendment of the noble lords lord ezra and lord taylor as they explained it <e> <s> but i have considerable reservation about the form of wording especially the exception of residential property which could be a very valuable income-producing investment <e> <s> therefore i merely wish to give general support to the idea without any commitment to the wording <e>", "<cs> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> it would appear to me perhaps wrongly that there is a printing error in the last line of the amendment and that the second for should read or <e> <s> i assume that that is what is intended <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will be able to tell me because <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord hacking has said this is an important amendment <e> <s> it is an important area of the bill and it is important in our view on this side of the committee that any <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and as i seem to have been provided with the same information as the noble lord lord meston i merely refer also to the document and to section of the government of burma act of which i am sure the noble lord lord lucas is well aware <e> <s> this gave power for parliament to amend draft orders and i understand was used in that way <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords mechanical difficulties having prevented me arriving in time i might as well say something <e> <s> this amendment helps the situation mentioned at earlier stages <e> <s> it is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i asked for this amendment in committee i am very pleased to see that while i was not persuasive here i seem to have managed to persuade people in another place <e> <s> it is wholly to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak to the same amendments as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> if there has to be a reference to factors that may be in the interests of justice and a clause relating to the interests of justice it is better that it should be in the bill <e> <s> the factors listed in amendment no <e> <s> appear in general to be satisfactory <e> <s> the most satisfactory factor is the phrase shall include at the beginning <e> <s> that leaves it clear to the person or persons making the decision that there may be other factors <e>", "<cs> alpha might be better my lords <e>", "<cs> i have not checked with the companies act but i should be surprised if it is in the same wording <e> <s> it appears to us that this poor inspector is being directed to produce a written rather than a printed report <e> <s> does the minister really mean that <e> <s> the amendment provides <e>", "<cs> it may well be that the present lord advocate and any successor would suggest to the lord chancellor <e> <s> that may well happen i suspect that it would <e> <s> that does not necessarily take one far as the noble lord <e> <s> lord brabazon will no doubt appreciate <e> <s> the lord advocate can suggest but it is the lord chancellor who appoints <e> <s> all the lord chancellor need do is to consult <e> <s> there is no necessity to have anybody qualified in scots law on the tribunal <e> <s> this is a matter about which as the government are well aware the law society of scotland and others are very worried <e> <s> subject to reserving the right to come back at a later stage of the bill i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> subject to one correction i think that the noble lord is correct <e> <s> this point was discussed on wednesday when unfortunately i was not able to be present <e> <s> it was mentioned by my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> in the hope that the noble lord will look at this again i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> these amendments are linked to amendment no <e> <s> and therefore i do not propose to move them <e>", "<cs> that reply is not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> if i may put on my scottish hat rather than a party hat i would say that scotland is a separate jurisdiction and has a separate legal system and it should be recognised as such <e> <s> there are tendencies in this bill not to do so <e> <s> the government have made certain improvements as they have gone along but when by statute there is a registrar of companies in scotland i can see no reason why the government are so afraid of putting in the amendment i have suggested <e> <s> subject to the remark that i may come back to this at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> certainly i do not wish to divide on this amendment and so i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord williams of elvel said in relation to earlier new clauses on this side of the committee we have not had time to study in full these clauses in this difficult area or to have consultation with those interested in them <e> <s> therefore i intend to say nothing more than that we may come back on this at report stage <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord he seems to have completely misunderstood the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> the purpose is not to extend the effect but to give the secretary of state the power to do so if he thought it advisable and therefore avoid the necessity of amending legislation <e> <s> the secretary of state may by order means that he may do so in suitable circumstances <e> <s> it does not mean that he has to do so <e>", "<cs> i shall accept that hesitant reply <e> <s> on the understanding that i may return to the matter at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise the question of the construction of part iv of the bill <e> <s> it appears to <e>", "<cs> it appears that the chairman of the stock exchange to the surprise of others as well as myself takes much the same view as i endeavoured to put in relation to the whole of this part of the bill <e> <s> i support strongly the suggestion that this part should be taken away and thought out again <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause remains as a potential benefit for lawyers to which no doubt i should not object <e> <s> however the directive uses the word necessary <e> <s> one can

<e> <s> who will decide reasonableness <e> <s> why can the clause not say <e>", "<cs> i am in the same position as i was regarding earlier clauses and as my noble friend lord williams was on earlier clauses <e> <s> we have not had time to digest these amendments which appear as if they have been recently plucked up from a field and given to us <e> <s> they may be ready but we do not know <e> <s> subject to the right to come back to the matter at report stage i shall say nothing further <e>", "<cs> i accept that invitation <e> <s> i certainly welcome the amendment so far as it goes but whether it goes far enough i do not know <e> <s> i should like the opportunity of further study but there are other rules such as the rules about charges and various other things where particulars have to be registered with specific registrars <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if someone had to go from one registrar to another just at the choice of a particular company or issuer <e> <s> this may need looking at again <e>", "<cs> at second reading i raised the question of the definition of takeover which now appears in schedule which of course is sections <e>", "<cs> that would be very interesting if it were accurate <e> <s> section of the <e>", "<cs> the lord advocate who is the premier law officer in scotland controls the procurators fiscal but i am not sure that constitutionally that is right <e> <s> the procurator fiscal in his own area is entitled to raise his own prosecution unless there is an instruction of a certain type given by the lord advocate that he may not do so <e> <s> does the noble lord mean that the lord advocate will give an instruction <e> <s> if so would it not be better just to advertise the existence of scotland at least in clause and to say specifically that prosecutions in scotland are not to take place without the consent of the lord advocate <e> <s> if that is not objectionable to the government i should be perfectly prepared to withdraw the amendment and produce another at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged and subject to that proviso i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak in order to get more information which i am sure we shall get from the government on the legal question of where the onus of proof is to lie under subsection <e> <s> is a partner to have the onus of proving that he is ignorant or that he attempted to prevent the commission of the offence or is the prosecution to prove that he was not ignorant and did not attempt to prevent the offence <e> <s> it is a rather serious matter <e> <s> it is very important and it is far from clear <e>", "<cs> that is all very well but it does not say so in the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord will be fully aware it is quite incompetent

prosecution <e> <s> it could well be interpreted that that was a defence rather than a prosecution onus <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee if i misled it <e> <s> what i intended to say was that the difficulty could arise that conditions imposed and of course conditions could be imposed by the chief constable or in scotland by a judge as well as the chief constable on intended processions

no signs that i shall ever have to do so <e> <s> but i regret that his amendment the government amendment in my view continues the difficulty which was pointed out at committee and which does not

completely illogical when they said that there should be total immunity for the sib and sros but no immunity for rpbs <e> <s> our view has always been that there is a good case for an immunity on the lines of the immunity in this amendment for all three that they should be protected against those they control but that they should not be protected against the public <e> <s> that is in effect the amendment amendment no <e> <s> to which i shall be speaking some time later this evening <e> <s> however as it is already incorporated in this amendment i support it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the

leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am willing to bow to the ability of the draftsman to put in something which is probably of six lines rather than of three words <e> <s> i beg leave to

leave to withdraw the amendment and i thought that might satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his answer which i regret to say is wholly unconvincing <e> <s> i agree it has to cover instructions to the manufacturer of the component but it is surely also designed to cover the situation where the manufacturer of the total article which has the component in it issues instructions to the consumer which involve a misuse of the component <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i will beg leave to withdraw the amendment in the hope that perhaps the government may look at this again and perhaps the manufacturers of components may be able to persuade the government in this respect if i have been unable to do so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs>

withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> on these benches we have to oppose the amendment not with any purpose of saying that the amendment or the idea behind it is bad in itself but because the purpose of

for whom if anybody there will be a right under this directive <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is an appropriate time to ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to ask the opinion of the committee but loss and damage is one phrase which is used fairly frequently in the legal language at least of scotland <e> <s> i make no attempt to speak of england <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning was speaking of england and i am sorry to keep on putting up the flag of st andrew <e> <s> i have to do that and i have no intention of apologising for doing so <e> <s> the difficulty is that if one talks of a description of property ordinarily intended for private use and the directive talks of a type of property the courts first question will be why do you change the word <e> <s> if you change the word you must mean something different and what different do you mean <e> <s> if one talks about property it includes perhaps everything that is owned <e> <s> if one talks about item of property one is talking about an individual article and that is the wording in the directive <e>", "<cs> i take advantage of this procedure to raise two questions <e> <s> one is why in clause <e>", "<cs> the problem has arisen time and again in limitation and proscription legislation both in england and in scotland about continuing damage where one has pills or exposure to asbestos or exposure to something that gives you a disease <e> <s> that has caused continual trouble <e> <s> it would be reckless of me to say that the law has got it right yet but the collective mind

years <e> <s> however i shall leave that <e> <s> if i were in my private capacity instructed to appear for an insurance company and were to be instructed to defend a case where somebody who had used an article for some time had suffered loss or damage i should take the position with some strength under clause b that the article had been used and was therefore no longer intended to be used because intention implies in the way that subsection b is worded that one has to have an article <e>", "<cs> for that small favour i am very much obliged <e> <s> i formally move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly prepared to put forward the same amendment to clause at report stage <e> <s> this is an argument that if my recollection is right we had also on the financial services act <e> <s> it appears to me to be quite impossible to ask the prosecution to prove that somebody knows something is false if it cannot put the person into the witness box <e> <s> therefore this is a completely worthless provision because you cannot prove what is necessary <e>", "<cs> with respect the ministers answer shows the contempt for local authorities which has been expressed by the government throughout their exercise of power <e> <s> they are not interested <e>", "<cs> i am very willing to accept that and to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it points out the difficulty of keeping up with the way in which the government amend legislation in schedules to various bills <e>", "<cs> i have heard of returning to victorian values <e> <s> we are returning here to the deodand which is in a sense returning to dark ages value <e> <s> so be it if the government wish <e>", "<cs> i am not quite certain whether it was at second reading or during the committee stage of the drug trafficking offences bill as it then was that the noble lord lord hooson raised the question of the presumption of innocence <e> <s> certainly the possible effect of the convention on human rights was raised at that point though not in any great depth <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of opposing any of these amendments <e> <s> so far as one can follow them they appear to make the position clearer <e> <s> as a member of this place for but a short time may i suggest that it would have been clearer if the amendment had taken out clause and reprinted it <e> <s> one could then have looked through the marshalled list to see what the governments intention is <e> <s> it is difficult to find what the governments intention is from amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> i think that when the noble and learned lord the lord advocate reads what he has said he may realise he appeared to make some confusion between expenses and what we are concerned with here <e> <s> i merely pointed out that contrary to the english proceedings there is no way of paying the expenses of somebody who is acquitted <e> <s> that does not happen in scotland that is the difference <e>", "<cs> certainly the bill was supported by the party <e> <s> we are trying to apply it to scotland <e> <s> there are differences already in the bill which i have pointed out <e> <s> there are differences in the english procedure <e> <s> the one factor that may make a crucial difference after a long trial and an acquittal is that the english acquitted person gets his costs paid out of central funds <e> <s> that is one crucial difference <e>", "<cs> if he or she marries the accused there is no way one can force him or her to give evidence for the prosecution <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord of that <e>", "<cs> it is the other way round competent but not compellable <e>", "<cs> we are still awaiting the reason why the minister considers that the drug trafficking offences act which he steered through this chamber only some six months ago is so <e>", "<cs> from the experience that i have which i admit is short there have been occasions where each side of the committee has tried to have it both ways where necessary and to say this is done because it follows england or england is different from scotland <e> <s> i shall not take it further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear that the single judge sift and the two judge appeal for appeals against sentence have both been discarded <e> <s> i congratulate the government on their decision <e> <s> i am sure that is correct <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself with the remarks made by the noble and learned lord opposite <e> <s> i was not trying to suggest that sheriffs were going wrong <e> <s> what i was trying to suggest perhaps putting it in another way was that increasing the power to sentence to three years did not mean that parliament was suggesting that sheriffs had been too light in the past <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps what the noble lord could not read was not the information he was seeking <e> <s> if he goes back to his previous office he may have some recollection of discussions with the magistrates association and of the home office issuing guidlines intended for the magistrates <e> <s> if the minister is going to write to me that is the subject which i hope he will deal with and also how if at all the guidance is to be applied to scotland <e>", "<cs> on the other point i should have thought there is merit in the road traffic case <e> <s> there is no intention of doing a special measurement of damage but just making an award <e> <s> if a child is killed as a result of being knocked down by a drunken driver on a pedestrian crossing and the drivers circumstances are such that a prison sentence is inappropriate there may be cases where it is appropriate to make a compensation order of say or so <e> <s> however i am in no way suggesting that should take away from the civil courts jurisdiction or that it should be any precise measurement of the loss <e> <s> as the minister is going to consider this matter on the basis of receiving a report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i do so may i say that i should have mentioned that the noble and learned lord will no doubt want for his reading and consideration the eleventh report of the criminal law revision committee <e> <s> as it appears impossible to put in an act of parliament the decision of the court of criminal appeal in <e>", "<cs> it is interesting to hear what was provided to the noble lord to say <e> <s> i remind him that a community service order is a sentence <e> <s> there is already power in the legislation to combine a probation order with a community service order so under the present law it is quite possible to have a probation order and a community service order <e> <s> the community service order is a sentence <e> <s> it is difficult to see why a compensation order is so very different in terms of non-compliance from a community service order <e> <s> however if the government are looking at the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was precisely because i did not intend that art and part guilt of statutory offences should be abolished that the amendment is drafted in this way <e> <s> in other words it follows a subsection which says precisely that there is art and part guilt in statutory offences <e> <s> however in the light of a response which is rather more encouraging than i have been <e>", "<cs> before i do so i should ask the noble lord this <e> <s> if he is right and finds that the court already has this power will he write and tell me what and where it is <e> <s> subject to that i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if whichever noble lord is dealing with this will tell us where we can find the criminal justice scotland act which is referred to throughout the clause <e> <s> if it is intended to be this bill it is now and no doubt at the next stage of the bill the alteration can be made <e> <s> i did not wish to table a series of amendments to change the date if i was wrong but i

around that all someone who pretends to be an enforcement officer can be penalized <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is always interesting for two scots to be discussing possible amendments to english law <e>", "<cs> certainly on that undertaking and awaiting eagerly an explanation as to why in the second part of the schedule there is no reference to

will not come back withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his answers <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i heard

the amendment <e> <s> however before doing so perhaps i can bring to the attention of the noble and learned lord the difficulty that arises if there is the same provision in sections and of the act

that the government made in bringing this bill forward and the lack of thought and cohesion <e> <s> we have in clause a definition clause that deals with part i and we have in clause a definition clause that deals with the bill altogether <e> <s> there is no difference between the two sets of definitions <e> <s> there is no purpose in having clause <e> <s> it is just shoddy draftsmanship to have this at all <e> <s> where we have definitions that reappear in clause they are identical to those in clause <e> <s> clause includes definitions that are not in clause and the converse applies <e>", "<cs> it depends on for whom it is sensible <e> <s> it is perhaps very sensible for parliamentary draftsmen it is perhaps very sensible for government departments <e> <s> but surely the purpose of bills which become acts is that they should be sensible and easily understood by the public <e> <s> it is much easier for anyone who is trying to find out what a bill is talking about if there is one interpretation clause <e> <s> there is nothing difficult about saying that the valuation acts in part i mean such-and-such and putting that into clause <e> <s> it is ludicrous to have two interpretation clauses <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gray pointed out in part i year means the financial year of a local authority <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister will no doubt appreciate any court will therefore assume that year means something different in part ii onwards <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> the point that i am trying to get over is this <e> <s> one is legislating not for the sake of government departments or parliamentary draftsmen but so that the public can understand what one is doing <e> <s> for that reason the language should be simple and easily understood <e> <s> this is the factor that parliamentary draftsmen seem to forget <e> <s> secondly if possible there should be one definition clause not a sort of concatination of different definition clauses <e> <s> there is no reason why the definition clause should not be totally in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the argument <e> <s> however i cannot see why one could not say in clause that <e>", "<cs> there are a number of people apart from the late sheriff of kilmarnock who <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i never suggested that there was a need to have it <e> <s> i suggested that there was no need to have it <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the definition that has just been quoted which does not appear in the bill but in the notes on clauses which only certain of us possess refers only to the personss sole or main place of residence that is rooms in a hotel used by a manager as his living quarters <e> <s> that is fine in regard to the manager but what about the guest who uses the hotel and has done so for or years as his living quarters <e> <s> is that to be a part residential subject <e> <s> no one seems to know the answer <e> <s> certainly the minister has avoided giving an answer for the past few minutes <e> <s> no doubt he is waiting for assistance and here it comes <e>", "<cs> that is acceptable provided it is not just correspondence with me but with others who are interested and that it is made available in the library <e>", "<cs> surely as the same man is to run both registers he will tell himself that some year-old is on the voters roll and therefore may be liable to pay the personal community charge and the year-old will just disappear and therefore will not be on the voters roll <e>", "<cs> it costs rather less to go from edinburgh to newcastle or even to berwick than it does to pay the community charge estimated at <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the answer seems to be wholly unsatisfactory <e> <s> so far as i can follow the arithmetic the total extra cost of putting this into operation is supposed to be about million <e> <s> there is no estimate of the additional cost for collection and recovery which is in the second part of the amendment <e> <s> there is i should have thought no doubt that there must be considerably increased costs of trying to recover this from people if you doubled the number of people <e> <s> it seems logical that your costs of trying to recover it will be higher <e> <s> no estimate has been given and it would be very interesting to hear what the estimate is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is the last of the amendments in this group <e> <s> also i wholly support amendment no <e> <s> which has been moved by members of the committee who are no longer in the chamber <e> <s> it appears to be the mood of the committee that students should be treated differently <e> <s> it is also quite clearly ridiculous that the government should pay money to students to enable them to pay out money <e> <s> what is even more ridiculous if the situation is as i understand it is the intention of the government to pay them per cent <e> <s> so that they have to pay an extra per cent <e>", "<cs> will the minister explain a point which i have failed to understand <e> <s> the purpose of the poll charge and the purpose of students paying it is apparently accountability <e> <s> therefore they vote for the party that they decide to support <e> <s> how is that relevant in the amendments we are discussing which deal with overseas students <e> <s> they have no accountability they cannot vote <e> <s> they must pay and of course they must pay either rates under the present system or a community charge but accountability does not exist for them <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that the only people entitled to vote who are not british subjects are subjects of the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> as the minister dealt with apportionment in relation to residences in our debate on tuesday we were then dealing with a building part of which was normally non-residential and part of which was used as a residence such as the owners or managers flat in a hotel <e> <s> it does not appear to me and no doubt the minister will tell my why i am wrong that anything in the apportionment schedule covers a whole building such as a residence which is used for part of the year as a residence and for part of the year as a commercial subject <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to continue to intervene <e> <s> does that mean that for the years until the community charge comes in in england and wales if it ever does the health boards will be enabled to pay their trainee nurses more to enable them to compensate so that they can attract nurses <e> <s> otherwise the nurses who would be trained in edinburgh will go to be trained in newcastle <e>", "<cs> the minister does not seem to see that if one puts a community charge on nurses in scotland where there is none in england the nurses in scotland will leave and go to england <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for his answer but with respect he does not appear to have seen the difficulty <e> <s> the words solely or mainly resident say nothing whatever about the home and that is what i endeavoured to get through <e> <s> the words in the bill do not carry this connotation of domicile which seemed to be in the reply of the minister when he spoke about the person who lived in a flat in the town and went back for weekends to his home in the country where his family lived <e> <s> his home in the country would be where he was solely or mainly resident <e> <s> i should have thought that the word resident means where he resides <e> <s> it is a neutral word <e> <s> it is a question of fact and not a question of intention <e> <s> i can say that my home is in edinburgh even though i am out of edinburgh for years at a time <e> <s> in that sense my home is in edinburgh <e>", "<cs> certainly for that purpose it is unfortunate to quote an english case in connection with a purely scottish bill <e> <s> there may be some scottish authority but i have not looked for it <e> <s> i should have thought that the question of residence of students for voting purposes is not very helpful <e>", "<cs> i am certainly aware that democracy prevails <e> <s> fortunately for scotland it has prevailed with far greater sense at least at local authority level than it seems to do in the other place at the moment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord stodart is right about the capital gains tax provision but i am not in any sense knowledgeable on tax law <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the minister that in the scottish case of students residing it was decided that they could vote either at their home or where they resided at the university they attended <e> <s> so they could legally be on both registers and choose where to vote <e> <s> no doubt they voted as it suited them but they were on two registers say stirling and ayrshire or something like that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his careful explanation <e> <s> it appears that what is being done is an example as the noble and learned lord lord wilson said just now of a bureaucratic nightmare <e> <s> we have the usual thing <e> <s> there is a liability on the citizen until the name comes off the register <e> <s> the registration officer is given discretion to take it off and can do so retrospectively <e> <s> but if the citizen fails to tell the registration officer where he goes lie has to pay a penalty <e> <s> he has to pay everything back under clause <e>", "<cs> this amendment throws up another example of the gross unfairness of this whole proposal of the poll tax and the difficulties that exist for ministers of religion hotel staffs hotels tied cottages and others <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that at the moment nothing in amendment no <e> <s> is against the law <e> <s> any payment of a community charge in these circumstances would possibly be regarded as a legitimate business expense <e> <s> the difficulty is whether it would be allowable as a business expense from the point of view of the inland revenue <e> <s> it has nothing to do with being legitimate or illegitimate <e> <s> it is a perfectly legitimate business expense <e> <s> the question is whether it will be slung on to the employee as a benefit in kind upon which he has to pay tax <e> <s> the second difficulty about this is that it is not restricted to any group of people it is general to any employment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i only brought in the city of london because of the governments repeated assertion that they intend to bring this in in england <e> <s> i do not believe that assertion any more than the noble and learned lord lord wilson <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that but as the amendments are in the same group i am speaking to them together <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will give way <e> <s> that may be all very well but the difficulty remains <e> <s> the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> lord campbell of alloway was that the phrase unmarried couple does not come into the question at all nor is it stated that the couple have to be of different sexes <e> <s> it is possible to foresee that a couple might be living together as if they were man and wife when they were not capable of being that <e>", "<cs> there is another problem as to hen the living together ceases <e> <s> is it for the registration officer to prove when he is trying to establish joint and several liability the date the living together ceased <e> <s> or is it for the defender or the person responsible <e> <s> let us think for a moment of a university <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway or i or the two of us jointly and severally or severally could find some method of making it clear that we were talking about one female and one male <e> <s> that is not clear in clause b <e> <s> however <e> <s> if i have followed the noble and learned lord correctly i fail to understand the other point that both people would be sued jointly and severally <e> <s> as regards joint and several liability i thought that one picked which one may be worth powder and shot to sue and that in no way did one have to sue them all <e> <s> unless my understanding of joint and several has been wrong for the last -odd years i would foresee the situation that it is the wageearner who will be sued who will then say oh but i ceased to live with my bidey-in six months ago <e> <s> then presumably the registration officer has to produce evidence to prove whether or not that is true <e> <s> it seems to be a most extraordinary procedure <e>", "<cs> i shall not ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is very late at night and i do not wish to delay the committee but there is one point that the noble and learned lord raised which requires attention <e> <s> he said that evidence accepted by a social security appeal tribunal that a couple were living together would be evidence acceptable to a sheriff <e> <s> there is a difficulty there <e> <s> i can see that the evidence might be acceptable to a sheriff but if the finding of the social security appeal tribunal were binding on the sheriff all sorts of difficult issues would be raised <e>", "<cs> that is all very well <e> <s> although i am far from satisfied with the answer i think that the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour has a good point on the issue of the married womans tax and the way legislation is moving and mainly because of the lateness of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very willing to withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise one practical point <e> <s> will students be given a certificate that they are full-time students <e> <s> if not how will the person responsible for collecting the community charge know that someone who is staying a night is a student and therefore does not pay the charge or is not a student and therefore should pay the charge <e>", "<cs> the minister does not seem to have seen the point of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i might be allowed to try to clarify it <e> <s> there are certain people who are paid and supplied with a house in which they have to live for example ministers of religion lighthouse keepers police officers prison officers and others <e> <s> those people are suddenly going to be told you and your wife have to pay a personal community charge <e> <s> does the minister expect that all the negotiations for pay and other matters which are planned for scotland from st april will be settled so that those peoples pay will be readjusted to take account of the fact that although previously they had been living in accommodation for which they did not pay rates in the future they will have to pay this personal community charge <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble viscount is mistaken <e> <s> i hope that a private in the army is not paid so little that he would benefit from the rebate system and i hope that anyone higher than a private would certainly be outside the scheme <e> <s> however someone posted from england to scotland must pay per week more in scotland than in england and that is the basic problem for the forces <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that a tax to use a neutral word which is payable under subection a in respect of the ownership of premises is a property tax however it is measured whether by value or by a multiplier <e> <s> it is still a property tax <e> <s> nothing that the minister said suggests to me that i am wrong about that <e> <s> therefore this is a matter on which we should divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i shall not try to answer the noble lord lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> i do not think it is up to me to explain what this bill means <e> <s> i am in as much of a fog as the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that the prescription covers what he talked about because of what was said by ministers in another place at the committee stage <e> <s> they said if i followed their remarks rightly that if somebody bought a house which was in a state of dilapidation and had two houses for a period while doing up the second one that person would have to pay the standard community charge after the period of three months which is applicable in clause <e> <s> that is my understanding <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the noble lord lord monkswell was entirely wrong <e> <s> it seems to me that he was entirely right <e> <s> we should remember the kind of situation that has happened recently in aberdeen about which we have all read <e> <s> people there tried to sell their houses in order to move away but they had difficulty in selling them <e> <s> they have a three-month period when they move away during the time that the house is empty but after that time they will have to pay the second charge the standard community charge unless the house is uninhabitable <e> <s> what bigger incentive to render an empty house uninhabitable can there possibly be <e> <s> that situation will arise in any number of cases <e>", "<cs> i assure the minister that at least historically there were plenty of cases where roofs were taken off houses in order to remove them from rating <e> <s> if the minister is not aware of that he is not aware of a fairly significant part of scottish history <e>", "<cs> he said that he was aware of it <e>", "<cs> i wish to draw the ministers attention to amendment no <e> <s> a which is aimed at that point and to which we shall come in about two pages <e> <s> it aims to give the local authorities discretion over the three-month period <e> <s> that may be a matter at which the minister will also look <e> <s> i hope that he will also look at the problem of someone who owns a house in one of the holiday areas such as the mull of kintyre on the west coast who at times lets it at times allows members of his family to use it and at times uses it himself <e> <s> it is difficult to decide whether that is to be liable to commercial or standard community charge <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i shall continue my sentence and ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> my point was not so much the continuity of the period but the fact that there is nothing in clauses and which gives any obligation for anybody to tell the registration officer <e> <s> obviously the registration officer is the person who has to know <e> <s> i shall be very pleased to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> as these amendments have already been dealt with perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i suggested that i do not move amendments nos <e> <s> to including amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i could simply say ditto <e> <s> it appears to me totally reprehensible that people with very large houses with very large estates for which they require considerable local authority services should be asked to pay exactly the same as people who have a small but-and-ben <e> <s> it seems totally reprehensible and the most regressive part of a very regressive piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> some of the places without services are places occupied by crofters who are working <e> <s> they do not have to pay the standard community charge <e> <s> whether they are old-age pensioners or whatever they have to pay the personal charge <e> <s> they receive no services in such places without roads on the western side of harris or lewis <e>", "<cs> everything that they buy in the outer islands or in the inner islands or in most places in the highlands is considerably more expensive than in the cities <e> <s> your lordships house decided in the judicial committee that for that reason they were not entitled to any higher rate of dhss benefit <e> <s> in places such as tyrie or coll or colonsay they will be asked to pay exactly the same regional personal community charge as if they lived in an unflooded house in bearsden <e> <s> on this side of the chamber we think that is totally unfair <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lord referred to amendment no <e> <s> which i do not think is included in this group <e> <s> i think that he meant to refer to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is in the names of my noble friend lord ross of marnock and myself <e> <s> i did not understand it to be in this group <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and not no <e> <s> a i shall continue my argument in favour of amendment no <e> <s> but i hope not at this stage <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord mentioned amendment no <e> <s> which is why i got to my feet <e> <s> if it is not in the group i shall sit down again quickly <e>", "<cs> i was going to ask this <e> <s> how does the person in charge of the collective community establishment know whether somebody is liable to pay a personal community charge <e> <s> is it just because some character turns up and says i have been thrown out of the house by my spouse <e> <s> i need a bed for the night <e> <s> i am registered to pay a personal community charge and therefore i do not need to pay my collective community charge contribution for the night <e> <s> alternatively is somebody to give him a certificate showing that he is registered for the personal community charge somewhere in scotland or is the housekeeper of the establishment to keep a register of the whole of scotland showing who is liable to pay a personal community charge and where <e> <s> how is one to know whether somebody who turns up at night for a bed at somewhere such as the great eastern hotel in glasgow is liable to pay a personal community charge or has paid it <e>", "<cs> the noble lords answer implies that everybody in charge of a homeless persons establishment has a complete register of people who pay the personal charge throughout scotland <e> <s> it also implies that at or oclock at night he has the ability to check whether somebody who may not be totally sober at the time he turns up for a bed is giving the right address and whether he has paid the personal community charge before he knows whether he is liable to charge him that night for his th personal community charge <e> <s> it seems to me to be a ludicrous system and i do not understand how it is supposed to work <e>", "<cs> with all respect will the minister look at subsection <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> on the understanding that my english is going to be improved by the government that is something i shall look forward to seeing <e> <s> i thought it was fairly clear that what i meant was that the person to whom the repayment was due had to claim it back within three months <e> <s> if that is not clear i shall be delighted to see how the government in six lines can make it clearer <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i have not sat down by begging leave to withdraw this amendment if i may i should like to say to the noble lord lord renton that we are dealing with so to speak one nights community charge which is one three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth of say <e> <s> the landlord if that is the right word will have paid that at some point to the local authority probably monthly <e> <s> there is a good deal of bookkeeping involved <e> <s> if at the end of three years which is the normal limit of civil liability there is a liability to repay i should have thought it could become far too complicated <e> <s> however i again beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from his previous ministerial responsibility the minister may recollect the habit of police statements in england giving the date of birth of people if they are under but if they are or over they just say over <e> <s> i should have thought that or something similar is the answer <e>", "<cs> in the electoral register we can have any number of john smiths <e> <s> we should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to speak only on the provisions relating to the criminal injuries compensation board but my first duty is to congratulate my noble friend lord irvine of lairg on his excellent speech <e> <s> it is a great pleasure to welcome another scot to this side of the house and especially one who had the good sense to graduate from glasgow university <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the answer foreseeable and disappointing <e> <s> it appears that the minister has no confidence as to who might be the secretary of state by the time comes around because if we were to give this power to the secretary of state he might appoint a later date <e> <s> that is very encouraging for this side but it is odd to hear the minister putting that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the idea of a referendum should meet with the noble baronesss disapproval because it would he too complicated when one considers that there was a devolution bill involving a referendum which was certainly as complicated as the rates bill <e> <s> i have not looked it up but i should be interested to know and i shall no doubt be told at some point whether the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter voted in favour or against the referendum on devolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of any opposition i think that it would be superfluous to say anything other than that i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always pleasant to see the government accept suggestions coming from other places <e> <s> both the noble lord lord gray and myself made the proposition that it was ridiculous to have two definition clauses quite apart from having other definitions spattered about like stray currants at various places in the bill <e> <s> it is better to have one definition and i welcome the change <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider the point of the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden <e> <s> i believe that it was that one cannot achieve harmonisation without prior legislation <e> <s> i believe that that is a point on which i and the noble lord would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords this batch of amendments and i hope we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and illustrates the difficulty that is being caused because according to these amendments at some time in the future say in the year the assessor will have to go back to the system that has been abolished <e> <s> he will have to assess what would be the net or gross annual value of various house properties domestic subjects apportion them between the ones in the same tenement or adjoining properties or whatever and adopt exactly the same procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to get into the procedural mess i should add my voice to those who say that obviously an unfairness exists <e> <s> with all possible respect to the government it illustrates the fact that they have not thought this bill through far enough <e> <s> not only are there the tied cottage situations and a change which will inevitably mean a change in the way farm workers are paid but it also as the noble lady lady saltoun said affects the question of charities churches and the rest of them <e> <s> it will put on to these charitable organisations a very considerable burden in trying to get people to do jobs for the charities or to be ministers in the churches which will as a result of this suffer a considerable loss in disposable income <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards that explanation which i understand does it not illustrate a need at least for a transitional arrangement until and unless perhaps that is the order of the words a similar english system arrives <e> <s> in that event someone employed on a farm in berwickshire will be very keen to obtain employment on a farm in northumberland because he will be very much better off <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to that proposal there is no suggestion that the english bill will come into effect at the same time as the scottish bill <e> <s> we voted against that on tuesday <e> <s> the bill is to come into effect in scotland at least a couple of years before it can come into effect in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether your lordships will allow me to deal with that amendment and then go back to amendment no <e> <s> and the other amendments in this group <e> <s> this amendment improves to some extent the position from the point of view of students <e> <s> the only difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i gave that impression <e> <s> it was not the impression i intended to give <e> <s> what i intended to make clear was that while there is one system in england and a different system in scotland <e> <s> one has to have something that compensates for any loss that the scottish situation therefore has <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the whole business of personal charges was to depend on where people were solely or mainly resident <e> <s> if someone is solely or mainly resident outside scotland my idea was and perhaps i misunderstood the bill totally that they did not have to pay scottish community charges <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add to that <e> <s> my understanding is that third reading is due to take place on th may which is not all that far away <e> <s> if we are to have a threat that at some point presumably next week an amendment will be put forward to give the registration officer power to go into records kept by universities and other colleges this is a matter about which the universities and colleges have not heard <e> <s> all kinds of questions of privacy and confidentiality may be involved <e> <s> it would require more consultation than could possibly be done in days <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord was no doubt well founded in pointing out some difficulties about can elect to in amendment no <e> <s> a and if they so agree in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however what will happen if the census-taker going around is not having much difficulty with people who are in fact married but when he asks johnny are you living with jeannie as man <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously fair that people who are suffering from severe mental handicap should be excused from paying quite apart from any other people who should be excused <e> <s> we on this side fully accept that <e> <s> however there are various difficulties that i foresee and perhaps the minister will clarify them <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i am sorry if i sounded grudging <e> <s> last week i was accused of being one of a class who had no sense of humour <e> <s> i seem to be having a rough time <e> <s> i did not mean to be grudging i meant to accept this fully and wholly and welcome it as broadly as i could <e> <s> i am sorry if i have given the wrong impression <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it is not an easier way just to say that the person suffering from the severe incapacity has to have produced for him a medical certificate and the registrar operates on a medical certificate <e> <s> that is something that in severe mental illness severe mental impairment and severe mental incapacity the mental health act has been telling us about for years not only the act but all its predecessors <e> <s> why not just work on the same certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it would be easier to put it back in something like the words of clause in which it is quite clear that the person has to pay the community charge to the authority in whose area he is resident <e> <s> that is quite a simple concept <e> <s> one could reword this clause to make it fairly clear that it meant the same whether there were one local authority for that area or two <e> <s> that is surely the point <e>", "<cs> its the crocodile <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made it perfectly clear that we are dealing with the same multiplier one or two or anywhere between whether it is for something of the size of inveraray castle or a room and kitchen cottage in inveraray <e> <s> both are assumed to be used as a second home <e> <s> the allegation made by the noble lord is that they use the services equally <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have not been here very long i learnt long ago that even if one proposed an amendment that was acceptable in principle to the government it was necessary that the government reword it in some way or another <e> <s> that basic rule is inflexible <e> <s> of course i accept that the governments word must always be better it is the natural rule of things and that any amendment suggested by any other peer must always be worse <e> <s> again that is the natural rule <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gray no doubt knows what this is about but he is not here <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl lord dundee can explain to those of us who are here what it is about <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the explanation i thought i heard the noble earl lord dundee say that part residential subjects meant part in the sense of a physical part rather than a time part that was used for residence <e> <s> that seems to be inconsistent with the position of university residences <e> <s> his noble friend the minister told us about university residences which are used during term time as residences and during vacations for commercial holiday or conference purposes where one took the part to be a time part rather than a physical part <e> <s> it seems to me that the two explanations in so far as i understood them were inconsistent <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl can clear that up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to accept it <e> <s> this is the usual situation <e> <s> i tried to put the amendment into two lines but the government draftsman managed it in nine lines <e> <s> no doubt nine lines are far clearer shorter and easily understood <e> <s> however i am perfectly prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has mentioned amendment no <e> <s> is in my name <e> <s> the reason for that figure being put in is that as i understand it is the general practice with the electoral register that one has the date of birth only for somebody who becomes during the year <e> <s> it was to take that into account <e> <s> if the electoral register has for example two john smiths living in the same house father and son perhaps and no difficulty is encountered in working out which one is voting i cannot see that it will cause insuperable difficulty for the registrar of community charges who might even think of putting junior after the younger one if he is thinking hard <e>", "<cs> my lords it was very interesting to discuss subsections a and b which my amendment did not intend to alter in any way at all <e> <s> i have no objection to those otherwise there would have been an amendment down <e> <s> the difficulty is subsection c which talks about designating first of all <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens if the registration officer says this is a reasonable excuse and the levying authority says no it is not <e> <s> does the levying authority then put in a surcharge although the registration officer says well this is a reasonable excuse or even this was my mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that as this session has a certain period of time to run this matter could have been got right <e> <s> it could have been got right with little trouble over the easter recess <e> <s> the government have had some experience of drafting these clauses because they took what i think the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter referred to as section of the act i think it is the act in or and altered it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak about the scottish question following the general election result <e> <s> we have heard two able speeches today by the noble earl lord perth and by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> i agree with much of what they said <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the new minister the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden <e> <s> i hope that he will have a happy time in his new office though i rather doubt it <e>", "<cs> it is with considerable diffidence that a scottish lawyer gets up at this point from these benches <e> <s> however having heard the references to the late lord reid and the scottish position i should like first of all to say that i wholly support the remarks of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i should like to pray in aid the amendment to the scottish legislation which was carried through by the then lord advocate who may have a further influence on the government the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern in the criminal justice scotland act because the amendments which are now sections and of the criminal procedure scotland act were brought in as complete clauses replacing the old sections thus giving parliament a full picture of what was being achieved <e>", "<cs> in our view amendment no <e> <s> should not be accepted but amendment no <e> <s> should <e> <s> there should be a right of appeal against the recommendation but we are not yet discussing that <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i was not suggesting that <e> <s> i was suggesting that the power to make a recommendation should be there in the circumstances in which a life sentence was pronounced in non-murder cases <e>", "<cs> in replying the minister will no doubt consider that in this government gave such a right of appeal to scottish cases with a recommendation <e> <s> it seems slightly illogical that there should be that right of appeal in scotland but not in england and wales <e> <s> i fully agree with what was said by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in respect of private recommendations <e>", "<cs> we support the thinking behind this amendment <e> <s> to deal with the last point of the noble lord lord renton on this side we supported the provisions relating to hospitals but we certainly had no idea that in doing so we were supporting the privatisation of hospitals and i do not think anyone would have suggested that <e> <s> surely the way to deal with this is for the relevant inspectors who inspect restaurants and any other establishment to be the people to inspect and enforce the standard <e> <s> i should have thought it would be that way of enforcement rather than letters to mps or others though no doubt all such letters will continue as they always have done and i suspect always will <e> <s> surely it is necessary that the standard should be there if for nobody else at least for the prison staff who among others deserve to be protected from salmonella <e> <s> therefore i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> this side of the committee has no objections to the amendments but

expected to discover be a subjective standard <e>", "<cs> in view of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that this is a matter in which there is a lack of understanding between the different sides of the committee <e> <s> for example the position may be that someone with a very long list of convictions for crimes of violence who sustains a broken nose will not get an award whether or not he was an innocent victim <e> <s> there is no point in insisting on a board hearing

have not done that up until now because we have waited for the trial unless there has been an outstanding warrant and the offender has not been caught <e>", "<cs> i find the argument of the noble and learned lord rather unsatisfactory <e> <s> the total administrative expense of the board which includes every cost is about per cent <e> <s> of its total cost <e> <s> it is not a board that is running away with costs of administration as is the court system <e> <s> it is a board for which the administrative cost is very low <e> <s> it seems a great meanness <e>", "<cs> the real trouble is the word essential essential for what <e> <s> what is it to be essential to the life of the applicant the good temper of the applicant or what <e> <s> essential is a very difficult word to ask the board to interpret in these circumstances <e> <s> if you are dealing with plastic surgery or the ability to breathe properly through ones nose and these are the types of cases which arise most frequently it is very difficult to see how essential really helps us <e> <s> it is not essential for the life of anybody that she should have a four-inch scar removed from her face but it makes a difference <e> <s> how much of a difference becomes essential is the real issue and it really will not do for parliament to leave the board with a completely unanswerable question and expect it to make sense of it <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e> <s> it may be that if the view of a lord chancellor who is perhaps not wholly inimical to scotland prevailed the sort of drafting that takes place on lines and would not occur so often <e> <s> moreover i wish also to bring to the noble and learned lords attention the fact that in may of this year we were in aberdeenshire dealing with an accident which had unfortunately occurred off shetland when a helicopter had fallen into the sea <e> <s> if that had been a crime as the bill is drafted english law would have applied to those fatalities <e> <s> that must be totally wrong <e> <s> i am very glad to see that aspect is to be looked at again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is another occasion on which there are many members of your lordships committee whose views would have been of great value on a matter such as this but who due to the lateness of the hour cannot be here <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of those who have social work experience and expertise <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in the hope that i may return to it at a more convenient hour at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about these amendments is that if one leaves out sub-paragraph one then has sub-paragraph standing by itself and applying the fatal accidents act to unspecified cases <e> <s> then when one comes to a similar amendment in paragraph one gets the same thing applying the damages scotland act <e> <s> i am not at all certain that this really puts the matter clearly from the point of view of the public <e>", "<cs> i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having heard the noble and learned lords argument i find it difficult to accept <e> <s> the only real comment from the public about the inadequacies of the boards actions came in respect of <e>", "<cs> this amendment turns round the drafting of clause and i would have no objection to it <e> <s> however i remain baffled as to why it is thought that the offences in subsection are not offences which require proof of intent to cause death or personal injury or recklessness <e> <s> one would have thought that that naturally applies to rape or to any offence of causing bodily harm to arson to offences which cause personal injury under the explosive substances act and under the firearms act and the same to riot and affray <e> <s> it seems to me that subsection is completely otiose and unnecessary but i suppose there is no difficulty in saying everything twice <e>", "<cs> in considering the matter the government are taking into account the views expressed by lord justice lawton when he said that the board will be able to recognise a crime of violence when they hear about it even though it is difficult to provide a definition which is not too narrow or too wide <e> <s> that is an english lawyers approach to the matter which has i should have thought a great deal of common sense <e> <s> once one tries to define a matter too far one then gets into difficulties <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting and rather longer dicussion on this than i had thought was intended <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support that i received from the noble lord lord irvine of lairg <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble and learned lord opposite did not seem to take the point that part of the intention of this amendment was to restrict the cases to certain types of event <e> <s> i was also disappointed that he said that suicide should not be used in scotland <e> <s> i agree it should not

firearms which i was endeavouring to make <e> <s> i will try to put it again very simply <e>", "<cs> there is a basic attraction in having the scheme set out in an order <e> <s> but the difficulty about that if i understand the procedure of your lordships house correctly is that there will be no opportunity to amend the order or to persuade the government to put in amendments <e> <s> this sort of discussion would therefore be impossible <e>", "<cs> i accept that this amendment goes some way <e> <s> however if one adds it as printed at the end of line it becomes part of paragraph e which seems to be wrong <e> <s> i should have thought it should be either paragraph f or a proviso or something else <e> <s> also it does not appear to cover the problem about the ships and whether a ship is to be regarded as scottish english or welsh <e> <s> that can make a crucial difference to the assessment of damages especially if the assault takes place outside territorial waters <e>", "<cs> with that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the support that i have had from noble lords and especially from the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> if the government do not consider that this clause in the scheme would cause difficulty then the members of the board of whom i am one have not managed to get our point across <e> <s> it causes tremendous difficulty as to what is to be exceptional for one thing on the points mentioned by my noble friend lord irvine of lairg but what is unfortunate in my view is that we have not dealt at all with the

has heard the decision has then to find somebody to advise him whether it is wrong in law <e>", "<cs> my lords my first duty is to express regret that a family bereavement has prevented my noble friend lord williams of elvel from taking part in todays debate and to assure the house that he will be taking a full and active part at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the position and the report of the committee is not finalised in time i trust that the government will allow these clauses to be recommitted <e> <s> it is very unfortunate it happened in the financial services bill if the government produce a large number of amendments to new clauses at a very late stage in the bill <e> <s> it destroys any purpose of having the bill properly discussed <e>", "<cs>

accidentally become my amendment perhaps i should reply <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble and learned lord has managed in a sense to change the question from whether a life sentence is necessarily appropriate for a conviction for murder to whether there should be a radical look at the whole offence of murder and the offence of culpable homicide <e> <s> as i understand it although in committee we discussed the broader question the amendment is purely on the issue of whether it is appropriate that all people properly convicted of murder should receive a life sentence <e> <s> i remind your lordships that among others in committee the noble and learned lord lord roskill was very clearly of the view that this caused considerable difficulty in his experience as a judge <e> <s> i should have thought that if we are to have a general review it may be encouraged by your lordships house voting in favour of the amendment <e> <s> therefore i think it is appropriate that the views of your

understand why the commissioning proposal is out of clause <e>", "<cs> this amendment is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> which is in my name along with my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones

the road-making will be better carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by the reply but it makes clear the government view <e> <s> apparently if a young lady has a scar across her face which can be cured by plastic surgery but with which she can exist on a two- or three-year national health service waiting list it is not essential that she should have that treatment <e> <s> she should wait with the scar <e> <s> i think that the appropriate word is requisite but at this time of night i shall not press this necessary amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord willis mentioned the common market but surely the answer is that there should be a common period throughout the community for the purposes of harmonisation <e> <s> can the minister say when it is likely that there will be harmonisation on this issue <e>", "<cs> is not the position that spain has a term of years france years austria years italy years belgium years and germany years <e> <s> the minister did not appear to answer my question which was when do the government expect harmonisation on the different figures within the ec <e>", "<cs> we strongly support the idea behind the amendment of the noble lord lord brain that we are now discussing <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> tabled in the name of my noble friend lord williams and myself has exactly the same intention and it does not perhaps matter whether it has the same wording <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the words of the noble lord lord brain and should like to draw attention to a different aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord somers seems to have misunderstood the intention of the amendment <e> <s> the intention is not to omit performance but to add sale or distribution <e> <s> it is my understanding that many musical works are now performed without there being any writing in manuscript <e> <s> having heard what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment

has been referred to clause which deals with something that is not an artistic work <e> <s> clause begins <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and i think it is intended that we should also deal with amendment <e> <s> the difficulty here is to know what is a copy <e> <s> if one takes a photograph or an artist takes a photograph then somebody else who knows something about photography can say that photograph was taken at a certain time of day in a certain area of sunlight or shadow <e> <s> therefore i can repeat that picture by going for example at oclock in the morning if the light is the same <e> <s> does that then constitute a copy <e> <s> is that a copy which is not protected <e> <s> if so why is it not protected <e> <s> it seems to me that that would be a straight copy that type of thing which one would recognise as being a copy as an infringing copy apart from this subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may come in here so that i do not have to deal with amendment no because sound recording raises certain aspects other than photography <e> <s> it involves things like phrasing and timing interpretation and copying from one sound recording to another and may be even more clear than photography <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment it occurs to me that producing a still photograph from would not cover the situation of taking a small part of the still photograph and making that the copy <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting comment <e> <s> it may well be significant whether a matter is substantial or recognisable <e> <s> rather than test the opinion of the committee i shall consider what has been said <e> <s> i should have thought that there is something to be said for making this bill understandable to people who are not active

opinion of the committee i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is interesting but again i should have thought that there is something to be said for converting this clause of the bill

little hope at the moment that statutes could be understood by the ordinary citizen <e> <s> why not make it perfectly clear if my amendment does not suit and put in by means of pictures or otherwise

britain just allows people to export an infringing copy into a country which is covered by the convention <e> <s> i shall read what the noble lord has said and may return to the matter later <e> <s> at this stage i would ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> surely amendment no <e> <s> puts an objective test in place of a subjective test and the subjective test put forward by the government is the test of the accused or the person accused of piracy <e>", "<cs> that may be so but if he is possessing them for selling does he not get caught by clause b <e> <s> i should have thought that the words <e>", "<cs> i shall consider both what the minister has said and the phrase possesses in the course of- which seems slightly dubious <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the face of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as long as the minister is considering whether criminal activity is a trade or business i am perfectly prepared to withdraw the amendment so that he may consider the matter <e> <s> if someone is totally crooked it is suggested to me that criminality may be a profession <e> <s> the noble and learned lord who sits closest to me may not accept that <e> <s> however it seems to me to be an activity which if it is restricted to a trade or business may be too closely restricted <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the main problems in the area of piracy especially in piracy of tapes is that a machine can make a pirate tape and can also make a whole variety of other things <e> <s> as the minister will know it is in the selling of tapes that piracy is most common at the moment <e> <s> this seems to be a totally adequate precaution to deal with that very common form of piracy <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will think about the issue again <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to see stemming from the decision in the <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead in moving this amendment <e> <s> i cannot see that these three subsections add anything to the sense <e> <s> it is no doubt my fault <e> <s> perhaps when answering the minister will tell us what they mean other than a statement of the obvious <e>", "<cs> the omission from the bill of the fact that there is the defence of public interest has caused concern to those involved in reporting news <e> <s> it is a matter which deserves more serious consideration for the lack of which i am partly responsible because i tabled the amendment rather late <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> first of all it appears that a photograph of a current event and one can think of certain photographs that have been taken of dramatic current events is not to

<e> <s> after as careful an examination as i was able to make at the time it did seem to me that the subsection was totally different to article <e> <s> the act may be very interesting but the berne convention was amended as late as october <e> <s> therefore it has to be brought up to date again <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because it seems that unless an amendment on these lines is made it will be quite impossible for any form of broadcasting to go through safely on any matter of current events or any form of investigative journalism <e> <s> there are occasions when people say to television or radio reporters things that they would in retrospect wish they had not said <e> <s> it would be very difficult if a broadcasting company were then to he in a complete state of uncertainty as to whether it had the persons permission to make a broadcast <e> <s> i therefore suggest that something along these lines is absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> if one looks at the definition in the bill one can see that a literary work means any work which is spoken which is not a dramatic or musical work <e> <s> one word apparently according to that definition would be a literary work <e>", "<cs> i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> however it seems that there is a distinction between the treatment of musical works and subsection <e> <s> incidental using it in its sense of not being a very important part of the broadcast or whatever we are dealing with could mean quite a large chunk of the literary work <e> <s> it is difficult to see how that would not be deliberately included and it is difficult to see the distinction in principle between treating musical works in one way and literary works in another <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> however i shall still do what i was going to do and ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl has dealt with the point totally <e> <s> if a parent turns up who is not interested in the production but happens to wander in does that turn the production into something that needs some kind of a licence <e> <s> if a parent turns up because johnnys maths has not been very good and he wants to see the maths teacher who happens to be performing in a school play so what <e> <s> as it is at the moment it seems to be quite definitely limited <e> <s> the point of the word generally was to prevent this kind of extraneous visit by somebody who was not concerned from raising some terrible problem of copyright <e>", "<cs> if he is a parent he is not <e> <s> if he is a parent he is completely excluded even if he is a guardian <e> <s> a parent in relation to a guardian includes any person who has actual custody of the pupil <e> <s> a person is not directly connected with the activities of the educational establishment simply because he is the parent of a pupil at the establishment <e> <s> so we are stuck with that parents are excluded <e>", "<cs> that is precisely why the amendment suggests the word generally because a parent is specifically excluded by the subsection that we are discussing <e> <s> if we put in the word generally the condition is that the audience is generally limited to teachers and pupils <e> <s> if we leave it out any parent who for whatever purpose may be coming in merely by accident to see a teacher about something else throws the whole copyright position up into the air <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has done his best and we must compliment him on that <e> <s> i am interested to know whether he or the department for which he speaks at the moment has had any consultation at all with the department of education and science <e> <s> if he looks to his left he may receive help from that direction <e> <s> this appears to be a completely unworkable provision <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> the department of education and science is interested in many subjects but it does not employ teachers <e> <s> did the department of trade and industry in any way consult local <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> this discussion seems to be an application of the rule that is alleged to belong to a certain professor parkinson that a matter of less importance takes up more time in this chamber than a matter of greater importance <e>", "<cs> i tried to follow the noble earls reply <e> <s> it is late at night and it is difficult <e> <s> clause deals with copying by educational establishments <e> <s> subsection appears to suggest that that copying the per cent <e> <s> is free whether or not there is a licence and in particular if there is no licence there is no charge <e> <s> if i am wrong about that no doubt the noble earl will intervene <e> <s> if it is free and i see that he is remaining in his seat <e>", "<cs> if that is so i find great difficulty in the last two lines of subsection because for the life of me i cannot see anyone even if i may be so bold at this time of night a tory local authority agreeing to pay for a licence to copy less than can be got free <e> <s> that is what the last two lines of subsection appear to envisage <e>", "<cs> it is really very difficult <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to an education authority which does not exist but used to exist the dundee education authority <e> <s> if it were to suggest that it wanted only per cent <e> <s> a year and could work it out because it had foresight that it could do per cent <e> <s> per quarter why should it enter into a licensing agreement if the licence agreement cost it money <e> <s> it can get away with per cent <e> <s> without paying anything <e> <s> i cannot see the logic in that <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> is it the position therefore that if a licensing authority chooses to offer a licence then the education authorities have to accept it whatever the price subject of course to going to the copyright tribunal <e> <s> in that situation i would ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment which seems to be totally reasonable <e> <s> the governments position seems to be totally unreasonable <e>", "<cs> is it not the position that the stationery office calculates the cost by working out the price or printing the number upon which it decides and dividing by that number <e> <s> therefore <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me the answer is in clause which provides for the right of the author not to suffer unjustified modification of his work <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a difficulty philosophically with the noble lords amendment because apparently a useful article by definition is not an artistic article or work <e> <s> there may be all kinds of difficulties which a number of members and especially some of those who are not at the moment able to be present in the committee may wish to raise as to whether an artistic work is necessarily unuseful or whether a useful article may not of itself be artistic <e> <s> however it seems to me that there is some lack of definition in drawing that plain distinction between useful and artistic <e>", "<cs> i agree that there is not <e> <s> unfortunately it was proposed in the marshalling that the motion should be dealt with somewhat later <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth i believe it is necessary in dealing with this clause and the next two clauses in a sense to put down a marker for what happens on clause <e> <s> the difficulty here is that these three clauses attempt to take out of copyright something that is to be given a design right and we are not at all certain that the government have got it right <e> <s> the government have changed their mind because in the white paper at paragraph they said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has taken up at this stage all but one of the points i tried to raise at second reading and in committee <e> <s> he has taken the areas which i tried to amend and refined and polished my amendments <e> <s> i am delighted and very much welcome the helpful and constructive approach that he has taken <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting answer but does it really fit the berne convention <e> <s> that says that the authors are to be entitled to equitable remuneration for any communication to the public by wire or by rebroadcasting of the broadcast of the work where this communication is made by an organisation other than the original one <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also speak in support of this amendment <e> <s> to me the difficulty is the absence anywhere in the bill of any definition of assertion <e> <s> we are told that the right is not infringed unless it has been asserted in accordance with section <e> <s> section states various ways in which it may be asserted and we shall come to that but nobody tells us what assertion is <e> <s> surely it would help people dealing with a totally new right to know and i am deliberately not using the word moral because i think that that may convey something different what this assertion is <e> <s> if for example somebody writes a book and sells the copyright to a publisher but his or her name is still on the book is that assertion or is that not assertion <e> <s> if say agatha christie had sold her copyright for a certain hook to a publisher is she asserting her right or not asserting her right <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the example that the noble lord gave of private use would be covered anyway under fair dealing and therefore would not be involved <e> <s> unless i have not followed the minister completely it did not seem to me that he dealt with the point <e> <s> we are coming to somebody who has as i thought i said when introducing this amendment asserted his right to the photograph <e> <s> that has to be asserted for example in clause <e> <s> by instrument in writing <e> <s> when the photographer has put his instrument in writing the assertion then <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we can take this very much further <e> <s> there is a difficulty and i am very pleased that the minister is prepared to take it away and think about it as i am sure he will <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> an unsuccessful attempt was made to get the assertion taken out of the first part of clause <e> <s> there is no need to repeat what was said <e> <s> we must have asserted the right before any of these came along <e> <s> therefore if i am following the noble earl correctly this is an unnecessary amendment <e>", "<cs> i return to this question of assertion <e> <s> this clause tells us the methods of asserting but it does not tell us what assertion is <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give way <e> <s> in contrasting subsections and he said that under subsection an assignation or the assignment lasts for ever for anybody <e> <s> there is a distinction in subsection where the assertion binds anyone to whose notice it is brought <e> <s> does he say that the assertion covered by the assignment or as i would have it assignation in scotland binds someone whether they know about it or not whereas in subsection it does not bind anyone unless it is brought to their notice <e>", "<cs> would the minister kindly state in the letter not how an assertion is communicated but what the assertion has to be <e> <s> perhaps he will include in the letter illustrations of how it is done in a musical sense in a literary work and in an artisitic work <e>", "<cs> it is always interesting to hear the position that the alliance takes <e> <s> if it will allow me to do so i should like to speak in favour of the freedom of the individual <e> <s> it seems to me that the bill as drafted is fair enough <e> <s> in fact clause as we tried to argue on this side of the committee does not go far enough <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me i have never made any claim to be any sort of journalist <e> <s> i have never tried to <e> <s> if i tried to be a journalist i should try to have a contract that controlled what i was doing <e>", "<cs> i would be very interested if the noble lord would identify the strand which says that socialism denies the freedom of contract <e> <s> that would be an interesting line <e> <s> there is a normal line throughout all the history of all the parties who are at present represented in the committee as i understand it that there is a limit in which the state intervenes in the freedom of contract for what is called the public interest point of view or to regulate that <e> <s> but i have never known and i have only been a member of the labour party for something over years anything that said that the labour party was against the freedom of contract <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris can point to the fact well he is increasing my education <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i think if he is speaking about distortion and mutilation he is speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i believe we thought he was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> d <e>", "<cs> i also think that the amendment is mistaken <e> <s> i just can remember who john grierson was <e> <s> many very good nature films have appeared on television <e> <s> i can imagine that somebody with an inclination to parody or somebody like mr john cleese could have great fun with those and could cause considerable fun if he was allowed to modify them to a considerably unjustified extent <e> <s> i should have thought this was a protection which these people are entitled to have <e>", "<cs> the moral right is different from the copyright <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> you can assign the copyright to one person and retain the moral right yourself <e>", "<cs> if the copyright does not form part of his estate the moral right does not pass under paragraph b of clause <e> <s> therefore one has to have clause c to deal with the moral right when he has assigned the copyright to <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord thought of article of the berne convention <e> <s> whoever authorised that had the idea <e>", "<cs> it is very interesting to see how the government wish to destroy personal rights of property <e> <s> no doubt this will also be of interest to all those who are authors within the meaning of the bill <e> <s> but i shall read what the noble earl has said and may well return to this at a later stage <e>", "<cs> would not the easy answer be to include one sentence stating that concession damages will not be available in any copyright action <e> <s> that would make the matter quite clear and perhaps the government should think about that <e>", "<cs> in scotland we have an odd tradition when one side in an action makes an assertion and the other side accepts it that the court tends to accept that in a civil action as being accepted <e> <s> i have looked for a long time for the reason why english cases take so much longer than scottish cases <e> <s> perhaps i have now got a clue <e>

action a judge tends to say yes that is agreed and therefore the court is satisfied <e>", "<cs> i happen to be a member of the faculty of advocates <e> <s> i think that on this point i would have support from a barrister of the english bar <e> <s> i think we would object very strongly to any allegation that we were engaged in trade or in business <e> <s> that would be terrible <e> <s> we must be classified as being a profession <e> <s> but if the intention is that we cannot breach the copyright law so be it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is perhaps not the time to ask for the opinion of the committee <e> <s> i shall consider what the noble earl has said although i must say i do not consider his answer totally satisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> it is quite improper that owners of copyright should be able to wander around the countryside bursting into peoples property and picking up whatever they feel may be an infringing article <e> <s> they should go through the courts <e> <s> they have a procedure which the noble lord lord mottistone will know can operate very quickly indeed to recover such articles <e> <s> it seems entirely proper that that should be done under some sort of control and not by anyone who is wandering about and leaping

experience of going with the backing of a court order and various court officials to recover alleged breaches of copyright from <e>", "<cs> the difficulty that i have with this amendment is that it would appear to give an opening for a publisher or a recording company which buys out copyright or negotiates copyright on behalf of its authors music writers or performers to have complete control in negotiating schemes <e> <s> it would therefore be a different type of organisation than the performing rights society and the various other organisations with which we are dealing <e> <s> this seems

to get on with the bill i ask leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage in the hope that some rational consideration will be given to it <e>", "<cs> i quite agree and i am not disagreeing with that argument <e> <s> it is a matter of the english language <e> <s> it seems to me to be unnecessary to have an organisation claiming to be representative when before the organisation can be heard by reference to clause the tribunal has to be satisfied that it is representative <e> <s> those seem to me to be unnecessary words but i shall not press the point <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that may be the purpose but is it what the subsection says <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for putting so strongly and clearly the points that i would have endeavoured to make <e> <s> the difficulty about the special leave is that over the years one will

would be different rates of consumption and it would be quite impossible without a qualifying adjective to put a burden on the tribunal of having no discrimination at all <e>", "<cs> if i may say so

the nature of the work itself there is one element which is totally missing from its consideration <e> <s> i hope that the minister is prepared to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the

broadcast surely that is something totally different from whatever fee if any he may be entitled to receive if an educational establishment wishes to make use of that broadcast in another way <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a complete confusion there <e> <s> why should the broadcasting authority in a sense have to pay for the freedom of the educational establishment <e>", "<cs> it is much

what may happen shortly may show that there is a tactical advantage in having the noble lord lord hacking propose an amendment rather than come number four on the list of those who support it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to note that the government have apparently changed their view of the meaning of the berne convention since the publication of the white paper on the subject <e> <s> i

his intention in regard to amendment no <e> <s> and because i also have put my name to the amendment perhaps i may thank the minister and the government for at last yielding to pressure from this side of the chamber and in another place which has convinced them of the need for a written lease <e> <s> in effect the minister has given us a very long statement and i think that we should all like to study it to see exactly what it contains <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the drafting proposed by the noble earl because the bill is absolutely impossible to follow <e> <s> it is fairly easy for government departments which have all the bills available to them and can put them on to word processors and carry out the changes in that way <e> <s> however for anybody who does not have that facility it is quite impossible to follow the type of amendment which schedule creates without going back cutting up and sticking pieces of paper on and then trying to see if one has it right <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister would consider what i understood is called a keeling schedule that is to have another schedule after schedule setting out the result of the amendments carried in schedule to schedules and to the rent act scotland <e> <s> this would then all be in one document <e> <s> that is what was done and what i intended to refer to in the copyright bill <e> <s> i should have thought that it was quite easy and it would cost only a little more <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i am not certain where the long answer on amendment no <e> <s> takes us in relation to this amendment <e> <s> i have not yet had the opportunity to read what the minister said about succession to assured tenancies <e> <s> i know that he said something but that is as far as i am prepared to go <e> <s> it is important that there should be succession rights <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i did not hear i heard perfectly well <e> <s> i did not fully take in and understand the effect on the bill of what the minister was saying in regard to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed <e> <s> up to now i have found the ministers contributions to this bill helpful <e> <s> what he has said now in my view is complete rubbish <e> <s> he is saying in effect that scottish homes is to be given power to approve of those of whom it cares to approve to disapprove of those of whom it cares to disapprove and any potential landlord is to have no standard and no method of challenging such disapproval <e> <s> that seems to me to be basically unjust <e>", "<cs> that is fine but judicial review as the minister knows full well is only a review of administrative action <e> <s> the person administering the review has to decide on the powers that are given

can say that a matter is outwith the bodys powers <e> <s> it has power to do anything <e> <s> that is what is wrong <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the minister has had reason returned to him after a short interval when it was away <e> <s> i hope he will give favourable consideration to this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will enlighten the

excessive has scottish homes the right to say that it does not want the property <e>", "<cs> then why is it that a local authority has no right to reject the price that the district valuer has set and even in the case where the district valuer has made a mistake is not permitted to appeal to the lands tribunal <e> <s> however much expertise the district valuer may have i think that the lands tribunal would regard itself as having as much expertise <e> <s> the lands tribunal for scotland has a higher standing in questions of setting values in such situations <e> <s> i do not understand why in the case of purchases from local authorities the government insist that the purchasers can say that they do not like a price but a local authority is unable to do so and has no right of appeal against the price even in the case of the most blatant mistake <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is surely that most tenants buy only one house especially tenants exercising a right to buy <e> <s> there is not much difficulty in valuing one house <e> <s> people know roughly the value of a corporation house <e> <s> if the purchase is of houses in castlemilk there may be a high level of dispute about the value of the block of houses with say half or per cent <e> <s> of them empty <e> <s> it is with that type of issue that we are concerned <e> <s> as i said we are not discussing a tenant buying one house <e>", "<cs> it is the other way about the tenant fixes a rent with the landlord and the tenant being in receipt of housing benefit automatically the rent officer comes round <e> <s> there is already an existing contract between the landlord and the tenant for rent <e> <s> then the rent officer comes round looks at it and says oh no that is excessive <e> <s> housing benefit will only be at the lower level <e>", "<cs> the minister has gone a great distance in what he has just said <e> <s> if he means that landlords can charge only market rents and if as i understand it the rent officer is to fix what are to be reasonable rents based on market rents which is a distinction i do not see i fail to see why it destroys the basis of the bill that the tenants should be able to restrict the rent they pay to market rent <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> that would be dealt with by market forces if i may pray them in aid <e> <s> we are dealing with the market rent for the house <e> <s> that does not depend on the type of tenant <e> <s> as i understand it the rent officer is fixing the market rent of the house <e> <s> in the cases with which we are dealing we are assuming that the landlord is charging and the tenant has originally agreed something above the market rent for the house <e> <s> i see no reason in effect why anybody even if he later obtains employment should be bound to pay more than the market rent <e>", "<cs> we are at cross-purposes <e> <s> it may be a minor point <e> <s> the noble baroness is talking of someone anticipating the type of rent that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend considers what he will do with the amendment does not the minister accept the point that it is impossible for the police to watch over a person who is in fear of violence <e> <s> it just cannot be done <e> <s> you cannot place a policeman outside each house to see that the wife husband daughter son or whoever it may be does not come to visit <e> <s> the exercise is far too costly and the police manpower is not available to carry it out <e>", "<cs> i do not think i said anything about direct labour organisations being deprived of work <e> <s> nor would i wish that the private sector should be deprived <e> <s> i was merely suggesting that if its tender were cheaper than others it should be allowed to do the work and if the governments aim is market forces why not <e> <s> if the direct labour organisation happens to put in a cheaper tender than anybody else why are the private builders to be protected from fair competition <e>", "<cs> i am always interested in the theory of competition <e> <s> it appears that if there is an efficient direct labour organisation that can undercut and supply to the consumer cheaper services it is not to be allowed to do so by the government as a matter of principle because it would interfere with the small builder <e> <s> in a sense that is what the minister has just said <e> <s> if he does not agree with that no doubt he will say so <e>", "<cs> i raise the same point that was raised on tuesday by the noble earl lord selkirk about the way in which this legislation is now being drafted <e> <s> if one were to set out to make the bill as un-understandable as possible it would be difficult to improve on what has been done with the schedules <e> <s> i take up the point made by the noble earl lord balfour <e> <s> i find it fascinating that first of all we <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl explain what connected but not consequential means <e>", "<cs> with respect we are not in areas of drafting we are in areas of english <e>", "<cs> the language is english but we shall willingly go into the scottish language if necessary <e> <s> we got into rows about ish and various other matters earlier on <e> <s> surely in this committee we can get something which is explainable in simple english <e> <s> sir ernest gowers wrote a book on the subject some years ago <e> <s> please may we understand what the government are trying to do <e>", "<cs> does that mean that if a matter is not flowing directly it is disconnected and therefore you call it connected <e> <s> is that what is meant <e>", "<cs> i must deal first with the point raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> my understanding of the procedure from what the noble lord the chairman of committees said is that it is only amendment no <e> <s> that falls

language and communication mathematical studies and application scientific studies and application creative and aesthetic activities technological activities and application social and environmental studies religious and moral education and physical education <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff may be interested in those <e>", "<cs> we do not oppose these amendments but we should like some clarification as regards amendment no <e> <s> which proposes the setting up of a standing advisory council on religious education <e> <s> that is wholly acceptable <e> <s> however it changes section of the education act which allowed the local education authority to decide on the method of appointment of the standing advisory council for its area <e> <s> is it necessarily a good thing to have a rigid method of appointment and set-up for all the different local education authorities <e> <s> we on this side of the committee rather doubt that it is <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate is well aware there are areas where there are different situations and different kinds of society <e> <s> would such a provision fit an area such as bradford for example which has a large non-christian population which has its own religious beliefs <e> <s> on that point subsection a of amendment no <e> <s> refers to religious denominations <e> <s> as a presbyterian i am quite prepared to be described as a denomination but whether a buddhist a mohammedan or even a jew would like to be regarded as a religious denomination i do not know <e> <s> i suggest that such religions and denominations would be a happier frame of words <e>", "<cs> i have lived under a conservative regime for longer than i should have liked <e> <s> i thought that in general the conservative party and conservative governments liked to act within the law and within the spirit of the law <e> <s> that is an issue on which there has been consensus between all parties in this chamber <e> <s> it is one of the aspects of consensus which should continue <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> in clauses and we have various rules as to how the secretary of state is to deal with the various councils <e> <s> if he disagrees with the councils advice he has to give his reasons as the minister has already reminded us <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will not press these amendments as we did indeed discuss them on tuesday under amendment no <e> <s> and at that stage we had no notice of them <e> <s> as i said then there is a problem that while we accept that there should be a mandatory body in each local authority there is a certain difficulty on our side in that that body should have a set form for each local education authority <e>", "<cs> does the ministers answer mean that under the bill as it is printed the parliamentary commissioner the ombudsman can come in but only after the section or section direction from the secretary of state <e> <s> if so i do not see why giving a direct approach to the parliamentary commissioner cutting out the secretary of state who is not really equipped to be a judge in such a case is necessarily reducing bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will at least take this matter away and think about it <e> <s> it appears to us that his answers have not been very satisfactory <e> <s> in fact i have yet to hear the answer as to why it is still appropriate that the local authority ombudsman should have a right to deal with any local authority school <e>", "<cs> he has certain rights in the administration of schools <e> <s> why should that right be removed and not replaced except by the secretary of <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to be as important as the ballot that the resolution by the governing body should be reached by a real majority and not put through by a group which happens to know that for the next six weeks certain governors will not be around <e> <s> this amendment would make it absolutely clear that a full majority of the governing body has to pass resolutions <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> if the amendment calls for a vote of the majority of governors that exist to be in favour of the resolution i fail to see how it matters if the minority are present or absent <e> <s> it does not seem logical <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can explain the point <e>", "<cs> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> the amendment says quite clearly <e>", "<cs> that is not the proposition in the amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to read it he will see that it refers to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise a non-ecclesiastical issue in this group of amendments and speak about amendment no <e> <s> f which is at the tail end of the group <e> <s> it seems perhaps not to give the safeguards which the government intend that it should <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give way <e> <s> i am sure that it is possible but i think that the wording needs redrafting <e> <s> all i am requesting is that the noble baroness will perhaps take this back and see whether the provision could be tightened up <e> <s> it seems that some restriction needs to be added such as that the governors need to be satisfied that the list is to be used for the purpose stated <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that this amendment is being discussed on its own otherwise i should have mentioned the grouping <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to divide the committee on the amendment at this time of night <e> <s> i shall read what the minister said though to me it sounded unsatisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having heard what the noble lord the minister has given us already this evening i am not entirely certain that i can lake as read anything because i do not know what might emerge <e> <s> there was some difficulty with arithmetic <e> <s> there may be even more difficulty over understanding <e> <s> however on the basis of the helpful and friendly undertaking i think the best answer would be to delay consideration of the other amendments in the group if necessary until the next stage at report <e>", "<cs> in the face of the governments commitment on amendment no <e> <s> bc i beg leave to withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> ca and cb which relate to clause <e> <s> the clause states <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister is prepared to do that <e> <s> i can imagine a situation where some of the school staff objected and someone challenged the legal right of the secretary of state to consider the matter as it was not included in subsection <e>", "<cs> my difficulty with this amendment is to see where the local education authorities are to get the money from <e> <s> i had the impression over the last eight years and possibly a little more that there was a certain amount of constraint on what local education authorities spent money on <e> <s> it seems that this money in the end was to come from the government or from the taxpayer <e> <s> in that sense it seems a rather pointless exercise to land the responsibility on the local ratepayer in this way when presumably the local education authorities if they are like the education authorities in scotland have been desperately trying to get permission to spend money on buildings and have not been able to do so <e>", "<cs> if the only change is in effect a change in the name of the employer from a to b it is not a change that is to the detriment of his working conditions and therefore the last two lines are unnecessary <e> <s> therefore from what i have been taught about judicial interpretation of course i bow to the noble and learned lord who has far more <e>", "<cs> i have difficulty in seeing how the change of name of the employer by itself and nothing more can possibly be argued to be to the detriment of the employee <e> <s> however i shall read what was said by the noble and learned lord and at this stage ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the end i shall withdraw this amendment because of the lateness of the hour <e> <s> i regret to say that that has nothing to do with what the noble and learned lord said because in effect he said nothing <e>", "<cs> one can best look at the point that i wish to raise by first looking at subsection of this clause which provides obviously correctly that designated schools cannot be closed without following the procedure laid down in the education acts <e> <s> then one sees that a designated school is such school as the secretary of state designates in an order as shall relate to that inner london council and which had previously been an ilea maintained school <e>", "<cs> no doubt it is my fault but i do not think that the minister answered the point that i was endeavouring to make <e> <s> if there is a borough that has within it five secondary schools say but it should only have three because of the number of children that it contains what is to prevent the secretary of state from saying this borough needs only three schools and designating the three of his choice <e> <s> then the other two which have no connection with any other boroughs close because they have not been designated so far as i can see under this clause <e> <s> there is no consultation process because subsection deals only with schools which have been designated <e>", "<cs> the minister referred to statutory guidance <e> <s> is that guidance to have the force of a statutory instrument or is it just guidance <e>", "<cs> under the statute where <e> <s> which section <e> <s> so far as i am aware this guidance is just a document that comes from the department of education and science <e> <s> is there to be an answer or shall i go on <e> <s> if we are talking about consultation that is fine <e> <s> paragraph of the guidance states that the secretary of state will be prepared to consider inheriting property located outside a boundary in the light of representations made by other bodies <e> <s> the question i should like to ask is let us say that borough a wants this property outside its boundaries <e> <s> how are the other councils to know that it wants it unless there is such consultation as i suggest in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to keep on with this subject but we have been through guidance in a whole variety of bills in the very short time i have been here <e> <s> guidance can take all sorts of forms <e> <s> the guidance to which i have been referred could be just <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged for that because as i thought i said or at least as i intended to say one of the fears is that the staff commission will be as toothless a tiger as the glc staff commission which could really only offer encouragement <e> <s> something more is required and in view of the ministers encouraging words i hope he will return with something stronger <e> <s> in the light of his undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly support these amendments and i hope that i shall not be too repetitive <e> <s> it seems to me on the information i have that there are various other points which can be made <e> <s> it is not only necessary that there should be equity in dealing between various members of staff of the same grade and with the same service <e> <s> it is obviously wholly wrong that a mere matter of chance should decide whether or not the employment and therefore the redundancy period shall be transferred from the glc <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord for what he has said <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment and consider what he has said in more detail and perhaps obtain some advice <e> <s> there are difficulties in the bill itself in relation to this kind of problem which arise under clause which we shall come to later <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that he should do it in isolation i was suggesting that he should do it after consultation <e> <s> however it is not a very important matter and i do not wish to delay the committee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw

english and welsh education school systems <e> <s> the continuation of four of the scottish universities was guaranteed by the act of union <e> <s> scottish universities are entirely different and are based on a scottish system of school education which is entirely different and for which the department of education and science has no responsibility <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will give way <e> <s> surely the job of the commissioners entails among other things having regard to the need to enable the qualifying institutions to provide education and to promote learning <e> <s> that is what clause says among other things <e> <s> in order to do that the commissioners must surely understand the education system of the country in which the universities are operating <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this is the most major item in the bill <e> <s> we have had an interesting discussion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have never heard parliament disposed of quite so summarily <e> <s> we are discussing a group of five people who will change statutes and even acts of parliament <e> <s> it will then report to the privy council

the universities and many others are concerned should be exercised strictly within the limits and not exceeded <e> <s> i should have thought that it is eminently reasonable for parliament to have some supervisory role in deciding whether or not those powers are being properly exercised <e> <s> otherwise what is the purpose of having a parliament <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that i do not find that satisfactory <e> <s> we have gone through this bill as we have gone through others with the government saying that the powers given to do this or that shall be by order or that without even the necessity of an order the secretary of state shall make up his mind <e> <s> it seems to me that the alteration of statutes is important and that parliament has a different and more important role which should be recognised <e> <s> i intend to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i offer my congratulations to the noble lord the deputy chairman of committees if that is in order <e>", "<cs> that sounds perfectly reasonable but why not say it <e> <s> why not put it into the bill in the reasonable words which the noble and learned lord so reasonably used instead of using words the meaning of which many of us have difficulty in following <e>", "<cs> at the moment this provision is by itself and we do not know what is to come with it <e> <s> it sits outwith other provisions which deal merely with dismissal <e> <s> it is much more easy to discuss the subject if we see it in the context of the grievance procedure that the noble and learned lord hopes to introduce <e>", "<cs> my suggestion was not that both amendments should be withdrawn but only that amendment no <e> <s> zaa should be withdrawn until we see the other side of the coin of the grievance procedure <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear asked her question and i think that as a result the noble and learned lord did not reply to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale as to whether it might be better not to move the amendment at this stage until the grievance procedure was available <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i shall take advice on whether it is

personal community charge <e> <s> there has been no increase whatever in their grant which makes one doubt whether this review has any validity at all <e>", "<cs> that is true <e> <s> however there is such a thing as a water charge under the abolition of domestic rates legislation with which i should have thought the minister would be fully acquainted <e>", "<cs> i would strongly support this amendment because it seems to affect only those who are eventually acquitted <e> <s> as i understand the position somebody who is in the end convicted has his sentence backdated to the time he is remanded in custody and therefore he pays no community charge in respect of the period he is on remand <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps he can tell us whether the amendment will cover the scottish act as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with the scottish act in short measure <e> <s> i agree with the <e>", "<cs> the determination to do something by regulation rather than by statute seems strange <e> <s> the minister and i argued about the question last year <e> <s> why is it necessary to do this by regulation except perhaps to allow the english six months in which to sell a house rather than three months <e> <s> as a scot i wonder what the difference is <e> <s> is it that the scots would need amending legislation while the english would have a regulation subject to the negative procedure <e> <s> if so why is there the difference <e> <s> what do the government fear in making the two the same <e> <s> do they intend to amend the scottish act so that it is covered by regulation and the two run side by side <e> <s> the government undertook that the two would run side by side <e> <s> why is there a difference <e>", "<cs> as the minister knows it is easier to produce a statutory instrument and have it approved by parliament than to produce an amending act <e> <s> if in august or september say the department of the environment considers that four months

this at a later stage <e> <s> it seems to me that it is easy for the government to do one or the other to bring the two into line on this issue <e> <s> the minister apparently is unable to get

the previous statement of the management that only two strip mills were required and the lack of investment in the coke ovens at ravenscraig and the storage capacity at dalzell <e> <s> however i do not wish to go into that so much as to inquire what is the governments attitude to the arthur young report <e> <s> they give no answer and never have done except to say that arthur young did not receive information from the british steel corporation and therefore apparenty arthur youngs management consultancy report must be regarded as rubbish <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord give me some figures to show how much of that per cent <e> <s> is imported by the british steel corporation <e>", "<cs> my information is that it is very substantial <e>", "<cs> can the minister define what the bill means by saying <e>", "<cs> we are dealing here with cases where a contract has been entered into between the british steel corporation and someone else on the basis that the corporation is by contract not permitted to assign sell or do anything to the contract <e> <s> therefore we have a contract between a and b by choice b has decided that a must remain the contracting party <e> <s> parliament merely says that for a read c without giving b any opportunity to say i do not like this <e> <s> that seems to fly totally in the face of all the private law of contract that i know <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will have something encouraging to say as regards this amendment because he has certainly been pressed to do so from all sides of the committee <e> <s> the assurances we have so far received only concern the strip mill at ravenscraig until next year and steel production if my memory is right for a further five years <e> <s> that would follow sugar the aluminium smelter at invergordon and paper at fort william <e> <s> indeed it would not improve scottish views of the government which perhaps showed their lack of encouragement last year if yet another major industry disappeared after so many promises <e> <s> therefore i hope that public interest is recognised by the government as being far wider than mere matters of competition law which can go to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> am i not correct that in the statement last december the commitment to ravenscraigs hot mill was to next year only <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord explain how an act of will override an act of <e> <s> it appears to me unreal and contrary to constitutional theory <e>", "<cs> surely the minister must accept that if an act is passed in preventing british steel plc or whatever it is called from doing certain things it does not matter what an act of or states can be done by any other company <e> <s> if british steel plc cannot do it and the government cannot do it under this act it does not matter whether bp or anyone else can do it <e>", "<cs> in the light of the new constitutional theory that a act overrides a act perhaps the minister will explain matters in a little more detail <e> <s> i should like to know more <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with a certain amount of diffidence <e> <s> i appreciate that on numerous occasions in the past i have asserted sometimes to the irritation of some of your lordships that scotland does it differently and the different way is better <e> <s> i make it quite clear that i fully accept that the scottish education system is in need of a considerable amount of improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble and learned lord agrees <e> <s> i believe he has less experience of it than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certain elements in the consultation paper with reference to testing where the local authorities do not agree <e> <s> however i quarrel with the noble baroness lady carnegy on the question of centralisation <e> <s> i realise that scotland has only a limited number of local education authorities but within the guidance of the curriculum council there is a considerable difference in the way in which they approach the matter and in the arrangements of the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord has been in glasgow or edinburgh recently but there are certainly areas of deprivation in those cities <e> <s> cynics in the younger age group would take these subjects if they were treated in the way the noble lord is treating them and would laugh at them in the way the noble lord is laughing at them <e> <s> so be it they laugh at history and geography also <e>", "<cs> my lords as an elder of the church of scotland i do not know whether i have to declare an interest <e> <s> however i assure the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i shall not say a word about scotland being superior <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the opposition front bench agree almost entirely with what is in the right reverend prelates amendment <e> <s> it is clear to everybody that christianity has played a crucial role in the development of the history ethics and morality of britain <e> <s> i would remind some of my noble friends that it has played and still plays an important part in the history of the development of the party to which we belong <e> <s> therefore i agree with the noble lord lord elton that perhaps we should move on to the more detailed debates <e> <s> i congratulate the right reverend prelate on managing a virtually impossible job in achieving what he has achieved and achieving it by agreement <e> <s> i hope that the amendments will meet with the approval of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a minor point but in the right reverend prelates amendments and the government amendments where religious worship is used and at other points where collective worship is used are the words intended to mean the same or is a distinction being drawn between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> it is perhaps most strongly supported by the foreword to the brandt report which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry hut no doubt the noble lord lord home will quarrel with too many words <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ask at the end leave to withdraw this amendment but certainly not as a result of the reasoning put forward by the government <e> <s> if one looks at clause and considers the very unlikely but possible chance that a <e>", "<cs> my lords i was attempting to say i apologise for having said it so often that on occasion the scots have something slightly better than the english <e> <s> the ethnic minorities of this country continually say to the english at least consider what we have what we are doing and what our lives are like <e> <s> dont just say we are perfect and you must come up to our standard <e> <s> i shall not take the matter any further <e> <s> i do not wish to widen the scottish-english divide <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak briefly to the amendments <e> <s> for once i did not follow the noble baroness lady seear as to the relevance of the act of worship to the amendments which seem to be dealing with religious education rather than worship but perhaps that is being too pedantic <e> <s> the amendment would drive a large hole in the compromise if the right reverend prelate will allow <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that does not seem to meet the point <e> <s> i want to make clear that i speak as the son of a church of scotland minister so i am not totally biased against the clergy <e> <s> but there are other smaller groups and one wonders about their qualification to teach <e> <s> we are talking about the qualification of clergy to teach <e> <s> as i read the amendment of the noble lord there is no test to be put on the clergy as to whether they are qualified to teach <e> <s> under the amendment so long as they have a dog collar on they can teach religious education <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect to the noble lord we have just one further opportunity to discuss this bill at third reading <e> <s> the rules of the house so far as i understand them are that the areas which we can discuss are sometimes slightly limited <e> <s> therefore i think it is proper to raise these issues at this stage <e> <s> it seems to me difficult to know exactly whom we are dealing with and it becomes even more difficult when one comes to the suggestion that these people are to give such education with or without remuneration <e> <s> if a whole variety of people are to give it with remuneration who is paying for this in a maintained school <e> <s> that is a very serious problem if there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this amendment gives any solution to the difficulty of the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> the solution is to increase the number of places for training teachers of religious education <e> <s> but this amendment does nothing to achieve that result <e> <s> i should have thought that it would certainly not help by adding a whole group of enthusiastic amateurs to teach religious education to children <e> <s> i do not think that works <e> <s> i am all in favour of religious education but this could be interpreted as religious amateurs i think that would be unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords if music and art cover all things what is wrong with the words the arts <e> <s> do they not cover music and art <e> <s> i should have thought that they did <e> <s> why have we wasted minutes on this matter <e> <s> i should have thought that the government could have accepted it without any difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to give a certain amount of flexibility <e> <s> it allows which the foundation subjects appear to prohibit people to learn let us say french and german simultaneously before the age of a possibility which appears not to be included <e> <s> if it is the intention of the secretary of state to keep ancient greek and latin out he can still do it even if he accepts the amendment of the noble lord lord mcnair because all he needs to do is not to specify latin or greek as one of the languages <e> <s> that is already in subsection b and is not affected by the amendment <e> <s> however it would prevent a future secretary of state having to pass an amending act to allow classics to be taught <e> <s> it could be done by an order alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me absurd that in this country we have an area where a large number of people speak polish as their natural home language and therefore virtually learn english as a foreign language at school and that they should be taught french or german through the medium of english at the expense of being taught polish <e> <s> that seems totally absurd and the kind of situation we are talking about without raising any issues of colour prejudice that might arise from dealing with other foreign languages <e> <s> i totally support everything said by the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the noble lord lord young of dartington was thinking of the interpretation act which says that the singular includes the plural <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal very shortly with the scottish challenge <e> <s> it is delightful to hear that the noble lord lord beloff has been converted to the prospect that everything scottish is good <e> <s> i do not think that i have ever said that <e> <s> i certainly would not intend to say that <e> <s> if i did say it the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would probably disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with that <e> <s> but if one goes through a straightforward list of what archbishop laud lord strafford the earl of montrose cromwell pym and hampden did one is left in total confusion <e> <s> one has to know something about the circumstances in which they lived and why in those circumstances they did what they did <e> <s> that in my view is what history is about <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords are we discussing a group that includes nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> if that is the case then it is not in the grouping or are we discussing only the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord thorneycroft as is my understanding <e> <s> it really would be much clearer certainly for me and i would hope for other members of this house if we knew what we were discussing <e> <s> i was not clear from what the noble lord lord thorneycroft said whether he was speaking to his amendment no <e> <s> a and some other amendments of which i did not have prior notice or to his own amendment only <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give way once more <e> <s> this is a quite important amendment <e> <s> i realise that i am fairly new to this house but if we are going to have amendments in the s which come up and which are not in the groupings it is very unfair if we are suddenly asked to discuss them without notice <e> <s> the groupings are available outside this chamber and we work as i understand it on the basis that these groupings are agreed to unless we have some notice that they are not <e> <s> it is very difficult if we are suddenly asked to discuss amendments that are not on the list of groupings and not expected to be discussed today at all <e> <s> some noble lords who might have wished to discuss the amendments may not be here or like myself may not even if they are present have prepared themselves in regard to the amendments in question <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the position my understanding is that one informs the chief whips office of the amendments that one wishes to be taken in a group <e> <s> that assists the house <e> <s> i fully appreciate that i have little experience of this house or of the other place compared with the noble lord lord thorneycroft but it is a bouncer to deliver at ones head if i may use a cricketing term suddenly to say that we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> and certain amendments thereafter without prior notification that those may be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed religious education for several hours yesterday <e> <s> the bill deals with many other matters <e> <s> the house made a clear decision yesterday in accepting the amendment put forward by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> he holds the view that further discussions may be helpful <e> <s> there is a point at which the house must get on with the business of the bill <e> <s> there are members of the house who are deeply concerned about other parts of the bill <e> <s> it would be utterly deplorable for the house to get into a discussion which involved a competition to see who was the better christian on a basis of who spent the most time in this chamber discussing the various arguments <e> <s> we must have a sense of proportion <e> <s> if we have a suggestion for further discussions let us leave it at that and get on with the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i do not want to go back to but when parliament passed the act section of which contains these words it was not thinking of anything other than the christian faith and was referring to denominations of the christian faith <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question before the minister sits down <e> <s> is she aware that the jewish faith could be said to be divided into various denominations and the moslem faith could be said as we know perhaps from what is going on between iran and iraq to be divided between various denominations <e> <s> therefore to use denomination as being equal to faith could be said to be confusing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to everyone who has spoken in this debate <e> <s> it is unfortunate that in her response the noble baroness has completely failed to see the point at which we are driving <e> <s> in no sense are we against local financial management <e> <s> in these amendments we are attempting to arrive at a situation where local financial management can work <e> <s> under the bill as it is we do not consider that local financial management will work there will be difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the amendment as far as it goes in allowing a little more flexibility <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government are prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government in the usual pleasant tones of the minister have been as rigid as they have been throughout the bills proceedings <e> <s> there is a total lack of flexibility and a total lack of considering other people points of view <e> <s> it would be different if the bill had been completely thought out from the beginning <e> <s> obviously that is not the case <e> <s> the government have brought forward over amendments at this stage very few of them the result of further consideration of earlier amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is clear from the able speech that the noble baroness lady faithfull made that children with special educational needs require different amounts of space depending on their special needs <e> <s> one result of that might be that a child coming in with special educational needs cancels out two three or four other so to speak non-special needs children <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again we have a situation where amendments proposed from this side of the house are described as well-intentioned <e> <s> i appreciate that on some occasions they are not described by the government as well-intentioned <e> <s> however they quite often are so described <e> <s> then they are dismissed as irrelevant unnecessary badly drafted or something else <e>", "<cs> my lords which amendments were accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl and i am particularly grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy because she did me the courtesy of listening to what i was saying which was a great help <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not concerned with the first amendment but i should speak to the group <e> <s> this group of amendments brings the number of government amendments to this chapter which this house has considered and it is only to this chapter in this house and not the other place to over <e> <s> this shows how much careful preparation went into the drafting of the bill <e> <s> if some of the amendments had been in response to some of the arguments that were put forward by members of this house or members of another place we might have had more respect for the government <e> <s> however i will do my best to deal with this group <e>", "<cs> my lords in general we support the idea behind the amendment <e> <s> i am not entirely clear whether the noble earl meant that the employer was to pay for the time off or that the education authority was to pay for it <e> <s> if the education authority is to pay the natural question is where is the money coming from <e> <s> is it coming from central government or the poll tax payer <e> <s> if the money is coming from the employer speaking as one myself what happens about the self-employed <e> <s> if the employer has to pay people for time off what happens to the self-employed person <e> <s> does he pay himself to be a governor <e> <s> it seems a slightly unfair situation <e> <s> no doubt this is a general matter and a pilot study would be generally useful <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood correctly what the noble lord read out he was saying that there is a draft document for obtaining the views of local education authorities <e> <s> so be it <e> <s> i hope that the secretary of state i am sure he will pays attention to the general views and that he will come to a general view of the average position across the country of the various local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady carnegy and her noble friend lady young <e> <s> they are in the unique position of having their amendments accepted by the government <e> <s> it may have something to do with where they sit when they are in the house <e> <s> we have no objection to the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the results of giving each school its own governing body is that one increases the cost of looking after them and the need for clerking <e> <s> it is obviously necessary that that clerking should be done properly <e> <s> it is ludicrous to suggest that the clerk will perform his function for nothing or will do it efficiently for nothing <e> <s> it is therefore appropriate that clerks should receive some payment <e> <s> it is also appropriate that the additional cost should not necessarily fall on the education authority as the local taxpayer but should be a matter to be compensated under the grant arrangements from central government <e> <s> when answering i hope that the government will take that point on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we know that under clause even if so minded the secretary of state could not abolish the sex discrimination legislation because of article of the treaty of rome and because of directive / i quote that from memory <e> <s> but i am not certain whether the treaty of rome covers racial discrimination <e> <s> if it does not the secretary of state under the terms of clause can modify any enactment and therefore can just abolish race legislation as regards certain types of schools <e> <s> it would be quite inappropriate that he should be able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly puzzled by the numbers in the group of amendments that were read out <e> <s> i thought that this group included amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the noble earl read out amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i know that the government do not believe that we are going fast enough but i did not realise that we were going backwards <e> <s> can i take it that we are discussing only the four amendments and not the others <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems slightly strange that the government have only woken up at report stage in the second house to which this bill has gone to the fact that occasionally a new school is opened <e> <s> so be it <e> <s> i find it interesting that the appointment of staff by the new temporary governors is to take immediate effect <e> <s> that is within the logic of the proposals of the government <e> <s> however it is very strange that the temporary governors are not to be allowed responsibility for buying the books and pencils because that may be too much for them and not because they are not allowed to manage the budget but they are to choose the staff including the head teacher <e> <s> that is an odd way of doing it <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the house <e> <s> in principle we have no objection to these proposals but it seems that logic has flown slightly out of the window <e>", "<cs> my lords in this group of amendments there is amendment no <e> <s> which will disappear if amendment no <e> <s> is agreed to <e> <s> this debate reflects a discussion we had in committee when it was argued that the word costs did not include the question of part of the costs <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord trefgarne who agreed to take it away and look at it <e> <s> i may be wrong as to who agreed to take it away but somebody on the government front bench did so <e> <s> i am pleased ever <e> <s> though it was unacknowledged that my amendment has in fact appeared in amendment no <e> <s> because it refers to part of those costs <e> <s> i am grateful that on one occasion the government have taken some account of what i have said <e> <s> it is a pity that they did not notice that they were doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two amendments to amendment no <e> <s> to be called <e> <s> we should not approve amendment no <e> <s> before we have discussed the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is not going to move the amendment i should like to move it and speak to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that it is the custom of the house that if someone speaks to an amendment the government have some chance to answer which they have not yet had <e> <s> i had intended to say that i was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b together <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of the amendment is not so much the question of redundancy payments and whether the recipient thinks them enough but whether too much may be going out from the local authority and the need for the local education authority to be consulted <e> <s> i find it difficult therefore to see why the minister tells me that the redundant teacher if i may describe him or her would have union advice <e> <s> i have no doubt that that is so <e> <s> i was making the point that the amendment provides that the lea which may well have to pick up the can should have an input and be able to make sure that not too much is paid out <e>", "<cs> my lords these may be technical amendments but perhaps we might have an explanation of some of them <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> removes the requirement in the articles of government of a grant maintained school which requires the governing body to publish annually details of the procedure relating to complaints by parents <e> <s> in view of the fact that this afternoon we have passed a government amendment extending the range of complaints procedure in other schools why is it necessary that the complaints procedure is being diminished in grant maintained schools <e> <s> there seems to be an entirely different approach being adopted for different types of school <e> <s> no doubt the minister will be able to explain why that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if the government are to adopt that attitude would it not be better that they ceased to require any members of your lordships house to be present and just passed it all through by correspondence if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand this <e> <s> if one can go on and on asking for grant-maintained status it seems totally illogical that having tried it and having found that it does not work in a particular school one cannot ask for the management to be reversed <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord beloff is trying to have it on one side only <e> <s> one can ask as often as one likes for grant-maintained status but once one has it one cannot ask for it to be taken away again <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the government are encouraging divorce <e> <s> as i understand it if people divorce and remarry you then might have a child with three parents <e> <s> in those circumstances do they get three votes <e> <s> further if you got into the hollywood scale you could have one child with a whole concertina of parents <e> <s> does the noble baroness not agree that this might be most prejudicial to the single parent either because the person is not married or because he or she has been widowed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a unique occasion when the government listen to something said by the opposition <e> <s> i welcome this amendment but i am now going to carp a little <e> <s> if as is required by the bill something over circulars giving all this information must be sent why cannot they be circulated among the staff of the school who presumably are fewer in number than the parents <e> <s> because of the way in which parents seem to be multiplying in this bill a large secondary school with or children would involve sending circulars to over parents but only one set of documents <e>", "<cs> my lords as a presbyterian involved in this dispute between the church of england and the roman catholic church i would support the right reverend prelate on these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the origins of this section in previous legislation i should have thought that if the intention was that any objection by anybody in england and wales was to be heard it would have been perfectly possible to say so <e> <s> subsection does not say anybody may object it says any of the following may object and the following are four different classes <e> <s> if one is dealing with a school in say the west of cornwall apparently so long as one can gather together local government electors in northumbria cumbria or somewhere like that it meets the case <e> <s> one can have the trustees the governing body and the local education authority <e> <s> how can one have anybody else <e> <s> if a teacher a cleaner or anybody else wants to object how do they fit in <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory is right last week we had a very short discussion on an amendment in the name of the noble lord lord renton about the difficulty of the words religious denomination used indiscriminately when they could clearly mean religious faith <e> <s> i have no objection to the amendment if the words mean denomination rather than faith <e> <s> however perhaps before third reading the government could have a look at the places where these words are used and will ensure that they are using the words meaning methodist presbyterian church of england or whatever and not buddhist moslem or christian <e> <s> on reading the bill there appears at various stages to be a muddle as to the meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support what the noble lords lord renton and lord boyd-carpenter said about the difficulty of the bill and the importance of getting it right <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton said the same phrases arise again and again in the bill <e> <s> on one or two occasions i have raised the problem about denominations and faiths <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> says <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that these amendments are only technical but if one looks at clause one finds it only deals with primary and secondary education <e> <s> i understand from what the minister said although he said it rather fast that it was intended that if the school was used for further education the local authority or the school could charge <e> <s> what about nursery schools <e> <s> is nursery education covered by that or will it be charged for <e> <s> where does that fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the minister for his reply <e> <s> however i made the comment before is it not for the house to consider the amendments or just the minister and myself by correspondence <e> <s> further the minister did not reply to my question as to whether nursery education was involved in this provision <e> <s> i raised the point of whether charges are to be made for nursery education <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one question on this group of amendments <e> <s> i presume that it is intended to prohibit charging even where the child does not eventually sit the examination for one reason or another <e> <s> will the minister confirm that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in general we welcome this clause but i have two or three comments to make <e> <s> first it seems odd that the governing body and not the teachers is to decide whether on educational grounds a child should not be put forward <e> <s> i trust that the government will make it clear that this power can be delegated to the head teacher from the governing body and that in any guidance the government issue that will be the normal practice <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down it is all very well telling parents but if they cannot do anything about the information given it is difficult for them <e> <s> does not the noble baroness agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear the noble and learned lords statement that he believes that there is such a thing as the community <e> <s> i believe that it is fairly obvious that the particular community of the various types of institution will differ <e> <s> if one were dealing with an institution in aberdeen covering agricultural research it would have a wider community than that of robert gordons institute <e> <s> however either organisation would be perfectly willing and able to recognise its own community <e> <s> that is the point that the amendment sought to make and therefore there could not be a definition of community <e>", "<cs> my lords on this group of amendments to which the noble and learned lord has spoken there are a number of questions on which i should like some assistance <e> <s> the first is why when the liability to contribute to outstanding loan charges is being transferred has the compensation for former employees to remain the responsibility of the local education authority <e> <s> it would seem just as logical to transfer the responsibility over to the higher education college <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> that amendment also includes the phrase at the end that the local education authority and the governing body of the designated institution <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not take up the time of the house in arguing the point further <e> <s> i shall merely keep to my own view as i trust i am entitled to <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to repeat what i said at committee stage or at earlier stages but it seems to me that in addition to the notable speech made by the noble lord lord grimond one has to consider the fact that the department of education and science is responsible for all education in england and wales including universities and polytechnics it covers the whole thing <e> <s> that is a vast responsibility <e> <s> then there are the eight scottish universities <e> <s> the secretary of state for scotland is responsible for all education in scotland except the scottish universities those universities which the act of union said were to be kept separate and protected <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i should like to ask whether she agrees that if our amendment were to be accepted it would be the secretary of state for scotland who would be appointing the universities funding council for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the one point upon which i would agree with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is in my disagreement with the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> it seems to me as a mere scot that we have spent far too much time in the house discussing purely english matters and not nearly enough time discussing scottish and united kingdom matters <e> <s> there is a tendency for scottish matters to come on during the dinner adjournment <e> <s> i have never noticed matters dealing purely with london being dealt with only during the dinner adjournment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> one cannot do other than describe amendment no <e> <s> as a piece of verbose waffle <e> <s> it does nothing to convey any sense <e> <s> the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord swann take out totally unnecessary words without changing the meaning <e> <s> therefore i strongly support the amendments to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords of this group of amendments perhaps the crucial one is amendment no <e> <s> a the rest of them seem to pave the way for it <e> <s> as the noble baroness said this is similar to the schools amendment <e> <s>

think of a ring-fence that is flexible <e> <s> the real problem it appears to me is to retain the staff needed for ilea to continue its job until the boroughs take over <e> <s> the governments response indicates that they have not really thought this out because to imply that various key people in ilea can also do the job in the borough at the same time seems to me a pious hope <e> <s> however i do not wish to divide the house and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> the situation as i understand it is that at the time of the transfer from the glc to ilea both the employer and these employees who understand number about or intended that the glc conditions would apply <e> <s> that is the reason for the difficulty because both the then employee and the then employer wanted this to be i do not know whether the noble lord the chief whip wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the chief whip is very anxious that we should get on and so are we <e> <s> however the chief whip has more power to allow reasonable hours for these debates than i have <e> <s> it is not on this side of the house that the delays on this bill have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume the bill will not be passed until some time later this year <e> <s> should have thought that is likely <e> <s> if so i should have thought that to go back to a date in in the normal sense of the word is retrospective <e> <s> in any event my recollection is that the abolition of the ilea was not considered by the government in the bill in july because it only gave certain boroughs the opportunity to opt out <e> <s> therefore the ministers answer does not meet the point <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a surprising amendment <e> <s> it says that someone who is employed by the ilea may enter into a contract of employment with a successor authority and that the ilea can do nothing about it <e> <s> someone can work six hours a day for the successor authority and whatever time is left with the ilea <e> <s> it seems rather hard on the ilea that it has no choice in the matter <e> <s> it is not to be consulted <e> <s> will the minister explain why the ilea has to accept such a joint appointment instead of taking part in making a joint appointment if it is suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps she can explain how a joint appointment can be made by one person who employs someone who is employed by another person but who does not consult the other person in other words the ilea and the ilea has to accept it <e> <s> that is not a joint appointment it is a person who is doing two jobs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am totally delighted that the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton should have this appointment subject to the approval of parliament which i have not the slightest doubt he will get <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord on the woolsack has not explained why this amendment is wrong or should not be put in <e> <s> there was not one word explaining what is wrong with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply which although delivered with his customary courtesy if i may say so without intending in any way to be discourteous did not seem to me to meet the point which was worrying me <e> <s> but i do not wish to press this point any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for putting forward these

the house i should like to say that i accept that <e> <s> however i am unclear of the remedy available to someone who feels that they should have been consulted but have not been <e> <s> is it a judicial review <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise one point <e> <s> the government gave an undertaking during the proceedings on the scottish bill which is repeated as regards this bill that any concession made in this bill would be followed up and that the scottish bill would be amended to the same extent <e> <s> i have looked in vain for these concessions in government amendments to schedule which i think is where they should be <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will forgive me while he is trying to read his notes may i say that there is one similarity <e> <s> we both use the same language and unless they are technical legal terms english words tend to mean the same <e> <s> we both use the same dictionaries north and south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has read his brief very well and i congratulate him on it but it does not answer the point <e> <s> the words in section of the scottish act with which i presume the noble earl has been provided are <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the scottish position on wilful refusal to pay <e> <s> there is no argument to say that the provision was put in because in scotland certain areas of the political spectrum put forward the idea of not paying <e> <s> if that were the reason for putting in the provision i am sure that the noble earl would have included it in schedule which amends the scottish act <e> <s> even with the threat in scotland of wilful refusal to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords the scottish position was not concerned with recovery of rates or a tax <e> <s> it was concerned with the whole business of civil debt <e> <s> there is no need in the bill and with these amendments to review the whole business of the recovery of civil debt in england <e> <s> as i understand the amendment i am only a scottish lawyer all that is being done is to take one procedure which applies to rates and put it into the general procedure which applies to the recovery of all other civil debts <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is on these amendments and i shall not take up your lordships time for very long <e> <s> we have had two very able speeches so there is very little for me to add <e> <s> it seems indicative of what happened that perhaps there was no consultation between the department of health and social security which took a quite proper attitude to nurses by changing them to students and the department of education and science <e> <s> no thought was given to how this was to be done <e> <s> surely the only fair way is to call student nurses students from now on <e> <s> with a predicted shortfall of at least recruits for nursing in england and wales i am very carefully not mentioning scotland by the year it is daft for the government not to give effect for this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for that very careful answer <e> <s> what baffles me about this whole bill relating to the community charge is that after both houses of parliament had in effect gone through a community charge bill in drafted by the parliamentary draftsman and revised with all the skill of this house and the house of commons and passed into force as an act the parliamentary draftsman drafting the bill now before us did not start with the scottish bill as his framework and go along from there changing it as necessary for english law <e> <s> the noble earl will be well aware that if two pieces of legislation covering the same subject are worded differently the courts will <e>", "<cs> my lords this shows that the government really have gone completely off their heads <e> <s> can i have an assurance that neither this amendment nor anything like it will be introduced into the scottish act and that there will not be the comparative amendment <e> <s> this amendment appears to provide it does not say anything about the recovery provisions so i suppose it is the same as we had before that if somebody pays their partners poll tax they go to the magistrates court and say jeannie was wilfully refusing to pay <e> <s> please put her in prison <e> <s> it does not seem to me that this does much for restoring the victorian values of family life if there were any <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned three other amendments which he has included in this group but unfortunately i did not hear what they were <e> <s> i am aware of amendments nos <e> <s> a and a and perhaps the noble lord will read out slowly the other amendments to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords my only comment about amendment no <e> <s> a is to express regret that the noble lord did not read out the new subsection a which is contained in the amendment <e> <s> having tried to read it myself i came to the conclusion that the only person who could have read it with any attention from anyone listening would have been the late groucho marx <e> <s> the basic result is something to which i have no objection <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one group in a series of amendments that are being made to the scottish provision <e> <s> the number of amendments that are being made to the scottish legislation continue to grow and will no doubt continue to grow at least until next week and possibly that is not the end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendments <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl lord selkirk has forgotten that we had the same argument when we discussed the abolition of domestic rates etc <e> <s> scotland act <e> <s> in that case i <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> this house decided in may that to say schedule or whatever it is has effect was incorrect drafting <e> <s> are we to take it that the draftsmen ignore anything that this house decides <e> <s> it was a decision of this house which the government accepted <e> <s> it was supported very strongly from the government side and had some support from myself <e> <s> are we to take it that the government just ignore what was agreed a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one question which i hope the minister will be prepared to answer <e> <s> we understand that amendment no <e> <s> zna or the redrafting of the provision is to clear up doubts as to whether the original paragraph achieved its purpose <e> <s> can the noble lord enlighten the house as to what the doubts were and how they are clarified by the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an amendment relating to churches <e> <s> i have no particular reason to oppose it but it is a matter about which there has been no consultation whatever <e> <s> is the amendment put forward purely on the basis that this was done for england and no consultation with scottish local authorities was considered appropriate or necessary <e> <s> what is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very interesting to have a provision that applies to england and wales and which is then applied consequentially to scotland on the basis that we have already discussed it <e> <s> in a sense schedule together with clauses and are the parts of this bill that concern scottish people <e> <s> this is an amendment to schedule which applies to scotland <e> <s> in principle i have no objection to the amendment <e> <s> i was just worried that there had been no prior consultation and that apparently there would be no discussion in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords in this rather long group of amendments there are various points on which i should like some clarification <e> <s> i start with care workers who are dealt with mainly under amendment no <e> <s> zg <e> <s> the conditions under which they become exempt are to be prescribed and various things are required to feature in the regulations which will no doubt appear at some time in the future it is hoped after some consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased with the result though not entirely clear whether the minister wants me to withdraw the amendment so that he can come back with his own amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i am grateful my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the amendments in reverse order starting with amendment no <e> <s> u <e> <s> the power given is very wide <e> <s> i should have thought that if the intention is that it is solely to tell the registration officer that people are receiving income support and have not applied for community charge support if i may put it like that then why not say just that instead of making it very wide and saying <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to amendment no <e> <s> zka i thank the noble lord <e> <s> it meets the point that i endeavoured to raise and meets it very well <e> <s> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> zn that is to bring it into line with what has already been decided for england the deduction of the community charge arrears from the benefit paid by the dhss <e> <s> that seems to be an unnecessarily harsh measure which will increase hardship for those at the lowest level of income but as the house has already decided that that is appropriate for england then no doubt it is appropriate that harshness for the poor should continue all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for trying to explain that the problem does not exist <e> <s> perhaps i may start with a legal whine <e> <s> it seems wrong that joint and several liability should be the name attached to something that is in no legal sense a joint and several liability <e> <s> it is a guarantee or an obligation <e> <s> it is certainly not a joint and several liability <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect possibly i am getting tired i think that the noble baroness is talking nonsense in saying that this is treating men and women equally <e> <s> it does nothing of the kind <e> <s> it is saying that in the case of a woman living with a man the man is responsible for her tax <e> <s> that is it straight down the line <e> <s> if each was liable for his or her own tax alone i should have agreed entirely with the noble baroness that it would be fine <e> <s> the husband or wife with no income would then have been entitled to income support and the per cent <e> <s> without the earnings of the other spouse having to be taken into account <e> <s> it is surely obvious that one deficiency in this form of taxation is that the couple who are both earning will pay precisely the same as the couple only one of whom is earning either because the woman has a young family or because there is no work for the person to do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the recollection or the detailed knowledge of farming of the noble lord lord stodart of leaston to enable me to talk about the sugar factory at cupar <e> <s> but i know of a more recent closure of a factory where the government had invested a vast amount of money and where the secretary of state was suddenly taken by surprise at the decision to close it <e> <s> that was the caterpillar company where much to the annoyance of the secretary of state a closure decision was implemented <e> <s> perhaps it is that kind of situation that we wish to prevent happening in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the government and the british steel corporation are withdrawing their threat that the hot strip mill at ravenscraig is guaranteed only until next year <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as little surprise to your lordships if i say that i found the amendments tabled by my noble friend lord williams to my amendment no <e> <s> convincing and that i am minded to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the remarks of the noble baroness will be read widely in scotland <e> <s> the number of children especially women who look after aged parents for years and who under this bill and the provision that the noble baroness supports would be thrown out is tremendous <e> <s> i hope that what the noble baroness has said will receive wide publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty has been pointed out by the minister that the notice can be given by the landlord time and time again on whatever specious grounds he may put it <e> <s> therefore he can threaten the tenant all the way through by always having a notice available <e> <s> there are landlords who are not quite as straightforward as i have no doubt the minister would be if he were a landlord but we have to deal with that situation <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will look again at this to see whether he can tighten up the amendment so that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say that we are very grateful <e> <s> it is an almost unique experience in this government to find a minister who is prepared to listen and then act on what he has listened to <e> <s> it is a very encouraging habit <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and i agreed with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie when he said that the courts in scotland were overloaded <e> <s> no doubt the minister is fully aware of that <e> <s> further it is a matter which can be dealt with very quickly <e> <s> it is very difficult for certain tenants to get into court <e> <s> if they do not satisfy the legal aid requirements certain tenants do not the cost of fighting over whether the landlord or the tenant should have carried out repairs is a prohibitive expense for them to undergo in enforcing their rights under their lease <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he will deal with the matter of costs <e> <s> the cost of litigating in a sheriffs court is considerable in relation to a failure to carry out repairs <e> <s> i am endeavouring to raise that major point <e> <s> the cost for someone who is not entitled to legal aid legal aid limits have been tightened recently is very heavy <e> <s> there is a severe disadvantage for anyone who wishes to recover through a sheriffs court that to which he is entitled in law <e> <s> a tribunal would avoid that problem <e> <s> perhaps the minister will consider that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for interrupting <e> <s> however the noble lord must consider that the cost of an application to say an industrial tribunal is very low compared to the cost of taking the same case to the sheriffs court if the litigant is not entitled to legal aid <e> <s> the cost of taking a fairly simple case to a tribunal dealing with rents is very low indeed compared with the cost of raising an action in the sheriffs court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the minister but he has made the confusion worse <e> <s> do i understand that we are to wait until we see the english bill when it eventually comes to this house and then having already passed this bill we shall know what it means <e> <s> there is something coming in the housing england bill if i may put it that way that if the government can get it through will affect the housing scotland bill <e> <s> it is a most unsatisfactory position if i may say so quite bluntly <e> <s> we are to consider something which we know nothing about apart from what the minister has said <e> <s> we are to have an amendment to this bill which is still before the house and could be amended by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought perhaps hoped is a better word that the government would look at anything that was said in any debate and consider it <e> <s> i hoped that the minister meant more than that on this occasion <e> <s> however if he does not and i understand from his view that he does not and that this is merely a formal i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i should make it clear that i have a copy of the cosla briefing <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister has a copy <e> <s> i am looking in vain for any reference to the noble lord having said anything about polls <e> <s> therefore he has a different brief from the one which i have <e> <s> the only reference to the noble lord is a quotation from what he is alleged to have said beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> he has a different brief from that with which i have been provided by cosla <e> <s> i think that we had better leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> my lords nor as i understand it does my noble friend lord kirkhill have any objection to giving the tenants the choice of transferring to a district council if they wish to do so <e> <s> however obviously the government do not regard choice as meaning choice but regard it as meaning something different <e> <s> the choice is free so long as you decide to go to where the government decide you should go <e> <s> in this amendment we are trying to help the government to allow the shetland tenants of the scottish special housing association to do what they wish to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the noble lords information quite contrary to the information which i have been given <e> <s> my information is that the member of parliament for orkney and shetland mr wallace and others have been fighting for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the support that i have received from the <e>", "<cs> my lords that would seem to be the perfect reason why there would be no need for specification <e> <s> you must trust somebody somewhere <e> <s> the idea that the secretary of state might inadvertently omit something from his schedule that he would otherwise specify seems to me to be terrible <e>", "<cs> my lords we from this front bench support the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate and congratulate him on achieving what i would regard as an almost impossible task of realising in the main a consensus <e> <s> on this issue of course we would not apply any whip <e> <s> members of the party to which i belong will be free to vote in any way that they wish <e> <s> however the front bench retains one or two worries about the provision of collective worship and religious education as set out in the bill <e> <s> the first is fairly straightforward <e> <s> why have the government changed their attitude during the bills progress through parliament <e> <s> in another place the governments attitude as i understand it was that the act needed no amendment <e> <s> perhaps we may have some indication of why there was that change <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> on this occasion the government seem to be rigidly set on a procedure which would require if they were dealing with space requirements an excessively bureaucratic process <e> <s> this small element of flexibility would allow something to be done because there is no information in the national curriculum on the space that may be required i hope i have the ministers attention it is much easier if only one person is speaking at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me if the position is that the government are going to issue guidance anyway what is wrong with their accepting this amendment which just says precisely that <e> <s> i do not see what we are arguing about <e>", "<cs> my lords i contrast the bill with the copyright designs and patents bill or even the financial services bill with both of which i was involved <e> <s> on occasions the opposition moved amendments which the government regarded as unnecessary <e> <s> if they were not inimical to the governments purpose they were occasionally accepted <e> <s> if an amendment fits the governments purpose although the government say that it is unnecessary because guidelines will be issued why

governments attitude is wholly irrational <e> <s> on that ground i press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it quite clear that certainly those acting for the front bench of the main opposition party have not been part of the bounty of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret this position <e> <s> i thought that the government had some attitude to accept the general importance of parliament <e> <s> the government are treating the house with total and utter contempt <e> <s> they have done so throughout our consideration of the bill <e> <s> the government have listened time after time to views expressed in particular from this side of the house on many occasion from the cross-benches and on several occasions from the government benches put forward by noble lords who disagree with the government and who have some knowledge in matters of education <e> <s> on almost every occasion the government have said this is what is in our bill <e> <s> we shall not even answer your argument <e> <s> we shall not attempt to answer your argument <e> <s> we stick by the bill <e> <s> in my view that is treating members of the house with contempt <e>", "<cs> my lords these are technical amendments <e> <s> they are some of the amendments not all of them technical which the government have enrolled for third reading <e> <s> it is perhaps worthy of note that more than half of the amendments that we have to consider at this stage of the bill are government amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not get into the incandescent fury about which the noble lord lord st john of fawsley spoke <e> <s> i have a difficulty in that i do not recollect my noble friend glowing incandescent <e> <s> he can occasionally be firm in his views <e> <s> indeed i hear him whisper that he was incandescent <e> <s> i regret that i did not see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i did not see that resumption of life <e> <s> the mouse of the noble lord lord st john of fawsley perhaps was suggested and certainly has been welcomed by the government at a very late stage in the bill giving us no time to consider this aspect <e> <s> it is totally absurd that we should be considering such a radical departure at this very late stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden accuses me of conveniently forgetting <e> <s> i have mentioned invergordon on i believe three occasions and each time the noble lord has conveniently forgotten that i did so <e> <s> he has not managed to come up with any reason why a very new plant was closed when the government would not change their mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done my best <e> <s> if i had had any suggestion from the minister that the drafting could have been improved i should have been happy for him to put forward an amendment taking out over and replacing it with or over <e> <s> that could easily have been done <e> <s> similarly i should have been quite happy if he had produced an amendment saying for any personal community charge <e> <s> i fail to agree with him but that is a matter on which no doubt we shall remain in disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very encouraging to have that information <e> <s> although the noble earl said that it had been given at a previous stage of the bill i do not remember that it was all given <e> <s> i think that we have received certain assurances now that we did not have before from the minister <e> <s> i am grateful for those assurances <e> <s> however what he has had to say about the timing of guidance brings us to the point that this bill is being rushed through without having been properly thought out and if i may return to the previous amendment without being properly drafted either <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with some interest and growing amazement to what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i do not think that he can really believe that <e> <s> as the noble lord <e> <s> lord renton told us at an earlier stage the act provided for attachment of earnings and restricted imprisonment to recovery of rates and certain types of tax only <e> <s> have never seen why that was necessarily a good way to incur state expenditure to try to obtain money for the state <e> <s> it seems to me illogical and parliament also thought that it was illogical for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the amendments <e> <s> it is pleasant to be going back to the old scheme before the legal aid scotland act was passed <e> <s> the application was granted backdated to the date of the application because

and learned lord for that short reply <e> <s> will he take steps to see that wide publicity is given to the decision that he and his right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in support of this group of amendments and deal specifically with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> due to the rules of the house it appears that it is not proper to speak after the minister has spoken <e> <s> therefore the minister will speak last to his amendment which seems a curious way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always suspicious of an assurance that there is no need for a provision saying that someone will do something because in practice they will <e> <s> if there is nothing in the bill in practice they may not <e> <s> if that is to be the practice what is the governments objection to putting it into the bill and making it a duty <e> <s> that is the difficulty the government never seem to face up to <e> <s> time and again they come forward with the idea that we do not need a provision in the bill because it will be the practice <e> <s> i have never yet heard them give a satisfactory answer to that conundrum <e> <s> if something is to be the practice i still do not understand why the government do not say that it will be the practice and put it into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as the last words indicate deals with schedule <e> <s> perhaps the minister can explain what is happening to schedule <e> <s> in clause of the housing bill there is the remarkable assertion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand this <e> <s> we shall shortly deal with schedule <e> <s> the government are putting forward amendments to schedule <e> <s> we are told that the schedule will never be brought into force <e> <s> why then are we bothering <e> <s> if it is intended that the schedule will never be brought into force why is there not an amendment to take it out <e> <s> if the schedule is to be enforced what is the point in having the provision even for a week or so when at some later date a court will look at it and say that it shall be deemed not to have come into force <e> <s> if someone acts on the provision in schedule if it is ever enforced and schedule to the housing bill is eventually brought into force and with retrospective effect abolishes schedule what is a court to do <e> <s> is it to say that the person acted on something that it now deems never to have existed <e> <s> this is a ridiculous position <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will consider the phrase in the housing bill to the effect that the schedule shall be deemed never to come into force <e> <s> if the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that if i raise something in committee in this house it is of less significance than if a member of the union raises it in another place <e> <s> do i understand that because i raised it and the unions have not raised it that it was of no significance <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that i raised it because the union raised it with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but my amendment is not intended to do any such thing <e> <s> it is intended to leave the three months for acceptance of the offer but to give a further period of three months for the lodging of an appeal to the industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that these points are now to be considered seriously <e> <s> i shall shortly ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> before doing so i should point out that the words reasonably practical that occur in

of state cares to give it <e> <s> it should be an effective committee <e> <s> the smaller the committee the better <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have rarely heard a more convincing argument for the amendment than has been produced by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> he said that the home office would never do anything other than produce a fair balance of interests

for a moment to the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> there is no similarity between a committee looking at the whole of penal affairs and a committee considering a firearms act and its operation <e> <s> we need only consider what we have done in the past months with the criminal justice bill which did not go over the whole aspect of criminal law and perhaps the -odd commons amendments which we have to consider on friday <e> <s> that is a far wider sphere and therefore there is logic in saying that the home secretary only refers certain matters to such a committee and does not give it a wide brief <e> <s> in this case the committee is operating in a restricted sphere and can surely think for itself <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be too technical and legal at this time in the morning but subsection a entitles the committee <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the obvious answer to the point raised by the noble viscount is that one should think of the <e>", "<cs> i do not understand the point that the minister has just made <e> <s> if the code is prepared it cannot be approved by parliament unless the secretary of state approves it first <e> <s> i do not see how the secretary of state could approve something which contradicted the guidelines that he was issuing to chief officers of police <e> <s> perhaps i am not following the ministers argument <e> <s> it seemed to me that there was inconsistency <e> <s> if one looks at subsection b one sees that the secretary of state has to approve the code before parliament can have a look at it <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment for exactly the reasons the noble earl has given <e> <s> there is nothing further that i need say <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must be aware that if one buys a house one must be sure that there is no deserted spouse who has rights to it <e> <s> i fail to see any basic difference between that situation and a letting situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of opposing these amendments <e> <s> all i would say is that this very useful bill which i believe that we got more or less right in this house has come back virtually unscathed <e> <s> i think that it is a matter for congratulation <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have no intention to oppose this but merely wish to welcome the usefulness of having this consolidation measure <e>", "<cs> my lords if these amendments were kept separate they would not follow correctly so i shall speak to them all together <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is a considerable improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords because i have a particular interest it was thought appropriate that i should speak from the back benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to everyone who has taken part in the debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham that one has to use some of the words used in the bill <e> <s> i took the words conduct connected with from the governments drafting in the bill as it is <e> <s> that is where it came from <e>", "<cs> my lords as we understood from the minister that the intention is only to take a swab between the lip and the gum i should have thought that there was a lot to he said for amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the amendment that was passed by your lordships is a better amendment to the bill as it was originally than the amendment we now have to consider <e> <s> the difficulties are fairly great <e> <s> before any issue of opting out is considered one must remember that the register of parents tends only to consist of the name of a person with whom the school could get in touch if anything happened to a particular child <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so

country may have a certain level of complaints that parents are deprived of a chance to get on the register a different situation could arise the following month with a school elsewhere <e> <s> if the secretary of state allows one and not the other a pattern of decisions will develop that is not consistent <e> <s> we shall be left with a situation in which the secretary of state choses which local education authority he likes which he does not like which type of school he lets out and which he does not let out <e> <s> that is a denial of parental choice <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> section does not say what a parent is it says what a parent includes <e>", "<cs> my lords all i wish to say is that i am very glad that the commons did not disagree to a radical extent with regard to the scottish sub-committee <e> <s> as a scot and speaking from this bench it would be unwise of me to say anything deterimental to the establishment of a welsh committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and the noble lord lord renton may or may not be correct <e> <s> i do not wish to enter into that argument <e> <s> but the amendment standing in the names of the noble baroness lady robson and my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey is not in contradiction of that assertion <e> <s> it seeks to add to the commons amendment <e> <s> therefore it does not disagree with the commons amendment but adds to it <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble and learned lord makes that point we have discussed for days at a time on this bill the question of whether people who have mental deficiencies of various kinds should receive rebates <e> <s> we have also discussed whether people in various situations for example people in care or carers should receive rebates <e> <s> those cases have all been discussed without the noble and learned lord on any occasion raising the constitutional issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the matter was not raised on second reading <e> <s> i think that was what i said <e> <s> it was not raised by the government and it had not been raised by the commons at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has never heard a worse point <e> <s> i have certainly made some bad points and i believe i have made many points that were worse than the present one <e> <s> however if the question of a bill being a money bill or a bill that raises the question of commons privilege was to be raised it would have been raised by the noble and learned lord not only in an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i studied the elements of constitutional law a long time ago <e> <s> i may well have forgotten many of them <e> <s> in view of the debates which have taken place in another place and in view of the suggestions that were made at second reading i believe that the house would have expected that some of the amendments foreshadowed at second reading might be suggested to be out of place by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> however i do not believe that the argument can be continued further <e> <s> perhaps i shall be allowed to sit down without being asked to say anything more <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will give way <e> <s> i do not think i said a word about the levels of pay of nurses <e> <s> i commented on the lack of year-olds to be trained as nurses which is a purely demographic issue <e> <s> i did not say a word about levels of pay nor did i criticise the government <e> <s> if i had thought about it perhaps i would have criticised the government but in fact i did not do so <e> <s> therefore the noble earl should not put into my mouth words that i never said <e> <s> i said that there was a shortage of year-olds and perhaps even the government will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords this disagreement took place in another place without any discussion as to the reasons for it because of the operation of the guillotine procedure <e> <s> it is satisfactory as this amendment in all its stages was a government amendment to have some explanation as to why the other place disagreed with it no doubt at the instigation of the government <e> <s> however having had that explanation i have no reason to disagree with it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the reason for this change <e> <s> what i cannot see and no doubt the noble lord will explain is why considering it was a government amendment moved on th july the government had not thought of this point at the time they drafted the amendment <e> <s> i can see that it is unfortunate to back-date illegality therefore i have no intention of proposing it <e> <s> however surely this point must have occurred to the person who was drafting and approving the amendment <e> <s> no doubt the minister will respond <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not wish to stand out as a lawyer but as an arithmetician <e> <s> a week after th july would have been rather earlier than th july <e>", "<cs> my lords while we have not got exactly what we asked for it would be churlish not to accept that water dripping on a stone has at last had some effect <e> <s> we are very grateful for that <e> <s> we welcome these amendments so far as they go <e> <s> they give the landlord some assurance that the valuation eventually achieved will be fair <e>", "<cs> my lords normally a bill such as this to increase the borrowing limits of a profitable and as the minister has said well run well managed industry would be passed in very much less time than the two and a half hours which the other place took to discuss the matter <e> <s> everything the minister has said is an illustration and many more could be given of the ridiculous nature of the governments proposals for privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord remember that the closure of invergordon was related to the governments control decision on the pricing of electricity <e> <s> their insistence on increasing the price of electricity unnecessarily was one of the reasons for the closure of the mill at fort william <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first regulation we do not dissent from the inflation-proofing of the legal aid limits <e> <s> we shall be interested to see the two-tier limit when it is introduced and have no objection to it that is if it is introduced and if the legal aid bill receives royal assent as i assume it will <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government are to be congratulated on tackling the issue of replacing section of the act <e> <s> we agree that it needs to be replaced and not merely repealed <e> <s> i intend to criticise some aspects of the white paper <e> <s> that does not mean that i agree with everything else or that i disagree with everything else <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the white paper does not include any proposal to bring the security services under some form of parliamentary control <e> <s> i agree wholly with what my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones said on that point <e> <s> it is also unfortunate that it does not do anything to tackle the issue of freedom of information <e> <s> this is obviously deliberate on the governments part but it is the necessary other side of the coin <e>", "<cs> i very much hesitate to intervene as a scot on something that is purely english <e> <s> i believe that there is an advantage to put into the primary legislation what the law actually means <e> <s> it is unfortunate to leave the definition to the subsidiary regulations <e> <s> i also believe that a court would be helped in general by always having disclosure of the sources of any information unless the reporter was able to say that for some specific reason he wished not to disclose his source of information <e> <s> therefore i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl lord balfour that the rules about looking after people under a disability perhaps need to be looked at <e> <s> however as he will appreciate it is essential and it is the courts main job in making these rules that the assets of the person disabled will be properly looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was endeavouring to make related to the separation of the executive from the judiciary <e> <s> someone has to make the regulations <e> <s> what is wrong with giving the power to the judiciary <e> <s> that is where the power is <e> <s> the regulation power can easily be the judiciary <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the robber fires his gun only if things go wrong for him

"<cs> my lords my noble and learned friends have said so much so much better than i can that my speech can be relatively short <e> <s> however the noble baroness lady carnegy seemed to think that it was a good idea that what the noble and learned lord who was sitting on my left when the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was speaking referred to as a dogs breakfast should all be in one bill

acceptable to the government because it seems to me to be unnecessary <e> <s> the purpose of the first amendment i should have thought was covered by the lines that follow that it is restricted to information regarding misdemeanours if i may put it like that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly add a little to what my noble and learned friend has said in support of the necessity for an index of charities <e> <s> the purpose of this part of the bill is to assist charity to assist people who wish to give money to charity and to assist those who are entitled to receive money for charity <e> <s> however it seems to me that the list wherever it is held and whoever compiles it is an essential item of any such provision <e> <s> it also seems to me that it is quite easy for the inland revenue either to prepare the list itself including the purposes of charities or to make the information available to anyone who should receive it <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate suggested that the need for this bill was the supervision of charities as if the majority of charities was some kind of group of delinquents <e> <s> i suggested to him that what was needed was help for charities <e> <s> it did not appear to me from anything said by the noble and learned lord that he was taking any course other than being the teacher keeping the naughty boys in line <e>", "<cs> is not the difficulty about which we are talking that subsection b of the clause does not permit someone like me to look at the list <e> <s> it seems to me that it only permits me to ask about one particular charity <e>", "<cs> of course i shall not press the amendment until i see what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i am grateful to him for answering the point raised by the noble earl lord balfour about tax on the maintenance of church buildings <e> <s> the amendment was specifically drafted with a view to include religions that were not christian <e> <s> i quite see that there may be some difficulties with certain groups of people who call themselves religions <e> <s> however the special position that i was attempting to put about churches i shall deal with the special position of the church of scotland later is that they have rules and they have set government set procedures <e> <s> in many of the churches this is done by legislation quite often by private legislation through these houses of parliament <e> <s> if they set down one way of doing accounts for example does this mean that under this scheme everyone has to produce two sets of accounts one to fit one body and the other to fit the other body of legislation <e>", "<cs> i wonder what the point of this is <e> <s> why should anybody suggest that something that is recognised by the inland revenue and has a base in scotland should never call itself other than a scottish charity if it wanted to <e> <s> why does parliament need to give it permission to call itself a scottish charity <e> <s> i rise not to suggest merely that this is unnecessary but to ask the noble and learned lord to explain what he asserted at second reading if my memory is right at col that this made no change in the scottish law of charity <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will not mind me reminding him that was not a definition of the scottish law of charity <e> <s> it was a case which provided that one had to apply english law to obtain inland revenue exemption <e>", "<cs> of course i accept that the <e>", "<cs> i think most of us would have some difficulty in recognising someone as charitable who for example left his books to the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that both the opposition and the government seem determined to create totally unnecessary offences <e> <s> no doubt the courts will be able to deal with them as they see fit <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord explain whether if there is a body of trustees and

of the trusts scotland act <e> <s> if he has considered it why has he not amended it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise the question of this clause standing part of the bill although i know that we are trying to make progress because of delays on the other matters <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord the lord advocate did not deal with the issue i am surprised at the noble lord lord macaulay agreeing so heartily with this point which i tried to raise in dealing with clause that someone will apparently be guilty of an offence because someone else has done something about which he does not know <e> <s> that person will have done nothing <e> <s> if one person in a trust holds out that the trust is a charity all trustees are according to subsection guilty of an offence and liable to go to prison <e> <s> is that what the government intend <e> <s> i cannot ask the opposition whether that is what they intend <e> <s> it seems a surprising intention <e> <s> it is quite contrary to section of the trusts scotland act which states that a trustee is liable only for his acts and not for the acts of others <e> <s> is that truly what the government mean or has the whole question of criminal intent gone and this is an absolute offence if somebody does it <e>", "<cs> i may be being obstinate <e> <s> i am sorry no doubt i am <e> <s> however there are trusts which meet once a quarter <e> <s>

learned friend lord cameron and myself to the rather lengthy list given by the noble and learned lord so that we can discuss them all at the same time <e>", "<cs> does the noble and learned lord really mean that the trustees of a trust which has been wound up will have to keep the records <e> <s> they will have ceased to be trustees at that point <e> <s> i read the subsection to mean that the trustees had to send the records somewhere so that they would be available <e> <s> it seems an extraordinary suggestion that the regulations are to say that some poor trustee will have to keep the records of an organisation which has ceased to exist and that he will have to do so for six years or longer <e>", "<cs> i recognise that a balance has to be struck <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord is well aware he can get to the court at any time <e> <s> within recent years he has gone to the court at an even later hour than this in the evening in order to obtain an interdict <e> <s> therefore if any lord advocate wished to go to court for a temporary suspension he could do so without any great difficulty <e> <s> i should hope that the noble and learned lord might reconsider whether he has the right balance <e> <s> in the hope that he will at least look at the issue i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment should be dealt with at the same time as amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> on the basis that that is correct i draw attention to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> unfortunately i disagree with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i cannot see anything in my amendment which prevents him from putting forward a scheme <e> <s> i am trying to give the court the final discretion as to what to do with the scheme and to allow

intend to press the matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i said that these were probing amendments but i am still wholly unclear as to where if one has in subsection a charity which is managed or controlled wholly or mainly outside scotland we shall get the scottish courts transferring its funds to some other charity that it or the lord advocate thinks of without creating absolute havoc with the judges in england <e> <s> however if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is happy so be it and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e> <s> this part of the bill is in a complete mess as regards who are parties to any of these proceedings except the lord <e>", "<cs> a great deal of clarity would be introduced into the obscurity of this part of the bill if the words management and control were defined in some way <e> <s> nobody knows except perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord advocate or those who drafted the bill and they are not telling us who it is anticipated are people with management and control what that covers and where it is covered <e>", "<cs> i agree with that <e> <s> it certainly should be improved <e> <s> but it should not be improved so that anybody who takes on a job with a charity is automatically liable to be disqualified for life from doing anything and may be sent to prison for six months for doing it <e> <s> we have to encourage people to act as trustees of charities not to pile on the penalties <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has an amendment which takes out the whole of clause and replaces it with a new clause for reasons best known to himself <e> <s> is it of any purpose to be discussing the clause which the noble and learned lord is just about to kick into oblivion <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether in dealing with this amendment we could have some assurance that clause will also be looked at as well because it really comes together with clauses and <e> <s> dealing with this amendment and the details of it i hope that the noble and learned lord or his successor may be slow to operate subsection at least until the court of session has given clear guidelines by decisions it has made so that the sheriff courts can have some knowledge of the standards they are to apply and the tests they are to apply <e>", "<cs> having received a promise to look at it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> like my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey i am generally in favour of some sort of advisory board <e> <s> however there is no assistance

procedure went through with a lot of assistance from the consumer interest <e> <s> however that has raised difficulties because it deals very well with the tradesman who is suing for his account or the person who is suing the tradesman for bad work but it raises terrible problems for the small claim which is a personal injury <e> <s> the case of that type of injured person does not seem to be met by the consumer interest as at present constituted in the consumer council and other consumer bodies <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment i do not think that i mentioned banks at all <e> <s> i

point will be looked at i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if my memory is correct a self-financing hope was expressed about the forth road bridge <e> <s> there was an attempt at some point <e>", "<cs> i oppose the question that this clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> the need for a conveyancing board or a conveyancing and confirmation board is not shown in any way except

certainly makes compensation <e> <s> but as a matter of english if that is what it does is not my wording better <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton does not agree <e> <s> no doubt he is much wiser than me <e> <s> the wording of a provision in any act of parliament should be straightforward and simple and create its meaning <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate agrees with my suggested amendment he will have plenty of opportunities to amend the act because he has done so at length throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with that <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord renton was disagreeing with something i said earlier <e> <s> that is my view <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the noble and

they become utterly confusing when you take away the clauses <e> <s> it does not tell you where you are going at all <e> <s> it seems to me that what has happened perhaps with the best will in the

mistake <e>", "<cs> surely the question of the noble lord lord renton was not whether the drafting actually did or did not exclude judicial review but whether the secretary of state and the lord advocate meant it to exclude judicial review <e> <s> presumably the lord advocate knows what he meant to do whether or not he is satisfied that he did it <e> <s> can he say whether he meant to exclude judicial review <e>", "<cs> i suppose that that means that the lord advocate did not know what he meant to do <e> <s> in those circumstances and in the hope that he will know by report stage i ask

second line of amendment no <e> <s> the second purchaser should read purchasers <e>", "<cs> there is obviously a difficulty in that if a conveyancing practitioner has to offer an interview with a

lord sits down perhaps he will also give an assurance that the conveyancing board will not impose a lower standard on conveyancing practitioners than the law society imposes on solicitors for conveyancing <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will look at amendment no <e> <s> and also take advice about the question of notices of inhibition <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> as the

offence is being created <e> <s> the secretary of state and the lord president are not to be punished if they fail <e> <s> surely that illustrates the futility of this subsection <e>", "<cs> we have in a sense discussed a lot of the principle that lies behind this amendment which seeks to rewrite clause <e> <s> i do not wish to depart from anything i said about that but it puzzles me why the lord president is debarred from consideration of the code of practice which is contained in subsection and is not to consider the question of the treatment of complaints or the indemnification of members <e> <s> the effect of that is to tell the lord president that he must not consider codes of conduct <e> <s> as the lord president is the final arbiter on codes of conduct for solicitors and advocates

confirm that i shall not be moving the amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord grimond introduced the amendment almost as if speaking to a clause stand part motion <e> <s> perhaps i may take advantage of that fact to inquire what are the purposes of the first two subsections of clause <e> <s> it is fairly simple to follow subsection and easy to recognise that it would be right for the english welsh and northern irish lawyers to have the same or equivalent rights to practise in scotland that would be afforded to an irish or french lawyer who presumably would be an advocate <e> <s> however it is completely obscure as to why the english welsh and northern irish lawyers are to be treated in a different way under subsection <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i said this on the previous amendment of the noble lord lord grimond but i repeat it <e> <s> if the provision is to give the english welsh and northern irish common market rights in scotland we have no objection to that <e> <s> it is on the understanding that the scots acquire common market rights in england wales and northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to be obstructive but if we are only trying to give the same rights to the english if i may take them shortly to cover the whole batch as we give to the french <e>", "<cs> the lord advocates last amendment removed from the clause any question of conveyancing <e> <s> we are now concerned only with pleading in court and conducting proceedings <e> <s> if the english bill contains a provision similar to clause as amended by the noble and learned lord a group of non-lawyers will be allowed to practise in certain specified courts in certain categories of proceedings and on certain types of business with restricted rights of audience <e>", "<cs> i do not understand the amendment <e> <s> it starts with the supposition that advocates have a different rule of conduct for the sheriff courts than they have for the court of session <e> <s> my understanding

<e> <s> a and would have supported amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in view of what my noble and learned friend has said i do not need to add anything to that support <e>", "<cs> one of the reasons for proposing this amendment was adverted to by my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey and was mentioned by the noble lord lord alexander that is to state emphasise and strengthen the obligation on advocates and solicitor advocates that they should enhance their service to the public <e> <s> that is something which is of great importance and has to be stated <e> <s> that is why the rule is so

amendment no <e> <s> in which my noble and learned friends lord mccluskey and lord emslie and i suggest leaving out and inserting <e> <s> as i said on second reading the provision is daft to use the kindest word <e> <s> no advocate or solicitor can be appointed a sheriff or a sheriff principal until he has served years <e> <s> paragraph a provides that <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will tell us how many have tried <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is that until the sheriff court act of the period for a sheriff was five years <e> <s> that was changed <e> <s> that act was not an appropriate act under which to change the period for appointment of court of session judges <e> <s> this is clearly an appropriate act because we are asked to approve periods for qualification for appointment as a court of session judge <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about that proposition is that there is no amendment to the sheriffs appointment which can perfectly well appear in this bill <e> <s> if one considers that the period of service has no point why have a -year period for the appointment of solicitors as sheriffs or sheriff principals <e> <s> why not abolish that too <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord wants to throw in that sort of logic then let him throw it in and we shall discuss it <e> <s> as it is at the moment it looks odd <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have any interest to declare <e> <s> considering the state of health of those who are senior to me in the outer <e>", "<cs> i do not see the point of this clause as it is drafted <e> <s> what happens if the agreement in the new clause is that the accounts should be taxed by the auditor of court <e> <s> is that prohibited <e> <s> it does not appear to cover that situation and that is a fairly frequent agreement namely that there should be a taxed account <e>", "<cs> the clause states that if there is such an agreement it shall not be competent for the amount due to be paid for the court to remit

of the person who is appearing <e> <s> we must be very careful that in widening the rights of audience we do not water down the quality of the advice that is available to a person who is appearing in a court which is after all by its definition intended to be more serious than a tribunal <e> <s> the latter concerns a specialised area <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the scheme should specify the category of proceedings and the nature of the business <e> <s> that is all very well <e> <s> you categorise that person so that he is allowed to deal with for example certain types of patent applications <e> <s> however as my noble and learned friend said what happens if the case jumps from that to a matter concerning something different <e> <s> at various times in practice we have all found that a totally different branch of law has suddenly appeared in the case that we are conducting <e> <s> we have to deal with it <e> <s> what is to happen to the person who suddenly finds that the case has moved out of the category in which he has a right of audience <e> <s> the bill is completely blank in that respect <e> <s> is he to say to his client i am sorry <e> <s> at the moment i have to stay silent and there is nothing you can do <e> <s> that matter must be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords when one looks at clause one sees no reference to any directive <e> <s> the clause gives a power to the secretary of state after consulting the lord president to make provision for enabling practitioners from parts of the united kingdom other than scotland to practise in scotland on terms similar to those given to other member states <e> <s> it does not matter whether there is a directive a directive or any other directive <e> <s> that is what the clause enables the secretary of state to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it seems to me wrong in principle that this country having decided in to stop prosecutions of war criminals and having in passed the genocide act without taking the opportunity of making its provisions retrospective should now go in for retrospective legislation over years after the event <e> <s> i also do not understand why the bill is framed in such a selective way <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord hailsham referred to the concept of selectivity <e> <s> we are looking at war crimes committed between and but why do we ignore italian occupied countries japanese occupied countries or even stalinist occupied countries <e> <s> further i do not understand why the bill refers to manslaughter and culpable homicide <e> <s> my understanding of english law may well be wrong but i understand that in england murder is committed by a person who causes death meaning to do so or meaning to cause grievous bodily harm <e> <s> in scotland murder is committed when a person causes death intentionally or is reckless as to whether his victim lives or dies <e> <s> apparently in this war crimes bill we are to prosecute people years after the event who did not intend to cause death because that is the necessary consequence of including culpable homicide and manslaughter <e> <s> is that really what we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it the idea included in amendment no <e> <s> is good <e> <s> however it illustrates the point to which my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey has already referred <e> <s> it is quite ridiculous that a new idea which has never been considered for english law should suddenly be introduced into a bill <e> <s> although the principle was discussed in committee in another place it was introduced only last tuesday in an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend lord cameron of lochbroom and i tried unsuccessfully to get rid of this clause when it was before your lordships at committee <e> <s> i am glad that at last wisdom has prevailed and i welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i tabled the original amendment i welcome the present amendment so far as it goes <e> <s> i am sorry that the government have not accepted my suggestion that the easy way would be for the secretary of state to nominate certain bodies as religious organisations because the present amendment raises complications <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord completes the sentence and in order to ensure that he does not offend others perhaps when using the word denominations he will say denominations and religions <e> <s> it is important that religions other than the christian religion should be recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords on a more simplistic note if the person required to answer the question says i decline to answer the question can he then be prosecuted under the terms of subsection or is such an answer one which cannot be used in evidence in terms of this new clause <e> <s> if that is the case we have gone round in a complete circle and no one has got anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i support amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble lord lord macaulay on the basis that there should be a similar provision in amendments nos <e> <s> and because the same standards should apply in both cases <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> it seems that there is a great deal of sense in amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord will no doubt recognise at the moment there is continual trouble about precedence between counsel conducting trials before a single judge of the high court and clashing with their duty in the court of appeal or in the appellate jurisdiction <e> <s> unless these people are not to have any rights to conduct cases before the high court as a court of first instance it is necessary that they should be dealt with on that basis <e> <s> if they are not to have the right to conduct cases before the high court as a court of first instance it is difficult to see why they should conduct appeals in the appeal court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear what the noble and learned lord is saying <e> <s> is he stating that in a speculative action the other party backed by the insurance company or whatever is to pay a higher rate of expenses <e> <s> if that is so i understand it but i totally disagree with the justice of it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble and learned lord will allow me to intervene because the provision worries me <e> <s> in clause one has a situation in which the agent and client can agree the rate of payment for a fee and there can be no taxation thereafter because they have made a written agreement <e> <s> is that to apply to a speculative action <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house and especially to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for missing the beginning of this debate <e> <s> there is a problem about the measure as it is framed bearing in mind amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> the whole suggestion seems to be that the decision is to take place before the child starts to give evidence <e> <s> those of us who have been involved in criminal trials have often encountered the child who breaks down at the start of giving evidence in the middle of giving evidence or at some stage after having started giving evidence <e> <s> is it envisaged that the live television link will then take place or be available <e> <s> if it is so envisaged will that type of trial suddenly be adjourned to a different court because there is not the available facility <e> <s> such a problem does not seem to be recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise merely to point out the possible difficulty which may arise during a trial taking place in stornaway <e> <s> for example one may have a child who freezes up at the sight of the accused i apologise to the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar for suggesting that this might happen in stornaway <e> <s> one would presumably have no television link installed and therefore one would have to move to say inverness when one was right in the middle of a trial <e> <s> one would have to move a jury of people the child and those who are looking after it together with the accused and so on <e> <s> if such a situation arises in the middle of a trial it is a very difficult problem to solve <e> <s> however no doubt the noble and learned lord has thought about such a situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say briefly that i totally agree with everything my noble and learned friend has said indeed he said it much better than i could ever have done <e> <s> i utterly support his views <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is absolutely necessary that these three linked items should have the same standard of proof <e> <s> no doubt the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would agree with that <e> <s> it seems daft that one requires corroboration for breach of a probation order but apparently no corroboration is required for a breach of a community set ice order or of an attendance order <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the authorship of the original amendment i have a clear recollection of moving it <e> <s> equally i have a clear recollection that it was handed to me by my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey who was unable to be present on that day <e> <s> perhaps that clears up any question as regards the copyright of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with a great deal of diffidence i rise to speak on this point <e> <s> it appears to <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to have to say that i do not agree with my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey on this point <e> <s> however i should make clear that i wholly agree with him when he says that these proposals in regard to the appointment of inner house judges are wholly and utterly unsatisfactory <e>"]
