of medical teaching resources in london in relationship to the country as a whole <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that while some of the reports recommendations are very tough they could be helpful towards trying to see how to use limited expert resources in the best possible way <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest and enjoyment to the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and would make the same comment as lord byers has just made because he obviously enjoyed himself very much in his knockabout and i think scored a number of points which were fair enough in the circumstances <e> <s> but there are other aspects of the matter and i warmly agree with lord byers that certainly at this stage of the game what matters most is that this man having now been appointed

in his speech i will do so <e> <s> i was refraining from doing so because i was enjoying listening to him <e> <s> i did not attack the nationalised industries i attacked the noble lord and his noble friends over the difficulties which they have created for the operation of the nationalised industries which is a very different point <e> <s> that was the point that i was making but i shall not take up more of his time <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while we all wish to see the prison population reduced we also expect his right honourable friend the home secretary to be aware of his responsibilities to protect the public against predatory characters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it would not be a wise precaution to have all packets of weed-killer which contain either paraquat or diquat marked poison <e> <s> although i take the point made by the noble earl that the directions are clear would not a red message marked poison on each package be a wise precaution which might easily save a serious accident and would cost no more to the manufacturer <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the amendment and in particular may i correct an impression which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether in the event the sharp raising of fees to overseas students has seriously decreased the number entering <e>

should like to add a word to this brief debate and i must apologise for having to go to a short meeting of deputy speakers when the amendment was starting <e> <s> it is an interesting point <e> <s> evidently the house is of the general view that these trial areas are a valuable experiment <e> <s> they could teach us much and could prove valuable and therefore we are all in favour of them <e> <s> what we have to think about are the optimum conditions to give them the best chance of success <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon with his usual persuasiveness has begun to alarm us about the possibility of things going wrong and local authorities wanting to bring the trial scheme to an end prematurely because things have not gone in the way they expected them to go and in the light of that two years would seem to him to be the maximum period that they ought to have <e> <s> the other side of the coin is <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the order which the minister can make will be anything between two and five years and what i am interested in is that the minister when he makes his order for an experimental area should usually i would hope give a period longer than two years <e> <s> the problem as i see it is that if we are to succeed with this idea and nobody can tell whether it will succeed although there are some areas in which it looks hopeful operators must come in and give a service and they must have time to establish themselves and to make their business profitable <e> <s> therefore i am most anxious that the period of the trial shall not be too short <e> <s> i would hope that the flexibility will be left two to five years and i would hope that when the local authority considers an application they would suggest that the trial should be for three or four years or whatever it might be <e> <s> i would myself regard two years as being too short a time to show whether or not such a scheme could succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies perhaps he could clear my mind on one aspect of this which is similar to the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> will he explain what happens at the end of a designation order whether it has been a success or a failure <e> <s> will there be a review a report or some publication <e> <s> if so what does the minister then do <e> <s> does the local authority reapply for an extension if it

been a kind of haze with not very happy results <e> <s> we have to try my suggestion and i hope that my noble friend will consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his attitude and that of his colleagues in venice in recognising that the plo are a factor must be taken into account in achieving peace in the middle east <e> <s> is he also aware that the anxieties of the

the debate on lord wells-pestells amendment no <e> <s> from which we seem to have gone rather a long way i should like to answer a point powerfully put from the benches on the other side by the two noble baronesses in backing up the noble lords amendment <e> <s> they particularly attacked the government side because the reductions proposed in clause which will of course make an economy in public expenditure are set against the background of a budget which has reduced taxation and particularly has reduced it at the top end <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the view expressed by the noble lords lord digby and lord ridley <e> <s> local education authorities in this country are highly responsible bodies and have records of decades of completely safe service in this respect and

surprisingly to him give him a little support on the first part of his motion <e> <s> as an old boy of the club of chairman of nationalised industries i have some sympathy with the first part of the motion <e> <s> chairmanship of a nationalised industry as those of us who have so been know is a very arduous job it really is a bed of nails <e> <s> you are on your own <e> <s> it is poorly rewarded in material terms though somewhat better now than when i started eight years ago even the honours which used to be distributed to those who took part are now withheld <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the noble lord to give me details of the private firms that do give index-linked pensions <e> <s> i simply do not believe it <e> <s> it cannot be done <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord glenamara will give me that information <e> <s> the fact is that in the public sector the pension funds provide what pensions they can and in order to keep at the level which has been set every year the employers section has to increase its contribution in order to keep the pension fund solvent <e> <s> private firms cannot do that they cannot go on increasing their prices in order to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give the noble lord a comprehensive list of what his party nationalised during their years of office from to <e> <s> i shall give him a supplementary list of those that his party is committed to nationalise now such as insurance construction banking and so on <e> <s> i earnestly ask the noble lord with the influence that he possesses to try to get some common sense into this <e> <s> unless we get stability our nationalised industries will never have the chance that they have in other countries to make the best of themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord has put up with many interruptions but i must say that private capital is lost on a large scale every time that happens <e> <s> if the noble lord understands the problem of making private capital that you have to start by borrowing and creating it he will realise that this is a loss which cuts deeply <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word on these amendments <e> <s> i very much sympathise with the needs of industry and it would be a mistake to think that local authorities do not understand the needs of industry <e> <s> certainly in the south-eastern region where we work very closely with the extractive industry we understand the needs very well and i think they understand the needs of the local authorities very well <e> <s> i should say to my noble friends that local opinion is very sensitive now about opening any new pit for the getting of aggregates which i am speaking about particularly here <e> <s> in the south-east there are very few areas left which have not been worked <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i put this point to the noble lord lord mottistone who obviously understands the needs of the industry well <e> <s> again i am speaking about aggregates <e> <s> the normal practice as he knows is for the industry to acquire areas of gravel-bearing land wherever they can get it to give themselves a bank as it were for the future <e> <s> they have a rough plan in their minds of how they might work these in the future long before they have got consents <e> <s> is that not sufficient for them to work on along with the kind of assurances given that authorities will renew consents where they ought to be renewed <e> <s> everybody knows that at the end of the day this material has got to be got in order to build the houses roads or anything else you want <e> <s> the industry has got a very strong argument in the end that we all want this stuff although we do not want it taken from the places we like <e> <s> is not that the right way for the industry to continue dealing with it by acquiring areas of land where they know there is gravel and phasing that accordingly <e>", "<cs> it would be ungracious of me not to thank my noble friend for his charming answer but he will of course admit that there was not much substance in it <e> <s> i am bound to say that it does not console me very much to know that ministers are going to give further consideration to this point when there is no commitment of any kind that they will say anything or do anything in the future <e> <s> i of course accept that this is not the time to make big new financial commitments and that was why i put <e>", "<cs> this is a clause in which the local authorities are very interested as well as the industry <e> <s> of course i understand the point made by my noble friends the industry is apprehensive as to how much this may cost it <e> <s> it would seem to me that once the first reviews have been made this new liability as it were will not be a recurring one because of course new consents today will carry the necessary conditions with regard to restoration and after-care <e> <s> so it will be rather once-and-for-all <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will confirm that point <e>", "<cs> may i briefly interject a technical comment on my noble friends speech with which i sympathise in principle <e> <s> the fact is that a great deal of technical progress has been made in the last years and from that point of view it really would not be appropriate to imagine that consents made years ago with regard to restoration were adequate <e> <s> they just were not <e> <s> none of them of course included such conditions as after-care which is absolutely essential in order to get adequate restoration <e> <s> while this whole subject of compensation is fraught with problems over which i have some sympathy with the industry i would hope my noble friend would bear in mind that the shortening of the period in terms of the technical progress in this particular field would not really be justified <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble baroness for her lusty support and i feel that it ought to have shaken my noble friend into conceding something though at the moment it does not look very much like it <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend made rather a bad point about the fictitious rock face which was to be chamfered to a degree slope at a cost of million because the fact is that all the orders have to be confirmed by the secretary of state and presumably he would not confirm such an order <e> <s> my noble friend will have to think again before he comes forward with another set of arguments <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for having another go and of course i give him credit for continuing to make grants of per cent <e> <s> for reclamation of dereliction in the assisted areas <e> <s> but that is no compensation to the other areas of the country including the south-eastern region with which i am particularly concerned which are not assisted and which therefore do not get grants of that size <e> <s> however that is a point by the way <e> <s> perhaps we could have a further discussion between now and report stage and particularly with regard to what is to be the scheme placing part of the burden on industry so that we can get some assessment of what the balance is that will fall on local authorities and can make an objective assessment of the prospect of the local authorities picking up the tab and doing it which is what we really want them to do <e> <s> then perhaps we can see whether we should accept that or whether we ought to try again on report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking now because the noble baroness lady robson has been kind enough to allow me to take her place not because i shall be hurrying off to dinner somewhere but because i shall be succeeding my noble friend who is sitting on the woolsack and unless i do it fairly quickly i shall not be able to speak at all <e> <s> so my warm thanks for her gracious act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to debate this matter at length with the noble lord he obviously feels as keenly as i do about it <e> <s> but time runs on <e> <s> i would only say that it is a matter of judg <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not also the case that they are both considerably under strength <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a brief word of support for the minister and ask my noble friend to take this into account <e> <s> the local authorities have a practical problem just as much as the industry has <e> <s> of course all those who are familiar with this subject understand that the industry needs to plan years ahead in order to keep its very expensive processes going <e> <s> we fully understand that <e> <s> on the other hand the local authority have very sensitive public opinion to handle <e> <s> certainly in the south-east region where so much of this aggregate must be got the sites being opened now become more and more sensitive <e> <s> it really is quite an important matter to the local authorities to get the timing of these developments in the most acceptable way or at least let me put it like this in the least unacceptable way <e>", "<cs> my lords allow me to confirm that i am quite happy to debate my two amendments nos <e> <s> and with the amendment of the noble baroness amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for so effectively opening the debate on this matter and for making the points with which we are all concerned to the effect that there should be a survey of past dereliction in particular <e> <s> the noble baroness made the point that my amendment is less strong than hers because i seek only a single survey <e> <s> i was optimistically supposing that since there is to go on to the statute book such a good piece of legislation so that effective restoration will be assured no dereliction will arise in the future from current workings and there will be only existing dereliction to tackle <e> <s> i am entirely with the noble baroness as regards the practical end that we want to reach <e> <s> we certainly want to ensure that no new dereliction arises or that if by some awful accident it does it is dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to call attention to clause of the bill to which my noble friend has referred which would give local authorities in cumbria new powers to make by-laws for restricting or prohibiting digging and other works in areas identified by them as being of archaeological interest <e> <s> cumbria is no different from other parts of the country in that respect <e> <s> i understand that in fact the county council only intends to specify some sites out of a potential of some in the county listed as of archaeological interest <e> <s> clause of the bill has a wider impact but is designed for the same purpose <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his lucid exposition of the new clause an important provision which introduces an important new principle <e> <s> i can meet the inquiry of the noble lord lord underhill about the views of the national water council because i heard their views today <e> <s> they like the noble lord have found the time all too short because they saw the amendment only yesterday and had not been brought into consultation on its form <e> <s> they and the water industry generally are perfectly willing to accept any liability which parliament wishes to put on them and in practice they have been makirg <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his answer but i must say that it does not convince me in the least <e> <s> i consider that the liability being put on the water industry by this proposal is absolutely out of proportion in comparison with those imposed on all other public utilities and is entirely unfair in the instance that my noble friend proposes <e> <s> the point that my noble friend has made gives water undertakers a course of action but that is all there is no question of putting them on the same basis as other public utilities <e> <s> i am not satisfied with my noble friends answer <e> <s> i feel that the consultations have been inadequate <e> <s> any liability in this context should be placed equally on all public utilities and then we could put the matter in the correct perspective <e> <s> i must advise my noble friends that i shall put down an <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel honoured to follow the noble lord lord ashby to whom i always listen with both pleasure and enlightenment <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord cranbrook on this report and his speech in introducing it which i thought was most masterly in its lucidity and analysis <e> <s> i should also like to

misapprehension <e> <s> i have studied it carefully and thought about it <e> <s> i believe that it would be better not to introduce annex ii even in this qualified form at this stage <e> <s> i believe it would be better to proceed with annex i which in my opinion makes an unanswerable case and see how experience works out with that <e> <s> there is quite a bit to learn for the planning authorities

qualifications or perhaps on a straight mandatory basis <e> <s> i offer those thoughts which i hope may be helpful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge who made such an interesting speech and who raised a number of interesting points in a most stimulating way with most of which i agree <e> <s> in the interests of brevity in my own speech i must resist the temptation to follow him <e> <s> instead i must stick to the few remarks i want to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> i would remind her that in december there was a vote on the second reading of my private bill making seat belts compulsory which was two to one in favour of the bill <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend comes to his peroration will he kindly say a word about motor-cyclists <e> <s> noble lords have had quite a bit to say about motor-cyclists and it is very important that we

"<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank noble lords who took part in this debate for making it a worthwhile and interesting occasion <e> <s> i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord mishcon for his very helpful speech and i am very sure that all noble lords were particularly interested to hear his precedent of membership of the wolfenden committee and the street offences act which was a very effective act in my opinion to deal with this difficult problem of prostitution forever with us but at least it does not now offend those who do not wish to take part in it <e>", "<cs> my lords those figures are disappointing <e> <s> we might have expected a bigger improvement than has been achieved even when taking account of the increase in traffic but is the minister aware that it is most necessary that there should now be a professional analysis of these figures and facts so that we are able to draw the correct conclusions and will he ask the transport and road research laboratory if they will kindly make this analysis so that we may have the benefit of it when we are considering this important subject next month <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill amends the substantive town and country planning act part v thereof <e> <s> its start was in the other place where it was promoted by my honourable friend mr stephen hastings and has of course had all stages approved in the commons <e> <s> noble lords and noble baronesses who are privy to the mysteries of planning legislation will remember having seen something very like this bill in the local government planning and land act which my noble friend lord bellwin introduced here in november <e> <s> noble lords will also remember that the house had more than enough of that bill and that in order to save your lordships staying powers the government dropped this piece of legislation schedule as it then was <e> <s> that is why it comes back again now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord and the noble baroness for their very kind reception and i also wish to congratulate the noble baroness lady birk on her welcome recovery it is nice to hear her in such good voice again after her indisposition before the house went into recess <e> <s> as ever the noble baroness showed a most impressive grasp of the complexities of this obscure subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> there remains little for me to say after that admirable speech by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however i should begin by saying to the noble lord lord houghton that i welcome his amendment on the marshalled list for giving this committee the opportunity to discuss the most important point in the bill but i agree with the analysis of the noble lord lord mishcon that if we altered the bill substantially then probably and i emphasise probably and not possibly the bill would be lost <e> <s> time is so short for the return of a private members bill to the commons where there must be complete agreement and there simply would not be time to re-open the major issues <e> <s> however speeches from the noble lord i would find in no way daunting <e> <s> i imagine that they will not all be minutes long but i am sure they will be very interesting <e> <s> i would say this about the amendments on the marshalled list in the names of some of his noble friends who cannot be here that for a private members bill where a good deal of work must be done to deal with technical amendments they should have been on the marshalled list before this morning <e>", "<cs> i certainly congratulate the noble lord lord houghton on handling this major issue so skilfully and at such short notice <e> <s> it is an ingenious idea and i congratulate the noble lord lord donaldson on producing it <e> <s> certainly it is worth further consideration but of course it would fundamentally change the whole structure of the bill and as the noble lord lord houghton rightly says it depends on whether the local authorities would be willing to operate it <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that i have <e>", "<cs> the thought here is that a local authority or the crown might allow its premises to be used for some artistic display which could be seen from outside and generally and then there could be a charge of indecency <e> <s> the thought is that public authorities of this kind should be trusted to ensure that their premises are used in a perfectly reasonable way for artistic displays and that they ought to be protected in doing so <e> <s> it is as simple as that and means exactly what it says <e> <s> i imagine that this amendment was proposed by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i think there must be a misunderstanding because i am sure that he would be entirely in favour of the provision <e>", "<cs> i cannot add very much <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury is perfectly right <e> <s> the word includes is repeated in the next line for a specific purpose and the two includes are linked to each other <e> <s> if means is put in instead of includes the drafting will then be defective <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel that he does not want to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby with unerring skill has put his finger on an anomaly in the bill <e> <s> the boundary of the bill is to deal with indecent display not with the general subject of obscenity <e> <s> the sort of activity which one might think about in this context an activity which is to be found in particular in the northern part of this country is the strip show <e> <s> strip shows are often to be seen in public houses and the like <e> <s> the bill is not intended to deal with that situation though it may be that some of them are obscene and ought to be checked <e>", "<cs> i recognise the noble earls great parliamentary knowledge and therefore the value of his opinion on this point <e> <s> the fact is that parliamentary counsel says that either form of words either open to view or exposed to view would mean the same <e> <s> so it really is a matter of taste as to whether your lordships wish to make the change <e> <s> i feel quite neutral about it <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear whether my noble friend lord belstead feels that there is any risk attached to it <e> <s> from such advice as i have been given i believe that there is not <e>", "<cs> we must thank the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby once again for moving an amendment in the absence of its progenitor and for the very able way in which he did so the example he gave of a -year-old marriea mother was a good one <e> <s> here again we are dealing with a matter of judgment <e> <s> if one fixes the age at then there may be some young men or girls of or even who will go into a shop and the shopkeeper will find it very difficult to tell what age they are <e> <s> some young people look quite grown up <e> <s> on the other hand if one sets the age at some children aged or may go into a shop <e> <s> the noble lord was good enough to give me part of the case against the advice given in the williams report that was a good age to set i would have thought that was an appropriate age <e> <s> i understand that the working party on vagrancy also recommended that was the age that should be set recognising that there is bound to be a bracket and nobody can tell absolutely what age a person is <e>", "<cs> i would suspect that this form of structure is fairly common in defining an offence of any kind actually committing the offence or attempting to commit it but how it applies in this particular case i would suggest is that if a shopkeeper was in the process of dressing his shop window with indecent material of this kind that would be attempting to make a display of the kind which is to be made illegal under this clause and if a constable saw him doing this and entered the shop to take action against him to charge him he would then charge him with the attempt to commit the offence because the shopkeeper would not have completed his offence he would only be in the process of starting to do it <e> <s> that is the kind of action <e> <s> i agree that it would not happen very often that the constable would be there at that critical moment and see the shopkeeper starting to dress the window but it could happen and because it could the clause has been drafted in this way in order to cater for it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i should like to say a further word <e> <s> i regard this as very marginal and i <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord houghton that this is an important amendment and of course it did receive a great deal of attention in the debates in another place which i have studied in the same way as the noble lord has <e> <s> we start from the position that the law now allows private prosecutions <e> <s> therefore lord houghtons amendment would remove from private citizens a right that they have now <e> <s> let me remind the noble lord lord monson that this is a right which the private citizen has at present and i would suggest that there should be a very strong case indeed before we take it away from him <e>", "<cs> i think that there is some misunderstanding in the noble lords mind <e> <s> this is not at all a question of forfeiture <e> <s> it is simply the removal of some of the material sufficient for purposes <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to interrupt him before he withdraws his amendment we might ask my noble friend whether he will confirm with much greater authority than i have that i have given the noble lord a correct version of the law so that he might then be completely reassured <e>", "<cs> these punishments have been debated and approved in another place <e> <s> i would not regard myself as an authority on what is the correct gradation of punishments for an offence of this kind <e> <s> i should have thought that it would have been extremely rare that there would be imprisonment ever awarded for such cases that fines would normally be sufficient and that it would be only where there was the most persistent flagrant and continuing breaches that more than the monetary penalty would be considered <e> <s> whether two years is more correct than one year i would think is a matter for judgment and something on which i should like to hear my noble friend before we conclude this debate but i see that it is related to some extent to the obscene publications act which has a maximum penalty of three years <e> <s> i suppose that the two years maximum was fixed in relation to that <e> <s> i would think it very rare indeed that the punishment of imprisonment would be inflicted at all and certainly a punishment of two years would be extremely exceptional <e>", "<cs> i would say that they have a colder climate but the answer to the noble lord is that the effect of these amendments would be to bring us to the same level <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will accept that three months does not sound very much but the noble lord lord houghton well knows that all booksellers newsagents and the like have been aware of this bill for at least the last six months and many of them have made the necessary changes already as again no doubt the noble lord also knows <e> <s> three months from the date when the bill reaches the statute book which hopefully will be by the end of next month gives them from the beginning of the year when they certainly knew it was coming along nine months <e> <s> i would have thought that that is really quite adequate time <e> <s> once the bill is on the statute book we had better let it go forward and become effective as soon as may be <e>", "<cs> i think the feeling of the committee is that we have spoken for long enough <e> <s> i hope noble lords on the other side will accept that we have had a very good debate it has been going for hours <e> <s> i do not propose to reply to any of the points which have been made <e> <s> every aspect has been covered and i am sure that the committee is now ready to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her support <e> <s> in fact it is very much to her credit that these amendments are down at all <e> <s> the only fears that my noble friend and i had were that we might have difficulties when the amendments go back to another place and we might be in danger of losing the bill <e> <s> but as it is quite clear that there is general support all round these amendments will now be made and then they will be brought into <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i support the noble baroness in her view <e> <s> this is a very complex and difficult field in which to legislate <e> <s> but on the ground there are cases not many where the unscrupulous operator does do things that he ought not to do and it causes serious offence locally <e> <s> it is most desirable that there should be effective action taken <e> <s> clearly in a private bill of this kind there would be an obvious danger when it went back to the other place of the industry interests feeling that they had not been sufficiently consulted on what is a very sensitive area

considering adopting these attractive advanced computer techniques does he also consider the increased vulnerability to industrial action that they import <e> <s> does he consider what safeguards if any he can introduce to protect himself <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we on this side of the house are much reassured by the statement that he has made <e> <s> is he aware that while we all recognise what an attractive idea it is to proceed with major electrification both from the point of view of the efficiency of the railways and their operation and from the point of view of the supplying and contracting industries unless the investment can show an adequate return this is not going to benefit us as a country <e> <s> this will be an additional burden for all of us to carry and for all the earning industries of the country to carry out of their profits <e> <s> we are much reassured that my noble friend and his right honourable friend in the other place are insisting that there should be shown an adequate return on these particular sections of electrification that are being proposed because only in this way can we be sure that we are really going to benefit by it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the leadership of a number of the arab states including egypt is distinctly helpful and moderate in this context and that a new initiative by my noble friend and his colleagues in europe with america would greatly strengthen their position which is already under considerable pressure from their militant elements <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> on this motion i should like to say a word of thanks to my noble friend lord avon and to my noble friend lord bellwin and also to the noble baroness lady birk who unfortunately cannot be with us today <e> <s> we have significantly improved the bill during its brief passage through this house and it will make a valuable contribution <e>

noble baroness is perfectly right this bill is of very limited scope it deals simply with indecent display and nothing more <e> <s> the greater part of the interesting and perceptive speech made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby was directed towards a different definition of the offence of obscenity <e> <s> as those of your lordships who have read the williams report will know that particular aspect is the one which the williams committee was dealing with in the definition which it suggested <e> <s> in this context which is a much more limited context the general thought up until now certainly in the house of commons has been <e>", "<cs> i think i can my lords give the noble lord some comfort in this matter <e> <s> first as i think he knows the seizure in this instance is not the wholesale seizure he has spoken of under the act which would be a seizure under a court order where the material is to be confiscated <e> <s> seizure in this case is to take a sample sufficient as evidence to bring a prosecution <e> <s> therefore the amount taken is tiny and will not endanger in any way the shopkeepers business <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will remember we had a very long and interesting debate on this point during the committee stage <e> <s> once again the noble lord has put the arguments forward very cogently <e> <s> the first point which i ought to make to the house is that the right of private prosecution is a common law right which belongs to every citizen of this country now and always has <e> <s> nothing is being put into the bill <e> <s> what the noble lord is proposing is that that common law right should be removed <e> <s> therefore the onus is absolutely on his shoulders and broad they are to show why it should be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord merely to remind him that savonarola was burnt in the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the assurance that he requires that the defendant does have an absolute right under the criminal law act to opt for trial by jury <e> <s> it is for the magistrates to decide whether they would wish to take the trial summarily if they think that it is a lie defence they then put to the defendant whether he would wish to be tried summarily or prefer to go for trial by jury <e> <s> he then has the choice <e> <s> therefore the option and the right are firmly his <e> <s> he cannot opt to be tried summarily if the magistrate decides that in its nature it is a serious offence and should go to the higher court but he always has the right to opt for trial by jury if he wishes it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin my few remarks by paying a tribute to our chairman the noble lord lord cross of chelsea for his leadership of the committee and for welding us into a team for this tremendous marathon <e> <s> it is i suppose a matter of some interest that five peers with the noble chairman from quite different sources and with different political convictions should all have reached the same conclusion on this somewhat controversial subject <e> <s> i think that was a good deal due to the leadership of the chairman who saw that we all soaked in equally the facts as they were poured upon us in the months that we sat there so i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i should like to remind him that he has just acquitted me of charging him in regard to repeating debates that have been gone over in another place <e> <s> i

stage of this bill and i cannot believe that noble lords would really wish to do that <e> <s> it would of course automatically remove half the people who would be subject to the law if we made the wearing of seat belts compulsory only for front seat passengers <e> <s> the number will automatically be halved if we take out all the drivers <e> <s> in fact rather more would be taken out because a good many people drive on their own without passengers <e> <s> so the effect would be substantially to reverse the decision which we took before and i feel sure that noble lords would think many times before wishing to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with other noble lords in asking my noble friend the minister to make progress in this particular field <e> <s> if the compulsory wearing of seat belts is to be the law of the land then a major improvement in their design is very much needed <e> <s> my noble friend lord cork and orrery has provided us with a useful debate which calls

they have got to try to cover everything so far as they can <e>", "<cs> it might help the noble lord and the house if i said that from my point of view i would welcome this amendment and i think it is reasonable that it should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> i am addressing my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson is technically right <e> <s> there are cases where men and women survive accidents probably for one cannot prove it because they were not wearing seat belts <e> <s> the transport and road research laboratory did a study on this <e> <s> they made an estimate a very broad one that it is probably something like one in cases but such things do happen <e> <s> on the other hand as we all know wearing a seat belt roughly doubles ones chances of surviving <e> <s> that is the whole justification for proceeding with the law <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if i give a partial answer to my noble friend

i have had no advice that that level of fine has been found onerous in practice <e> <s> of course i have no doubt that the magistrates courts have never levied fines at that level undoubtedly where there have been breaches of the motor-cycle helmet law the fines have been at a very much lower level <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i briefly explain to my noble friend that i have not been quite so guilty as he makes out <e> <s> my first shot at this was to put down the same clause as was contained in my private bill which applied affirmative resolutions to only part of the provisions in clause <e> <s> when my attention was called to this point i proceeded to amend that new clause <e> <s> whenever one amends a new clause which was originally drafted by parliamentary

lords i feel i must say a word here in support of my noble friend lord bellwin sorry though i am to find myself in conflict with the noble lord lord underhill who has been such a valued and stalwart supporter of mine through much of this bill <e> <s> the fact is that we really did decide this issue at report stage and as the noble lord reminded us we divided on it <e> <s> he made out a very attractive case and the result was that he got a great many people into the lobby with him <e> <s> it is the type of case which one can always make out very persuasively because it seems to give an option which gives a rather serious matter a merciful application and i can understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank my noble friend lord bellwin for his able conduct of this long and difficult bill <e> <s> i would also congratulate my right honourable friend the minister of transport for finding time to legislate on road safety <e> <s> it does not get much attention in this busy world but of course the annual toll on the roads is gigantic <e> <s> some quarter of a million people are killed or injured each year <e> <s> it is an enormous figure and we all too easily

reduction of manpower in local government services is very welcome news for the hard-pressed ratepayers of this country <e> <s> is he aware also that the noble baronesss good debating point that this is increasing unemployment does not really have much substance because in many cases the high financial burden of rates at the present time is handicapping industry and commerce and so causing more unemployment <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that in the forthcoming review based on his green paper we look most hopefully to a new system of financing local government which will make a fairer distribution of the financial cost of local government upon more shoulders and with a considerable reduction on the shoulders of industry and commerce because that is the best way of getting a more competitive edge to our industry and commerce and so increasing employment rather than reducing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested to listen to the noble lord lord energlyn with his expert

myself and to the clerk and i echo them <e> <s> no chairman of a select committee ever had better colleagues than i had both in the wisdom they contributed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the university of surrey has a faculty of hotel catering which is an extremely popular one and the only one in the country <e> <s> is he further aware that the governments recent financial cuts dealt to surrey were to the tune of some per cent <e> <s> is he aware that if he wants to see hotel and catering trades encouraged by further training for undergraduates to become graduates in this important activity it would be wise to be a little more liberal with finance to the only university that has a faculty for this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that informative answer <e> <s> does it mean that the police will have an obligation to appear at these applications for licensing and give evidence in the same way that they would before a magistrates licensing bench in an application for a liquor licence <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that mr sullivan who claims to be the owner of the largest chain of sex establishments in the country has recently been convicted in the snaresbrook <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate my noble friend lord bellwin on his clear and lucid exposition of these regulations and indeed on his moving of them at the end of this long saga to which the noble lord lord underhill and the noble baroness lady stedman have referred <e> <s> it is the final act of a piece of legislation which i believe will bring much benefit to life and limb and i should like to thank all those who have supported me over this long period <e>", "<cs> my lords while my noble friend is being accused of obdurate behaviour in the governments unwillingness to concede the very large increase sought by the unions on the other side is he aware that the government have been seen as representing the general interest of the nation as a whole and especially of the taxpayer and indeed the whole of industry in settling a level for the increase which had some relationship to the general level of increase which could be paid in industry which has to earn the living of the community and provide for these funds in the first place <e> <s> the representation that the government have been obdurate and unreasonable does not fit the picture at all <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us whether in the dockland development corporation scheme in the very impressive development of houses for sale which has already occurred in the past months there is a portion for shared ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the new leader of the soviet union has declared that soviet policy rests upon the invincible might of the soviet union and will he therefore take care to see that the soviet union takes some steps in this direction before others commit themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that there seems still to be some need for the director of public prosecutions to clear his mind on the line which my noble and learned friend has just explained <e> <s> because last september in the croydon magistrates court summonses were taken out by a scotland yard chief superintendent under section of the obscene publications act which would have committed the astra video company to trial before a jury and on conviction to a custodial sentence and the dpps representative had these summonses stopped so that the prosecution proceeded under section with only a possible punishment of forfeiture of the objectionable tapes <e> <s> as these video tapes were declared by the magistrates to be of an exceptionally violent nature i would ask that my noble and learned friend would confirm that he himself is confident that the director of public prosecutions does understand that we in parliament expect that the law on obscene publications weak though it may be be allowed to be prosecuted with the full force that parliament has given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house when the automation of ticket issue and collection of london underground will be completed from its far-from-completed position now <e> <s> can my noble friend also say how many personnel will be saved when it is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is an early diagnostic unit in guildford and that very authoritative medical opinion in guildford is convinced that it has the greatest <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by thanking my noble friend lord orr-ewing for initiating this interesting debate and by adding my congratulations to those of others to the three maiden speakers who each made a speech of great interest so much so that we look forward with great pleasure to hearing them often again <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i should like to say for the record <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if he followed the advice given to him by the leader of the opposition the imf would be unable to make loans to any iron curtain country or to any south american country which has scant regard for the liberty of the subject and that its general purpose in assisting the economies of weak countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that partly reassuring answer <e> <s> is he aware that new jobs in this desolate dockland area are a wonderful prospect which should not be lost on any account <e> <s> is my noble friend able to say more definitely that there could be the prospect of the secretary of state vesting this land in the docklands <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the private sector has to bear the risks of the market in competition with overseas competitors who command the overseas markets as well as exporting to our own market <e> <s> it is because they have to bear that trading risk that it is necessary to give the private sector this assistance whereas the nationalised industries in the main have protected and in many cases monopolistic positions <e>", "<cs> my lords while any offer to reduce russian arms is welcome can my noble friend confirm the impression that the russian offer would have the effect of reducing their medium-range missiles to some extent but of removing ours altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord jenkins of putney asks his question i wish to rise on a point of order on the question because i believe that the question in its present form is in breach of our standing orders <e> <s> i refer particularly to the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to my noble friend the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords having raised the matter perhaps i may add just this <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the leader for the helpful statement which she has made and for myself i am very happy for it to be referred to the committee on procedure which happens to be meeting next week <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if i may say so for us to divide on an issue like this <e> <s> the fact is that in this noble house we are each one of us responsible for order and there is no machinery as there is in the house of commons with which many of us are familiar for deciding these matters in a more rational way <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we shall never reach a settlement of this long running difficulty until the plos voice is heard in some way in the international context <e> <s> however much we may sympathise with israel and i dare say that most of us do we shall have to find a way for the plos voice to be heard in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for his statement and he and his right honourable friends for setting up this inquiry <e> <s> may i also thank sir david serpell and his committee for the report <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that we appreciate that the government are trying to strike the right balance between this huge sum of money million a year which the taxpayer is now providing for subsidising the current operations of the railways and the sort of natural sympathy which most of us have for the railways themselves <e> <s> i dare say that in my generation it dates back to our childhood wish to be an engine driver but certainly the sympathy is there and we do feel for the railways especially if we could see a steam engine <e> <s> that really does give us a thrill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for repeating the statement and to say how sorrowful it is to me to see this great industry in this parlous condition <e> <s> i speak in particular in the light of my own experience <e> <s> i was chairman of the njic and in the past i have conducted similar negotiations <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that workers in <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the leader of the house agree that the four questions on the order paper today are models of brevity and conformity with the rules of order and much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should apologise to my noble friend for the fact that i was on the telephone when the answer was given <e> <s> in regard to this very worrying dispute is my noble friend aware that the major clause in the agreement that the unions have with the employers provides that in the event of industrial action every effort shall be made to avoid harm to the health of consumers <e> <s> in this particular context and in wider contexts it will become increasingly difficult to maintain and to discharge that very important obligation of the employees each day the water strike continues <e> <s> will my noble friend take note that there really is a very weighty obligation on the three unions concerned to consider much more closely the reasonable offer that they have been made and to bring this damaging strike to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for giving us the opportunity to have this very interesting debate this afternoon particularly calling attention to the problems of the impact of modern farming technology on our countryside as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it has disappeared into the hands of owner-occupiers <e> <s> up to a point that is most commendable and i myself have been one in the past but the point is that there is a certain amount of land remaining <e> <s> but what is happening now is that because of the restrictions of landlord and tenant legislation landlords when they get the chance of getting land back into their possession are not going to let it again so there are less and less tenancies for young men to take up <e> <s> that is a point which my noble friend on the front bench is well aware of and i hope that before long there may be legislation to make the position a little less tight <e> <s> that would be for the benefit of everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords to me falls the pleasure and privilege of congratulating the noble baroness lady nicol on her maiden speech which she executed in such an expert and charming manner <e> <s> may i congratulate her on the brevity of her speech which not all of us always quite copy but it is an example we could all take note of <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate her on her success in keeping within the hounds of non-controversy on a subject about which she clearly feels very deeply <e> <s> we all listened with attention to her comments about local government and it is clear that in the noble baroness we have a doughty warrior for the local government cause one who will have something quite trenchant to say when she is no longer restrained by the maiden speech convention <e> <s> we look forward to hearing from her frequently in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he has not given an answer to my major question and proposition what provision is he intending to make for the industrial relations structure of the water industry in the future <e>", "<cs> a very bad answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i raised this in the first place may i make the point that the standing orders are the standing orders of every peer and the responsibility for keeping them rests equally on all of us <e> <s> it is not for just one or two peers to call attention to breaches it is an equal responsibility for all of us and it would make it less invidious if it were more generally borne <e>", "<cs> may i say a word to support my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> one of the difficulties especially with a very small board like this is to try to get the right balance in so far as anybody represents anything <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett makes a good point here these people are there to manage the whole bag of tricks not just to represent one particular interest <e> <s> if an additional member of a board is to be brought in to represent agriculture or fisheries then the case for all the other people local government industry recreation uncle tom cobbleigh and all is made out <e> <s> no doubt before my noble friend lord bellwin has finished he will hear a lot about all this <e> <s> he will have to enlarge his boards by about times <e>", "<cs> may i add just this for the edification of my noble friend lord onslow the land drainage function does extend from the rivers which the water authority manages to the farm <e> <s> in the management of the river the water authority is responsible for seeing that not only is the river running as it should but that it is dredged and managed in such a way that the watercourses part of which will also be the responsibility of the water authority are kept clear so that the gradients from the farms draining the water actually from the fields will flow smoothly into them <e> <s> so there is a direct practical link there which flows from the days when the river authorities were responsible for the management of land drainage <e> <s> this was inherited by the water authorities and it is essential that there should be some direct link between the hoards of water authorities and the farming world <e> <s> to some extent it is the same in fisheries <e> <s> the water authorities have a very good record here in the hatcheries they have set up to breed fish for stocking in order to improve the fisheries in the rivers <e> <s> once again there is a direct practical relationship there and that is reflected in this particular constitution <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend comes to the end of this debate i wonder whether he would give further consideration to the suggestion made by my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> there is not all that much between the government and those on both sides who have moved amendments <e> <s> the amendments ask only for the same number <e> <s> it is simply the machinery of how those people are to be selected which is at issue <e> <s> my noble friend lord onslow suggested that perhaps six or eight members might be nominated by the local authorities concerned <e> <s> the minister would then have a choice <e> <s> perhaps there is some way of bringing minds together <e> <s> there seems to be so little between both sides that it is a pity to disagree over it <e>", "<cs> may i make this point <e> <s> nationalised industries have had a rather rocky record over the years <e> <s> my own feeling about them indeed my own experience is that success depends basically on the relationship between the secretary of state and the chairman <e> <s> for the industry to be successful the chairman of the nationalised industry whomsoever he may be has to make winning the confidence of the secretary of state his first concern <e> <s> however important all the industrial considerations are and they are weighty he must be able to win the confidence of the minister <e> <s> so often these industries get into trouble because for one reason or another that confidence does not exist <e> <s> it is in relation to that particular matter that i believe my noble friend is right in sticking to his point that if there is to be a deputy chairman it would be better if he were appointed by the secretary of state so that if he does have to act there is a reasonable prospect that there will be a good relationship between them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add a few words <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall not be quite so helpful to my noble friend on this amendment because i think that there is real substance in it <e> <s> i differ from the noble lord lord melchett only on one point <e> <s> i should have thought that one member on each regional board covering both water recreation and wildlife and conservation generally would be all that the hoards could comfortably contain <e> <s> but the case for including such a person is very strong indeed <e> <s> i urge my noble friend to think about this again <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is only one of a number of programmes which has caused a great deal of offence <e> <s> will my noble friend consider asking the chairman whether he would be good enough to attend on the home secretary to explain what are his difficulties in conforming with the very specific terms of the act with regard to standards of decency <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we have been informed that the new cable television when it comes into operation will be safeguarded this is the governments term by a similar safeguard for standards of decency there <e> <s> but is he aware that the position is so often unsatisfactory with the existing media that we really need something a good deal stronger if cable television with all its possibilities has nothing better to offer than that <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> i recognise that the somewhat complicated machinery that my noble friend has contemplated and described to us will indeed provide what is required <e> <s> it has to be done in this curious way because the noble lord is abolishing the national water council and therefore he has to find some other statutory body to take its place <e> <s> it does do it <e> <s> it brings in all the other water authorities <e> <s> it will bring in the trade unions as well and therefore it will provide a similar structure to what we have now <e> <s> for myself i am perfectly satisfied <e> <s> does the noble baroness wish to speak <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> as my amendment was the start of this interesting discussion i should like to thank your lordships for making it such a worthwhile debate <e> <s> i confess that my motive for putting it down was not really in the belief that my amendment would be accepted <e> <s> back-bench amendments are very seldom accepted in any circumstances and as i anticipated in my opening speech both front benches united against me so i was sunk from the start <e> <s> my only noble friend was lord howie of troon on the back-benches at the opposite end of the chamber who saw that there was some validity in the point that i was putting forward <e> <s> any suspicion that the noble baroness lady fisher might have had that this was some deep-laid plot which was to bring in by the back door the start of the governments new policy on the matter must have been completely swept away by the gallons of cold water which were poured on my amendment very charmingly by my noble friend lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords after that interesting interlude between the usual channels who do not usually fire off at each other in the house i would only add that we are all well aware of what happens to private members bills <e> <s> many of us have moved them from time to time <e> <s> we get the best consideration from whichever side forms the government but one has to accept at the end of the day that private members business however important it is has to take second place to government business <e> <s> this means that from time to time one must give way and have ones business postponed <e> <s> i realise that the noble lord lord molloy in this particular case has had to put up with this two or three times <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy for him <e> <s> i have had some experience of private members bills myself <e> <s> but the fact is that two wrongs do not make a right <e> <s> if he has been unlucky in being asked to postpone business it still does not justify his asking the house to repeat business which has been debated already in which he could have taken part but in which he did not and which is still to be debated on the report stage <e> <s> it really does not make sense to conduct business like that <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord has heard the governments reply he will be informed as to what now is the measure of aid <e> <s> it does in fact go a very long way to meet the point which lord molloy has been putting before us <e> <s> in my own judgment it probably substantially satisfies it but perhaps i should myself wish to reserve my opinion on this point until i hear the further debate which will take place on the report stage of the transport bill a debate in which no doubt lord sefton will wish to take part to see whether there is a substantial area not covered when the government and the noble lord lord underhill have given further consideration to it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point which has absolutely no relevance whatever <e> <s> i have no idea of what he is going to say well i do have a pretty good idea because i have seen what my noble friend lord bellwin said in answer to the amendment which is the same as this bill which the noble lord lord underhill moved <e> <s> if the noble lord lord molloy has not read <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened with interest and sympathy to the noble lords moving speech <e> <s> he regretted that a note of bitterness should have come into the debate so do i but it did not come from this side <e> <s> there is just one point on that which i should like to make <e> <s> it was a charge made in particular by the noble lord lord hatch that any opponent of the bill was an opponent of the travel concessions for the unemployed <e> <s> that of course is totally wrong <e> <s> if the noble lord has listened to my noble friend the minister lord lucas he will know and all noble lords who heard it will know that there is quite a range of assistance <e> <s> it is possible it may even be probable that something more needs to be done in that particular field <e> <s> but one thing which is absolutely clear is that this is not the right bill in which to do it because this bill will be tacked on to section of the act where it does not fit particularly well because that section is particularly for the assistance of the elderly and disabled <e> <s> therefore technically the use of this bill is not necessarily the right way in which to achieve the excellent ends for which the noble lord lord molloy has so eloquently pleaded <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the value of religious education in the schools depends primarily on the individual teacher that it is the spark of christian love in the teacher which touches the children and makes the education worthwhile <e> <s> is he satisfied that the teacher training for religious education is adequate to meet the need <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords is my noble friend aware that it does just happen that religious education is the only specific item of education referred to in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that after the questions that were put to him last week about religious education some noble lords will be disappointed to find that there is no word about that in the whole of this white paper <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me whether this is a subject which my noble friend and his noble friends and right honourable friends will really take seriously <e> <s> is he aware that most of us think that the christian heritage based on roman civilisation is the whole basis of our lives and that unless children are taught this at school or at any rate given a rough idea of it the major foundation of our whole civilisation is omitted <e> <s> will my noble friend undertake to convey to my right honourable friend the secretary of state our very deep concern that in the whole of this white paper which i have skimmed rapidly through there is no word about this as a qualification which should be sought for in at least some teachers who are to teach in our schools today <e>", "<cs> my lords as there seems to be a difference of opinion between the two sides of the house is my noble friend aware that on this side the wish to see the coal industry built up into a highly productive and efficient industry as a major part of the economy of this country is at least as strong as in noble lords opposite and that the new leader whoever he may be is a man of critical importance especially in the field of marketing if this is to be achieved <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the transfer fee heavy though it is and of course to many of us undesirable though apparently unavoidable is small money compared with the huge subsidy which our taxpayers are at present bearing of million a year to keep the coal industry going <e> <s> so if this man has the qualifications of leadership which we recognise and which noble lords opposite recognised in when they appointed him deputy chairman of british leyland he may very well be able to give the lead in the reconstruction which is needed in this industry to bring about the very great contribution which it can make towards our whole economy <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while there is of course anxiety about the rising trend of nitrate levels in drinking water supplies the standards set by the eec are significantly higher than those set by the world health organisation and that there is no certainty that there is a medical necessity to reach such a very high standard <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add one point to support my noble friend <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one point to my noble friend <e> <s> although i was not able to support him on this matter on committee stage i shall support him because he won the vote the last time <e> <s> the position follows from what the noble lord lord melchett was saying that agriculture and fisheries and the minister of agriculture and fisheries have the constitutional position of appointing two members who are knowledgeable in farming or land drainage as is specified and in fisheries matters <e> <s> this follows the construction of the water act <e> <s> that particular provision was put into the bill then i may say against the opinion of the doe of the day <e> <s> they were taking their traditional position of being against anything that they had not put down themselves <e> <s> my noble friend is carrying forward that tradition in the best possible style <e> <s> joking aside this amendment was then made because the strength of the agricultural lobby in the commons was sufficient to win the day and oblige the government against their wishes to put in this provision for agriculture and fisheries <e> <s> thus it was that two ministers appoint in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords could i just add one word to the debate which has just concluded with the noble lord not moving his amendment <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord skelmersdale and the department of the environment on making this arrangement <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is right that the impact of our consultants in overseas markets is enormous <e> <s> they earn huge sums of money for the benefit of this country and do our country good in every way <e> <s> quite rightly they are jealous that they should not suffer from unfair competition from a public body financed by public funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief comment on the instruction which the noble lord has just moved in such cogent and detailed terms <e> <s> i should begin by congratulating him on getting such a good trailer in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a fact that as reported in the press this romanian was convicted in his own country of rape and violence and was convicted of theft in france <e> <s> is this part of his record <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a query on the same subsection particularly following the line of my noble friend <e> <s> i should be glad if my noble friend lord skelmersdale would explain how these policy issues are to be decided <e> <s> it appears by implication that the regional water authority itself will have to decide whether a policy issue is not confidential or urgent and can therefore be discussed by the consumer councils before it is decided by the regional water authority <e> <s> but if the regional water authority decided that no such issue ever occurred the consumer council would never have such a matter before it <e> <s> it might complain and ask why it did not <e> <s> the answer would be that no such policy issue came before the water authority <e> <s> in other words the amendment which my noble friend lord sandford has put before us does not seem to me to be entirely practical <e> <s> i shall be grateful if my noble friend lord skelmersdale will explain how he sees this paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me is he really happy to leave the uncertainties that there must be in this subsection as to what are the obligations of the water authorities in this matter <e> <s> is it really clear as to whether they have any obligation to put issues before the consumer councils or can they say with their hands on their hearts we have heard nothing which is not either urgent or confidential and therefore can put nothing before you <e> <s> will this not leave a possible basis of misunderstanding between these important new bodies and the water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is some difference between national events like the opening of parliament which is clearly in the national interest attendance at the cenotaph which is clearly the wish of the whole community and entirely partisan events like this particular demonstration which the question is about <e> <s> is it not reasonable that public funds generally should pay for the former and that there should be some consideration of whether the individuals who are particularly involved should pay for the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to add a word to this debate on this interesting report <e> <s> first i should like to thank the committee who were kind enough to invite me to be a member of it for this particular inquiry <e> <s> i should also like from my relatively detached position to congratulate them on choosing this subject for inquiry <e> <s> i follow the distinguished leader of the opposition distinguished not only for his position now but of course as a welshman and therefore knowing more about water than anyone else in the house <e> <s> as he rightly says nothing creates greater heat in wales than water <e> <s> i can well remember from my days as chairman of the national water council that whatever water problem we had there was always a welsh dimension which was different from that in any other part of the country <e> <s> there was plenty of water in wales but there were always some difficulties about getting it across to england even if it was only paying for it <e> <s> it was most interesting to hear the noble lord making such authoritative comments on this valuable report <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves the topic of research may i raise a matter <e> <s> i noted carefully that he said that he cannot tell us how he is going to implement his undertakings that more will be spent on research and that long term strategic research should be more adequately coped with <e> <s> i remind him that he told us that two months ago <e> <s> therefore his department has had two months in which to think the matter out <e> <s> if he cannot tell us the structure and what the arrangements will be in order to carry out these undertakings i think that he should tell us today when he will be able to give us a statement on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the chairman of committees i beg to move the procedural motion standing in his name on the order paper <e> <s> the purpose of this motion is to enable all private bills currently being considered in this house to continue their progress through parliament next session <e> <s> i understand that a similar motion will be moved in another place <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that the expression used by the noble lord lord molloy con trick is undoubtedly an offence under standing order no <e> <s> as to asperity and he should be asked to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the newspaper referred to by the noble lord opposite is more usually known as the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend lord elton not aware that an undertaking by one of the lords spiritual is probably more reliable than undertakings of noble lords who are ministers which we were discussing a little earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords as most consumers are also taxpayers will my noble friend remember that the bigger this department becomes the higher the taxes are likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that sympathetic answer and the good news that the secretary of state has taken the initial step <e> <s> can my noble friend tell us is the secretary of state contemplating setting up machinery so that there can be continuing consultation between those responsible for broadcast programmes and teachers to ensure that the influence of television programmes on children should not be damaging <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the burden of this report shows that the average viewing hours of children between and is no less than hours a week more hours than they actually spend in the classroom <e> <s> is he aware that this does show how enormously influential television is and the necessity for stronger safeguards <e> <s> can my noble friend give us some encouragement that we may expect some permanent machinery to be set up to get an improvement in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am very glad to follow the right reverend prelate in this short debate and to say that i sympathise with his plea for the churches to be allowed to be involved <e> <s> it would certainly be a mistake to have a dominating party in any particular group <e> <s> it seems to me obvious that the christian church which has been the inspiration of our country for years <e> <s> should be allowed to have some part of this very important medium <e> <s> i feel sure that my noble friend the leader of the house will be sympathetic to that view <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a basic principle of democratic government is grievance before supply <e> <s> that is a rule which the noble lord lord molloy with his long and interesting history in the other place will be well aware of <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that in all too many local authorities today the councils concerned seem unaware of the strength of grievance among those in the business community who are loaded with excessively high rates which are crippling their businesses and to which the local councils seem absolutely indifferent <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that it is these business interests that look to central government to give them some protection against the mulcting that they are suffering at the hands of their local authorities <e> <s> is my noble friend therefore aware that he is fully justified in the legislative action that he proposes to take <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that despite the hard cases that may come out of this device the general idea of imposing some further means of deterrence on motorists who consistently break the law in this respect is very much in the interests of the

comprehensive speech with which i find myself in almost complete agreement and upon one or two points in which i should like to touch <e>", "<cs> i enjoyed listening to the noble lord john-mackie with his great experience of agricultural matters putting some technical flesh onto the political bones of his noble colleague but i am not sure that all the flesh really fitted <e> <s> it would be a very short-term farmer who did not get the fertiliser value back out of his land in his lifetime and there might be one or two other technical points on which the noble lord as fluent as ever and as always delightful to listen to was a little on shaky ground <e>", "<cs> of course it has and i hope that it will have a very good effect this time in trying to put right some of things that have been put wrong <e> <s> but the point i was making was that the political judgment of the experts that is the ministers and the officials behind them in the ministry of agriculture of that day was that on the

be welcomed <e> <s> can my noble friend tell the house whether he now intends to make this an even easier habit to acquire by further improving the fastening apparatus for seat belts and making it generally uniform <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware with regard to the possibility of lives being saved by people being thrown clear of a car in an accident that in the racing world this

country it was the first time there had been such a review which found not only that the land was required but that it was more than required that there was indeed a significant shortage of training areas and that in no circumstances was there scope for reducing it <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the noble lords question about vaccination is my noble friend aware that it is a very much less attractive solution than slaughter because once vaccination becomes at all general it seriously confuses the issue in diagnosis due to the effect that it has on the blood condition of the birds <e>

somewhat arcane subject <e> <s> to me one of the many uninitiated it is a subject of not only very great interest but also enormous importance <e> <s> i have listened fascinated to the debate about remote sensing <e> <s> i do not intend to make any comment on it because i do not have time but i have certainly learned a very great deal to my benefit as i think have all noble lords concerned <e>",

is shooting at is certainly one with which i sympathise <e> <s> in fact clause does just that <e> <s> in subsection but with the qualification of subsection the clause covers exactly the area about which the noble lord is talking <e>", "<cs> if the non profit-making subsidiary proceeds to manufacture extreme obscene material and then passes it back to its parent company this could be a very

house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad to say that on this occasion in principle there is nothing between the noble lord lord houghton and myself and that in principle we are with him <e> <s> in form the answer is that we are not yet quite ready <e> <s> there have been a number of discussions with officials of the bbc and the iba to try to deal with this rather complicated matter and they are not yet completed <e> <s> i think it is enough for me to say at this stage that it looks fairly certain that there will need to be some amendment at report stage if for no other reason than that to do with references to the complaints commission <e> <s> we think that there is a necessity <e> <s> but these conversations are continuing <e> <s> when we have been able to settle precisely what the amendment should be we shall put it down for the report stage <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord may be willing to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the spirit in which the noble lord has moved his amendment <e> <s> he has made it plain that he does not wish to create a back door which would upset the system of classification which we wish to set up here <e> <s> the fact is that a good many imports come from europe <e> <s> i understand that a number of imports come from italy and spain and spain will shortly be a member of the community <e> <s> the situation relating to classification in europe is very variable <e>", "<cs> from the terms in which he moved his amendment it appears that the noble lord wishes to provide exemption for the person who makes a video for his own exclusive use for professional education <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so may i remind him that at the report stage at another place my honourable friend mr <e> <s> bright did move amendments covering clause and clause in order to widen the exemptions particularly in this respect <e> <s> it may be that the representations made to the noble lord lord houghton did not fully take on board what that widening achieved <e> <s> neither mr <e> <s> bright nor i are as unsympathetic as the noble lord makes out <e> <s> we are very happy to hear any representations he has from his own lips <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the committee wishes to hear a long speech from me about clause especially after the noble lord lord mishcon has so ably made out the justification for it <e> <s> i think it is only necessary for me to say that it would be a mistake for the noble lord lord houghton or indeed for the trade to think that either i or indeed the government who give such substantial support to this bill are out to persecute the trade <e> <s> we recognise that it is a vast and important trade serving the country most valuably and that the very large majority of all the trade it does is perfectly legitimate wholesome and helpful in every way <e>", "<cs> this has turned into a very interesting debate so innocently started by the noble lord lord aylestone with his relatively small but important amendment <e> <s> it was my noble friend lord renton who broadened the debate because he then started the debate on the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> so we have been introduced to a number of very interesting views about the designated body who they should be and how they should operate <e>", "<cs> my lords what a lot of experience the noble lord has <e> <s> in carrying out this function the british board of film censors must be guided by the law <e> <s> the law in these matters comes under the obscene publications act and there have been a good many occasions in this chamber when i have had something to say about that and i have expressed my opinion about the acts weakness and vagueness and the urgent need to have something clearer and stronger <e> <s> nevertheless it is the law <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend will agree that as his amendment and amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord houghton deal with two different sides of very much the same point they might be combined in one debate <e>", "<cs> may i first answer my noble friend lord lauderdale on his point about leaving out these words which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby defined as flannel <e> <s> they are not flannel <e> <s> they were put in at the committee stage in the other place specifically in order to widen slightly the words viewing in the home the history of which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has rightly described <e>", "<cs> the noble lord means clause <e>", "<cs> i do no think there is much for me to answer <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for almost everything he said except the last crack <e> <s> i beg to move my amendments <e>", "<cs> the answers to my noble friend lord renton i thank him for his brevity are as follows <e> <s> the other place was discussing this subject and had decided the r classification of film with which my noble friend may not be familiar <e> <s> those of us who are familiar at all with the film world understand what the r classification is <e> <s> it is a film with a good deal of obscenity in it which nevertheless is not obscene to the point where it would breach the obscene publications act <e> <s> when classified as r the classification means that films can be shown only to people over the age of and in cinema clubs or sex shops <e> <s> so the viewing is very restricted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will recollect he moved an earlier amendment to exempt video works produced by non-profit-making organisations and charities <e> <s> after some discussion the committee was not in favour of that amendment and the noble lord withdrew it <e> <s> the same principle really applies to the amendment that the noble lord has just moved <e> <s> however he has asked a number of questions which are somewhat outside the amendment and as far as it is possible i will do what i can to answer them <e> <s> the first major question he asked was is there to be a charge on public funds <e> <s> my noble friend and i have both explained that there is not to be a charge on public funds <e> <s> this is to be self-financing so that the cost of the process of classification will be borne by the industry <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that in the main the industry is not without finance <e> <s> the noble lord gave an example of a small producer on the isle of wight making pictures of childrens pantomimes and religious works <e> <s> i should think that that very likely falls within the exemptions in clause which we have already discussed at length <e> <s> however we shall have to see just exactly what those films show <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a good point <e> <s> it is desirable that this classification <e>", "<cs> it certainly would but i do not anticipate that that will happen <e> <s> we are dealing with a very experienced body which will understand that that would be totally impracticable <e> <s> therefore we can be confident that we shall start on the same classifications as already exist for films <e>", "<cs> if i may help the noble lord i can say that with absolute confidence <e> <s> if my noble friend got up from the front bench he would say the same <e> <s> that is the intention and is likely to remain so for the time being <e>", "<cs> first perhaps i may thank the noble lord lord aylestone and the noble earl <e> <s> lord longford for bringing their amendments together <e> <s> they do in fact cover the same picture the problem of labelling <e> <s> the position is that there is quite a major technical problem of labelling the existing video works <e> <s> new ones of course will present no problem <e> <s> on the video work at the beginning the classification will be stated and it will also be stated on the case in which the video work is placed <e> <s> but the position is much more difficult with existing works <e> <s> it could involve a very great deal of expense if it had to be spliced into every existing video work <e> <s> there are also difficulties with the import of certain video works especially from india which have a particular ethnic value for certain groups in this country where there would be only a few to be marked in this way <e> <s> here again we have a problem <e>", "<cs> we will certainly do that but without commitment as to what we shall come up with <e> <s> we want the same end as the noble lord lord beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us what is the perspective of this problem <e> <s> what has been the average number of pit closures over the past years

the pressure on our financial economy being such due to the movement of international funds that we shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in this centenary year of the nspcc i am sure that we are all very conscious of the responsibility of society to do what we can to protect children <e> <s> i am quite certain that noble lords opposite read the report in the paper today of the serious upward trend in harm to children which so often occurs in the home <e> <s> but i do not think that we should delude ourselves into thinking that children cannot be damaged by seeing some of these unpleasant videos <e> <s> they undoubtedly can be harmed and there is plenty of evidence of that <e> <s> so the two matters really are in the same realm we are concerned particularly in this context with the protection of children <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i should like to associate myself with what my noble friend lord elton has just said <e> <s> i recognise the perspicacity of the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon in picking the most effective issue on which a jury should deliberate <e> <s> i think that we should look at this amendment between now and the report stage <e> <s> there are problems about it <e> <s> without being able to indicate the kind of answer that we shall arrive at we shall certainly look at the matter most carefully and return to it again on report if the noble lord is willing to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i readily acknowledge that is a heavy fine but it is applicable in only two instances <e> <s> the other offences will be subject to a fine of up to with the recent upward adjustment <e> <s> these offences are not comparable with stubble burning and i am sure that the noble lord lord monson would be the first to acknowledge that <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i recognise that there is great weight in what has been said by the noble lord lord cornwallis by my noble friend and by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> sometimes i feel that i should like to speak more freely on these matters but time is important and therefore i cannot do so <e> <s> but i certainly sympathise with his expression of view about the bad end of this trade <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with my noble friends trying to get what he can out of me but this matter has been given very careful thought both here and in the other place and i really cannot encourage my noble friend to think that if we took it back we would be likely to take another view <e> <s> i must say that although i do not always agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh i entirely agree with him in this instance <e> <s> we must approach the matter of adding to the number of custodial sentences with the greatest caution and i think that in this case with the high level of penalties we should try and see how we get on <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord makes that he wants to be assured that this decision is taken by a completely responsible person that this is an important power which is being given to search for evidence and that it should be granted only in proper circumstances <e> <s> of course as the noble lord well knows what we are talking about are circumstances in which the policeman believes that there is evidence that an offence has been committed <e> <s> we are really talking about the video shop which is for the purpose of supplying <e> <s> it would be most exceptional for this to be in anyones home that someone should have transformed his home into a trading operation <e> <s> so we are talking normally about trading premises <e> <s> if the police believe that an offence has been committed it is essential that it should be possible to collect the evidence for it <e>", "<cs> i can certainly concede the noble lord his point that clause is related to the police and criminal evidence bill which will shortly come before this house <e> <s> the position is that if noble lords pass the video recordings bill and it receives royal assent before the police and criminal evidence bill subsection will be repealed by clause of the police bill <e> <s> this will mean that the offences provided by the video recordings bill will become subject to the general arrest conditions of the police and criminal evidence bill <e> <s> the arrest conditions will provide a power of arrest similar to that given in clause <e> <s> the presumption is that the process will be by way of summons but if the suspect refuses to give a name and address or gives false particulars the police may arrest him <e> <s> so the machinery is such that the noble lord will have his wish that this clause will then disappear and be absorbed into the police and criminal evidence bill <e>", "<cs> it has been an interesting debate on this rather limited subject <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord mishcon my thanks as ever <e> <s> i do not think that i could give a better answer than he has <e> <s> but i would make this point to the noble lord lord houghton who wants the short title to be accurate <e> <s> he has stressed many times how small is the amount of video nasties in relation to the total volume of video works which run into or <e> <s> the video nasties number perhaps to at the outside <e> <s> that is the only section which is in danger of censorship <e>", "<cs> yes but it is a very small part of it <e> <s> the major function under this bill will be classification and as has already been said far better than i can say it the present short title is accurate and complete <e> <s> i am sure that it would be wise to leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords are grateful to the noble lord lord houghton for once again his interesting tour <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord jenkins for arguing his case so ingeniously <e> <s> as he knows this question was debated at length during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> he is now really asking us to rehearse similar arguments to those we discussed before <e> <s> i should like to remind him of the wise words of the noble viscount lord tonypandy i am sorry that he is not well enough to be with us when he said that if we take this subsection out of the bill we may as well say goodbye to the bill <e> <s> it knocks the heart out of it <e> <s> this is an aspect of the matter of which we should all take note <e> <s> there is real substance in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should reply to the noble lord since he has implied that i do not understand what the amendment is about <e> <s> as i moved the amendment i have the right to reply to the debate <e> <s> the justification for the amendments is exactly as i said it is to ensure that the amendments more precisely fulfil their purpose in that these particular works will go to the professionals for whom they are intended <e> <s> that is the specific intention <e> <s> as originally drafted with these exemptions in clause where there were exemptions for the works it would be possible for an unscrupulous producer to produce a work of this kind and introduce a pornographic feature to it which could then have a commercial value <e> <s> the whole object of these exemptions is to provide for the needs of the professionals as set out now much more clearly in amendment no <e> <s> the medical services the health and personal social services and indeed for the professions supplementary to medicine act the nurses midwives and health visitors <e> <s> this is the object of the exemption and in so far as this amendment more precisely ensures that the supplies are directed to them and go to them this is the fulfilment of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am moving only amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> but if amendment no <e> <s> is accepted i shall then proceed to move amendment no <e> <s> and the noble lord will be able immediately to move his amendment to my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with close attention to the noble lord and yet i am bound to say that i cannot see that his amendment would add very much to the existing subsection <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to his own words which i wrote down the likelihood is that everything will be seen privately in the home <e> <s> that is the case and so by inserting the word in question we would not be adding anything that could be considered as either guidance or declaratory <e> <s> the noble lord himself has objected strongly to including anything that is declaratory <e> <s> if this amendment had any value at all it would be only that <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord reads his speech tomorrow he will see that he has said both things that i have said to him <e> <s> i made a note of them as he said them <e> <s> but the point he made towards the end of his speech that the likelihood is that everything will be seen privately in the home is the fact of it <e> <s> there is no particular objection or significance in the word either way <e> <s> it will not add anything because it is the case that normally things will be seen privately in the home <e> <s> in the circumstances i do not think that i should advise your lordships to accept a word which will add nothing of any kind to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in saying that the amendment is superfluous <e> <s> the provision in clause gives the secretary of state power to require the report to be made in any form he wants <e> <s> it is perfectly obvious that he would want a statement of accounts because among other things somewhere else in the bill he has to approve the tariff that will be charged for the classification function <e> <s> so the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a point which was discussed in a slightly different form at some length at the committee stage and i quite understand the noble lords anxiety that he does not want to see this age limit raised from to <e> <s> i can assure him that the governments intention is that it shall be introduced at the same levels as are now being used by the bbfc that is the ages of to and that there is no intention of changing it in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with the leave of the house i could say just one further word <e> <s> first of all i did say to the noble lord not that it was very likely that the ages of to would be the ages used by the bbfc that they would be definitely <e> <s> so let us get that on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that will have reassured him but at any rate we shall start on the basis that he and i imagine his noble friends would wish <e> <s> however the point is again a very small one although i agree that the significance the noble lord <e> <s> lord houghton has attached to it makes it seem a very great one <e> <s> i do not think any government or any home secretary would ever wish to see the age raised above <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may add a word to this little procedural discussion <e> <s> i do feel that the noble lord lord houghton is right <e> <s> there is a major point here and it is of course related to the schedule <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be for the convenience of the whole house if we debated the issue as one <e> <s> in the schedule is set out an alternative scheme which would make other licensed premises at any rate in principle workable and therefore i would strongly urge the noble lord lord jenkins who i think has the ball in his court that it really would be for the convenience of everybody if we proceeded as the noble lord lord houghton has suggested <e> <s> so that one debate could then cover the whole issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with close attention to the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i have spent a good deal of time studying his schedule because that is the substance of his proposition <e> <s> while i take the point which the noble lord lord jenkins was making his amendment does not have substance until we suggest how we are going to license how the licences will operate and how they will be controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figures he has given us this afternoon showing that the long-suffering taxpayer has provided some million of new capital expenditure in order to get british leyland off the ground so to speak make it plain that it is going to be greatly in the interests of the taxpayer to sell this company to the public if the public is willing to buy it so that in the future it will be private capital which will be provided and not the taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great attention to this interesting debate and i should like to add a few words regarding my own feelings about it <e> <s> i see this paving bill as a necessary piece of machinery in preparation for the main bill in the next session and incidentally the government have a clear mandate for that bill <e> <s> therefore as i see it if the government proposal to abolish the glc and metropolitan counties is justified the paving bill is also right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for his informative answer <e> <s> is he aware that at many intersections in this country the signs are not adequate they often lead to accidents due to hesitation by drivers as they are negotiating an intersection and that this is something which could be rectified by a comprehensive review <e> <s> is he further aware that our general road signing compares very badly with our neighbours in europe particularly the french and italians <e> <s> we are way behind <e> <s> while i realise that it would be expensive to bring the level of road signs other than on motorways up to a good modern standard is the noble lord the minister aware that it really would be a valuable improvement good value for money and would save a great many accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that though he has given us many informative answers he has not really satisfied the house particularly on the point of continuity of signing which will carry travellers through to their <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i should ask for the leave of the house as i have already spoken to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be pleased to answer briefly the arguments of the noble lord <e> <s> lord houghton in reply to the original debate we had <e> <s> i did recognise as i told him at the time that his amendments and his new schedule had been carefully considered <e> <s> i proceeded to go at least a little way to analysing the schedule he proposed which sought to control the granting of a licence for video shops which could then trade in r video works <e> <s> i do not propose to trouble the house with a rehearsal of the points i made to the noble lord on that occasion <e> <s> no doubt noble lords will remember them and they are in any event all on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords there are obvious practical difficulties in meeting the point of the noble lords amendment regarding a named constable <e> <s> of course it is a named constable who has to make the application for the warrant and he must give his evidence under oath to the magistrate who is to issue the warrant <e> <s> but when it comes to making the entry if the police forces are required to apply the warrant to a named constable only when the entry may be a few weeks later or at some later date all kinds of difficulties may arise the constable may even <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord once again has understandably tried to introduce safeguards for the benefit of the private citizen or trader who is concerned <e> <s> but i think that we must also look at the practical problems involved <e> <s> what the bill says is <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that the noble lord has a point that a safeguard is needed in this field and that a trader should not be victimised <e> <s> but as he rightly said one month is probably too short <e> <s> what we are relying on in this case is the police and criminal evidence bill where it is the governments intention to make an amendment to clause of the bill which will ensure that seized property is retained only so long as is necessary in all the circumstances <e> <s> clause of that bill will ensure <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while we all share the anxiety which has been so well expressed from both front benches <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not claim to be an expert on this or indeed any aspect of the bill though i am bound to say that during the course of its passage i am becoming much better informed i think i know enough about this particular problem to be able to answer the noble lord <e> <s> first i <e>", "<cs> my lords that is so <e> <s> i think it is desirable for them to be optional because one does not know for how long material is to be held and in what circumstances <e> <s> as long as the powers are there i think we can leave it with some confidence to the courts to see that destruction follows where appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord rightly said this is a subject which we have debated before at committee stage when we had an interesting debate on the point as to whether the word censorship should be introduced into the short title <e> <s> i recollect as the noble lord lord monson has said that we had a difference of opinion <e> <s> but he accepted the point then that censorship was inappropriate because it would apply to only a very small part of the total material <e> <s> but we had quite a range over the whole subject and i recollect the intervention by the noble lord lord houghton as well <e> <s> but the contribution which impressed me most was from the noble lord lord mishcon who has played such a splendid part in these debates when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i said nothing of the kind <e> <s> i said that if there is another video bill that will be the time to add additional words if they are needed to describe the nature of it <e> <s> however when there is only one bill of this kind the word video is sufficient to describe it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord jenkins on bringing this subject before us today and indeed on his speech with much of which i agreed <e> <s> while i am sorry to lose plurality i am even more sorry about the enormities committed due to the bodies which are disappearing since i agree with the noble lord that plurality is valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to do what i can to help clear the confusion from the noble lords mind <e> <s> first if i may i shall correct his definition <e> <s> he used the words within the mischief of this bill <e> <s> this is not a mischievous bill <e> <s> this is a bill which will confer considerable benefits on parents up and down the country <e> <s> it is a bill to curb illicit trading and it does not bring all citizens within its scope <e> <s> if we accepted the noble lords amendment while i quite understand what he is about in limiting this matter to those who are in the trade as i am sure he will know his definition of in business would cover anybody in any business and i do not suppose he really intends that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord ardwick for putting a very cogent point <e> <s> i feel a certain sympathy with the noble lord lord mcintosh because i understand what he is driving at <e> <s> i understand his point that there is a difference in kind between normal sexual relationships and these other matters mentioned in subsection <e> <s> it seems that what offends the noble lord lord mcintosh is that normal human sexual relationships should be included in this category together with abnormal sexual relationships as if to do so were an offence against loving human relationships <e> <s> we are not talking about that <e> <s> we are talking about what is put on a tape for entertainment and that is to what this particular subsection relates <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if in speaking to the noble lords amendment i also speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> and so that we can include in the debate the alternative amendment which i think will better meet the point with which the noble lord was rightly concerned and raised on the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate the noble lord on the care with which he has examined every word of this bill <e> <s> i entirely accept that his motive is to be helpful here <e> <s> the fact is that usually the date of the certificate and the summons will <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must congratulate the noble lord lord monson on his research <e> <s> i did not know that was a bumper year for legislation with acts <e> <s> even less did i know that the average length of the short titles was four and a quarter words and that two short titles had eight words <e> <s> the noble lord certainly did his homework <e> <s> i remember best as being the great drought year which caused me headaches of a different kind <e> <s> however i do follow his argument when he says that the brevity argument will not hold water was the year when there was not much water to hold <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the noble lords reasons for moving this amendment <e> <s> he did in fact rehearse a great many of the arguments which he has expressed before about the bill and in which he has made it perfectly plain that he is fundamentally opposed to the bill and would wish it not to go on the statute book at all <e> <s> naturally if he cannot stop it going on the statute book at all to limit it to five years is i suppose a second best <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are supporting this private members bill and it is a private members bill which will effectively classify this material <e> <s> that is the need it is generally seen as needed and receives very wide support <e> <s> the reason why the noble lord might have felt depressed from time to time in the course of the debates when he did not have much support is that this measure does have wide support and it does have wide support in the other place <e> <s> it could not have been approved and passed by the other place unless it commanded support from all sides and after a great deal of debate the form in which it came here has been achieved by getting a balance between the views of the different sides <e> <s> it is thought of as something which really is needed and that is the reason why the noble lord may have felt the debates here were pressing on him because the majority of noble lords on all sides of the house feel it is most desirable that we should get these video works classified just as soon as possible <e> <s> that is a matter of fact <e> <s> if this proves to be wrong i am perfectly certain that the government of the day either this government or the next will act to introduce an amending bill or whatever bill may be suitable to make it an effective act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i do not propose to recapitulate all the arguments which we have already heard on the other side <e> <s> i only wish to thank those who have helped me deal with a very difficult little bill <e> <s> i thank first of all my noble friend the minister and his experts who have been superb in their assistance <e> <s> i could not possibly have managed without them <e> <s> i should like to thank noble lords from all sides of the house who have given me tremendous support on the bill not least by being here and not saying anything when they often would have liked to <e> <s> i am afraid they have heard already far too much from me and i do not propose to recapitulate any arguments now <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is no single measure which <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the governments policies in progressively reducing inflation and so increasing the competitive edge to industry in this country have given a massive improvement in our capacity to win markets back an improvement which no other government have been able to achieve for very many years <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that industrial disputes which increase costs are the high road to losing that competitive edge <e> <s> is he aware that germany has just suffered from a very serious disruption throughout her steel and motor-car industries which will undoubtedly affect the balance of trade in the current year somewhat in our favour <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figures for the numbers of doctors employed in the health service in the four years from to have gone up by and the numbers of nurses have gone up by <e> <s> do these figures really look as if the government are dismantling the health service <e> <s> should not the government be congratulated on adding to the strength of the health service in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in assessing the importance of this subject the theatre at stratford-on-avon should be regarded as not only a national institution of importance but also an institution of international importance <e> <s> people come from all over the world to the theatre there <e> <s> is he aware that strong evidence shows that the interference in the theatre would be very significant from this transmitting station being set up just outside stratford <e> <s> therefore does he appreciate that this is a matter of very major artistic significance not only to us in this country but to the world generally <e> <s> will my noble friend kindly take that dimension on board and pass it on to his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the scientific evidence with regard to cause and effect of acid rain is by no means conclusive and that his cautious approach to this matter as representing that of the government is fully justified <e> <s> is he aware that when the report of the select committee of this house on this subject is published he will find this point fully substantiated <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that we went all round this course yesterday <e> <s> should we be going round it again today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question on a subject which was mentioned by the noble and learned lord opposite <e> <s> that is about the wye/usk transfer scheme <e> <s> i recollect in urging the welsh water authority to proceed with an emergency type of transfer scheme because that scheme would substantially alleviate the water shortage in a large part of south wales <e> <s> would my noble friend please tell us whether or not that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i help my noble friend <e> <s> i said one for each find or deposit <e> <s> one for the whole deposit <e> <s> i also described for the information of my noble friend the dimensions of the gas deposit as forecast now by the company as stretching some two miles from east to west across the centre of the village <e> <s> the proposal to drill a well on the extreme end of it on the airfield therefore does not describe the effect it would have on the village itself <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that point will he deal with my question about the possibility of improving technology so that gas can be piped as is oil to an arterial point where it can be treated on an industrial site centrally rather

his contribution to this house on scientific matters has been brilliant <e> <s> we all very much value his presence here <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves the point about the disposal of sewage sludge at sea will he deal with the point that i mentioned about the desirability of accepting the royal commissions recommendation of joining in an international independent survey of the north sea which as i said the thames water authority would warmly welcome because it is confident that its standards will stand up to such a survey <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the water authorities in the past few years have most impressively developed techniques for surveying the mains water supplies without digging up the roads <e> <s> they use various methods such as radar screens and so on and they have television cameras actually placed in the mains <e> <s> thus they have been able to work out techniques for repairing and re-lining mains <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies may i ask him whether he is aware that if the government chief whip has advice to give it is usually within the courtesies of this house to hearit <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i should like to say that having been co-opted to be a member of this committee for one session and having seen the quality of the noble lords who take part there

house is playing a particularly valuable part <e> <s> the reports that have been produced in that committee have been of value to noble lords on all sides of value to parliament generally and i

movement of millions of people every day by london transport are out of use because they are subject to major repair <e> <s> is it not possible in these days of modern technology to achieve a more rapid reconstruction when major works are needed <e> <s> does he not agree that this really is a substandard service for an underground railway system which is still potentially a first-class service

hope that many of the employees have also taken up shareholdings privately <e> <s> in any event the policy of giving the smaller shareholder a full allocation of his application seems to me to be a very wise plan in order to get the widest possible shareholding so that this will truly be seen to be a national holding by a very large number of people in the community <e> <s> that is bound to be a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that admiral lombardo of the argentine navy has stated that the instructions to the argentine ships were to attack the british force the british ships <e> <s> in those circumstances is it not probable that the captain of the belgrano had that message in front of his mind rather than the dimensions of the exclusion zone <e>", "<cs> my

self-finance <e> <s> is he aware that the water industry is at a far lower scale than any other nationalised industry having inherited a situation where there was no self-financing at all for capital expenditure and so the whole of the burden fell on the public works loans board in other words on the shoulders of the whole community <e> <s> therefore is my noble friend aware that it is very much in the interests of all concerned that the measure of self-financing by the water industry including the thames water authority should be increased so that the amount of money required to be borne by

official labour opposition has stated that it intends to divide against the order <e> <s> i feel that that is a most unfortunate thing to be happening on a measure of this kind where as the noble lord

and limb of the community <e> <s> in the event he made a cogent point that we did not have the report of the human rights comission <e> <s> that is a fair point <e> <s> it would have been desirable <e> <s> as my noble friend lord elton his already been told it would also have been desirable if we had had the report of sir cyril a little earlier <e> <s> however it is a pretty simple report and even i could take it in in hours <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave the question of the waterways will my noble friend tell us what percentage of freight nationally travels on the waterways <e> <s> is it less than per cent <e> <s> if that is so would he therefore be very careful about how much public money he pours into the waterways <e> <s> is he aware that most of our waterways are far too small to carry freight traffic and that they can only do so to a very limited extent <e> <s> would it not be far better to put some extra money into coastal shipping which carries quite a deal of freight rather than into the waterways themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to our interest in this long-running and very unpleasant war do we not also have an interest in maintaining the safety of oil shipping in the gulf where we have certainly with our partners a substantial interest <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the secretary of state specifically stated in the other place last evening that these rumours were untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to and indeed have been half-persuaded by the formidable advocacy of the needs of the pharmaceutical industry by the noble lord lord porritt <e> <s> it was particularly interesting and of course cogent but i have an impression after the recent pr campaign that they have been running that they are well able to speak for themselves and some of their contributions were not entirely creditable <e> <s> however i much respect indeed much more than respect the noble lord who occupies such a distinguished position in the world of medicine and in many other places and who has been such a stalwart ally of mine on other campaigns <e> <s> but in this particular context i am afraid that i do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what part of this total sum is payable to the water authorities in respect of damage to mains and mains sewers caused by subsidence <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that no single measure would give greater efficiency and more accuracy to the post office than the introduction of the universal post code <e> <s> can my noble friend tell us what plans the post office has for introducing that and what progress is being made towards it <e>", "<cs> my lords after that very powerful speech which set out to destroy the health arguments i think that i should say immediately that i have read the knox report and quite a bit of the extracts from the jauncey judgment and i would hesitate to dismiss that massive knox report as easily as the noble lord lord charteris has done <e> <s> the knox committee sat for three or four years and studied the scientific and epidemiological evidence not only from this country but from all over the world <e> <s> they reached their conclusions on that basis <e> <s> my word <e> <s> i must as a layman pay some attention to what they have said <e> <s> they were very clear that the health risks which the noble lord sees are simply not there <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this question on the order paper has a clear implication that lives are being put at risk by the national health service <e> <s> is he aware that this is a very offensive question both to my right honourable friend the secretary of state and indeed to the whole health service <e> <s> is he aware that on the figures of the financial provision by this government in the coming year billion is to be devoted to the national health service compared with / billion in the last year of the labour government <e> <s> even allowing for the cost of living increase is that not a very substantial increase <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if there is any substance in the offensive question of the noble lord it reflects on his own government the then labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords on a lighter note will my noble friend agree that it might be an improvement if questions framed in the form of have you stopped beating your wife <e> <s> were regarded as out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble lord lord birkett and hear the attractive picture which he paints of the strategic functions for which he was responsible <e> <s> i do take some <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer a word of thanks to the chairman of committees for this admirable report <e> <s> as on several occasions i have had a comment to make on order at <e>", "<cs> i must confess that that is not a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> it is not very different as the noble baroness will know from the answer that was given in the other place <e> <s> the point which she has made that if my amendment were accepted the water authority or the water company would then be liable for the financial cost of the process and much more seriously would be liable for a possible indemnification if a legal action were taken is not entirely clear to me <e> <s> that surely depends on how the rest of the bill is drafted <e>", "<cs> i must thank my noble friend for trying to satisfy me although i confess that i do not feel very satisfied <e>", "<cs> when this amendment appeared it caused some surprise to my friends in the water industry who thought that they had done rather well when they managed to get this part of the bill amended in another place <e> <s> however i acknowledge that there is weight in what my noble friend has just told us <e> <s> i suspect that the original concept of this amendment was linked to the amendment i have just unsuccessfully moved to leave out the word may and insert shall <e> <s> had that amendment been made to the bill the existing provision in clause would have related to it to provide the flexibility needed <e> <s> however i see that my noble friend has provided all the flexibility needed in a later amendment on the marshalled list and so i acknowledge that the wording she seeks to delete is not necessary and would cause problems <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i am happy to accept her amendment <e>", "<cs> may i add to the point my noble friend is making that operatives are of course accustomed to additions to water particularly chlorine which is very similar in its corrosive action in a concentrated state and would be at least as damaging as fluorine <e> <s> as this is common practice with all water treatment to add the fluorine to it would really add no additional danger <e> <s> it would be asking them to operate with one more tap and one more container and they are already fully trained in dealing with this <e> <s> i think i can assure the noble lord lord monson that this would not constitute an additional danger <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend on the front bench will give him that assurance <e>", "<cs> this seems to me very much like a re-run of the debate on amendment no <e> <s> when it seemed to me that the arguments were well ventilated on both sides <e> <s> the point is to what extent should the local health authority take the ultimate decision <e> <s> my noble friend has put down amendment no <e> <s> which requires the local health authority to publish in complete form any proposal either to start or to stop a fluoridation scheme <e> <s> having done so with the appropriate three months notice it requires the authority in reaching its decision to take into account the result of the publication that it undertakes in various ways so that the locality and everybody in it is aware of what is proposed <e> <s> that would be an adequate way of consulting local opinion <e> <s> it leaves the ultimate decision with the health authority which is after all at the end of the day in the best position to get the right balance on the medical and ethical arguments and in the light of the expression of public opinion which it will have had by then <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened fascinated to the noble earl lord shannon giving his technical explanation of the very complex situation which we had revealed to us in evidence with i should record the maximum assistance from the very able technical advisor and the extra technical advisor for the occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in addition to the normal sterilizing process in the treatment of water before it is put into the mains it is normal practice to include in the mains a certain amount of chlorine in order to keep the water supply sterile <e> <s> the mains often run many miles before the water reaches the point of consumption <e> <s> therefore there is a very major safeguard there which should prevent any danger of infection getting in in the course of supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer which tells me facts that i already knew on planning procedure <e> <s> as the proposal is outside the structure plan its prospects are obviously doubtful <e> <s> but is he aware that what i am hoping for is reassurance of the statement made last year with regard to the governments intention to preserve the metropolitan green belt <e> <s> is he further aware that had all the glamorised proposals like this one which have come forward to develop in the green belt been allowed in this post-war period the whole green belt would have disappeared by now and londoners would have lost the pleasure that they now have of enjoying the countryside and the fresh air <e> <s> does he accept that this is a point of major interest <e> <s> will he at the same time confirm that the rumour generated by the promoters that there is a shortage of housing sites is not correct and that the provision of housing sites in the structure plans of local authorities in the south-east is adequate to meet the need in the current decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest and attention to the noble earl and i sympathise with his anxieties <e> <s> however i think that he <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did extremely well today and made a very interesting speech <e> <s> i may not agree with it all but i recognise his authority <e> <s> the noble lord charged the government with pursuing with this bill a high risk policy <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to cast his mind back to when that bill was introduced because that bill also followed a high risk policy <e> <s> as the noble lord will remember the policy behind that bill was to introduce a system of comprehensive planning and control for every aspect of transport <e> <s> mercifully with time it has all disappeared and the sooner it went the better <e> <s> indeed i think that the noble lord rather agrees with me on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for assisting me <e> <s> i do not disagree with his analysis of the total cost to public expenditure <e> <s> a large part of it of course is subsidy to the disabled but the figure i quoted is the total given in the white paper <e> <s> even if we are speaking of only million a year that to me is a great deal of money <e> <s> the government have a duty to try to reduce it and make sure that the taxpayer and ratepayer get good value for money <e> <s> this is the main point that i am concerned with <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the additional point that this improved coach service has taken a good many private cars off the road <e> <s> the owners now come into london in coaches when they used to come by private car and that is a considerable gain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am sure he will have his opportunity to speak in a minute <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend for repeating that piece of very good news <e> <s> is he aware that the total number of houses built there makes a substantial contribution to londons housing needs <e> <s> however is he also aware that the very large number of houses nearly in that particular area which are now owner-occupied is a novelty an innovation which is tremendously welcome in that area for the prospects of new businesses of which there will be so many more <e> <s> is he also aware that a large number of dwellings about per cent <e> <s> are occupied by local people who have never had a chance to buy their own houses before <e> <s> in enabling them to do that the government have done something for which they are to be most warmly congratulated <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the major part of these housing schemes is comprised of small relatively inexpensive houses <e> <s> is he aware that i have visited some of them <e> <s> it is true that i have not been there for about months to two years but their price range was between and <e> <s> this does not seem to me to be an excessively high price for a house in london <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the noble lord opposite has quite the wrong impression and should go and have a look at the development <e>", "<cs> my lords on a personal note is my noble friend aware that my comment was not directed to the noble and learned lord on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that welcome answer <e> <s> is he aware that in that particular part of london the derelict dockland area where there has been a steady rundown of employment now for decades to get an increase of over jobs is really a complete transformation <e> <s> may i ask whether he is aware that it is immensely to the credit of the government <e> <s> is he also aware that this was done in the teeth of the most fierce opposition from all the local authorities there <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that that is all the more to the credit of the government for going ahead with it <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend tell the house whether these dangers include possible injury at the box <e>", "<cs> my lords is not technology in this area very greatly advanced in south africa over what it is in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can we not learn from them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend about a point that he missed before <e> <s> could we not send a mission to south africa to learn from their techniques to the benefit of ourselves so that we could advance our technology more rapidly here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking that it should be sent <e> <s> i ask my noble friend seriously <e> <s> we want to advance in this field <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell has a good point here <e> <s> can we not send a mission <e> <s> we know that they use these processes on a large scale in south africa <e> <s> is it not worth our while to send a mission there <e> <s> would my noble friend please look into that and see whether it can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the anxiety about the serious bottleneck of prisoners on remand can my noble friend tell us whether the home office have any plans to relieve that bottleneck <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a brief word in support of the first amendment moved by the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> the impact of the report in this respect is that peers putting a motion on the order paper can please themselves how they draft it and that we depart from our tradition of drafting it in neutral terms <e> <s> we must recognise the realities <e> <s> noble lords enthusiasm for a subject often overruns their discretion <e> <s> it is a help to them if there is some restraint from the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the quality of mersey is not strained <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the noble baroness in her description of the admirable state of affairs in birmingham <e> <s> that is a situation i would expect where she has a hand in it <e> <s> we are however looking at a national picture <e> <s> i am straying a little <e> <s> but let us face it the noble lord lord carmichael who moved the amendment with his usual charm and restraint will know as well as i do that if he had put his amendment on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord tordoff for his advice but i just do not agree with him <e> <s> if this amendment went into the bill it would put intolerable pressure on the secretary of state <e> <s> he would have to consider applications from literally hundreds of local authorities <e> <s> this would make for a delay if nothing else of years <e> <s> it would create a political situation which would be intolerable <e>", "<cs> i think we all got that point and i am prepared to acknowledge it but over the country as a whole it is not so <e> <s> over the country as a whole the cost goes up every year services overall decline every year the fares go up every year and the use of the buses goes down as well <e> <s> that is the situation we are looking at <e> <s> the government believe that a radical change is needed and the best one that we can conceive is to open the market of bus operation to free enterprise generally <e> <s> this will give the best service to the bus travellers and that is why the government have brought forward this bill <e> <s> it is in that context that we have to look at this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not going to go to the precise figure <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for helping me in that regard <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend lord belstead will give us the precise number of applications that we might have as a result of this amendment <e> <s> my guess is that it would be a very large number indeed and a quite impossible number to handle and certainly one unacceptable to anyone who believes in the value of the bill as a whole which i certainly do <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord carmichael may be willing to withdraw it after the general debate we have had because i do not believe that it is a practical way of going forward <e>", "<cs> this is a very important point <e> <s> i felt that the noble lord lord belstead gave a satisfactory answer and commitment certainly one which has my sympathies <e> <s> i shall be unhappy if the noble lord lord ennals takes this to a division and puts many of us in the position of voting against something which in principle we want to see conceded <e> <s> i most sincerely hope that he will not feel that it is necessary to do that <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great attention to the noble lord lord shepherd and recognise his authority in the matter <e> <s> he has the advantage of speaking with a large measure of experience and that carries great weight <e> <s> his first figure of what is the existing cross-subsidy in the nbc is obviously correct and it is a formidable figure <e> <s> i should like to say this about the whole principle of cross-subsidisation <e> <s> like the noble lord i have seen it working for many years and as i said on second reading i think that it worked fairly well in the past in the days when bus operations on the whole were profitable and solvent <e> <s> however i believe that come the day when they became unprofitable and they depended upon public subsidy in order to survive and with a gradually increasing public subsidy the psychology of the cross-subsidy changed inevitably <e> <s> in the days when the bus operators knew that where they had cross-subsidies they still had to make ends meet they had the proper incentives of commerce to ensure that the business was just as efficient as could be <e>", "<cs> there is a further point which the noble lord lord shepherd i am sure has in mind <e> <s> the noble lord as always puts his argument persuasively on grounds of safety a cause that we all share <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to answer the point which the noble lord has kindly put to me <e> <s> i am not saying anything of the kind <e> <s> i am saying that the traffic commissioner must from his own resources find out the information that he needs in judging the merits of any particular applicant <e> <s> i am not saying that he should in any circumstances accept the application of operators of the kind that the noble lord describes certainly he should not <e> <s> i am saying that in the bill we should not entrench the position of the existing operators in the same way as it is entrenched now because if we do we shall prevent a large number of valuable operators entering the industry <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for his helpful reply which at any rate goes some way to meet this major anxiety which is shared by noble lords on all sides <e> <s> it was rightly said by my noble friend lord gridley and i think by the noble lord lord barnett that this is an unprecedented situation where we have a nationalised industry which is being privatised not as one unit but split up into a number of units <e> <s> indeed it is the essence of the governments plans that they should be a number of relatively small units <e> <s> the commercial structure is going to be completely different from what it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the noble lord lord houghton who repeated many of the things that he said last year particularly in his peroration <e> <s> i should state that in so far as parliament was moved not just this house but the other house as well to legislate on this matter it was moved because families up and down the country were anxious worried about the material which their children were seeing <e> <s> that is not just working-class <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we have taken minutes on this question so it may be about time we moved on to the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall be brief <e> <s> like the noble lord lord seebohm i am glad to say that i have read the report and would like to thank the noble lord lord plowden and his colleagues for producing it <e>", "<cs> my lords would not one of the factors which affect inward investment be complete freedom from exchange control in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a very brief word on this interesting subject and commence by thanking the noble lord lord shepherd for kindly sending me an excellent brief which supports his case and certainly supports the splendid record which the tyne and wear integrated scheme has achieved <e> <s> i have read it with great interest and hope that it will continue <e> <s> i would make the point to my noble friend lord auckland that the admirable arrangements which the trains have particularly for dealing with disabled people will continue in any event <e> <s> with regard to what the government are proposing which is that the bus system should be made free so that private operators can operate in the city it seems to me perfectly possible to get the benefits of the existing system and the benefits of the governments proposals by the operators contracting with the individual private bus operators in order to integrate as seems desirable the bus operations with rail <e> <s> the noble lord lord shepherd nods his wise head <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was shaking it <e> <s> perhaps he will come to nodding it later <e> <s> i hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord challenges my competence to judge the rigours of the market i should remind him that my start in life was on a farm <e> <s> i raised the money to get my own farm i financed myself from nothing <e> <s> if i do not understand the market nobody does <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out that this is the report stage and the noble lord lord teviot has already spoken once <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should make an intervention not a speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one point before the noble lord lord tordoff replies <e> <s> there seems to me to be a real technical difficulty here in that if this option were allowed to the employee and i quite understand that he may wish to have such an option and obviously he may be concerned to try to preserve as good a pension position for the future as he has now when the local government body was no longer his employer then the body responsible for the pension scheme that is to say the local government body would have no control over his contributions <e> <s> this is the point behind what my noble friend is saying which is that the employer should have such an option as to whether he will allow any particular employee to come from outside into the schemes but normally if an employee is to continue inside an existing scheme and is going off to work for someone else it would have to be on a secondment basis so that the contributions can be controlled <e> <s> i think that my noble friend is on a perfectly sound point which is that no pension scheme could be run like this <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole of the conservative benches seem to be in favour of this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to make one or two points about where although i sympathise with the wish of all local authorities to see some sort of safety net there are certain aspects of the amendment which seem to me to go much too far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord alport for making that point again but he is opposed to the bill <e> <s> parliament decided on second reading both here and in the other place that the principle is agreed <e> <s> therefore at this stage it is out of order to argue against the general principle of the bill <e> <s> my noble friends point is the one i am concerned with that this amendment could go to the very heart of the principle of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend has been good enough to clarify that point for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all sympathise with the objective of my noble friend earl de la warr <e> <s> having read <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that on the very important point of verification which has been raised by the front bench opposite

completely absorbed in the criticism of different points is my noble friend aware that the virtual completion of this road is one of this countrys major road achievements <e> <s> it confers a very great benefit on not only the whole of the private travelling public <e> <s> it is very much to the governments credit that they put this work in hand and had it completed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my

europe as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although this is a very attractive scheme in principle in practice it is extremely difficult to get if off the ground <e> <s> is he aware that in my local town of guildford which is not unprosperous we have had no response whatsoever <e> <s> my noble friend lord bessborough who also is president of his theatre in chichester has been successful but in only a very limited way <e> <s> can we do something to advise theatres such as ours which now have no help from the arts council what technique should be followed to attract local business sponsorship so that we might have the benefit of this scheme <e> <s> at present we try and try but have no result <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that apart from the interesting intrinsic merits of this point there is a very important constitutional aspect to it <e> <s> when the european court hands down a judgment that places a direct obligation on any country to change its law to conform with such a judgment and this directive will affect not only the united kingdom but four other european countries also because it is contrary to their present laws that is to interfere with a basic principle of democracy that laws are made by the wishes of the nation which are translated into law through the majority party that is elected to government <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that when a judgment of this kind with such far-reaching implications is handed down it really does raise a very major constitutional point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that select committee g on the eec has been taking evidence from the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food on this very point and that it has been very impressed by the comprehensiveness and the thoroughness with which the ministrys inspectors carry out these inspections on all the sites round our coast where sewage dumping takes place including of course liverpool bay <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we have had much experience in all parts of the world in dealing with problems not quite as great as this but not far different <e> <s> it is the first step to reconciliation for the existing rulers of the country to set up a dialogue with the accredited leaders of the native peoples concerned and mr mandela happens to be one of those <e> <s> that is the first step which might make progress if mr botha would release him and start a dialogue with him <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that encouraging start does my noble friend intend to spread this scheme generally throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the position is that the vaccine which is given every year is based on the virus which has attacked us the previous year and usually two but that this year particularly some new sub-type came into this country and we were vulnerable to it <e> <s> i was one of the victims <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that normally the standard vaccine does give protection <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord gregson and to congratulate him on his fluent and cogent speech commending his report to your lordships <e> <s> we arc all proud of our great maritime tradition in this country <e> <s> it is sad news to read this report and to see how far we are slipping <e> <s> undoubtedly the noble lord together with his assiduous noble colleagues has called the attention of this house to the seriousness of the situation to how much is at stake and to possible lines on which we might proceed in the future <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him most warmly on an excellent report and to thank him for putting it before us <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the main incentive which has been in existence for some years now is that the peak point for the consumption of electricity in france is at a different time to our own <e> <s> therefore it has been an advantage for the past two decades i think for france to export electricity to us and i believe for this country to export electricity to france in off-peak periods <e> <s> there is therefore a perfectly sensible commercial objective to this arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which does not take us very much further <e> <s> is he aware that the customs and excise by means of the act protects us against the flood of pornography which pours around the world in the international trade <e> <s> is he also aware that the decision of the european court which disregarded the moral aspects of the matter in favour of the technicality cast doubt on the ethics of that court <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that by amending the obscene publications act by extending the definition of an article he could close the loophole on which the european court relied and so restore the effect of the act <e> <s> will he consider that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend be good enough to let me know when he is ready to give us the fruits of his consideration so that i may put down a further question to hear i hope a helpful answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people in our country think that there would be great benefit to the whole community if the sector of rented property in private hands was substantially increased <e> <s> therefore i would ask my noble friend to consider further relaxation of the over-stringent legislation now covering that sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that it fails absolutely to meet the substance of the question that there is now a loophole in the customs and excise power to prevent this offensive pornography flowing into this country from abroad <e> <s> is my noble friend aware bearing in mind in particular the sense of the house yesterday in favouring measures to strengthen the protection of family life and the educating of children sensibly in sex education that it would be quite out of line to leave this weakness in our legal position <e> <s> will my noble friend therefore go back to his right honourable friend the home secretary and ask him to study the obscene publications act and to consider drafting an amending bill which would add to the act manufacturing in addition to publication which it would be perfectly possible to do <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is a question i raised three or four years ago before british telecom was privatised and when this was part of the general complex of the post office <e> <s> is he aware that i was then given a non-answer such as the noble lord has given us today <e> <s> there seems to be a strange lack of interest on the part of the government in a measure which would have great benefit for the post office because nothing would create greater efficiency and greater economy in the handling of letters

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that surprisingly uninformative answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is a real need for short-term permits for parking for disabled people <e> <s> many people who have injuries accidents operations and so on require a short-time permit only <e> <s> if only long-term permits are issued this puts a premium on unscrupulous applications for a permanent permit which is not required <e>", "<cs> my lords i and i am sure other noble lords are grateful to my noble friend for undertaking to consider this point <e> <s> is he aware that in doing so he should remember that when arrangements were made in this house for permits for exemption from wearing compulsory seat belts there was a specific provision for short-term permits <e> <s> as that was workable it might be possible to make this workable too <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is really most objectionable that the noble lord however sincere his feelings should

matter hardly seem fit in this case <e> <s> these people have been in prison for five years <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that it is an outrage to human freedom that men should be treated like that

the government are to reject the alternative form of finance for the bbc through advertising <e> <s> i should like to make a short point about the statement which rejects the recommendation of the report that broadasting standards should be governed by the general law and that instead they should continue to rely i think these were the words on the much stricter standards which now exist in

material in the bbc and the iba for that matter have gone steadily downwards and that much material now contains elements of violence and obscenity which are entirely objectionable when they appear in the home in the kitchen and the sitting room for the family to see <e> <s> is he aware therefore that if he is going to rely on that existing obligation he has got to make it a great deal stronger

lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that informative answer <e> <s> but is he aware of recent press allegations that the artistic directors of these two theatres have made greater profits out of recent successes in their respective theatres when those successes have gone on to broadway and other commercial theatres than have the theatres themselves <e> <s> i listened to my noble friends reassurance but does he not think that with such very large sums of taxpayers money nearly million being

theatre which receives no grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which has more courtesy than substance in it <e> <s> is he aware that there are two new escalators that connect the bakerloo line to the district line at embankment station which were installed about two years ago

noble house and for the commons <e> <s> here we simply make claims for expenses to be refunded <e> <s> what they amount to depends for each one of us on our personal circumstances and judgment <e> <s> in the commons the situation is totally different they are allowances <e> <s> we are talking simply about a refund of expenses <e> <s> i cannot see how the per cent <e> <s> increase could possibly interfere with anyone <e> <s> it is more than the increase in the cost of living in the past year <e> <s> as most peers in any event claim rather less than the totals that are allowed because their expenses do not reach that amount it seems to me that there should be no difficulty here at all <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that with only three inspections completed and still to be carried out progress seems to be rather slow <e> <s> is there any prospect of speeding it up <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the country is covered by a fairly comprehensive network of independent radio stations which are serving local communities very well and which are financed entirely by private mostly local money <e> <s> is he further aware that any introduction of a scheme that would further divide the limited revenue which can be raised locally will probably destroy the whole structure of local radio and that most of these local radio stations many of which are not making a profit at all heaved a sigh of relief at the governments decision <e>", "<cs> my lords if the political colour of the government of greece were to change back to the extreme right as it was some years ago does my noble friend think that there would be the same body of opinion supporting the return of the elgin marbles <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the improved

after that very important intervention we return to the slightly calmer waters of the debate on the european communities amendment bill <e> <s> may i preface my remarks by saying as the majority of your lordships troop out that a number of noble lords here are still waiting to speak <e> <s> we are not yet halfway through the list of speakers at this relatively late hour this afternoon and i propose to make my remarks very brief <e> <s> indeed we have already heard a detailed and expert exposition of what is entailed in the single european act including an admirable prcis from lord templeman of the report of the select committee which he chaired so ably <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming what my noble friend has said about the reduction may i ask whether wheel clamping can be appropriately applied to these particular offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in this context the outstanding success of the docklands corporation should be borne in mind because that structure has been outstandingly successful in attracting private capital for this spectacular development in the derelict docklands <e> <s> unless the structure of the urban development corporations is set up in a way which will be attractive to private capital which will not always occur if it is simply a local authority matter we may very well not get the input of private capital which we so very much need <e> <s> will he bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one point which i think is relevant especially to the earlier speeches <e> <s> there is a suggestion that there has not been sufficient information on this very important matter i certainly go along with that that the house has not been kept sufficiently informed and that there might even be something furtive in the way the government have handled it <e> <s> i want to call attention to the two reports of the select committee that we have had on the subject one last year and one this year <e> <s> we also had the debate at the end of july when the noble and learned lord lord templeman who was chairman of the select committee concerned made the most cogent and authoritative speech analysing the proposals in detail and leaving no doubt whatsoever that the balance of advantage lay in accepting these proposed amendments <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a brief point in answer to what the noble lords lord molloy and lord bruce said about the possible amendment of this bill <e> <s> the amendment proposes that two articles be taken out of the treaty <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce knows as well as i do what that would mean <e> <s> if parliament decided to do that or to take out any other articles we should have to return to the other signatories of the european treaty and renegotiate the whole thing <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord bruce for making that explanatory point <e> <s> it does not comfort me in the least <e> <s> i do not believe that it will comfort anyone else who wants to see progress in the development of the european community <e> <s> the noble lord said that renegotiation might take two years <e> <s> it might very well <e> <s> it might take even longer <e> <s> two years have already been required i believe to negotiate what is before us <e> <s> it has been extremely difficult to get agreement to refine measures that would make it possible to achieve the central market and so avoid the continuous obstruction of recent years <e> <s> this is what the issue is about <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that among the risks he has to take note of is that probably by the middle of the next century we shall have run out of fossil fuel for generation and that we shall run the danger of all dying of cold <e> <s> would he take that into account in deciding what nuclear reactors we should use for generating purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not i am sure in any way a political issue <e> <s> it is to a large extent a procedural one <e> <s> i say with respect to my noble friend the leader of the house that the procedures of the house are being strained by such a massive volume of work with so many new clauses coming before us on report <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams the opposition spokesman has been cooperative <e> <s> i am sure that he will continue to be cooperative <e> <s> all of us want to see this bill go on the statute book <e> <s> but the opposition would have a very good case for asking for recommittal on many aspects which would mean our debates continuing for a very long time <e> <s> an undue strain is being put on the procedures of the house <e> <s> i ask my noble friend the leader of the house whether he can save the house from having such an impossible strain put upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> can my noble friend say what proportion of the total number of heavy lorries are already covered and can he further say what are the prospects that the foreign lorries of our european partners which travel on our roads may adopt these devices as well <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me how it is that considerations of humanitarian matters are connected up with these very intricate and important matters of defence especially as soviet russia is in breach of the helsinki agreement in this respect <e> <s> how is it that these humanitarian considerations are brought into this as bargaining counters <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we all share the feeling so lucidly expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon of sympathy with those who have suffered such distress and discomfort at heathrow <e> <s> however is not the logic of the situation that it is numbers that overwhelm the capacity to deal with immigrants <e> <s> is not a visa system the only way in which we can logically deal with numbers <e> <s> indeed the system has been practised by other countries as well <e> <s> is it not therefore most unwise for a leading spokesman for the labour opposition in the other place to commit his party if and when they form a government to do away with visas <e> <s> is it not the only way one can avoid this situation in the future <e>", "<cs> i warmly agree with the wise words of the noble lord on the liberal benches <e> <s> i wish to make one or two specific points to the noble lord lord bruce who i thought was rather carried away by the fervour of his own arguments <e> <s> of course we all recognise that the common agricultural policy has got completely out of control <e> <s> certainly here in this country perhaps with the exception of some sections of the farming community we wish to see it brought under control <e> <s> but of course this can be done only by in effect bringing down agricultural returns in one way or another which is going to be very painful for those concerned <e> <s> that is why nothing has been achieved to date <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a brief word about the noble lords amendments nos <e> <s> and with regard to his proposal that article and parts of it in particular should be omitted <e> <s> i think that since they have come into existence the community and especially the commission have a good deal to their credit with regard to improvements in the environment <e> <s> i had the privilege of sitting on the relevant sub-committee of the select committee for some years and therefore i have been able to observe <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the thought behind the education act was that all that is best and great in the life of our country has come from the christian tradition and christian teaching <e> <s> therefore all children should be given at least a rudimentary knowledge of that in the schools <e> <s> is that not the very best tradition that we should try to maintain today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some universities in particular the university of surrey with which i have some association are making a strong response to the governments recent move that universities should find more finance themselves by support from industry <e> <s> in particular by the development of research parks universities can not only strengthen the academic side by the interplay between the workers in these industry research units and their own staff but can also raise substantial sums of income by the development of the research parks to add to their own resources <e> <s> this makes for a splendid spirit of enterprise throughout the whole university <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in view of the enormous difficulty in making progress at government level in this matter and the entrenched interests of different nations there seems to be a prospect when british airways is privatised of its acquiring private airways in europe and thus setting up a structure in europe which might give a more liberalised fare structure than could ever be reached at government level <e> <s> it that a reality <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that apart from the fact that the generating board has been somewhat unfairly accused of adding seriously to acid rain by its emissions the major factor is undoubtedly lead emissions from motor car exhausts <e> <s> therefore will not the governments campaign in fact their programme to reduce lead in petrol make a major contribution to reducing acid rain <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that from to the number of hospital in-patients went up from million to million an increase of per cent <e> <s> how is it then that the number on waiting lists has not come down even more than is shown in the figures she mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is already a discernible trend for the narrowing of commissions on deals <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has not mentioned emissions from motor cars <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that he is completely wrong <e> <s> emissions from motor cars using petrol with a lead content are a major cause of acid rain <e> <s> therefore is not my noble friend wrong in not acknowledging that it is a major cause and that he has a very good programme for dealing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is a complicated point which <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great interest taken by this house in the legislation that promoted the new system of free operation of bus services could my noble friend arrange in the new year to publish a report of a survey nationally of how the new bus services are working throughout the country in order to fulfil our hopes as well as to allay our anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord is going to divide the house at the end of the debate i ought to spend a minute or two answering the amendment so far as it relates to the bill <e> <s> i certainly read the amendment to mean that the noble lord wanted a select committee to be set up and presumably to reach a conclusion before the bill was approved <e> <s> but i am sure the house is relieved to hear that that is not his wish and that indeed he is in favour of the bill <e> <s> therefore when the substantive motion is put to the house assuming the amendment is not carried no doubt he will vote for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he cannot have listened to the rest of my speech <e> <s> i made it clear that per cent <e> <s> of the new housing was being taken up by the local residents who have never before had a chance to buy a house <e> <s> that is the first point of interest for local people <e> <s> i also referred to the number of new jobs that would go to local people <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble and learned lord for a moment as he is so generous with his time <e> <s> he may be interested to know

buying them <e> <s> since then the prices of those houses have gone up but i am informed that the local people have been buying them for and less <e> <s> there is no doubt that the local people have

intervention by our own prime minister in meeting the president of the united states following the reykjavik meeting did not undoubtedly restore the balance in retaining a sufficiency of nuclear weapons in order to keep the necessary balance against the iron curtain powers over and above the conventional weapons <e> <s> was that not entirely due to the prime ministers intervention and is not a voice from europe very effective indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have the opportunity to join in this interesting debate <e> <s> i begin by thanking the noble lord lord annan for

lord in acknowledging the importance of the subject and the interest in it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when attributing to river authorities responsibility for the condition of coastal waters he should take into account the fact that the river authorities inherited the condition of the coastal waters and the short outfalls from the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as a past member of the surrey county council for some years i can remember that the standing of the tiffin schools in kingston was so high that every parent in kingston

their tests or remove themselves from the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is he aware of the point just made by the noble lord lord underhill that the incidence of accidents on motor cycles is still terribly high about eight times that of accidents in motor cars and that fatalities and serious injuries are almost times greater than fatalities and injuries in motor cars <e> <s> therefore the need to make off-street training compulsory is urgent in order that youngsters may have a chance to learn how to ride motor cycles safely before going on the road <e> <s> can my noble friend say what the prospects are for making off-street training a compulsory part of training before a provisional licence is issued as was contemplated six years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a good deal of expert knowledge is required to run these training schemes and that rospa is particularly well qualified to operate them <e> <s> is he aware that if the government were to provide more funds for rospa it could extend this training and thus make it possible to introduce the compulsory qualification before riders got their provisional licence <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to car thefts will my noble friend consider having it made compulsory for the licence numbers of motor cars to be etched on their windows <e> <s> that is one of the most effective ways of identifying motor cars after theft and would be an effective way of deterring the huge numbers of thefts <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take note that if there were stronger support from local education authorities for football and other games in schools public opinion would be more favourable when matters of this kind come up for consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the prime minister is about to go to moscow to talk to mr gorbachev is not that the best possible answer that the noble lord lord molloy could have to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking the noble lord lord ennals for raising this debate this afternoon and for limiting it in time <e> <s> i am afraid that i have to make an apology i also have to leave before the debate concludes <e> <s> i hope that i may be excused <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a number of the smaller areas with independent local radio now are showing signs of financial difficulty because their advertising revenues are not sufficient to pay their way <e> <s> if he spreads the butter even thinner on the bread will he not put a number of these valuable stations which are giving a very useful service

point made by the noble lord lord diamond evidently on the road to damascus is my noble friend aware that in so far as the public sector borrowing requirement has diminished from some billion or billion in the days of the labour government to billion or billion now this is reducing the additions to the national debt and therefore is specifically adding to the capital welfare of the country

measure of insurance which a surgeon has to take out amounts to around a third of his fees with the result that fees rise higher and higher and everybody suffers <e> <s> will my noble friend direct the attention of his right honourable friend the secretary of state to the danger we are in and the need to find the means to check this and ask him to consider very seriously the suggestions that have been made this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have the opportunity of saying a word in the debate and of thanking the noble baroness lady stedman for the opportunity of debating this attractive subject <e> <s> i join her in her generous tribute to william waldegrave for his work especially in the council of ministers in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that as a matter of order for the order paper this question would have been a not very welcome one in any circumstances but it would have been more formally correct if instead of the word encouraged there had been the word invited <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is not entirely the responsibility of government <e> <s> is she aware that it is also the responsibility of industry and commerce <e> <s> while fiscal policies generally in this government are helpful in this direction can further thought be directed to giving additional incentives to industry and commerce in order to build up their own research facilities <e> <s> such additional incentives can make attractive careers for our top grade scientists which we wish to see in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that unhappily this problem is not going to go away <e> <s> is he also aware that there has been a progressive increase in the amount of nitrogen gathering in aquifers especially in the eastern counties and that the present practice of heavy use of nitrogen on arable land is increasing it all the time <e> <s> is he further aware that it will be necessary for the government to take a positive view of the problem and decide one way or another how they propose to check the progressive deterioration <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the example of what is happening in the united states is so alarming that we should take a lesson from it <e> <s> in that country not only are astronomical damages running into millions being awarded but also the premiums paid for insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to follow the noble lord lord nathan who has introduced this important debate with such an admirably succinct review of our substantial report and even more substantial fourth action programme <e> <s> i am going to limit my remarks into one field <e> <s> it is a major policy statement which the ec produces

part some years ago as vice chairman of the education committee the two schools of tiffin boys and girls stood as shining lights in a very fine educational system and won more education honours than

existed in the past <e> <s> leaving aside all these local manoeuvres is my noble friend aware that the continuation of these schools will undoubtedly be for the benefit of the young people of surrey

the international dealing market for big deals has turned out to be for the benefit of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his lucid exposition of the vast and complex range of regulations <e> <s> i welcome them because i believe that the government are right to review the working of the vast system of administration <e> <s> it spends nearly one-third of the total national budget in order to provide help for those in need <e> <s> i believe that if they had failed to carry out the review of the past three years they would have been at fault <e>", "<cs> my

so it really cannot be said the changes are going to release public money which can then be redistributed as cuts in taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the virtue of legalisation depend on whether the right people take it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that hopeful answer <e> <s> however

cleaning the trains of this kind of paint and ink which is particularly difficult to remove <e> <s> would my noble friend consider strengthening the police resources of london underground so that it has a better prospect of catching the culprits <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will be encouraged to do what he can to help london transport at this time when it is spending some million to improve the appearance of trains and stations <e> <s> that will generally tend to reduce the risk of the unpleasant crimes we now see there <e> <s> will my noble friend kindly pursue the point that

ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful answer as far as it goes <e> <s> is he aware that his campaign last summer to encourage vaccination against flu has on the one hand increased the take up and the hurricane in the south-east which cut off electricity supplies for some days or even weeks on the other hand

with their exhausts in order to remove the silencing material <e> <s> therefore it is necessary for the police to institute roadside checks in order to see whether the silencing material is still present <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the last two inquiries about the management of airlines coming into this country the point about diverting aircraft to the regions including scotland was very carefully examined and it was found that there is a limit to the extent to which that can he done <e> <s> if it is overdone visitors to this country who wish to come to

right honourable friend in another place and my noble friend the leader of the house for the exposition of the bill which he gave us delivered most lucidly and with his usual charm and persuasion <e>

speech he has made justifying the very broad terms in which clause is drafted <e> <s> he told us that he will set up the national rivers authority <e> <s> indeed he has published a document about it

however i believe and trust my noble friends that we shall see it enacted in due course and that the nra will perform the functions that we expect of it <e> <s> therefore the points that the noble

of tax of p in the pound and the increase in the basic tax threshold of for the married man will be substantial financial incentives to all wage and salary earners to keep their demands low <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord renton in this amendment <e> <s> he made a point which particularly appeals to me as a practical one that even the explanatory memorandum has no validity in court <e> <s> the point that i picked up at committee stage was that the explanatory memorandum forecasts the creation of a national rivers authority <e> <s> the government have already done that informally by the publication of a sizeable document about it <e> <s> it seems to me that if my noble friend intends to go ahead and create this body which will be a very important body indeed and the

was wearing it <e> <s> people wearing seat belts sometimes are injured when the car collapses or a piece of metal drives through them but that would have happened anyway and it is not the fault of the seat belt <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we have already spent minutes on two questions and that in the interests of the ensuing business we should proceed to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we hear from the other side of the house about the failure of service stations to give good service but that my experience is that the small family service station which looks after my car does so to my utmost satisfaction <e> <s> this must be the case in the great majority of cases <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that of course he is right in saying that just as when we are buying anything else we must look around at different suppliers and choose the best one <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess i had expected that these two amendments would be moved together <e> <s> i am not absolutely clear whether the noble lord lord monson was speaking to both amendments but i imagine that he was <e> <s> therefore the debate will cover both <e> <s> perhaps other noble lords will wish to speak as they have their names down on the marshalled list <e> <s> i can only speak once so i must answer the whole debate now as well as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that this is a less restrictive amendment than amendment no <e> <s> but of course it is directed to the same purpose <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill had the argument right that clause provides for regulations <e> <s> a great deal of our debate has concerned what those regulations will deal with <e> <s> it is obvious that there are many aspects of rear seat belt wearing by children which will have to be catered for <e>", "<cs> my lords we are going around the same course again that we debated on the committee stage <e> <s> although the noble lord is technically within the custom of the house because he previously withdrew the amendment in practice we are simply repeating the debate that we had before <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that however great the affection for westminster hospital among noble lords in this house and right honourable and honourable members in the other place the regional health authority has responsibility for providing for the whole region and integrating into the development plans no less than six existing hospitals <e> <s> the rhas proposal is undoubtedly sounder both financially and technically hospital-wise than that from the westminster hospitals development fund <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is unlucky that there was not a th anniversary celebration years ago because the health service would then have been celebrating the biggest cut it had ever experienced <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a word of support for the amendment <e> <s> this is a special sort of company taking over a special sort of public duty in financing the new health centres <e> <s> i think that we have a special case here <e> <s> the question is just what form it should take <e> <s> my noble friend is right in that all companies must publish an annual report so the annual report is published <e> <s> but i think it ought to be made conveniently available to both houses of parliament because of the special nature of the body <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could with the help of his advisers give some thought as to how this might he done <e>", "<cs> that is true <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just one further point for the consideration of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> the people who work in the new centres are employed by the health service and carry out an essential part of it <e>", "<cs> surely the health service pays the salaries of the gps who work there <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i am talking about the doctors who work in the health centres <e> <s> they are an essential part of the health service as the noble lord lord ennals rightly said <e> <s> therefore it is a special situation <e> <s> i am not sure by what means my noble friend will he able to meet the wish which has been expressed but i am sure that a way can be found which will make it first convenient and easy for members of both places to get the reports and secondly for them to have access to the minister if they so wish <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of the government who seem to be a little short of support so far especially after the very persuasive speech of my noble friend lady gardner <e> <s> i correspond with the description that she gave <e> <s> as i can testify i still have a mouthful of teeth although some of them need repairs <e> <s> as she said it is perfectly true that it is older people who should go regularly for an examination <e> <s> mercifully the children are beginning to show a wonderful record in the health of their teeth and they will continue to receive free treatment <e> <s> i recognise the cogency of the case put by my noble friend with all her authority as a leading member of the dental profession <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one further word to this interesting debate <e> <s> for the sake of my noble friend on the front bench i could have wished that this amendment had been taken before the last one since it might have changed the voting <e> <s> i am someone who has his eyes tested regularly and i believe in getting a prescription <e> <s> in fact although i see reasonably well one of my eyes is slightly different from the other and so i need two somewhat different lenses <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord cullen that legalising ready-made spectacles will undoubtedly encourage people not to have tests <e> <s> of course it will <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i have tested the resilience of the barriers <e> <s> is he aware that i did so one night some years ago when i struck a patch of black ice after leaving the house after a debate <e> <s> my car skidded out of control and i struck the central barrier at i should think miles an hour <e> <s> it was a fast road and there was nothing on it <e> <s> i struck the barrier at an angle of or degrees and it gradually brought me to a stop without too much damage to the motor car <e> <s> therefore it stood up to the design specifications <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the university of surrey makes a valuable contribution to this business by being the only faculty in the country which gives a degree in catering <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that not very informative answer <e> <s> is he aware that in an episode of eastenders shown during family viewing time at in the evening of th july there was a scene with a girl who had been raped reporting at a police station which breached all standards of good broadcasting <e> <s> is he further aware that the commissioner of police of the metropolis has already complained to the bbc that the portrayal of the police officer in these very sensitive circumstances as rough and unsympathetic was quite damaging to all that the police have tried to do in recent years <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that a complaint was made by mrs whitehouse of the national viewers and listeners association about the fact that showing a scene of sex and violence during family viewing time is very offensive <e> <s> will he please expedite the setting up of the broadcasting standards council to deal with such offences <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is evident from the amount of interest on all sides of

next century especially our successors for a supply of electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the critical point of the noble baronesss question is that the industrial waste should be detoxified before it goes into the public sewer <e> <s> as long as that is done my noble friend is absolutely correct that the dilution and oxidation which will take place in the sea will safely dispose of the effluent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which was not very helpful to me <e> <s> is he aware that it will be very little consolation to the hundreds of thousands of air travellers and holiday makers some with young families who last summer spent up to hours cooped up in airports waiting for planes that did not arrive <e> <s> is he aware that as well as the dislocation through inadequate air control systems industrial action by the civil flight controllers in some european countries last summer has been largely responsible for that dislocation <e> <s> therefore will he take action to ask his right honourable friend the minister to come together with other ministers of transport in other european countries to see what action can be taken together to check this intolerable hijacking of holiday makers at the most sensitive times <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have now taken more than half the normal time for <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we are not impressed by the rate of progress of the mechanisation of postal handling and the universal introduction of the postal code <e> <s> is he also aware that if that were achieved there would be a massive saving in manpower and that it would speed up the handling of letters <e> <s> what is the prospect for the universal postal code being in position and that mechanisation being introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the past proportion of private industrys contributions to the nerc has been something of the order of per cent <e> <s> as the diminishing grant from the government has clearly had some influence on the industrial contributors <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that recent press reports state that the customs and excise are applying a more stringent test to gifts made by donor companies to universities and colleges <e> <s> can he confirm that the customs and excise has not changed the basis of the test and is applying a common-sense policy to such very desirable gifts <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will be kind enough to allow me to intervene on a point of fact <e> <s> the water bill to which my noble friend referred does not provide for that kind of disposal <e> <s> but the water companies which are now being sold to foreign hands in some cases own large reservoirs <e> <s> those are already passing into the control of foreign buyers <e>", "<cs> my lords it also depends on the quality of the questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is he aware that at present the need is acute and that in the vast metropolis it is rare to find any coherent system of traffic signs at main intersections <e> <s> where they exist they are not always helpful <e> <s> is my noble friend aware of a sign in the wandsworth-raynes park area on which the north-west arm indicates to oxford and the south-east arm of the sign indicates to folkestone <e> <s> neither is helpful to people looking for westminister or wimbledon <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that it would be helpful to all drivers to have a coherent system of signs at least for the trunk roads carrying traffic from the periphery to the centre of london <e> <s> can he say how soon his preparatory work may burgeon into action so that we see it on the gound <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very helpful answer <e> <s> i congratulate him on the extra resources that the government have placed at the disposal of london regional transport for this purpose <e> <s> however although congratulate him on the dramatic improvement in the appearance of the stations is he aware that the service is still defective <e> <s> far too often there is delay due to defective signalling or rolling stock and this causes increased congestion and then further delays <e> <s> will my noble friend direct the attention of the management to taking further care to see that these faults do not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a few words of thanks to my noble friend for introducing this bill and for giving us such a detailed and lucid explanation of its features <e> <s> i must make an apology in advance as i wish to be excused later due to an urgent appointment outside <e> <s> therefore i shall have to break my rule of normally staying until the end of debates <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true but i make the general assumption that the traffic will not be pushed into residential areas <e> <s> that would clearly be a complete failure of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the announcement of the measure of compensation that has been offered to the poultry industry <e> <s> however is she aware that a cull of per cent <e> <s> of the existing laying flock is unlikely to be sufficient to bring supply and demand into balance <e> <s> it is much more likely that a cull of per cent <e> <s> will be needed <e> <s> will she be good enough to take back to her right honourable friend the minister the view that greater compensation will be needed than that which she is proposing on the cull of the flock if the poultry industry is to be saved from disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on the first occasion on which he has answered questions at the dispatch box since he was honoured with a privy counsellorship we have all been impressed with his customary form <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that no single measure would add more to the efficiency of the post office and do more to strengthen the economy of the postal services than the completion of the postal code <e> <s> what prospect is there for that to be completed with all the saving of manpower and increases in efficiency which might be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that one point he made in his substantive answer is of dominating importance that is the appearance of the bench <e> <s> it should look broadly representative of the community especially when so many offenders today are young people <e>", "<cs> i feel i should like to add just one word to this interesting debate because i am also of an age where my eyesight is not what it was and my oculist advises me that for driving i should wear glasses although can see perfectly well to drive without them <e> <s> the result is that i normally do wear glasses and there is no doubt about it that the image is just a little clearer especially when driving fast on motorways <e> <s> therefore any driver in those circumstances will appreciate a situation a split second faster and therefore take earlier corrective action or whatever may be needed at perhaps a critical moment and thus avoid an accident <e> <s> there is no doubt a technical point here but the point my noble friend has to deal with in facing this battery of argument that has come at him is whether across the board there is enough evidence to justify requiring a specific test or anything more than we have now <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the development of the autoguide system <e> <s> i shall express the concern although i do not think it is very necessary that we should not amend the bill in any way that would handicap its development <e> <s> i was glad to hear the noble lord lord underhill supporting the principle of the scheme as he did on second reading because i think it has a valuable prospect of helping traffic movement in big cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i speak for a good many peers <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the design and choice of the average picture christmas card with which he provides us are very much to my liking and that i send the card out to about friends every year <e> <s> it is much enjoyed by my friends and he could not do better than his arts committee is now doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that relatively reassuring answer <e> <s> my impression is that in some areas the levels are significantly below normal <e> <s> is he aware that we have had a very dry january <e> <s> is he further aware that if we have a further couple of months of dry weather in february and march that will be the end of the storage period <e> <s> after that the rising temperatures and the respiration of plants mean that levels begin to drop <e> <s> if we have a long dry summer we should then have shortage difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the other aspect of this problem is the increasingly large sums which are being awarded <e> <s> is my noble friend and his right honourable friend considering whether there should be a legal limit to the damages awarded in these cases <e> <s> is he aware that in america as i understand it no less than one-third of surgeons annual fees are now devoted to insurance premiums because of the astronomical amounts which have been awarded there <e> <s> is he aware that we do not wish to follow that path here <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord lord sefton with not quite such wide-ranging polemics as he achieved and return to the subject of the bill <e> <s> that is of course to deal with what most people recognise as a serious problem in football <e> <s> the noble lord commenced his speech by saying that the bill should be thrown out by the commons <e> <s> he made it very plain that he regretted that he could not throw it out here as well <e> <s> therefore the point of view from which he looked at the matter was not entirely constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen to the noble lord with interest and respect because he speaks good sense <e> <s> he may be right that may be the right way of proceeding <e> <s> at the end of the day the police must be carried with the scheme it will never work without them <e> <s> they have done tremendous work over the past few years in keeping order and avoiding a great deal of violence in football grounds <e> <s> of course the co-operation of the police must be won and i am sure that my noble friend is fully aware of that <e> <s> whatever is finally settled as the outline of the scheme must satisfy the police as being workable so that they can join in and play a major part in making the scheme work as well as we hope it will <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although high interest rates deter businesses of any size the reduction in the basic rate of income tax and the rate of corporation tax undertaken by this government are far more important and have given a tremendous boost to the starting up of small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that minutes have now passed on this question and it is about time that we moved on <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that where litter bins are generously placed people will use them <e> <s> is he aware that in italy a country that i know well recently the rubbish in the streets has been disappearing as a result of placing litter bins everywhere <e> <s> it is the responsibility of local authorities to put them in place and to clear them <e> <s> will my noble friend try to obtain greater impetus for such a campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord hunter for giving us the opportunity to debate the white paper today and for such an interesting opening speech <e> <s> i sympathise a little with his regrets about the research situation and particularly with the burden of his report from the select committee in which he took part that my noble friend says he is now considering <e> <s> it is a fact that our research capacity has shrunk in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords it will need a great deal of effort to explain that the intention of the noble lord lord ennals was to proceed in that manner <e> <s> i hope that the discussions on the eight consultation papers will be proceeded with constructively <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and for placing in the library a copy of the report which i found interesting reading <e> <s> there are two major points which it makes where action should be taken first in applying a general blood test to all laying hens in the country for salmonella and secondly for preparing a vaccine against invasive salmonella for use with all laying hens especially breeding flocks <e> <s> those two points seem absolutely right and necessary <e> <s> will my noble friend tell the house what progress is being made on those two essential measures when they will be completed and whether all necessary resources to complete them quickly are available to those who are working on them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back to my noble friend on this point <e> <s> in view of the considerable general anxiety about this infection is he aware that greater urgency is required <e> <s> have he or his advisers consulted veterinary scientists in the united states who have some experience of this matter to see whether they can help in creating a vaccine <e> <s> a vaccine is the only way we can be sure that our laying flocks are safe <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that full answer and for the detailed report from the regions that he sent me <e> <s> that showed that rainfall during the past winter had been exceptionally low and that in the southern half of the country for the three months november december and january it was at a record low for the whole of the century <e> <s> is my noble friend satisfied that the inquiries that he has made have alerted the water authorities and water companies to the possible danger of drought this summer if we have dry months and that they are now taking the necessary precautions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that despite the golden value of his words we have spent minutes on the question <e> <s> does he believe that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the north report was particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the slant of the question gives the impression that the drinking water supply in this country has been defective in the past <e> <s> is he also aware that it has conformed with the world health organisations standards which have always been thought to be perfectly adequate <e> <s> however now that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the standard of other countries to which the noble lord lord ezra referred gives a different picture to the standard being asked for by the european commission <e> <s> is he aware that most of us have personal experience of bathing in the waters of the mediterranean from the countries round about france italy greece and spain where the waters are anything but clean <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that he is right to say that our programme of cleaning up our bathing beaches is a vigorous one <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that while we fully recognise the importance of this matter it would be far better raised in an unstarred question when more time could be given to develop it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of a related point to the question put by my noble friend <e> <s> it is the distance at which cars follow each other especially on motorways <e> <s> is he aware that in general cars follow each other far too closely and do not have the braking power to avoid a rear collision <e> <s> is he able to bring to the attention of the police the need to enforce more clearly the regulation concerning the distance between cars <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have the chance to add a few words to this debate on the bill <e> <s> i should like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lord caithness on his presentation of this vast and complex bill <e> <s> he did so in what seemed to me i made a note of this to be most mellifluous terms <e> <s> there are indeed many conflicts to come <e> <s> however the legislation certainly sounded very easy when he explained it to us <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend on the creation of the nra and i also congratulate my noble friend lord crickhowell on his presentation of the subject <e> <s> i have no doubt that the nra will provide a robust safeguard for the future water environment of our country <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend upon putting forward that proposal in the bill <e> <s> further i am sure that my noble friend lord crickhowell will make a most successful chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> would he be good enough to tell the house what this report was concerned with <e> <s> it was concerned with the proposal by the southern water authority to absorb the half-dozen water companies in its region because it wished to cover the whole area itself <e> <s> the report ended by recommending that it should not do it so it does not seem to be quite so damning as the noble earl indicated <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh has persuasively invited me to support him <e> <s> i sympathise with his objective <e> <s> i understand the very general anxieties that exist all over the country about the development of these huge areas that run into hundreds of thousands of acres across the land <e> <s> i believe that it will be too drastic for all the land owned by the regional water authorities to be taken away and moved over to the national rivers authority <e> <s> the greater part of the land will be required by the companies of the future <e> <s> i believe that the safer and more realistic approach is the one that i have in mind <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to persuade the committee to accept it <e> <s> we should have the statutory water company model instead of the plc in the bill <e> <s> as members of the committee have rightly said the plc has the primary motive of making a profit <e> <s> it is believed that this will give it the incentive to efficiency for the benefit of all <e> <s> this is not the moment for me to develop that argument but i do not believe that is so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words about sampling and laboratory testing <e> <s> i confirm what my noble friend lord crickhowell has said <e> <s> the job of taking samples and testing for all the rivers in the country is an immense one <e> <s> the regional water authorities are doing it at the moment as the bodies responsible for river quality and for checking what is coming out of their own and other treatment works <e> <s> this is a matter of physical necessity <e> <s> for the nra to set up an organisation to do that so to speak overnight would be clearly impossible <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me i sympathise with his query because that point seems odd <e> <s> the kind of ordinary shares which the statutory companies can raise are those with a maximum dividend which may be paid on the share <e> <s> they may pay a lower dividend but never one higher than the maximum fixed for that share <e> <s> they are called ordinary shares but they are a peculiar type of ordinary share <e> <s> it is not an ordinary share as my noble friend understands it <e> <s> perhaps i may put another point <e> <s> i did not say that consumers own the industry i said that they own the equity of the industry and that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> i did not say that the shareholder comes first i said that the consumer comes first <e> <s> it is under the bill that the shareholder comes first <e>", "<cs> i am sure that members of the committee from all sides feel that it is time to bring to an end our debate <e> <s> first i must thank the speakers who have been good enough to support the amendment that i put forward <e>", "<cs> my noble friend backs me up <e> <s> i think it is about the only issue on which he has agreed with me today <e> <s> we are talking about whether we believe that the profit incentive will suit this industry which has never had it better than the incentives of the past of public service and the automatic system of adjusting in the interests of the consumer <e> <s> it is a fact that the bill puts the shareholder first quite definitely in clause <e> <s> the director general of water services must ensure that there is a reasonable return for the shareholder and the consumer then takes the consequences after that has been secured <e> <s> that is a quite different priority from that of the statutory water company <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that over hospitals have indicated that they would like to become self-governing <e> <s> if so is he aware that that is encouraging news because there is no doubt that self-governing hospitals will be able to play a much greater part in the health service <e>", "<cs> i wish to call attention to a practical difficulty in the noble lords amendment <e> <s> the business of supplying water operating the sewage treatment processes and managing the whole of the rest of the vast business has to go on <e> <s> the regional water authorities which are fulfilling this function come to an end when the legislative process is completed and the undertakings are sold in the market to private shareholders <e> <s> it would seem quite illogical not to make the necessary appointments in order to take charge of this vast process of water supply and sewage treatment which has to continue <e> <s> it would be a complete vacuum <e> <s> however these things would go on <e> <s> the people on the ground so to speak or in the water would still be there working away <e> <s> i should have thought that the sooner the new organisation is working with the new people in charge and responsible the better <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is good at procedure and plays a large and helpful part in debates in this committee <e> <s> i believe that he is straining at a gnat here <e> <s> it does not seem to be a matter of vast significance <e> <s> i am holding up only half of the bill and we have a great deal to go through <e> <s> we have talked about trivialities but in my view this really is trivial <e> <s> the explanation that the noble lord lord mcintosh gave was a perfectly reasonable one <e> <s> whether the paper floated down from the ceiling or where it came from i do not know <e> <s> i believe that the example he gave was a very good one <e> <s> my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has so much experience and provides such tremendous value in the cut and thrust of this committee that i hope he can see that this is not a matter that we should pursue <e> <s> i believe that we should get on with the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one word of support for my noble friend <e> <s> discussion has been continuing ever since the act as to whether the balance was right between the water authorities and the local authorities <e> <s> the discussion is understandable for the very good reasons that the <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend lord caithness for his response to our amendment <e> <s> it is a somewhat involved situation <e> <s> the amendment was partially factual and partial probing <e> <s> my noble friend has substantially met the purposes for which we moved our amendment <e> <s> i did not expect the amendment to be accepted in the form in which i put it down but his concept of how the new plcs would have to be financed appeals to <e>", "<cs> i quite understand the noble lords point but i thought it needed to be said that in any event the government in other words the taxpayer would have to finance the huge capital programme which is now needed <e> <s> it is a matter of opinion different on each side as to whether that can be done better and with more benefit to the public by financing from the private sector and the private market or from the public sector <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words before the noble lord puts the question <e> <s> i apologise for not speaking earlier but i did not realise that the debate would come to an end so soon <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord cranbrook <e> <s> i believe that this measure is necessary for rivers <e> <s> there are certainly such regulations on the river thames where of course there are many vessels <e> <s> however it is quite difficult to enforce the regulations <e> <s> if there is placed on the river management authority the necessity of establishing sanitary stations so that vessels can discharge <e> <s> that requires a lot of organisation <e> <s> however it is essential in the interests of the purity of the river that there should be a regulation of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figure of quoted by the noble lord lord molloy seems to indicate that he has picked up the figure that was discussed during the debate on the cost of connection which in future will be thrown on to the developer of a new building not every year but just once at the time of the original construction <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the point that there should be no discrimination between different water users was very clearly made in the act <e> <s> is he further aware that it must be absolutely right to stick to that decision <e> <s> i hope that he will <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friend aware that the recent announcement of the commissioning of a second antarctic research vessel to gather information in this context is particularly welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always interesting to listen to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> he speaks with such cogency that i feel more than three-quarters persuaded before i start <e> <s> i felt strongly that my noble friend the minister should respond immediately and say yes of course we should remove the subsection and the flexibility <e> <s> i wonder sometime when we are discussing the problems of reducing pollution how much noble lords can visualise what happens <e> <s> i was going to say on the ground but it is more in the industrial premises which discharge the main toxic effluents into the local sewage works <e> <s> there are the problems as the effluent comes in changing perhaps more often than it should because the industrial process sometimes changes and therefore presents different problems for the treatment process in the sewage treatment works <e> <s> i am referring to the type of problems that the water authorities now and the water companies in the future have to contend with <e> <s> there is the problem of what happens when the final effluent arrives in the river and all the problems of sufficiently monitoring conditions as they change <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend how the proposed charging system in this bill varies from that in the act <e> <s> these charging structures are very complicated <e> <s> i am not absolutely clear as to how they will work under this bill <e> <s> i know fairly well how the act worked <e> <s> i should like to read out some subsections in section <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the logic of the speech made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> however as the new companies will be operating for profit they should be subjected to the same discipline as industry is now in regard to their discharges <e> <s> they should be required to observe a strict standard <e> <s> therefore as the noble lord rightly said there is a change from the constitutional position of the regional water authorities which are now operating as public corporations <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may just add a word of explanation and excuse for myself because i undoubtedly went a great deal wider than the amendment <e> <s> however there was an implication regarding that point in the rather ingenious speech of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i was responding to that but i do not think that my noble friend the minister can be blamed for not dealing with that point because it is miles outside the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which only partially answers the question which i asked <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the system of monitoring this testing seems very incomplete <e> <s> is she aware that the wish of the whole community is the elimination of this dangerous disease of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i pursue the point about the sum of money that my noble friend has spoken about the million which has been allocated for research <e> <s> if she cannot tell the house now which research station is to receive that sum to pursue that research will she perhaps write to me and also as to what is the programme of that research and when we can expect a report on the progress being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting answer <e> <s> it is rather like the bible story of the non-answer which offers an account of the minor prophets <e> <s> however i did not ask about animal protein inspections i asked about inspections of intervention stocks of cereals <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that inevitably cereals are infested with rats and mice and it is well known that rats and mice are carriers of salmonella <e> <s> can <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that her answer to this part of my question is far from satisfactory <e> <s> will she take back this message to members of the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> it is essential to have regular inspections of intervention grain stores and regular testing in order to ensure that they contain no source of salmonella <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the leader of the house for his <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express a word of support for the motion which has been so eloquently moved by the most reverend primate <e> <s> i fear on the other hand that i cannot support the motion of my noble friend lord lauderdale much though i sympathise with the passionate conviction with which he put his case and which i well recognise from many occasions in the past when we have been on the same side <e> <s> i should also like to thank the ecclesiastical committee for its report on this measure <e> <s> i note its recommendation in favour of it which i was glad to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the noble and learned lord lord bridge say that <e> <s> indeed he has heard a great deal about the matter from the ecclesiastical committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble baronesss point about the government considering further legislation in this field is my noble friend aware that the government would be very much at fault at present when the country is suffering from these rail strikes if they were not doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords much as i admire my noble friend lord wolfson i am astonished that he with his keen sense of commerce should be willing to commit the government to large sums of money many millions of pounds without knowing the facts especially at a time when we are just about to have the results of the survey which will give us the facts <e> <s> i have a great deal of personal sympathy for the amendment because i have a brother who is both blind and deaf <e> <s> i know the difficulties of getting about i understand the problems <e> <s> but before the government are asked to commit themselves i think that we should wait especially when it is only a matter of weeks or perhaps months at the outside to find out the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word of congratulation to my noble friend on proposing the new statutory order <e> <s> i extend that congratulation to the honourable member in another place mr peter bottomley on being the main force in arranging the very wide consultations that have taken place <e> <s> they have helped to give confidence all round to iron out the many practical difficulties that we discussed at some length during committee stage and to meet the very practical points that the noble lord lord monson raised in his splendid traditional defence of the liberty of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this question has been asked several times in this house in the past year or so <e> <s> is he aware that it is right that we should look to ministers who appoint the top management of london transport to ensure that the standard is maintained at a reasonable level <e> <s> since so much has been done to improve it is it not a great pity that this essential aspect of the escalators should not be properly attended to <e> <s> would he make a point of asking top management to give a greater priority to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider the following suggestion <e> <s> when these seductive advertisements for borrowing appear in the national press they should state that where a second charge is required on the property and there is a default the individuals property is at risk <e> <s> there should be a warning as is the case with cigarette advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already taken minutes on this question and are about to breach the very principle which we decided yesterday to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the courtesy of his answer but not for its substance <e> <s> is he aware that students at surrey university in guildford receive some per cent <e> <s> less per annum in student grant amounting to about a year than their neighbours just up the road and less than miles away at the royal holloway college in egham <e> <s> that is completely unfair to the students at surrey university <e> <s> as my noble friend has some obligation under the new social security arrangements will he take action to see that no one is worse off under those arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the last words of his answer to me about the possibility of some help from the new access funds is encouraging <e> <s> i see that it is possible that the universities funding council can make grants to universities in cases of hardship <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that it is quite clear that there is hardship in this particular case <e> <s> further will my noble friend put his considerable influence with the universities funding council in the scales to ask the council to consider the case of the surrey university very sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the commission is in the unusual position of making regulations and starting prosecutions when it has neither a monitoring force to find out what the offences are in the member countries nor an enforcement procedure for penalising the countries if they are considered to be out of order <e> <s> is he aware that the monitoring is dependent solely on complaints from member countries <e> <s> that is a very odd position for something which is said to be legal <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we have already exceeded our normal time for questions by seven minutes and that it is time we moved on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in addition to the convenience for those in northern climes of sticking to the present system there is the great convenience of a single time throughout europe for the business life of this country especially the financial life of london and that is a fact of which we should not lose sight <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls intervened on a point of order <e> <s> it is not in order for noble lords other than the mover of the amendment to speak after the minister has replied <e> <s> the device of saying before the noble lord sits down is familiar but there is a limit to which it can be streched <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham gave it a pretty good stretch when his question developed into a mini-speech <e> <s> it is in the interests of all noble lords to try to keep to the rule and i believe that noble lords opposite are stretching it a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for her slightly emollient answer <e> <s> is she aware that there are to be seen around our fields increasing patches of these noxious weeds the seeds of which are blowing around to plague the fields and gardens of neighbours <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that no one likes to be the recipient of their neighbours wild oats <e> <s> would my noble friend consider making the control of these noxious weeds one of the conditions of continuing to pay the per acre for set aside land <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord middleton and the members of the select committee for their careful and penetrating report on a complex and important subject <e> <s> the analysis of the agricultural consequences of the directive if pursued with per cent <e> <s> rigour is both authoritative and alarming <e> <s> i hope that it will be studied by the commission and acted upon <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as a regular user of the underground and a former frequent critic of the escalators my impression is that there has been a slight improvement in recent months <e> <s> as i always count the steps when i have to climb up without using the escalators i believe that my impression is probably reliable <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us what is the increase in the use of day beds <e> <s> is that one factor which is increasing the curing of patients with less use of beds <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the main benefit of wheel-clamping is the protection of the single yellow line which is supposed to be used by trade vehicles for unloading <e> <s> if there is no place for such vehicles to park at the kerb they double park and thus hold up the traffic <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right in saying that there have been significant reductions in breaches of the yellow line regulations and in the amount of double-parking by trade vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see my noble friend the leader of the house on the front bench is my noble friend aware that we have already taken minutes of the time intended for all questions <e> <s> does he not agree that it is time for us to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is an element of urgency in reducing the amount of obstruction to traffic especially in towns that these street works cause <e> <s> is he aware in particular that one of the proposals which has been considered for inclusion in the legislation is a lane charge to contractors in order to encourage them to use the new trenchless technology and thus avoid obstructing traffic <e> <s> is he aware that it really is most urgent to bring this into action as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving us the opportunity to debate this most important subject this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for his extremely comprehensive introductory speech <e> <s> he will of course understand that the limitation of time will prevent me from covering such a wide range of subjects as he has <e> <s> in fact i intend primarily to speak about the hospital service upon which the noble lord commented encouragingly as regards the progress being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be the first noble lord to congratulate the noble lord lord shepherd on the report and on his authoritative speech commending it to your lordships <e> <s> it is a report of great importance and interest <e> <s> he and his committee obviously worked hard and covered a huge range of business in putting together cogent findings <e> <s> the message that i received from what he said and what i have read is that although large resources are being directed into infrastructure by all member states the total still falls far short of what is needed to meet the ever-growing need <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is he aware that as a regular user of the underground during peak times i have observed the new barriers working satisfactorily <e> <s> is he further aware that the london underground authority should take credit for installing the automatic barriers which have led to an obvious advantage <e> <s> does he agree that the saving of million is less than i expected because fare evasion was known to be occurring on a very large scale <e> <s> does he anticipate that the figure will be improved upon <e> <s> will my noble friend answer my last question about problems of congestion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the reduction in in-patients mentioned by the noble lord lord ennals to some extent due to the great increase in day-patients <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we have now spent minutes on <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that we should speed up a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments new initiative in their discussion document <e> <s> i believe that it will make a big improvement as regards london traffic <e> <s> incidentally i have observed that the majority of vehicles in london are light delivery vans not private cars <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that while there is pollution in the north sea our country is only one of many bordering the north sea and our contribution to pollution is a great deal less than that of other countries with great rivers like the rhine <e> <s> the greatest amount of waste dumped in the north sea by britain would be only a fraction of that emitted by the river rhine <e> <s> is he aware that the dumping of sludge in the north sea is carefully monitored by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food and that there is no sign of a build-up of toxicity in that area or of any effect on fish stocks <e> <s> while it is true that the dumping of chemical waste will have to come to an end we would be wise to wait until the five-year survey that is being carried out by the natural environmental research council is completed so that we know what exactly is happening in the north sea and who is responsible for most of the pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that informative answer <e> <s> is he aware that the information that he has given about water levels in the southern region reflects the dangers for water supply next summer in that region where rationing and shortages are already endemic <e> <s> is he aware that the southern region is particularly dependent on groundwater supplies from which it obtains per cent <e> <s> of its water <e> <s> that is more than in most other regions <e> <s> does he agree that the answer would be for southern water to build a couple of large storage reservoirs which would conserve some of the rainfall in order to supplement the groundwater supply <e> <s> does he also agree that that would provide an adequate overall supply for dry summers <e> <s> will the noble lord advise the company that that is the action it should take with all expedition <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord mellish is perfectly right to say that adequate water comes from the skies and that we are well blessed in this country with more than we need only using about per cent <e> <s> of what falls from the skies for supply <e> <s> management therefore depends on storing enough of the winter rains either underground or in surface reservoirs to ensure that we have sufficient for dry times in the summer <e> <s> a couple more reservoirs are needed for the southern region to supplement the limited aquifer supplies <e>", "<cs> rose to ask her majestys government what action they are planning to reduce <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that though there may be many weaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we ought not to move on to the next question <e> <s> we have had minutes on this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for a new system of student finance arises out of the success of our education policy in the rapid expansion of numbers of students <e> <s> it has already been mentioned that there are more students in further education than there were years ago and it is forecast that the numbers will double in the next years <e>", "<cs> my lords while i should certainly be critical of the quality of management in british rail and feel sure that there is room for great improvement there is my noble friend aware that the logistics of commuter traffic into london i am a daily sufferer so i am aware of the problems are unlikely to be met satisfactorily with an adequate standard of service simply by relying on the commercial market <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that it will be necessary for a certain amount of public funds to be made available in order to maintain a good standard of service in place of a service which is at present very far from good <e>", "<cs> i should like to enter into this modest auction <e> <s> i am especially interested in the university of surrey in guildford <e> <s> housing costs in the area are even more horrific than they are in london <e> <s> i would not be in favour of changing the whole structure of the bill with this amendment to cater for such differentials <e> <s> of course london receives a differential under the rules of procedure and therefore its special need is recognised by my noble friend <e> <s> however my friends in the university of surrey do not receive such a recognition although as i said the housing costs in the area are even higher <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put another point to my noble friend which is not entirely helpful to him but which i believe is very germane to the view of the house <e> <s> noble lords who wish to take part in this and they are on all sides of the house will need to study the consumer credit act and obtain expert legal advice on it because this amendment seeks to stretch the terms of the act in order to make this exception <e> <s> it may be perfectly valid and possible to do that but it seems to me a relevant point that we cannot take the bill as it is on its merits without considering it in relationship to what is a very complicated piece of legislation namely the act <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend has taken that into account in the view which he has taken <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies once again i have already intervened but perhaps i may add one thought <e> <s> he said that we should debate this amendment and see what happens <e> <s> if the consensus is that debate on report is inadequate to deal with it he is prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put one more point to my noble friend <e> <s> there is a certain logic in this amendment <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to raise additional funds for the universities and the growing number of students <e> <s> this is a measure which will be of assistance to the treasury and the taxpayer in the long run <e> <s> the universities are being asked to work the machinery when the bill becomes an act <e> <s> it is only reasonable that the cost of working that machinery which will benefit the government should be borne by them <e>", "<cs> my lords allow me to begin by congratulating the noble lord and telling him that it is all too long since the house had the pleasure of hearing him <e> <s> we have much appreciated listening to him today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we have a specific as well as a general interest in the observance of these regulations by our neighbour member countries in europe <e> <s> is he also aware that a number of species of birds have to cross europe from north africa in order to reach this country <e> <s> unless better care is taken or less slaughter perpetrated by our neighbours the birds will not arrive here <e> <s> for instance the poor little nightingale has a most perilous journey from north africa being destroyed on the borders of the mediterranean as she flies to europe <e> <s> we are entirely dependent on our neighbours as to whether the nightingales arrive here <e> <s> far too few do so <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for her very careful reply to an authoritative debate on this amendment <e> <s> i also thank my noble friend lord mccoll who has great expertise in this field for his remarks <e> <s> nevertheless i am still left with queries as to what will happen on st april next year <e>", "<cs> i need not answer the noble lords question <e> <s> he must do that for himself <e> <s> my guess is that some would want to and some would not <e> <s> i believe that is a fact <e> <s> the first thing they would want to do is to ascertain what it meant <e> <s> they would need a modern management system so that they knew what they were dealing with <e>", "<cs> the atmosphere which has been created in the country has certainly been unfair and unkind <e> <s> the nhs trust is seen as the noble baroness lady phillips said as privatisation by the back door <e> <s> but the national health service trust will be just as much within the national health service as district hospitals <e> <s> nevertheless one must face the fact that the general feeling is that the creation of the trust is a step towards privatisation and therefore there is opposition even though people do not really know much about it <e>", "<cs> i disagree slightly with my noble friend lady carnegy with whom i usually agree <e> <s> i have been privileged to be chairman of a small religious hospital for several years <e> <s> we formed a board with three consultants on it from the start who are enormously useful <e> <s> they are high-powered people by their nature as consultants <e>", "<cs> i speak from experience although it is narrow experience <e> <s> we have three powerful personalities who have been extremely helpful <e> <s> they do not always agree with me nor i with them but the total outcome is that we have got things right as we have gone along <e> <s> we have made major developments on this line that on a much larger scale the nhs trusts will have to make with modem management computer systems cost accounting and so on <e> <s> we have to live with this with some difficulty <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to give a helpful answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the hash-up in london which heaven knows is bad enough services repairs which require the digging up of roads are a major contributory factor <e> <s> there are as many as per kilometre per annum in the city <e> <s> there are modern techniques by which these repairs could be carried out without breaking the surface <e> <s> they need to be encouraged by legislation which puts the emphasis the right way <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that that would make a major contribution to reducing the traffic hold-ups in london <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the timescale for making an appointment to the commission is unduly long <e> <s> can anything be done to reduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the bundesbank did not maintain its independence for very long in the face of chancellor kohls decision on one-for-one exchange rates between east and west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a tradition of christianity in this country and that most of us feel that all the values which we hold most dear to our hearts and our way of life stem from christianity <e> <s> we would expect therefore that legislation in this field would cater for that view <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on this occasion i find myself in complete agreement with the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> is she further aware that the question of my noble friend lord clanwilliam although in order procedurally is in the worst possible taste implying that numbers of people have lost their lives as a result of treatment by the health service or pharmaceutical drugs <e> <s> is she also aware that the noble lord lord molloy is absolutely right that the record of our health and pharmaceutical services in saving lives has a reputation which is second to none in the world and we should be proud of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the result of the new gps contract has been a significant increase in the number of tests taken running into hundreds of thousands <e> <s> therefore does my noble friend not agree that we should give credit for the contract despite the fears which the noble lord opposite has about what might happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house at what level of inflation he <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the great drought of the record of the anglian water authority as it then was in the management of its water resources was quite outstanding <e> <s> it was able to maintain supplies despite great difficulties <e> <s> the area relies on a high proportion of groundwater supplies the countryside being very flat and reservoirs a difficult proposition <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the implication in this question is not justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to my noble friend that we have now taken minutes to deal with three questions <e> <s> we have far exceeded the time allotted for question time <e> <s> if this very important point is to be continued should it not be continued by way of a debate <e> <s> i think that we should now proceed with the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people who have not been entirely bewildered by the adverse press presentation of this affair in respect to the enormous liability of the rover group which my noble friend rightly told us had already cost the taxpayer thousands of millions of pounds and was likely to cost even more because there was no possibility of it becoming sound will feel a sense of immense relief that further money will not be lost to the taxpayer <e> <s> is he also aware in regard to the other major point he made about the jobs of men and women being at stake that it will be seen that by getting the rover group transferred to a strong and viable company such as british aerospace the prospect of the continuing employment of such people is now secure <e> <s> at the same time it will also be seen that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord beloff makes a sound point <e> <s> is she further aware that i have been a regular attender at stratford-upon-avon every year for many years <e> <s> some young producers achieve productions so unconventional that they literally become a send-up of the work <e> <s> the basic attraction of shakespeares wonderful plays is completely spoiled <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the monitoring of beaches and coastal waters depends on the monitoring of the individual states concerned <e> <s> is not the commissions information entirely dependent on that <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether there is adequate monitoring of for instance the mediterranean states <e> <s> is he aware that whereas we have committed ourselves to this huge capital expenditure of nearly billion <e> <s> which will weigh heavily on our economy it seems more than likely that some of our partners in the european community have not committed themselves in any way to a similar programme for cleaning up their waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words on the procedural point which is an important aspect <e> <s> my noble friend made a serious procedural error but the narrowness of that procedural error deserves comment <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams has tabled a motion <e> <s> i must confess that in the years that i have been in this house i have never seen such a motion on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord put down the motion in order to deal with this procedural point <e> <s> that is a serious thing to do as it amounts to a vote of censure on my noble friend lord trefgarne <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that factual answer which i find rather discouraging <e> <s> is he aware that the spread of these sites is such that there are now nearly of them across the country <e> <s> is he further aware that there are serious objections to the ecological damage caused in some woodlands by the war games and to the noise that is caused to people living nearby <e> <s> will my noble friend consider revising the -day rule which is not monitored <e> <s> therefore no one knows how many times these sites are being used <e> <s> i hope he will consider limiting the rule so that where planning consent is given it is given only for a specific number of dates in the year which can be identified <e>", "<cs> my lords considering the drastic measures which the government took against the poultry industry in order to control salmonella does my noble friend think that she should take a little more action to control the danger of the incidence of salmonella from terrapins <e> <s> secondly does she have some anxiety about the neglect suffered by many of these attractive creatures when the person who has bought one or the child who owns it becomes bored and neglects to care for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very informative answer is she aware that the low levels of storage now indicate the probability of a further shortage next summer <e> <s> is she also aware that there is very little prospect of storage levels being restored by next spring to the full normal levels unless we have exceptionally heavy rain in every single month for the five months that remain of the winter <e> <s> in the light of this prospect of another water shortage next summer and bearing in mind the water shortage of the past two summers does my noble friend not agree that the time has come when the government should set up a survey to investigate the supply and demand for water throughout the country in order to determine whether additional storage reservoirs are required over the next years <e> <s> it takes at least years to commission and build a new reservoir does my noble friend not agree that such steps should be taken in order to meet the normal growth in demand and to avoid the serious shortages which are fairly widespread throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that her information that a report has already been set in hand is very good news which we should all welcome <e> <s> does she agree that when the report is received action will be urgent in some areas <e> <s> it takes at least years when starting to commission a reservoir to get through all the hoops of town planning consent and then there is the vast business of construction and the filling of the reservoir <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may call attention to the fact that we have taken minutes over the first two questions <e> <s> that is our allowance for the whole of question time <e> <s> i suggest that the remaining two questions should pass rather more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house whether the secretary of state will take into account the degree to which the individual hospital has been able to develop the resource management initiative in other words to modernise its management before it can qualify to become a self-governing trust <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the urgency which now exists in some of the hospices whose emergency services are immensely valuable when can we expect a decision by her majestys government to grant the sums of money which we are expecting <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a point on registration especially in answer to the beguiling tones of the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> it is represented to us that the registration scheme would be self-financing <e> <s> that would be attractive if it were to relieve local authorities of any addition to the poll tax but experience in northern ireland has not proved that per cent <e> <s> registration is achieved <e> <s> there registration is only between some per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> with our million dogs it would probably be even less <e> <s> the idea that a registration scheme would be self-financing sounds attractive but like other attractive ideas everyone is in favour of them but no one practises them <e> <s> it is rather like the church of england <e> <s> everyone is in favour of it but no one practises <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i did not do the noble baroness justice <e> <s> there is a strong point here <e> <s> responsible dog owners are well aware that they will be carrying the burden of the majority <e> <s> two large petitions from dog owners against registration have already arrived in the other place <e> <s> they realise that they are in danger of being clobbered for

should like with what has gone before <e> <s> i sympathise with the noble baroness lady stedman about the need to preserve village life by maintaining the single village shop <e> <s> that is all we have in my village it is next to the village school and it is vital in order to keep the village going <e> <s> my word we certainly try hard there to do that <e> <s> the noble baroness mentioned other matters which i shall not follow up since my speech concerns transport <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i had the honour to represent a constituency <e> <s> we had a membership of

complicated bill <e> <s> he made clear the many technical clauses and has given us a useful start <e> <s> i also thank the parliamentary draughtsman <e> <s> clauses and contain indices of the expressions used <e> <s> i have not previously seen that in a bill <e> <s> my noble and learned friend on the cross benches drew my attention to that <e> <s> it is a good idea and i am sure that all
