["<cs> my lords i am not finding it very easy to settle in on this side of the house <e> <s> after five years apprenticeship on the benches opposite i find that the scenery has changed in the past few days <e> <s> the chamber looks different noble lords and noble baronesses opposite look different <e> <s> they look more cheerful even younger as if they had a renewed sense of purpose in life a look of reprieve is on their faces <e> <s> it is all very strange but we shall have to get used to it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is so <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course a secular point of view about this subject as well as a religious one <e> <s> until the noble lord spoke just now i thought that we were going to get through the debate without quotations from scripture or without the voice of the so-called leviticus school <e> <s> of course they were freely relied upon in the discussions years ago on the question of the marriage to a deceased wifes sister <e> <s> but i come back to those considerations which i think are important in relation to the general issue before the house at present <e>", "<cs> then my lords i say that the exclusions have not been specifically made since the general change took place <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that when in introducing a bill and asking the house to give that bill a second reading an offer of a substantual change in the bill is made by the mover that virtually becomes part of the bills second reading <e> <s> that is my judgment of the situation <e> <s> at all events the noble lord lord mishcon has said that he supported the second reading of the bill as he did on a previous occasion on the understanding that this question of age restraint would be part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that for this house to have a debate on the governments economic strategy is a somewhat rare occasion <e> <s> certainly i do not recall in the five years of my membership of your lordships house any debate of this kind and i welcome the innovation if <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that we shall have a sight of this report soon <e> <s> for example will it be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i have objected on a previous occasion to a motion to take all stages of a bill on the same day without explanation and without justification <e> <s> if i may say so in moving this motion the noble lord did it just as casually as if he was saying that it is a nice warm day which it is <e> <s> the noble lord said not a word about the need for suspending our normal procedure for dealing with bills <e> <s> he said nothing about the urgency of the matter <e> <s> christmas is still a little way away <e> <s> the noble lord offered no explanation <e> <s> i think that we have to watch very carefully casual attempts to override the normal procedure of this house unless there is a very strong justification for it <e>", "<cs> my lords apologise for rising to make a few comments on the bill without having given notice but i am sure that your lordships will understand what a great inconvenience it is not to have the normal facility of seeing a printed order paper <e> <s> we have our annual printing difficulties but when will they be overcome <e> <s> the order paper is not delivered any more <e> <s> therefore when a motion to take all stages of the bill is sprung upon us as it was today it makes it difficult to be fully equipped to deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate that we have had today has been more than a discussion on the second reading of a bill <e> <s> i believe that it is the opening of a long and i hope fruitful debate on this difficult subject which is likely to continue in parliament for some time <e> <s> as an indication of public concern on this question i would remind your lordships house that the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard two speeches or observations upon my noble friends bill <e> <s> both were very disappointing <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley suggested that we should wait for the government bill which was going to be more comprehensive and probably more satisfactory <e> <s> the best is often the enemy of the good and moreover it is a mistake to await government bills in the hope that they are going to be better and bigger than other bills because very often they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords however much i try to compress my subsequent remarks i feel i must spare a moment to say what pleasure i got and i am sure all your lordships did from the three maiden speeches we heard this afternoon <e> <s> all three noble lords some of us knew well as colleagues in another place and there are two coincidences about the three of them <e> <s> one is that two of them the noble lord lord godber of willington and my noble friend lord ross served with me on a three-man inquiry appointed by the then prime minister mr callaghan into the security of cabinet documents <e> <s> that was an interesting exercise we found a few loopholes and we believe we closed them up and your lordships may have noticed that leaks have been fewer of late <e>", "<cs> then my lords my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos succeeded me as chairman of the parliamentary labour party <e> <s> i know the ordeals of that office <e>", "<cs> and my noble friend was in the chair throughout the period of the last parliament so all three are my friends and former colleagues <e> <s> i would only say about lord ross that he had a high reputation in the other place of being the scourge of the government of the day <e> <s> i think we got only the faintest glimpse of his capacity for invective this afternoon i hope we shall hear more of it even in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this bill <e> <s> after the clear explanation given by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran we realise that this bill is to provide the remedy for faults in previous legislation <e> <s> under the representation of the people armed forces act it seems evident that neither house of parliament understood what a grievance they were imposing on service wives <e> <s> apparently even in the year we were unaware that married women wanted to be recognised as independent citizens and not merely as the noble lord said as appendages of their <e>", "<cs> as to who we really are is a matter we can go into in more detail on another occasion my lords <e> <s> all the same what has become of that old tag about no taxation without representation <e> <s> since your lordships house has been deprived of all parliamentary authority on matters of taxation and finance why have we not long since claimed then to have some voice in the affairs of the country relating to economics finance and taxation along with other citizens <e> <s> i am sure there is a history to this matter but admit frankly that i have not looked it up <e> <s> i do not think we need dwell unduly on the history of some of our institutions we look at them in the light of modern requirements and there is not the slightest reason why peers should be denied the vote on the parliamentary register and should be deprived of the rights of every other citizen <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord listowel for introducing this debate and the noble lord lord chorley for contributing his maiden speech to it <e> <s> the noble lord lord chorley is obviously well informed and has given a good deal of thought to this matter <e> <s> i think that we shall need him in the future and i hope that we shall hear from him on this and other subjects again <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now discussing the substance of an amendment which was moved in committee only days ago <e> <s> unfortunately on that occasion i was occupied in another part of the building and was not able to take part in the debate <e> <s> i am not sure that we have in fact given the minister an opportunity to give the consideration to the matter that she promised to give only days ago <e> <s> i cannot accept this new clause i most strongly oppose it <e> <s> my noble friend lady birk has given some wise words to the house on this difficult subject but surely the house will pause before writing into an act of parliament provisions of the kind which are contained in this new clause <e> <s> the matter surely needs more consideration which the noble baroness the minister promised to give it and it needs full consideration too by other people and there must be consultation as well <e>", "<cs> no i am sorry the noble earl may not <e> <s> as i was saying it just goes to show that there is the weight of opinion in this house behind the work of the family planning association <e> <s> it is all very well for those who do little or nothing in this field to condemn those who are doing their best <e> <s> i have read many pamphlets on this subject and many contributions from various sources of moral welfare <e> <s> of course they are all in favour of moral responsibility they are all in favour of the great virtues in life but so far as i <e>", "<cs> my lords i would admit any disqualifications or qualifications that i have when it comes to speaking on this subject but at least they are as good as most other peoples including those of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords since animals in northern ireland are mercifully spared religious differences the grievances of hgistory and membership of the ira what have these wicked people got against them <e> <s> does the noble lord think that a delegation of humanists from england might help to restore the standards of animal welfare and kindness in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord kimberley <e>", "<cs> i would not myself have thought that this amendment was really necessary <e> <s> i cannot imagine any trade union holding a ballot which was not provided for under the rules or under the law <e> <s> this clause does not require trade unions to hold ballots it is permissive as is the case now <e> <s> all that this subsection does is to <e>", "<cs> i shall not oppose this clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> i think that it has had the blessing of too many people in too many parties for us in your lordships house to discard it after it has been included in the bill by the house of commons <e> <s> this idea of ballots attracts a great many people mostly those outside the trade union movement and not in it <e> <s> but this clause is dealing only with public money being spent on trade union ballots which are held permissively under the rules of the unions concerned or obligatorily under the rules of the unions concerned or by act of parliament on matters which fall within the itemised purposes of ballots on page <e> <s> that is all this clause is about whether we shall spend public money in this way <e>", "<cs> i will not detain the committee for more than a moment or two <e> <s> this amendment has been torn to ribbons by my noble friends lord wedderburn and lord underhill <e> <s> there are other desperate weaknesses about it which i will not trouble to explain to the committee but i say in brief that this amendment would be a prescription for anarchy at the beginning chaos at the end with the certification officer driven round the bend even if he were not driven out of the works <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that this is just impracticable <e> <s> i wish some solution to this underlying problem could be found <e> <s> as the noble viscount who introduced the amendment said this problem was not resolved in another place <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that in legislative terms it is almost insoluble <e> <s> bear in mind also that we are dealing with part of our institutional life which of itself has democratic principles and democratic experience <e>", "<cs> they each had their ribbons <e>", "<cs> perhaps the question i am about to ask can be answered later if it is not relevant to this particular point in time but why are we discussing this clause at all <e> <s> there are several amendments to it and the first of those is under consideration now <e> <s> but there is a code of practice already there this clause authorises the secretary of state to issue another draft and to indicate under subsection what parts of it are already in the code which are new and so on <e> <s> then the most astonishing thing of all is that in <e>", "<cs> when i heard the noble earl lord gowrie read out the terms of reference of the independent review committee established by the tuc i noticed how brief they were and it surprises me that anybody who has served on tribunals on committees of inquiry or on adjudicating authorities should want to press for harness to be put on members of those bodies <e> <s> this is a question of trustworthiness and confidence in a tribunal and the amendment is a proposed extension of the question whether a trade union has acted reasonably or unreasonably as shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case and it goes on to say that in the discharge of that responsibility the tribunal shall have regard to four matters which must guide their judgment <e> <s> one is <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for having had to leave the chamber for one hour earlier in the debate but i had to keep an appointment with a minister <e> <s> of course i heard the admirable opening speech of the noble lord lord schon and also the most impressive maiden speech by the noble lord lord sieff <e> <s> the noble lord lord schon entertained us for a few minutes with a couple of jokes about the characteristics of the british <e> <s> your lordships will remember that one was that the british never see the writing on the wall until they have got their backs to it <e> <s> i brought something back from america which i visited recently and i will present it to the noble lord lord schon <e> <s> they were saying that the future is not what it used to be <e> <s> the more we ponder over that the greater the truth we may discover in it <e>", "<cs> but my lords they were not there long enough to get anywhere <e> <s> that is the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friends on the front bench have persisted in this amendment at this time of night and after the debate that we have just had <e> <s> i want to uphold the right of agnostics to have a state of mind equal to that of conscience or of religious belief <e> <s> the opposition front bench is full of agnostics and here they are trying to deprive their kith and kin of the right to hold a deeply-held personal conviction <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill ignored from the beginning to the end of his speech the fact that we got rid of both conscience and religion from the constitution of the parliamentary labour party and substituted deeplyheld personal conviction <e> <s> he was probably not around when we did that <e> <s> i have said in this house before my noble friend came here that what is good for the parliamentaty labour party is good for the trade unions in this particular respect <e> <s> i personally regret that we have had to rely on a conservative government to rectify the serious flaw in the labour governments legislation of <e>", "<cs> i object to being told first that i did not understand my noble friend and secondly that i did not listen to him <e> <s> i understood him perfectly and i replied to him so will he please stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the british parliamentary group for population and development which is an all-party group of both houses has sent a message to the prime minister asking whether she will use her powers of initiative at the venice summit to get notice taken of the widespread extension of starvation and privation in the world today <e> <s> there is an urgency about this matter as my noble friend lord oram and others have said and if time can be devoted to consideration of world affairs at the venice summit it will be a great service to humanity <e>", "<cs> i think that we ought not to have too many speeches from the liberal benches without somebody else coming in between <e> <s> when the noble lord was speaking a moment ago he referred twice to the windfall to the workers which the incidence of the present law gives in certain cases <e> <s> anybody would think from the use of the word windfall that they had won something on the pools that some bounty or bonus had come their way <e> <s> actually this is only compensation for what would otherwise be loss of pay for the day <e> <s> this is an important matter for any worker <e> <s> compensation which may fall well below his actual earning rate for the <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with my noble friend that the government should take another look at this matter but i have a few cautionary words to offer to my noble friend on the amendment which he has moved <e> <s> the origin of the section of the act was really the utter dislike by the trade union movement of the non-independent union <e> <s> as my noble friend explained it was the evidence of undue pressure being put by employers upon their workers to join house unions that gave rise to the provision in the act to safeguard workers from being put under that form of coercion because that is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i was talking about individual liberty <e> <s> usually the employer is not an individual he is an institution <e>", "<cs> i feel that your lordships ought to leave the other house to take full responsibility for what is being done in this bill particularly in this clause <e> <s> i do not think it is our job to revoke or to repudiate what the elected chamber has done in this delicate field of human relationships in industry <e> <s> because and do not let us shirk this we are now getting very close to the unacceptable face of trade unionism <e> <s> this is a very delicate subject on these benches and it is one which troubles the public greatly <e> <s> i think that we shall not be doing our duty if in a debate of this kind we do not say quite frankly from these benches as well as from elsewhere in this committee what we feel <e> <s> my noble friend lady burton has undoubtedly said what a great many people in the trade union movement are thinking and what a great number of people throughout the country have been thinking for a long time about the use made of picketing in the course of industrial disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will not suppose for a moment that my temporary eminence on these benches is a reward for good conduct <e> <s> it is merely part of the arrangements wisely made by my noble friends who see to these matters that the spokesman for the opposition has some knowledge and experience of the subject under debate <e> <s> my own contact with this topic goes back a very long way <e> <s> however before i go further i should like to join with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in extending warm congratulations to the noble lord the lord president on his recent distinction and well-deserved recognition for pre-eminent services to the country and to the future of rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to put this proposition in the setting of the facts and factors which might apply at the time a decision was taken <e> <s> a great deal would depend on what was the current level of pay increases for example at the time the government had to consider what they did about the public service and there are other aspects of the general economic situation which would have to be brought into account <e> <s> but i am saying that there is such a thing so far as the civil service is concerned as a feeling of justice and fair dealing at the hands of their employer the government and it would be a grave matter indeed if the principle of fair comparability were set aside except in the gravest circumstances of the national interest and i do not see that condition applying in the foreseeable future <e> <s> the principle of fair comparisons was designed for good times and bad one might almost say in sickness and in health and it is not to be mauled about as an example to other employers outside the civil service has its claim to fair treatment as a matter of duty and obligation by the state <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord the minister for the very long comment that he has made on the bill and i shall be referring a little later to some of the important matters that he has raised <e> <s> first of all however i must join with the noble earl lord halsbury in a word or two of warm appreciation not only for his work which after all has paved the way to this very important occasion but of that of the noble lord lord ashby our chairman amazingly skilful and patient <e> <s> altogether the work <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am in favour of removing this clause from the bill <e> <s> if we remove clause we must also remove clause because clause deals with the compensation element of procedures under clause <e> <s> on this matter i have taken a perfectly consistent view for a very long time <e> <s> as i told your lordships previously i was a member of the liaison committee of the parliamentary labour party the national executive of the labour party and the general council of the tuc which tried to get agreement on a wide range of matters relating to the future policies of a labour government <e> <s> that was in <e> <s> what emerged from the discussions eventually came to be called the social contract although as i have observed previously in the course of the discussions the trade unions did not at all want the word contract to be used <e> <s> in fact they would not even use the word compact it was to be an understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords we must bear in mind that what we are debating is the question of fair or unfair dismissal because that is the issue in this clause <e> <s> this bill is providing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that in a moment because in my opinion this debate has already gone far wider than the terms of the amendment and much wider than the subject we have under discussion which is should dismissal as the result of a closed shop agreement be regarded as fair or unfair dismissal <e> <s> in this clause we are providing conditions which would make it unfair dismissal and the grounds for making it unfair dismissal would be a conscientious objection on religious grounds to belonging to a union or a deeply held personal conviction against doing so or an objection to joining a particular union <e> <s> this is what we are talking about <e> <s> i think if <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will find from the record that i did not use the words irrelevant in relation to the european convention <e> <s> i do not think that i used the word irrelevant at all <e> <s> i intended to say that the implementation of the convention to this and to other branches of our social and political life goes far wider than the narrower issue which is within the amendment before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view the debate on this motion should serve two purposes <e> <s> the first is to express our gratitude to those on both sides of the house whose talents have been brought so generously and so ably to the service of the house <e> <s> the second is to try to get a final appraisal of the bill that we are now asked to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we can get it absolutely right <e> <s> section which is vital to what i now come to says that no person having a right of killing ground game under the act or otherwise shall use any firearms for the purpose of killing ground game between the expiration of the first hour after sunset and the commencement of the last hour before sunrise <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not get it right it just shows how complex this simple little bill can be <e> <s> i will not read the remainder of section because it deals with spring traps and poison and has nothing to do with shooting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the comments that have been made on what i said to your lordships earlier <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no excuse for it i let the matter pass at that <e> <s> i think that one ought to have a point of view <e> <s> the government have a responsibility <e> <s> they have not expressed it before and i think that it is a great pity that they do not have better advice to give the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord auckland said that the act of was after all years old <e> <s> but shooting at night in was just the same as shooting in it is just shooting and it is at night <e> <s> so really i do not think that there is anything in that argument <e> <s> but more especially when a bill is dealing with firearms and the use of firearms which as the noble viscount says appears to include rifles as well as shotguns we must bear in mind that there is a great deal more shooting going on in the community today than there was in <e> <s> those are important matters <e>", "<cs> my lords something r welcome very much indeed is that we are having a debate on the finance bill <e> <s> last year i believe it was we inadvertently let the opportunity slip by <e> <s> this time we are having quite a good debate on the finance bill or at least if not on the finance bill on the economic environment of the financial situation <e>",

i am very anxious to oblige the noble lord if he will <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if i did so i should merely be following the attempt made by the late sir ronald russell to do it years ago <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord the minister with great care <e> <s> may i with great respect offer him just a word of advice to begin with <e> <s> those who say that charity begins at home are very frequently not charitable even at home and it is dangerous to use that clich as any justification for an inward-looking approach <e>", "<cs> my lords in quoting section the noble viscount said <e> <s> under this act or otherwise <e> <s> those words which follow or otherwise are important <e> <s> he said under this act or otherwise <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble viscount can now continue with what he began because it has a bearing upon subsequent proceedings on clause stand part <e> <s> i wonder whether it is permissible for him now to continue the statement that he began <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee will be grateful to the noble viscount for the statement that he has made but before i come to deal with that and the question that clause shall stand part of the bill i should like to explain for a moment why i did not move any of the amendments that i <e>", "<cs> it was not i but my forebear in the line of houghtons <e> <s> it was lord houghton of

only to night shooting throughout the whole of my comments on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord cannot persist in misrepresenting me <e> <s> nothing that i said justifies what he has just said to this committee <e> <s> he must not place constructions on my thoughts because i have not expressed them on the general question of shooting <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening for a moment or two more <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> almost everything that has been said indicates how ill-conceived the bill is <e> <s> there has been an anomaly for years and we are now dealing with it as if nothing had happened during that time and as if conditions merely required this so-called anomaly to be removed <e> <s> this is quite a silly way of dealing with this important subject

amendment <e> <s> it is clearcut and everybody can understand the nature of its implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the support of the amendment and at the outset wish to express my acute disappointment at the speech of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> i thought when he began that he was going to say that while he could not support the amendment moved in committee he could support this one <e> <s> indeed i thought he was going to forsake the economics of matchsticks and come on the side of the angels <e> <s> if we were not discussing a clause dealing with the nature of the fourth channel we might not be so keen on this amendment but that is what we are discussing and some of us want to see that the nature of the fourth channel satisfies some quite cardinal requirements <e> <s> they are already set out to some extent in the provisions of the clause but as the noble lord lord vernon said we are now members of one world and this aspect of the fourth channel is of supreme importance <e>", "<cs> my lords what a great pleasure it is to hear a success story amidst all the gathering gloom <e> <s> the pity of course is that the arts council is part of

session we were discussing the so-called anomaly in the law that ground game could be shot at night by owners of land but occupiers of land were barred by the ground game act <e> <s> one of the

amendment no <e> <s> take paragraph <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl and in order to save time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am content with that and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill proposes to amend the pet animals act of in one particular only <e> <s> the act regulated the sale of pet animals <e> <s> its main purpose was to do with the licensing of pet shops laying down proper conditions for keeping and caring for animals on sale in pet shops <e> <s> it provided for inspectors to see that these conditions were complied with the inspectors being officers of the local authorities <e> <s> another provision was that pets were not to be sold to children under years of age <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for dealing with this matter in a moderate and quasi-sympathetic way <e> <s> i will not take up more than a minute or two because i hope your lordships will give the bill a second reading and i shall be very glad at committee stage to go further into some of the points the noble lord has raised <e> <s> in particular i hold in my hand a copy of the regulations introduced by the tower hamlets authority for club row as from the beginning of this year <e> <s> they relate mostly to pet shops and there are eight pet shops within the precincts of this particular market it is the pet shops to which these regulations really relate <e> <s> all the safeguards against fire and other contingencies which are mentioned in these regulations have nothing to do with the conditions in the market place <e> <s> i can demonstrate that the conditions which inevitably prevail in the market place are really in contravention of the full intentions of the conditions laid down in these new rules animals on the floor in the streets with dust and paper it is a rubbishy place <e> <s> i believe that open market places and the barrows and stalls in streets even though licensed are not suitable places to sell young animals according to the standards of hygiene and of treatment of the present day <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble lord to look at page subsection <e>", "<cs> what wonderful news <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley is not as innocent as he sounds <e> <s> he knows why poultry are not included in the bill <e> <s> so do i so do we all because the government dare not include them <e> <s> they would have the whole of the battery hen industry on them like a ton of bricks if they included poultry in the bill which of course shows the hypocrisy of the british people when dealing with such moral issues as cruelty kindness ill-treatment and so forth <e>", "<cs> speaking in political terms i am all in favour of keeping hawks in captivity but i do not like the way in which noble lords have been regarding doves as pests <e>", "<cs> it is obvious that a number of noble lords on both sides of the committee are a little uneasy about this matter to put it no higher <e> <s> if we are setting out to give full protection to certain limited species which are in need of it then we must be seen to be giving that protection otherwise people will be disposed to say yes but you can get out of that <e> <s> it is all eyewash <e> <s> there is no real protection for these animals because the moment they begin to damage any crops the owner can run for his gun and shoot them off and if he is prosecuted he can raise as a defence that they were causing serious damage to his crops <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> allow me to say that they are exploiting the fruits of the land and there are certain tolerances which are called for in that situation <e> <s> if there are species which the whole nation feels should be preserved and which are doing a little harm here and there to the farming industry i think they must be prepared to put up with it <e> <s> they are doing pretty well <e> <s> i was chairman of the farm prices review committee three times when i was in the government and i used all my endeavours to give the farmers a good settlement despite the fact that they threw chickens dead chickens i may say at my noble friend lord peart after the first one <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will insist on this amendment going into the bill <e> <s> it took us a long time to get rid of the gin trap in england and longer still to get rid of it in scotland <e> <s> i thought that the assurances given to some of us during the period of the labour government meant that we were really going to see the end altogether of snaring when this legislation came forward <e> <s> the snare is a horrible thing and if one sees animals in a snare the rspca have been collecting photographs and so on throughout the country one must feel that this way of taking animals should stop <e>", "<cs> i think that it probably would be going rather further and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not catch what the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> i thought for a moment that the noble earl had accepted something <e> <s> at least he is to look at my amendment again <e> <s> we have to be content with small mercies in this debate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl is satisfied so am i on this occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> he has explained that this amendment seeks to strengthen the badgers act rather than get this species mixed up with the rather complicated criteria and conditions of schedule <e> <s> however i think that we must treat the badger on its own merits as it were <e> <s> the badger has been very badly treated for many many years and the act offered some hope that a good deal of the prejudice and legendary nonsense about the badger would be dispelled and that it would be given a new status among the mammals of britain <e> <s> unfortunately we no sooner had the badgers act on the statute book than this dreadful trouble arose over the suspected infection of cattle by badgers with bovine tuberculosis <e> <s> to a subsequent bill that was going through your lordships house in we had to add the provisions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and i am moderately satisfied with his reply <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> i am glad to add to the heavy burden already assumed by the front bench of matters to be further considered <e> <s> i guess that the report stage will be a very interesting time <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will accept this amendment <e> <s> we are dealing with people charged with the illegal sale of endangered species they are the people to whom this amendment relates <e> <s> at present as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has explained when a law officer or the customs and excise are bringing the charge they do not have to prove that the endangered species being illegally sold were also illegally imported <e> <s> the presumption is in those cases that the person illegally selling was also illegally importing and it is up to him to produce a licence if he claims that he had earlier permission to import these endangered species or otherwise to bring some corroborative evidence if he claims that <e>", "<cs> this amendment relates to living species not to products not to tusks and not to skins <e> <s> it relates to endangered species <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> i think we can congratulate ourselves upon having perhaps the best piece of legislation for the protection of endangered species of any country in the common market <e> <s> there are some things that we are good at <e> <s> there are other things we are better at than other countries <e> <s> on those rare occasions when we are better than anybody else it is worthwhile noticing it just for morale purposes if nothing else <e>", "<cs> these exceptions subject to the granting of a licence go very wide indeed <e> <s> i wonder whether somebody sat down to find all the possibilities of the situation and stick them on the list because we come in a moment to <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord that i have not missed the point <e> <s> it is just that perhaps he has greater confidence in bureacracy than i have <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation and i am persuaded <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am always upset when the noble lord lord stanley of alderley is not on my side <e> <s> that weakens my position greatly <e> <s> my reply to the noble earl is that i imagine that those who have crops livestock or other property which may be exposed to the depredations of species that might otherwise have the protection of the bill will no doubt ascertain from the appropriate authorities beforehand what kind of situation will arise if their expected enemies fly over or settle on their land in large flocks and begin to gobble up the winter-sown wheat and so on <e> <s> i do not think that farmers and others will apply for licences out of the blue if some unexpected catastrophe or threat befalls them <e> <s> on the whole they will know what is likely to come their way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i most willingly beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he is of course thinking of deer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley will probably recall that the deer act had to be extended by the deer act so as to provide for this very forfeiture <e> <s> although no distinction is made in the deer act between the weapon that kills and the vehicle which gets the offender there the forfeiture of the means of getting there and back and carrying the quarry back was clearly provided for in the definition of forfeitures in the act <e> <s> the badgers act comes into it too <e> <s> there the forfeitures relate to the particular methods of taking the badger <e> <s> they do not deal with the vehicle because the vehicle is probably not so necessary as in the case of deer and probably is not necessary in the case of some of the crimes which might be committed under this bill <e>", "<cs> what the noble earl said a few moments ago about tying the hands of the executive because an advisory committee is commissioned to make its report public is going around ministers somewhat like a password <e> <s> we heard this also in connection with the protection of laboratory animals bill <e> <s> since when have ministers been afraid of advice and since when need they be afraid of the publication of the advice they get <e> <s> we ate supposed to be in favour of more open government but really and truly what ministers seem to want is not open government but open and shut government <e>", "<cs> that means then that i can safely withdraw the amendment which i beg leave to do <e>", "<cs> why in this debate can we not hear a little more about the doctrine of the public good <e> <s> we are now having an assortment of speeches from noble lords opposite all out of burkes landed gentry <e> <s> i consider that this pursuit of compensation in all kinds of circumstances for all kinds of reasons is becoming a little obtrusive <e> <s> after all many sacrifices have to be made by people for the common good and any proposal that is reasonable should be shouldered by citizens of different ranks in different places in order to contribute something to the national good <e> <s> i am not a nationaliser by disposition and i am not sure that i am a nationaliser by politics either but i think it was a mistake not to have nationalised the lot after the last war <e> <s> i also feel that it was a serious mistake to repeal those sections of the town and country planning act that dealt with development value and so far as i recall that was done by a conservative government <e>", "<cs> the probability is that we are trying to do too much in one bill <e> <s> unfortunately however time is running so fast against us on the things that we want to preserve and safeguard that it makes it difficult to contemplate spreading this legislation over a longer period <e> <s> but it does raise the question of our procedures whether a bill of this complexity and this length can be dealt with in the way in which we are attempting to deal with it <e>", "<cs> i think this amendment is a waste of time <e> <s> there are more obscurities about ownership today than ever i remember <e> <s> if owners want to have their rights respected they should be more forthcoming in saying who they are <e> <s> many people do not know who their own landlords are <e> <s> in these circumstances it is a lot of rubbish to talk about the owner being notified with a view to being able to do something <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble lords impassioned defence of the interests of the farmers let us bear in mind that there is another side to the case <e> <s> this bill so far as i understand it is not opening up further access by the public to the countryside <e> <s> it is reviewing what has already been done in that regard and attempts are being made to tighten up the procedure so that further access will be difficult to obtain <e> <s> that is an important consideration that needs some examination <e>", "<cs> i had not finished with great respect <e> <s> the noble lord came in when the noble earl lord caithness had risen to intervene in what i was saying <e> <s> as i began to sit down the noble lord lord bellwin jumped up and wanted to carry the debate a little further <e> <s> may i therefore give way to the noble earl who rose earlier <e>", "<cs> that does not make any difference to me <e> <s> in this house one gets varied interests on both sides of the chamber <e> <s> i will not delay the committee more than a moment further though i realise that we have reached a stage in this committee when any speech from the back-benchers is an intrusion into conversations that are going on between the two front benches <e>", "<cs> no no <e> <s> it becomes a kind of duet or conversation between the two front benches <e> <s> surely there could be some better procedure than our sitting here to listen to in the conversations between the two front benches <e> <s> so i make no apology for an intrusion into this debate <e> <s> what i want to say is this we hear far too much about the interests of the farmers <e> <s> they are a pretty well-to-do section of the community <e> <s> they are not entitled to any more consideration than any other section of industry <e> <s> they are an industry and they are entitled to consideration along with other sections of industry <e> <s> but i do not regard farming as a form of worship <e>", "<cs> i think one of the deficiences of our procedure not only in your lordships house but in another place is that in the committee stage of a bill before anyone has explained what a clause sets out to do we begin to discuss amendments to it and it is only after all the amendments have been disposed of that one can get round to what the clause itself is designed to do <e> <s> this seems to me to put the whole procedure the wrong way round <e> <s> in the explanatory and financial memorandum to this bill it says <e>", "<cs> i know that we want to press on but i was interested in the noble earls passing reference to the inter-departmental committee on dogs in society <e> <s> i myself was chairman of the joint advisory committee on pets in society and was the principal witness to that inter-departmental committee in <e> <s> the report of that committee followed very closely indeed the recommendations that i was able to make on behalf of a wide range of interested organisations <e>", "<cs> is there a textual amendment needed <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> we are all getting charged with a little electricity i notice <e> <s> but nobody has yet mentioned human beings <e> <s> what about the thin-skinned humans who touch these contrivances <e> <s> it is surprising to me that this matter has not been raised before in this connection because these fences are a hazard <e> <s> i am not sure however low the voltage whether some people would escape a shock which might be harmful to them <e> <s> we have heard of children in connection with bulls and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for saying that he will not press his amendment <e> <s> it does not lie within the scope either of the original act or of the amending bill <e> <s> the amendment deals with the recipient of an animal <e> <s> it says that it should be unlawful for an animal to be given away as a prize in a lottery or competition <e> <s> no legislation at the moment deals with the giving away of animals <e>", "<cs> on the question that the clause stand part i would say this <e> <s> at the conclusion of the second reading debate i felt that the noble lord lord belstead was still an agnostic about this bill <e> <s> one can read about his agnosticism in cols <e> <s> and of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> i need detain the house only for two minutes <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will send this bill on its way to another place <e> <s> i think that the most i can usefully say about this bill in your lordships house has already been said <e> <s> there are numerous other considerations regarding it which i think would be more appropriate to be dealt with in another place where constituency and other interests can be brought to bear upon any aspects of the bill which might still be important in the minds of some people <e> <s> for example all the open air markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that more support for the amendment has not been forthcoming from the benches opposite <e> <s> i was taught to look to the aristocracy for upholding the sanctity of the sabbath but since the lords day observance society seems to have gone out of business nobody sticks up for sundays any more <e> <s> look at the bishops bench completely empty when we are discussing a question of sunday observance <e> <s> it is a dereliction of their duty in this legislature not to be present here this afternoon <e> <s> we hear from noble lords that the weekends are the only opportunity that some poor wretches get for shooting birds and other things which they call sport <e> <s> it is very nice of those who can shoot any day of the week to be considerate towards those who can shoot only on saturdays and sundays <e> <s> i should have thought sunday was the most unsuitable day of the week to shoot and kill anything <e> <s> i should have thought that was one of the last vestiges of the observance of the lords day but it is obvious that we are in a chamber of heathens <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord i am sure that the house fully understands the situation <e> <s> however the noble lord lord gibson-watt took an interest in this matter and perhaps it was fortuitous that i tabled amendments on it <e> <s> at the earlier stage the noble earl lord avon said that if pressed he would give further consideration to the question <e> <s> he was not pressed very hard <e> <s> nevertheless he apparently took it away for further consideration <e> <s> it may be that he wrote to the noble lord lord gibson-watt as he courteously has done to me and i am sure to other noble lords on matters raised during the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that on a matter of this kind the house should register an opinion <e> <s> i think it would be a good thing if the house expressed its disapproval of the spread of this kind of indiscriminate weapon against our wildlife <e> <s> i fully understand the practical considerations mentioned by the noble earl lord avon but i should like to see a little more moral fervour in decisions of your lordships house and this might be an occasion for a little of that to be shown on a matter of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that the noble lord lord belstead has left the position in a very unsatisfactory condition <e> <s> i think the government intended to do something and subsequently lost their nerve <e> <s> government departments and ministers do not take impulsive decisions on a matter of this kind and the clearance given by the home office on the very morning of the debate during which the noble earl lord avon told us the government were going to put down an amendment of their own was a clear indication that the home office had completed their consideration of this difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the offer of co-operation with the noble earl lord caithness and the noble lord lord stanley of alderley is too tempting to cast lightly aside <e> <s> if there is real business to be done and if we could combine to put the government back on course on a matter of this kind quite apart from other matters i think that would be courteous to the government and would give us an opportunity of considering the matter further <e> <s> my main purpose in raising this matter again was to get on record what the noble lord lord belstead had said repeating what the noble earl lord avon had courteously sent to me by letter <e> <s> but we cannot leave the matter where it is without further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i did not hear that intervention <e> <s> it is rather late at night to lay my snares but i have a full collection of snares with me <e> <s> i know it is not customary in your lordships house to have visual aids in the course of <e>", "<cs> was to distinguish between the self-locking snares and the ordinary snares in the parcel <e> <s> the department of the environment did not tell the man that half the snares he had sent in would be unlawful anyway <e> <s> that was because they were self-locking snares and clause of the bill would make them unlawful <e> <s> what i have just stated suggests that the department of the environment did not know the difference between self-locking snares and other snares nor for that matter did the local police <e> <s> that raises very important questions as to what is the purpose of banning the self-locking snare but not the other snare and how will the difference between the two interfere with the proper enforcement of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has just said and i will not labour that point <e> <s> i was not persuaded by the reply of the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> it is still a little doubtful as to what is the real purpose of this change of banning the self-locking snare and retaining the other <e> <s> however i think the noble earl underestimates the concern throughout the country about the extent of this cruelty <e> <s> i believe that time will show that public opinion wishes this change to be made from the use of an extremely cruel form of catching animals <e> <s> the fact that there may be a demand for something does not mean to say that we have to meet that demand <e> <s> there is a demand for guns there is a demand for daggers <e> <s> there can be a demand for all kinds of vicious things if they are supplied <e> <s> but we do not regard it as the duty of parliament or of society to yield up to all sections of the community which may make demands for particular devices or implements or weapons <e> <s> we have our own standards and we want to try to keep them <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with great respect i think that is a piece of humbug <e> <s> we are conserving the otter this is what it is all about <e> <s> what is the point in saying we are conserving the otter if we still allow the hunting of the otter with hounds but stop the hunt from killing the otter <e> <s> what is that kind of charade for <e> <s> is this called field sports <e> <s> is it a sport to go hunting the otter but not be allowed to kill it after centuries of the otter being allowed to be hunted and killed <e> <s> i do not understand how the noble earls mind works on this subject <e> <s> if we want to conserve the otter we must protect it in every possible way <e> <s> one of the ways of conserving it is to prevent it from being disturbed prevent it from being chased away from its habitat from its young whatever may be the condition of the otter when it is chased by hounds and when it is in danger of its life the hounds are called off <e> <s> is that a sport or is it conservation or what is it <e> <s> surely we cannot keep up the pretence that we are hunting when the conservation of the otter prevents us from killing it <e> <s> i cannot see how the noble earl can rationalise the speech he has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that this amendment does not really meet the example that the noble lord lord stanley of alderley quoted <e> <s> i will not put it as low as wishful thinking expressed in statutory form but to ask a minister to give due consideration is not really asking very much <e> <s> you can never tell whether or not he has given it <e> <s> no court of law can say that he has not not even the ombudsman can say that he has not if the minister says he has <e> <s> so altogether this amendment like many others in this group is seeking to allay fears <e> <s> i think this is the serious point behind this amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee can bear to listen to one or two impudent remarks <e> <s> one of the drawbacks to being in the house of lords is that we go on talking about some things time and time again and nothing ever happens <e> <s> we have discussed this subject before <e> <s> very soon there will be a kind of collection of hardy annuals that will come forward each session to be debated afresh passed in your lordships house and seen to be dying a lingering death along the corridor <e>", "<cs> my lords when small measures of reform are put forward governments frequently have two reasons for not accepting them <e> <s> one is that they want to do more and the other is that they want to do nothing or something different <e> <s> why is it that governments cannot see that progress is gradual that one thing leads to another and that if you do not make a beginning you do not get any further anyway <e> <s> in one place or another i have been listening to this kind of argument for years and it is extraordinary how even the new generation of ministers put forward the same excuses as their predecessors who grew old and grey repeating this kind of formula <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> i was merely confirming what the noble lord said that the problem of the airgun goes much wider <e>", "<cs> my lords i am suggesting that there is a wider problem of the use of the airgun <e> <s> the serious point about the airgun is that it is a weapon <e> <s> it was really intended to be a target weapon the sort of weapon that was used at fairs rifle ranges and so forth <e> <s> i am illustrating the fact that some people are using the airgun as a weapon to kill mammals and certainly birds <e> <s> earlier we tried to get a wider ban upon the use of the airgun <e> <s> now my noble friends on the other side the mafia led by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley have put forward a fresh amendment which comes within the rules of order <e> <s> i am merely trying to start off on an entertaining note for the afternoon and urge your lordships to disregard the advice of the minister and accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although this bill permits dogs to pursue otters as long as they do not kill them i am nevertheless not in favour of dogs being allowed to pursue sheep <e> <s> that inconsistency between the wild animal and the farmers pet i leave with your lordships to ponder <e> <s> this problem arises because two successive governments have not really grasped the nettle on the problem of dogs in society <e> <s> this is part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are nearing the end of the debate and i am wondering what the noble lord lord renton feels about the response there has been to his motion <e> <s> he will be telling us shortly whether he is satisfied with the mixed reception the discussion document has received <e> <s> i thought the noble earl lord gowrie was a little lukewarm in his introduction of the discussion document he appeared to have little confidence that a fine tuning of the law would do much good and he quickly moved on to the wider issues which were the important ones certainly from the governments point of view <e>", "<cs> be that as it may my lords my father emigrated eventually to get away from it all but he came back <e> <s> like my noble friend lord scanlon he liked to be back and when he came back he stayed and lived out his life in this country <e> <s> my noble friends father appears to have introduced a closed shop without consultation with the workers but i will forgive him that it was a long time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the noble earl lord halsbury i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> quite frankly i do not think there is much point in debating the merits of this amendment <e> <s> we are in rather a peculiar position this afternoon because we are considering the committee stage of a bill which has already passed your lordships house in the last session this is the second time around <e> <s> but there is more to come <e> <s> although this is the only bill before the house at the present time and it is the best bill there is we are hoping that there is another one coming before very long and that will be the governments own proposals <e>", "<cs> i hope that i do not have to go on saying the same thing and i am sure that your lordships wish to be spared my saying the same thing but i have an approach to this bill which <e>", "<cs> i feel that there is still much work to be done on the very important question of alternatives <e> <s> i do not think that it would be desirable to add the words of the amendment to the bill but i must say that the substance of the amendment concerns a great many people who are trying to find alternatives to the use of living animals <e> <s> so far as i can tell remarkably little attention is being given to this question where one would expect it to receive constant attention that is in the laboratories and similar places <e> <s> we are told that living animals are so expensive that cost alone is compelling researchers and experimenters to look for alternatives to living animals <e>", "<cs> since there seems to be mutual chiding going on and my name has been mentioned in that connection may i say that i was fully aware of the circular issued <e> <s> indeed i had something to do with its being issued <e> <s> we urged this upon the home office <e> <s> i only say there is no strong note of criticism in this regard that telling people to use all the alternatives they know of is not quite the same as being involved in finding alternatives which people might use because so many times when you urge people to use alternatives they tell you there are <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment for me to raise one or two general questions relating to future progress on this bill <e> <s> we have been told that we are waiting for the final draft of the council of europe and they have been at work for some long time <e> <s> they met in january when they had a drafting committee trying to finalise the draft which has been under consideration for so long <e> <s> they failed to agree on the final draft and another meeting is to be held on the th to the th may <e> <s> i think the home secretary and the council of europe members concerned hope that at the may meeting they will reach finality though there are still one or two very important questions outstanding <e> <s> i do not dwell on them for the moment because one of them arises directly on clause of the bill but what i am asking the noble lord the minister at the present moment is how we are going to proceed <e> <s> the question i am really raising is what consultations do the government have it in mind to hold with the various sections of interest in this difficult problem <e>", "<cs> this matter will be one of the main features of the legislation to come <e> <s> it is on this that i think a great deal of debate and probably difference of opinion will arise <e> <s> after all the act was designed to alleviate pain <e> <s> it was concerned with pain <e> <s> it described the general range of purposes for which living animals could be used but its main purpose was to alleviate and eliminate pain on the animals being used <e> <s> this has been pursued further in clause of this bill <e> <s> we have to look at what we mean by properly anaesthetised <e>", "<cs> they are difficult words unless you have them in front of you <e> <s> but the advisory committee which took two years to examine the ld test which is the one to which i referred earlier the toxicity test admitted that the ld test caused suffering <e> <s> there seemed to be no escape from it <e> <s> after all if you are going to put substances into living animals until you reach the point where half of them die it is unavoidable that you will cause suffering probably of an acute nature before death actually supervenes <e> <s> this is what it is for <e> <s> it is to test the lethal nature of the substance that is being used <e> <s> in fact ld means lethal dose and means per cent <e>", "<cs>

animals may be transported is laid down there is grave concern at slaugthering methods in the eec and the rules about the feeding and watering of animals in transit laid down in the eec directive are frequently ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it is obvious that this bill has aroused considerable interest and has been more controversial than i expected <e> <s> our debate today has not been nearly so entertaining as some of the debates we had on the wildlife and countryside bill when we were more relaxed and we had more friends across the chamber than i appear to have at the present moment <e> <s> nevertheless i have assumed this task and i am going to stick doggedly to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord ferrers kept on saying if this bill is <e>", "<cs> my lords while not asking the noble lord to enlarge on the matter at this moment would he consider being rather more positive and if possible a little more earnest in his invitation to the unions to come and meet him <e> <s> also would he indicate as clearly as possible the scope of the discussions that might take place <e> <s> i fear that when ministers say that they are ready to see people as soon as those people are ready to see them the invitation is not warm enough <e> <s> could he be a little more forthcoming on that point <e> <s> i think he should put himself in the position of making a formal request to see what is the reaction of the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord introducing this bill was conscious of the fact that he had got rather a cumbersome bill in two separate and quite distinct parts to bring before the house <e> <s> i think the government lost a good opportunity of using their imagination on the subject of road safety <e> <s> if we include compulsory seat belts in this bill how do you sell that idea under the prosaic title of transport bill <e> <s> where is the imagination here to catch and engage public attention on a matter of vital importance to all of them <e> <s> the first part of the bill again shows how commonplace the government thinking is <e> <s> it talks about privatisation <e> <s> what sort of policy is privatisation <e> <s> who understands what it is <e> <s> it sounds a bit intimate in some sort of way privatisation when what they are thinking about is dismantling reshaping or transferring from institutional life to a more dogmatic enterprise <e> <s> you can really describe it how you like from your own point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would he care to change the psychology of the matter and instead of talk about points awarded talk about black marks awarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his full explanation and i admit that i now understand the system better than when moving my amendment indeed that is the reward for having moved it in the first place <e> <s> we now know clearly what the issues are and i cannot quarrel with the line the government are taking in regard to these exceptions although we shall of course regret the governments need to make them if representations strongly suggest that they should <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to the noble lord the minister and i hope that we can now examine the position in the light of the fuller information and be more reassured than we were <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of this bill the house might just as well have resolved itself into a committee of grandparents <e> <s> i feel in a very invidious position this morning because mine apparently will be the only dissenting voice <e> <s> i feel almost as if i should erect here and now the warning prescribed in the bill and advise your lordships that if you would rather not listen to comments which will offend you deeply now is the time to leave <e> <s> i do this with great reluctance but quite frankly i had anticipated a different kind of debate <e> <s> i never believed that your lordships house would take this bill on a plate with quite the relish which has been the case this morning <e> <s> surely this bill deserves some controversy <e> <s> it is not a bill for a cosy gathering of your lordships house on a friday morning to send reaction on its way <e> <s> no my lords if for no other reason than that there must be a dissenting voice i feel a little more courage in saying what i am going to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only offer them humbly <e> <s> the first is that i was the first chairman of the young volunteer force foundation with the late lord selwyn-lloyd and mr jo grimond which was then one of the labour governments first ventures into institutional activity of a voluntary nature to recruit young people into social service <e> <s> my other qualification is personal experience <e> <s> in my lifetime war and the threat of war swept the frustrations and discontents of three generations of young people into battle <e> <s> millions never came back world conflict killed them off <e> <s> i was lucky i did come back <e> <s> however my youth was taken care of from the age of to in the first world war <e> <s> in the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure they are <e> <s> this shows that sometimes the pretensions of front bench spokesmen do not include the assent of all the people behind them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i hope that nobody has been scandalised and still less do i think that many older people will be scandalised by what they see anywhere <e> <s> nevertheless we are discussing a bill which attempts to give them some protection from being scandalised if that is the word to use <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when the governments forthcoming legislation to update the act comes before parliament the public will look for a complete clean-up of the procurement and care of animals for laboratory <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> he is aware that we in this house are awaiting the third reading of the laboratory animals protection bill which may take place later this month <e> <s> as i am given to understand that the advisory committee devoted a great deal of its report to the bill and the report of the select committee that preceded it may i ask if we are likely to have access to the report before the third reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am covered with shame <e> <s> i introduced a little drama into the matter in the hope of alerting your lordships to the gravity of the situation but i see that i should have done better to stick to the simple word penalty without enlarging on the whole of the background <e> <s> so i accept the rebuke of the noble earl lord howe and of my noble friend lady phillips and while full of contrition i am grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is interrupting me while i am trying to save a little time <e> <s> i am looking at the last couple of pages of my speech instead of at the first pages and i am sure that members of the committee realise how helpful i am trying to be <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for making such an adequate and firm statement of the governments position <e> <s> i think that is very helpful and i thank him for it <e> <s> i would only observe before sitting down that if i could have closed my eyes and heard another voice i should have said that we had heard it all before in the cabinet in <e> <s> but we persuaded the majority of the cabinet to determine otherwise when we published the white paper to which i referred <e> <s> i shall not recall the name of the home secretary at the time he was just as concerned about relations between the public and the police as was the noble lord <e> <s> i shall now consider carefully whether there is anything that i can usefully do on this matter in some different form for a later stage of the bill <e> <s> renewing my thanks to the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the sanctuary we wish to cherish is to exclude forcible entry into ones own home unless there are very strong reasons for giving the authorities the right to intrude <e> <s> if that is the basis then i think that any immunity from entry should be restricted to the drivers own home because he has the right of entry and the right of sanctuary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments that have been made <e> <s> the noble lord lord spens has a point that the relevance of the change in amendment no <e> <s> depends on the acceptance of a definition in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is a problem of the marshalled list <e> <s> sometimes we put the cart before the horse because the bill is drafted that way <e>", "<cs> several references have been made to this very useful bill and the narrow issue that it deals with <e> <s> i am bound to say that the government have shown no particular anxieties about this reform in recent years <e> <s> a bill was introduced in another place in which fell through lack of time <e> <s> the government refused to give special facilities for bills to deal with this matter <e> <s> they have regarded it as something to be left to the hazards of the private members bills procedures <e> <s> although from the governments point of view it is a useful bill it is entirely fortuitous that this bill comes to this chamber at all <e> <s> the sponsor of the bill in another place had first thought about another subject entirely and it was only by his own choice after coming out well in the bran tub of legislative opportunity that he decided to choose this bill <e> <s> so i think that having left it to the luck of the draw so to speak one cannot put too much stress on the governments interest in the usefulness of this bill <e> <s> it did not seem to matter too much until now <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i readily beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it is only fair that further thought should be given to it to see whether it does what it is intended to do <e>", "<cs> here again it would be unfair to pursue the matter further now <e> <s> if i beg leave to withdraw the amendment that will give an opportunity to the prime mover and to the noble lord lord nugent to consider the position <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that there should be a further opportunity to consider this point <e> <s> the only matter which can possibly be subject to the act is matter which is capable of being displayed <e> <s> it does not include anything else <e> <s> the point is that matter must mean something which is capable of being displayed <e> <s> however there is a point to consider <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in order to give my noble friend an opportunity to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> i agree with what my noble friend lord jenkins of putney has just said <e>", "<cs> the arguments will go down on paper in the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his helpful remarks and forgive him much <e> <s> however i am still not convinced that the example that he has given would be one in which the constable should enter the shop and say i see you have put two books up there which look very dicey to me <e> <s> have you any more like those which you are going to stick up <e> <s> the shopkeeper will say no that is it and the police constable will say well i had better have a look round and see <e> <s> what is in this box here <e> <s> were you thinking of putting those up <e> <s> no constable the shopkeeper will say and the constable will say dont lie you were just going to put these up <e> <s> i am going to exercise my right to seize these books because i believe they were going to be used in an attempt to commit an offence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord nugent said that the right of private prosecution already exists <e> <s> but what he did not tell the committee is under what statute that right exists <e> <s> unless i am very much mistaken he was relying on the vagrancy act <e> <s> i am advised that one could rely on the vagrancy act for almost anything in this bill <e> <s> indeed the vagrancy act was passed mostly in order to deal with the unruly behaviour of the soldiery returning from the napoleonic wars and indeed anything went under that act <e> <s> however we have chosen to legislate afresh and we are doing so today on matters that might be covered by the obsolete vagrancy act because we want to update the law and provide something at which parliament can look afresh <e>", "<cs> we shall probably deal with that point in a moment <e> <s> what i am stressing is that in previous acts in this field we have not left the right of private prosecution in the hands of the ordinary citizen <e> <s> we have deliberately taken it out of the hands of the ordinary citizen <e> <s> why have we done that and why did we do it for the protection of children act and the theatres act <e> <s> why did we take the right of private prosecution away from the citizen and in this bill propose to retain it <e> <s> this is the important point <e>", "<cs> that is a perfectly valid suggestion but that is on future deliveries <e> <s> he may already have material in his possession <e> <s> it is not all the girlie magazines and the sexy glossies that are involved here <e> <s> there are other indecent displays too <e> <s> there is point in some delay to enable people to put their shop in order <e> <s> indeed in a later amendment i plead for an extension of the period between the passing of the act and the date upon which it will come into operation from three months to six months <e> <s> it strikes me as relevant to our consideration here that this chain of booksellers should expressly put it to me that it is desirable that the right of private prosecution should not be let loose upon us right from the time the bill is passed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has scored a goal <e> <s> it may be that the amendment is defective in specifying an officer of the rank of superintendent or above <e> <s> that was so to speak an off-the-cuff judgment as to who might do it <e> <s> i did not want to put it in the hands of the director of public prosecutions and it seemed unsuitable to raise it to <e>", "<cs> what i intend it to mean is that if no charge has been made within days of seizure the goods must be returned from whence they came within seven days of the expiry of the days <e> <s> so it is the th day as the noble earl said <e> <s> it means that there are seven days in which to return the goods after the lawful retention for up to three weeks <e>", "<cs> i am a little perplexed about this <e> <s> it is true that the bill does not provide for retention or forfeiture as the protection of children act did <e> <s> if i am assured that when goods are seized and when that seizure is not followed by a charge against the person complained of they will he returned to him after a reasonable period i think we come nearer to agreement <e> <s> the question is how long would be a reasonable period <e> <s> i have known of cases where booksellers have lost half their stock and not been able to replace it because of the exposed position they were in with a possible charge pending against them <e> <s> i will ask leave to withdraw the amendment at the moment and see whether i can get some greater reassurance than the noble lord is able to give me on this matter <e>", "<cs> it may be that the whole case therefore rests upon the efficiency and diligence of the police <e> <s> if they take anything away and take a long time before bringing a charge then presumably the goods remain in their hands while they are either considering the matter or just shilly-shallying <e> <s> then it may become a case for the citizen to try to get redress by some means to recover his property because the police are doing nothing about it except sitting on it <e> <s> i am not sure that that is a very satisfactory position in which to put a citizen <e> <s> there is a lot of unfavourable publicity given to this kind of thing and many innocent people i am quite sure have been very badly treated under the existing legislation <e>", "<cs> i suppose an argument could made out in really bad cases that we could send them down for five years <e> <s> but i will not press that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and i shall consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> does this mean that the scots can do it more cheaply than the english <e> <s> is this another grievance england against scotland again or are the scots more enlightened people than we are <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mishcon has a more vivid imagination than i have <e> <s> i should not have thought that it would happen in that way <e> <s> we are not stopping selling <e> <s> they are only selling in a different part of the shop <e> <s> in fact they are selling in a part of the shop that a lot of people who would not have bothered otherwise will want to go to <e> <s> they will want to look around behind the notice board and if they are over they will have freedom of access to look at what is there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it is a question of when parliamentary time permits or whether the government are waiting for the outcome of the deliberations in the council of europe <e> <s> my question is asking whether the government intend to press on notwithstanding difficulties that may arise at the council of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the immunities in the present legislation derive from the first slaughterhouses act in scotland in which were put there expressly to protect the position of lascars members of the crews of ships in the ports of scotland yet years afterwards the protection of a minority religious persuasion in this matter has become big business and is becoming bigger business <e> <s> are the government indifferent to this <e> <s> do they think it is in accordance with the intentions of parliament throughout the period of this legislation <e> <s> my question asks whether they are prepared to advise local authorities to seek agreement with applicants for licences or planning permission to accept the pre-stunning conditions <e> <s> would the minister kindly answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords some local authorities have passed by-laws by resolution to regulate the method of slaughter of animals in their areas and those by-laws are subject to confirmation <e> <s> one particularly near kidderminster has already been passed and is awaiting confirmation <e> <s> will the government confirm by-laws passed by local authorities which seek to regulate the method of slaughter of animals when granting licences in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not take more than a couple of minutes now on this amendment <e> <s> it may be that we are in search of a solution to the insoluble but that suggests that this is probably a bad bill anyway <e> <s> if one cannot legislate in terms which are meaningful in the construction of the statute law for the purposes of public consumption and the administration of the courts then we are probably on bad legislation and we ought not be be passing a bill of this kind at all <e> <s> but that is not the point before the house this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a substantial matter though it is important <e> <s> i do not wish to trespass on the time of the house any longer than is necessary because there is an important amendment to follow <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a long intervention <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend had taken over the rest of my speech <e> <s> i am not familiar with the district council of sodom and gomorrah so i really cannot say what they would do if they were entrusted with the authority which this amendment gives them <e> <s> as for the methodist conscience i had one myself for a very long time and felt able to refer to it without offence to others <e> <s> but i would certainly withdraw that reference if it caused my noble friend or anyone else any deep feelings of distress <e>", "<cs> my lords while listening to the debate i have wondered why i am torturing myself so much <e> <s> i am obviously espousing unpopular causes in your lordships house this morning <e> <s> but there are some things that i feel keenly about <e> <s> one is that matters of this kind should go through the mincer of parliament with critical care so that we know what we are doing <e> <s> we are looking with every care to the creation of new offences with a new set of penalties with new rights of seizure entry and so forth <e> <s> that i feel is the inspiration behind this good-natured martyrdom <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome this announcement very warmly indeed may i ask whether the noble lord is aware that this committee will begin its work in very unfavourable circumstances so far as the civil service side is concerned <e> <s> can he offer some further hope that this announcement will pave the way to a restoration of peace in the civil service and greater harmony and understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a large part of the prospect of settling this dispute lies in the confidence that the government can offer for the future <e> <s> the civil service has been denied arbitration in the present dispute there can be no argument about that <e> <s> the government have refused to allow the operation of the normally agreed procedures for a reference to the civil service arbitration tribunal <e> <s> right now i am asking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in warm congratulations to the noble baroness lady gardner to whose maiden speech we listened enchanted by her survey of administration problems in a bill of this kind <e> <s> there i thought was the voice of practical experience of local authorities trying to be jacks of all trades and masters of none <e> <s> local authorities are given many different tasks which require considerable expertise and experience and probably we pause too infrequently before imposing more burdens upon them <e> <s> i will come back to that later but i am sure that the noble baroness knows a good deal more about other subjects than many of us in terms of practical experience and that she knows a lot about subjects besides zoos <e> <s> we shall be glad to have the benefit of her experience in other debates <e> <s> as a citizen and ratepayer of the westminster county council i had a personal interest in the noble baronesss ability and capacity for reviewing the problems of an important city authority <e>", "<cs> my lords that is almost a three line underlining of what i have been saying <e> <s> there is no mutuality between the two houses on private members bills <e> <s> this is another very sad reflection upon our methods of doing business <e> <s> i conclude my remarks by saying in quite short terms that i think that when a private members bill has gone through all stages in another place and is sent up here for consideration the government might at least underwrite that bill as regards time and allow parliament to function <e> <s> it is simply monstrous that one member can get up and prevent parliament from functioning at all unless the sponsors of the measure whoever they may be can get a motion through that the question be put and apply the closure to the debate at the last minute of the last hour available for that bill <e> <s> that is enough on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill now comes to its inglorious conclusion <e> <s> i say that with the fullest respect to the noble lord lord nugent who has sponsored it with good nature ability skill and success <e> <s> but nothing downgrades a bill more in your lordships house than to put on its concluding stage during the supper break <e> <s> the inference underlying the selection of this time to deal with the conclusion of the bill is that we should not spend too much time on it and only a few moments ago the normal supper interval of one hour was reduced to minutes <e> <s> i am not sure what happens if we exceed the time <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i have a few remarks to make especially about the general atmosphere in which it has been necessary to consider the bill <e> <s> putting it on at this moment puts an additional constraint on the time of the house to deal with it <e> <s> after all noble lords have gone for their refreshment and they will come back at the appointed time impatiently waiting for the resumption of the main business of the evening which promises to be rather long <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments which the noble lord lord nugent accepted were not substantial though both of them were important and i do not think they will cause any serious difficulty next week <e> <s> i hope not <e> <s> nevertheless it would not be unfair to say that in considering the bill and the amendments i moved to it considerations of time have been present in the minds of noble lords who have wanted to see the measure through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am merely making the point that none of us should refrain from going over a bill that comes from another place simply because it has already been gone over <e>", "<cs> my lords i almost apologise for inflicting so many penalties upon your lordships patience <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment is a mistake <e> <s> if there is a scale of penalty points the more rule of thumb they are the better it is <e> <s> we have begun to introduce into this scale grounds for argument on the bench as to whether it is a two or a three point offence or as to where it comes between four and eight points <e> <s> i doubt whether this is justified <e> <s> if it makes any difference to the grand total as to whether a driver exceeding the speed limit has a score of two penalty points or three it seems to me that he is a pretty bad man to be on the road anyhow and that probably he ought to have a higher penalty rather than a lower penalty against him <e> <s> we know that the speed limit is widely disregarded <e> <s> walk outside this place at any hour of the day but especially at a time when your lordships are leaving and see what is happening <e> <s> why we do not have more by-elections in parliament is a miracle to me because of the way people go by this place at terrific speed <e> <s> motor cycles do not seem to think they come within the speed restrictions <e> <s> and the more noise they make the less they think that they come within any curb that has been laid down by the transport act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> this bill is being made for motorists by motorists and i happen not to be one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e> <s> what is the procedural significance of this break <e> <s> if the business to come on during the dinner hour by any chance exceeds the time allotted what is the position of the house <e> <s> do we automatically go back to the transport bill or what <e> <s> i ought to be aware of what happens but i am sorry to say that i am not <e> <s> i am not thinking of speaking for the whole hour but i should like just a modest part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must protest at the way in which we are asked to conduct our business <e> <s> we are trying to match eating time with speaking time and on no other occasion are the two brought together in your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord who moved that this bill do now pass has raised a matter of very grave importance from the point of view of the relationships between the two houses and also relating to the procedures which are followed on private members bills <e> <s> i think it is shocking to hear from the noble lord the slender thread upon which this bill now rests in order to pass into law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord for paying that tribute which i am sure is fully deserved and i think that one has to bear in mind that in getting reforms of this kind one has to get the co-operation of those who are taking an independent and possibly moral standpoint as well as those who are engaged in the actual business of the dealing with animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what has been said by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> if we are to have a non-medical condition known as anxiety what about a conscientious condition known as deeply held personal conviction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a vice-president of the building societies association but i do not go all the way with the noble earl lord selkirk in his approach to the bill <e> <s> from the comprehensive description that the noble earl has given of the duties and responsibilities of the position of chief registrar i was convinced that we should have someone better than a barrister <e> <s> the present holder of the office mr keith brading has risen above his legal handicap and has been a man of outstanding wisdom and judgment in his position <e> <s> i shall say something else about the present holder of the office in a few moments but the condition which the bill seeks to remove has been in the law since at least and was modified somewhat as long ago as when it became permissible for an assistant registrar without legal qualifications to be promoted to the top job provided that he had had five years service as an assistant registrar <e> <s> that is how the law stands at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i find our debates on the finance bill rather unpredictable <e> <s> sometimes we have a debate on the economic situation and sometimes we seem not to have a debate at all <e> <s> scant reference has been made to the finance bill so far in the debate and the noble lord lord robbins who has just spoken reminded us of our constitutional position <e> <s> this bill could scarcely be called short and uncomplicated which seems to be the recipe for bills on the agenda for fridays <e> <s> because we cannot amend it there is little point in talking about it but we are asked to pass this bill through all its stages today <e> <s> i suppose that the reason for that is that the bill has arrived late from another place another reason is that there is a time limit to the passing of the finance act under the provisions of the collection of taxes act and there is also the pressure of other business <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend must allow me to complete my condemnation <e> <s> it was when employers and employees connived to make false entries on the payrolls in order to avoid deductions under pay as you earn leaving the recipients to declare their gains on their tax returns which they did not with the result that the inland revenue lost millions of pounds because this practice went on for years and years <e> <s> my noble friend wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i never know who writes the headlines in our newspapers <e> <s> we are sometimes told that the editors would like some headlines but the machine room would like others and the editors are not allowed to have the headlines they would like

lords the noble lord has not said a single word yet on the matter that i brought before your lordships house during the second reading of this bill <e> <s> some billion of revenue have been intercepted in the past few weeks <e> <s> large borrowings have become necessary by the government in order to fill the gap <e> <s> considerable increases in interest on borrowed money have now been

amendment standing in my name to leave out lines to <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl lord avon intended to do full justice to the purpose of these amendments but i must say that had i not studied this matter very closely myself i should have had difficulty in following the merits of the arguments that he used <e> <s> the truth is that we have been here before <e> <s> on th july last year the noble lord lord auckland introduced as a private members bill the ground game bill which was to amend the ground game bill of as though to celebrate the centenary of the passing of the act <e> <s> that bill received its second reading in your lordships house on rd july last year but thereafter it ran into difficulties <e> <s> at committee stage amendments were seriously considered and the committee stage collapsed because when there was a division there were not the necessary numbers to support a valid vote of this house <e> <s> as time was going on in july of last year the bill made no further progress <e> <s> before that bill came here it had been introduced as a private members bill by mr hooson member of parliament in july <e> <s> it went through another place without a word being said in support of it <e> <s> it got through its second reading on the nod <e> <s> it went to a committee upstairs in another place where the sponsor of the bill submitted a redraft of the only substantial clause in the bill which had been supplied to him by the home office <e> <s> the committee proceedings were over in minutes <e> <s> it was on that basis that the bill passed through another place and was introduced by the noble lord lord auckland in this house in july of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted one or two brief comments <e> <s> as regards scotland when the ground game bill of was under consideration in this house the sponsor was advised that it would be inappropriate to extend the provisions of that bill to scotland particularly as section of the ground game act of which the present bill is a qualification has already been repealed in scotland <e> <s> he was advised that the agriculture scotland act repealed section of the ground game act which prohibits the use of firearms by occupiers to take rabbits and hares at night in respect of scotland <e> <s> but section of the agriculture act as amended by section of the pests act prohibits any person from shooting ground game at night and its provisions were not restricted to certain persons as in the ground game act of <e>", "<cs> my lords in resuming the debate i should like to acknowledge with thanks the kind references that the noble earl lord halsbury made to myself in connection with all the work that has been done by a great many people on the bill <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that and i express regret that we must impose additional burdens this afternoon on the noble lord lord belstead who has had a very heavy ministerial load of late <e> <s> we can all sympathise with a minister who has to go from nationality to animals from riots to the miscellaneous business of the home office <e> <s> it is a most tiresome department to be in <e>", "<cs> my lords

the pet animals act regulating the sale of pet animals <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to follow the right reverend prelate in the important matter that he has just raised <e> <s> my own impression after seeing the indian reservations both in canada and in the united states was that they had both been treated rather shamefully in the past and i fear that nearly all colonisation has ridden roughshod over the rights of indigenous peoples who were there before the europeans arrived <e> <s> so i sincerely hope that this matter will be more adequately dealt with when as seems likely we come to consider the repatriation of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords time is pressing and there is a long debate to follow <e> <s> it is very unfortunate that this important matter comes just at this moment <e> <s> can the noble baroness assure us that we will have an opportunity to debate this on whatever occasion presents itself to do so

the duty of asking a few more questions about the situation <e> <s> but i do say that this marks and spencers demolition job is one which will create deep dismay in the civil service and stir up the embers of discontent which are now lying about as a result of the recent pay dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord thorneycroft said a few moments ago we are not yet discussing a bill on local government finance nor are we discussing a green paper on the options we may have on local taxation <e> <s> nevertheless it is very difficult to avoid anticipating them in at least some respects

when my noble friend is taken to the bosom of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and embraced by the noble lord lord thorneycroft i begin to think there is something wrong somewhere <e> <s> i do not propose to be embraced by anybody except the noble lord lord holderness with whom i find myself in such warm agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to enable harbour authorities to make by-laws for regulating or prohibiting the transport of farm animals intended for slaughter outside the united kingdom and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise a matter on this motion <e> <s> it is with some diffidence that i offer one or two comments upon the motion before the house <e> <s> three years ago i was asked whether i would serve on the select committee on personal bills and i consented to do so <e> <s> i was assured that it would meet only rarely because personal bills were few in number <e> <s> in fact it met once during the period of my three years of membership <e> <s> that was on an application by a man to marry his stepdaughter which was forbidden by statute law and for which a personal bill had to be promoted <e> <s> i sat zealously through the whole of one session in order to reach a unanimous and sensible conclusion on that application <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be permitted to say so i fully accept the explanation <e> <s> as i said i have no grievances about it and i apologise for not being familiar with the standing order to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> it may be that i expect rather more courtesy than is available in your lordships house on a matter of this kind <e> <s> a word to the effect that i retired under standing orders would have set my mind at rest <e> <s> however this is rather an embarrassing subject to raise <e> <s> i tried to raise it in some other way <e> <s> however i have no more to say and i thank the noble lord for his explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had remained behind to ask a few questions about the economics of agriculture <e> <s> what he was talking about with the office of manpower economics is surely chicken-feed compared with the intricate administration behind these regulations <e> <s> the minister of state introduced these regulations i thought in a spirit of resignation <e> <s> i can quite understand on this of all days that there is a spirit of resignation in the minds of ministers and of noble lords on the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not know the grand total of public money that has gone into british leyland <e> <s> on the whole there is not the equivalent of british leyland in the agricultural industry <e> <s> they are mostly small businesses and we are all interested in small businesses and in giving aid to them now <e> <s> all right then <e> <s> those who want aid for small businesses might take up all the grants given to agriculture at the present time and see whether there is any precedent there that might help <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is a somewhat improved version of the bill that i introduced in the last session which was not proceeded with owing to pressure of business and i am very grateful to the noble baroness the leader of the house for facilitating the second reading of the bill so early in this session <e> <s> the bill deals with the slaughter of animals for food and broadly stated in a sentence it restricts the export of ritually-killed meat to animals which have been pre-stunned under the conditions of the slaughterhouses act and corresponding acts for scotland and northern ireland <e> <s> it does not propose to amend the law of the domestic situation in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it is of course a difficult subject but somebody has to deal with difficult subjects if they are important in the minds of the public <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that up and down the country this matter is becoming of increasing concern and of increasing controversy <e> <s> far from being inopportune it is probably opportune for your lordships house to consider a state of affairs which if it is allowed to continue will only get worse <e> <s> i am afraid that this is my considered judgment after studying this matter very closely <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i did not think his long speech very helpful <e> <s> anyway i must not grumble about my front bench <e> <s> he raised the question of why the british dependent territories are in the bill <e> <s> it is a quite simple explanation <e> <s> there is a small export trade of kosher meat to gibraltar and it seemed to me that a satisfactory way of dealing with that was to include in the bill an exception for british dependent territories <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> a year ago tomorrow january this bill received an unopposed second reading in your lordships house <e> <s> on that occasion the bill was supported by lord de clifford whose recent death we all mourn and whose absence from this debate i greatly regret <e> <s> i saw the noble lord just before the christmas recess and he said that he was looking forward to supporting this bill on the second reading <e> <s> last year the bill subsequently passed all its stages and was sent to another place but because of lack of time there it made no progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this short debate and i especially wish to thank the noble lord lord airedale for drawing attention to quite an important aspect of buying animals in market places the questions of warranty and redress if one has so to speak bought a pup and frequently the difficulty of getting complaints attended to on the part of stallholders who are not regularly there <e> <s> there is no doubt that to buy from pet shop premises under the conditions by which pet shops are now regulated and supervised is the most suitable way of buying a pet animal apart from going to the breeders themselves and a number of people do go direct to breeders and look at what they are buying and rely on the quality of the animals they get <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience on the wildlife and countryside act led me to believe that in all debates on wildlife and animal welfare in scotland it was desirable to have the civilising influence of the english brought to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords when one considers the merciless attitude of noble lords from scotland towards that majestic bird the great black-backed gull and their unyielding attitude on the use of the snare against the fox one wonders whether the standards that are adopted by noble lords in scotland are in need of some civilising influence <e> <s> i give notice that that will be my role in the further stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly congratulate my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for having brought into the debate a breath of fresh and youthful air <e> <s> we so rarely here the voice of the young in your lordships house <e> <s> the rarest thing is to hear it directly it is still rare to hear it indirectly <e> <s> but this afternoon surely we have heard a message from young people that we have not heard earlier in debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a vice-president of the building societies association <e>", "<cs> as is my noble friend lord hill of luton <e> <s> the noble earl lord kinnoull is chairman of a building society in which i am an investor and have been a borrower <e> <s> i have an interest in other building societies mostly on principle not necessarily because they offer me the best opportunity of a return on my money <e> <s> i have been in building societies all my life and my father before me <e> <s> when people ask me as an investor to support my society i yield something of myself my history and my emotions to that society yet it is really a meaningless entity i do not feel i belong to anything nor do they think i belong to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will agree that we have just listened to a most fascinating speech from the noble lord and he has undoubtedly made an important contribution to the debate of the day <e> <s> i look forward to reading it in <e>", "<cs> before we pass this clause may i make a few maverick comments on the attitude of the human species to animals <e> <s> in the rubric here we see power of commission to deal with marauding deer <e> <s> it is true that that appears in the principal act but in this bill this is the only guilt label fixed upon the deer <e> <s> most people have strong affection for the deer the female of the species <e>", "<cs> i do not see any reason at all why the index-linked pension should be thrown into this discussion <e> <s> there are probably more index-linked pensions received by noble lords here than by those in other institutions of which we know <e> <s> all people on national insurance retirement pensions are on index-linked pensions <e> <s> so we must not disparage the index-linked pension and hang our prejudice upon this poor red deer commission chairman who does not even have his pension yet <e> <s> so whether or not it will be index-linked we do not know <e>", "<cs> you lordships house is a suitable place for us to take a high moral line and probably not be too concerned with the squalid details of conditions of service <e> <s> the main task for the chairman <e>", "<cs> i should have thought the secretary of state who makes the appointment should have the power to terminate it <e> <s> he should not need all this rigmarole to give him statutory authority to do a common sense thing something which is clearly within his statutory duty <e>", "<cs> now the noble earl is using this bill as a vehicle to attack those who have the welfare of animals at heart <e> <s> he must be careful not to misuse the vehicle he is given to express his prejudices about those of us who have animal welfare at heart <e> <s> i understand the ministers view upon the need for more comprehensive treatment of deer farming than is suitable or possible in this bill <e> <s> i am not going to make a long speech <e> <s> i am merely suggesting that it is desirable not to let practices of deer farming become widespread and established before dealing with them otherwise we shall have a repetition of what has happened on a previous occasion merely that vested interests become firmly established capital is invested and all sorts of difficulties are then raised against humanitarian methods of dealing with animals <e>", "<cs> this is a stage in the bill in which the english are made to feel somewhat inferior <e> <s> i recall that mr macmillan once said <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble viscount who has just spoken <e> <s> there are a number of things that have to be taken into account somewhere sometime before we can be sure that what we do will bring in legislation which will prevail <e> <s> i think the problem here is that the farming community go on assuming that their word is going to be the last word without taking into account the changes in public opinion in society today towards their treatment and many other peoples treatment of animals <e> <s> i resent the easy thought that if you mention the nfu you are mentioning an authority an opinion that must be respected and held almost sacred whereas if you talk about trade unions which after all the nfu is you get all the prejudices against union power <e> <s> nfu power is just as objectional as transport and general workers union power and they both must be assailed where they are being misused for the protection of particular interests and not taking full account of public opinion and the public interest <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said the other day to me if you didnt exist you would have to be invented <e> <s> that is no longer true because following my noble friend lord jenkins there are at least two of us who are opposing this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that we are not alone or we ought not to be alone in thinking that the constant indulgence of ageing noble lords in this house in condemnation of the sexual activities of others is really a little unseemly i have said before that we have no qualifications for it either by age or by current experience <e> <s> so i think we might leave it to others who have a closer interest in what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> that deals with the conduct of other people in inflicting cruelty on other species which is an entirely different matter morally and politically <e> <s> but here we are dealing with sexual activity which is on the human plane and relates to the conduct of individuals <e> <s> this is another example of a lot of people getting worked up over sex and panicking into repressive legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i think that i may be content with that but i should like to consider it further <e> <s> i agree that as the amendment is drafted it is probably open to the same criticism as paragraph <e> <s> this is the difficulty of the meaning of words and whether one can define ones purpose and intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain the house for more than a moment or two <e> <s> i did during the course of my speech say that this instruction did no more than underline what the committee dealing with the bill would have to consider anyhow on the petitions already received so that whether or not this instruction is passed the committee will have to do the job the petitioners require it to do <e> <s> i thought that to underline the importance of this matter and sketch in some of the background to it might not only enlighten the house but generally convey the atmosphere in which the committee might like to consider the petitions received <e> <s> that seemed a reasonable thing to do <e> <s> i sincerely hope therefore that the house will feel able to pass this instruction without a division and let the committee get on with its complicated task <e>", "<cs> i think that it is very difficult indeed for us to proceed very much further in committee on this bill until we know what it is we are really doing <e> <s> i know that the minister finds it highly diverting that he does not know the difference between a locality and an area but before very long he will have to make up his mind which it is <e>", "<cs> the simple reason is that there is a demand for them otherwise they would pack up <e> <s> when local authorities are given the power to decide on licensing sex shops are they to take into account any evidence that might be available about the demand for them <e> <s> or will they take a high moral line and say nil nil nil and that will be it <e> <s> is it local government if it is done that way <e> <s> is local government just one grand piece of idiocy or does it have some sense of responsibility <e> <s> i do not believe that any local authority worthy of being there will say nil nil nil without some regard to the locality and to what demand the shop might meet and therefore i suggest there must be something in the bill about demand <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford i wish to make clear that i am not wishing to see anything <e> <s> it is not my concern that there should be more sex shops or that what they sell should be taken into the home or anything of that kind <e> <s> i am not concerned with that <e> <s> i have no interest whatsoever in this subject except as i conceive it fair dealing with people a sense of justice and a sense of freedom <e> <s> that is what i am concerned with and nothing else <e> <s> noble lords will completely misunderstand my purpose if they think that what i am suggesting will happen is something that i wish to see it is not so <e> <s> from a personal point of view i do not care tuppence whether or not there are any sex shops <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> i thought that the minister was going to take a more comprehensive look at what he had said about locality in relation to this and the subsequent amendment <e> <s> we have heard for the first time this afternoon a very important and literal statement made by the minister on the construction to be placed upon the word locality <e> <s> i found a good deal of what he said quite acceptable <e> <s> if i may say so it seemed to be the common sense of the matter <e> <s> but in the bill we have no guidance other than that the meaning of the word locality is that it <e>", "<cs> i shall first deal with the minister <e> <s> my only complaint about the minister is that he really did not read me the whole of his brief i was content with what he said until i began to read further into the matter and found to my astonishment that the definition of a sex shop which a local authority might decide needs a licence can go very far down the scale of newsagents and booksellers <e> <s> how far down the scale will this licensing system go <e>", "<cs> i wish to put a slightly different point of view about the amendment which i regard as a most reprehensible amendment <e> <s> the committee should decline to pass an amendment which proscribes the liberty of the subject without the sanction of the house of commons <e> <s> the other place did not debate this issue <e> <s> the last amendment and this one dealing with the liberty of the subject was merely a sop thrown out by the minister on report of the bill in another place without any debate on the detail of the matter and that is wrong constitutionally <e> <s> your lordships should be the champions the custodians of the liberty of the subject and should not send a bill to the house of commons with things in it which the other place has never dealt with <e> <s> in those circumstances the committee should reject the amendment and have it debated where it really belongs which is in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that we are rapidly reaching a position of complete frustration in your lordships house over this bill <e> <s> it seems all we shall do is beat the air unless we resolve to do something <e> <s> if we resolve to do something it will be either not to pass the bill or to amend the bill <e> <s> otherwise we are sending messages across the atlantic to the people and government of canada of which they may or may not take any notice <e> <s> we have been told by the minister who has just spoken that at any rate her majestys government will not act as postmen <e> <s> the canadian government are familiar with a good deal of what has been said already and can probably anticipate much of what is to follow <e> <s> have we not to recognise that the aim of the canadian government has been first and foremost to obtain wide enough consent among the canadian people and the provincial governments to enable this request to be made <e> <s> they have been waiting for this opportunity and this consent for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my appreciation of the decision of the secretary of state <e> <s> he has at least one admirer on these benches for his sensitive and sympathetic approach to a most difficult problem <e> <s> as one who has spent a good deal of his life in that area who loves it so much and who is sensitive to the feelings of people in the district i think that the minister has been well justified in taking ample time in careful study of all the implications of this enormous development <e> <s> i think the minister ought to register if he will my own humble thanks for his approach to this matter <e> <s> realising the disappointment it will cause in some quarters as the noble lord the minister said a moment ago there is difficulty in reaching a balanced judgment there is nevertheless another side to this matter before irrevocable harm is done to the diminishing beauty of britain <e>", "<cs> the special quality of your lordships house is based upon experience and knowledge very often of a specialised character which can be brought to bear on the problems of the nation for the enlightenment and guidance of people generally and probably of the elected chamber in particular <e> <s> i doubt whether this is a subject on which our special experience and qualifications are suitable for the guidance and advice this bill seeks to give <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the point of that intervention but thought i had expressed myself pretty clearly on this and it is only a supplement to observations of a similar character that i have made previously <e> <s> it so happens that this bill is introduced on the day after the remarks made by the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice in your lordships house <e> <s> what he said on this subject yesterday has as was to be expected struck the headlines this morning <e> <s> it may appear to casual observers that your lordships are well on the ball since the remarks of the lord chief justice one day are followed by a bill like this on the day after <e> <s> this is of course purely coincidental and i would not myself regard the remarks made by the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice as a case for this bill today <e> <s> i would certainly agree that there is a case for more public discussion before deciding on further legislation on this difficult and emotive subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not saying whether it should or would otherwise be <e> <s> i am saying it is there and it is widely looked at <e> <s> therefore one wonders how one distinguishes between one form of sexual propaganda and another <e> <s> but these are all the old problems of trial by opinion on matters of opinion rather than upon evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords the most satisfactory conclusion to the debate would i suggest have been for the noble lord lord nugent to withdraw the bill and have regarded this as a days debate on an important subject on which views have been expressed in all parts of the house <e> <s> the minister has indicated that the bill cannot possibly make any satisfactory progress in further stages in this house <e> <s> without government help it can get nowhere and the noble lord lord belstead indicated the difficulties in putting the bill in proper shape to make it a likely piece <e>", "<cs> the noble lords expectation that i would be disappointed puts it mildly <e> <s> he has just given us the classic prescription for governments doing nothing <e> <s> why appoint committees to go into problems and then disregard the work that they do <e> <s> and why not heed a good deal of public concern about this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord northfield in this amendment <e> <s> this is really one of the troublesome parts of the bill <e> <s> of course i listened to the debates on this subject at the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> we have to make up our minds that public opinion on cruelty on the treatment of animals domestic pets and wildlife is changing <e> <s> if one looks back years one realises that things were done then which would not be tolerated today <e> <s> for example in the slaughter of animals for food there was a time when the most disgraceful conditions obtained in our slaughterhouses <e> <s> if you look back over the debates on the slaughterhouses legislation of different kinds since you see that the most horrible descriptions of conditions and <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i do not think that the warnings given by the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge are relevant to the problem of over-population in many countries of the world <e> <s> certainly they are not as relevant there as they may be to the alleged evils of western civilisation <e>", "<cs> may i make two comments <e> <s> first it is obvious to anyone who has had any experience of trying to arrange committees of getting people there and of deciding a reasonable quorum that you cannot run a committee with five to seven members <e> <s> it is quite impossible so i think that we should dismiss it straight away <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend who has just spoken agrees <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friends will forgive me for having a point of view of my own on the matter <e> <s> no one who went through two years of the royal commission on standards of conduct in public life could come out of it without some deep anxieties about standards of financial control especially in regard to malpractices in local government <e> <s> i regret that far too little has been done since the report of the salmon commission and the redcliffe-maud committee on this subject six or seven years ago <e> <s> there were a few nettles there to be grasped but they have not been grasped <e> <s> the big spending public sector of this country today which includes local authorities should be prepared to submit with good grace to anything which on examination parliament feels they should accept as a greater safeguard of the public interest and the public peace of mind <e> <s> that as a principle should be followed <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord mottistone is right in most of what he said <e> <s> i think there is a very big difference indeed from the conditions inside a commercial enterprise an industrial enterprise which is being tested in its efficiency in its accounting in its economy and in the use of its resources by means of factors which do not apply to institutional life <e> <s> when things go wrong in institutions and some of our nationalised industries have tended to become institutions they rely on external help to get them out of their difficulties and no not apply their minds as they should to putting things right inside <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come in again but we cannot allow this to become merely an exchange of opinions between the two front benches <e> <s> we are all in this debate and we have a point of view <e> <s> i feel very strongly about the matters on which i am speaking <e> <s> this is the first opportunity i have had for a number of years to express my discontent at the neglect of recommendations which were made by a committee and a royal commission on issues which are connected with the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce of donington has got a point on the wording of the bill when he speaks about any matter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bruce was in such a hurry to withdraw his last amendment that he did not give me a chance to give him the help for which he had asked <e> <s> i was very disappointed about that because i could make amends to him for the little assistance i had been able to give i thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i need scarcely say that the reply of the noble earl lord avon is disappointing <e> <s> i was deeply disappointed with the noble lord lord cottesloe and also with the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> i do not know if i may say so where noble lords go for their information or for that matter their experience <e> <s> all the voluntary societies that take care of the welfare of dogs are in support of these proposals <e> <s> local authorities are holding

of the house perhaps he could offer a little further information on the point which my noble friend has made <e> <s> i apologise for this matter coming on late in the evening but that is not my fault <e> <s> this matter is so important that with great respect to the house i do not believe that we should curtail our considerations of it merely because the hour is late <e> <s> it is quite early for noble lords to be doing business in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i have moved my amendment and i presume that the question will be put <e>", "<cs> my lords no ruling has been given that if amendment no <e> <s> were defeated it would not be possible to call amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it may be that a small amendment could be introduced at a later stage if there is any untidiness about amendments nos <e> <s> and going into the bill without amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not asked for it to be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> there may be a flaw in the amendment my lords <e> <s> i agree that information supplied to the rating valuers should be available in the way my noble friend suggests <e> <s> but that is not the only information held by the valuation office <e> <s> it has particulars delivered on the basis of a statutory obligation to supply the valuation department of the inland revenue with particulars of property conveyed including the consideration involved <e> <s> that should not be material to what local authorities require for rating purposes <e> <s> i am anxious that information which people are obliged to supply to the valuation office for entirely different reasons should not be made available for other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that competition from the banks has nothing to do with the behaviour of some building societies towards candidates who want to get a foothold in the self-perpetuating oligarchies which rule the building societies at the present time <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord before giving his answer saw the watchdog programme days ago <e> <s> did the noble lord see the letter from his honourable friend the member of parliament for hornchurch in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord show me a rule in any building society which authorises the society to approach the employer of a candidate for election to ask whether sufficient time will be available for the candidate to perform the duties of his office <e> <s> what right have they to do that <e> <s> is that in the code of conduct in the rules of the society <e> <s> yet this was done by a building society within the last month <e>", "<cs> my lords i preferred the version of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford to that of the noble lord the minister in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the two dangers which i shall describe in a moment are not so great in relation to an application for a licence for entertainment as they are in applying for a licence for a sex shop <e> <s> the question is what are these fees for <e> <s> are they at the will and pleasure and determination of the local authority to make what money they like on the side <e> <s> are they a temptation for corruption <e> <s> that report on corruption in local government has not yet been attended to properly <e> <s> if the fee is to be related to the expenses of the local authority to ensure that the public are not asked to pay for licensing these activities which have a commercial purpose all well and good <e> <s> but if they are to be used by the local authority at their own discretion for any purpose which comes to their minds then i think that is open to serious objection <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord nugent is nothing if not persevering in this field of interest <e> <s> if he persists i think that before long we shall have something known as nugents law and when in future i hear the word sex no matter how romantic the conditions in which it may occur i shall always think of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a few comments on the bill before it finally leaves <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord permit me to say a word <e>", "<cs> i am following what the noble lord is saying with the closest interest but he has not mentioned that in view of the special position of the civil service provision was made in the general arrangements for compulsory arbitration <e> <s> on the occasion last year of the dispute which arose access to an arbitration tribunal was refused in breach of the arbitration agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to speak at this stage in the debate because what i have to say will probably be better understood in the light of the speeches which noble lords have already heard from both sides of the house and particularly some of them from this side of the house <e> <s> the speech of the noble lord lord marsh was in a class by itself and appropriately made from a central position in your lordships house <e> <s> he made his name in another place by making that sort of speech against the tories <e> <s> of course it went down very well on our benches so that we all get this kind of entertainment in turn <e> <s> he is very impartial now in granting his political favours <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that it could have been reached in a shorter period than years over four parliaments and four governments <e> <s> the applied knowledge and ability of all concerned could have produced a conclusion rather sooner than that had it not been for the marginal swing of the political pendulum <e> <s> i believe it is our electoral system which is at the root of some of this trouble because it can bring about radical changes at westminster and in political power on remarkably small movements in electoral opinion <e> <s> that produces a distortion of our political and parliamentary system <e> <s> nearly all governments are minority governments and have more people against them than for them and in most cases the mandate is false yet it is freely used and is being almost sanctified now in our party political affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government wish to remove inconsistencies and a sense of injustice on this question of arbitration in the public sector why is it that arbitration under pressure was conceded to the civil service <e> <s> why is it that arbitration under pressure was conceded to the teachers <e> <s> now the noble lord is saying that the government must decide on the pay of the health service workers <e> <s> why cannot arbitration given to one section of the public sector be applied to others and what alternative is there for resolving differences between the governments workers and the government themselves if arbitration is not available <e>", "<cs> these amendments and the clause to which they relate are likely to become a feature of our political and parliamentary life if the see-saw trends of recent affairs continue <e> <s> it seems now as if one government propose and the next one dispose and one wonders whether we are entering a period of politics in which governments will have a single term and probably no longer in which case the succession of governments will be involved in undoing what their predecessors did <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that he could dispose of all the anxieties of my noble friend by seconding a group of tax inspectors to the department concerned to deal with claims <e> <s> they would make sure that nobody received anything to which they were not entitled <e>", "<cs> i put individual liberty very high indeed in the free society but as i said earlier the right of the individual may reach a point where he must have regard to the rights of other individuals <e> <s> in other words he must come to terms with his environment especially when he chooses that environment for himself <e> <s> i find myself in sympathy with the case made out by my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> we must bear in mind that throughout the piece the right of the worker with a conscience or a deeply-held personal conviction is upheld <e> <s> that is in this clause <e> <s> so we do provide for the strong personal reason for not wanting to belong to a trade union or a particular trade union <e>", "<cs> it is a good idea that we are talking about this rather late in the evening otherwise the public would get the mistaken impression that the debate has taken such a bizarre turn that we are now trying to prevent people from wanting to be unfairly dismissed <e> <s> i think that members of the public will think that we have gone barmy and that this bill is not to protect people from unfair dismissal but is to facilitate unfair dismissal with considerable rewards at the end of the day <e> <s> do not let us leave the mistaken impression that there is a lot of money in this for people who want it <e> <s> the money in this is for people who do not want it that is the whole purpose of the bill <e> <s> surely the seamens union and the maritime industry can find a way of dealing with people who want to be unfairly dismissed <e> <s> what about walking the plank <e>", "<cs> the first question is whether the period of five years for the review of the existing closed shop is the right period <e> <s> it is as the noble lord opposite has said a matter of judgment <e> <s> years ago when i was negotiating the introduction of equal pay in the civil service and i suggested to the then chancellor rab butler that five years for an instalment plan was the right kind of period he said that he thought it should be seven years because there was a good biblical precedent for it <e> <s> probably seven is the right interval here because there is a good biblical precedent for it <e>", "<cs> my lords since my name has been mentioned by my noble friend lord george-brown it is probably not known to your lordships that it was my nodding and low profile grunts of approval that caused his reference to the value of my opinion <e> <s> i do not want to leave your lordships in any doubt about that <e> <s> i fully agree with my noble friend lord george-brown <e> <s> i think it can be put in very simple terms that this amendment proposes to put statutory membership of a professional body pad passu as conscientious objection because it adds that to the section dealing with conscientious objection <e> <s> therefore it would be excluded from the provisions of subsection <e> <s> it is as plain as a pike staff and i do not know why we are going all round the houses about this <e> <s> what the minister has to do is to satisfy the movers and the rest of us who are interested in this that there is no need for this special exemption in these circumstances because it will be covered by other means in which case he has to show that it is not necessary to make it a pari passu exemption from subsection along with conscientious objection <e> <s> i hope that is a little clearer than it was before <e>", "<cs> i feel very cross indeed at the speech that my noble friend has just made <e> <s> i strongly oppose this amendment <e> <s> his supercilious reference to the constitution of the parliamentary labour party makes me more vexed still <e> <s> little does he know what we went through in the parliamentary labour party in order to get the conscience clause right <e> <s> he probably does not recall that the root of the difficulty in the parliamentary labour party were those who claimed exemption from the disciplines of the party on a three-line whip on conscientious grounds <e> <s> this arose to a very large extent as regards those who held strong views about defence and also strong views about temperance <e> <s> there were various causes of conscientious grounds at that time and i need not remind noble lords who understand parliamentary procedures of the problem which arises when members of a party decline to support the party notwithstanding the majority view because they say that they have a conscientious objection to doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords on this matter the point to bear in mind is that when the trade unions look a gift horse in the mouth they examine its teeth very carefully <e> <s> the moral of it all is never offer the trade unions anything that they have not asked for <e> <s> they will view it with suspicion and deep resentment and when you introduce draft regulations to administer the gift you will find that they will try to read between the lines and examine the motives of her majestys government <e> <s> i do not know why governments do not learn all this from practical experience but they do not <e> <s> they go on making the same mistakes all the time and the trade unions go on exhibiting the same attitudes all the time <e> <s> however it is part of the initiation of the noble lord on the front bench who had the difficult task of explaining what sounded to me to be almost inexplicable certainly it was extremely difficult to understand <e> <s> however we shall probably know more about these regulations when we read <e>", "<cs> my lords i wrote to the minister to tell him of my interest in this matter <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the explanation that he has given <e> <s> this is of course not unexpected because the chancellor of the exchequer announced the intention of the government to do this when speaking at the annual banquet of the building societies association a few weeks ago <e> <s> it was one part of his speech that was received with obvious satisfaction <e> <s> there are other <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> is it within the scope of the review to phase out this method of raising money altogether or is main the purpose of the review to make permanent these renewable concessions to those who engaged in this activity earlier on <e> <s> i ask that question because at the time there were some criticisms of this method of raising money for worthy and noble objects <e> <s> as my noble friend said a moment ago large sums of money are collected under this system not all of which by any means reach the destination for which they may be intended <e> <s> i wonder whether without asking the noble lord to commit himself in any way i could ask whether this review is a comprehensive one that is to say getting rid of this altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord also to confirm on the first draft order that under paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the disappointment of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that we are having nothing to say about the finance bill <e> <s> it seems very strange that we are having nothing useful to say about a bill of clauses and schedules <e> <s> last year some of us did have something to say but it was not welcome in some quarters <e> <s> at least a note of discontent on my part was received with consternation on the front bench opposite <e> <s> we had our debate last year on the finance bill on a friday which is usually the day we reserve for animals and pornography <e> <s> we are now having it on a monday with more time <e> <s> i believe the business managers of your lordships house were rather afraid that if we began to debate the finance bill today we might go on for a very long time with the fate of the bill hanging in the balance until late this evening and they wanted to get it safely tucked away with as little debate as possible and then we could range over the whole economy and no harm would be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i added my name to this clause because it represents a meeting of minds rather than any change in political alignment <e> <s> but my noble friend lord rochester is the secretary of the house of lords industry study group of which i have the honour to be chairman <e> <s> if that is not a commercial i do not know what is <e> <s> i could also refer to the fact that the noble lord lord aylestone was a colleague of mine in the labour government so i think that the support for this new clause has a respectable background <e>", "<cs> yes certainly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely but there are times when just a gentle nudge helps and this is what the new clause suggests <e> <s> it does not tell companies what they must do <e> <s> it merely asks them to tell us what they are doing <e> <s> and that i think is of great interest because it is one of the most important aspects of industrial relations today <e> <s> my firm conviction is that our existing system cannot last unless there is a better understanding between management and workers under our existing system <e> <s> i do not think that prosperity lies the way of this bill i do not think it puts us on the way at all <e> <s> but if this new clause went into the bill it would be the one thing which indicated that there was some constructive proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pity that we are taking two amendments to this bill which raise such far-reaching issues of importance and national interest at this hour of the night <e> <s> it is a pity that we were not dealing with these amendments earlier when the public was listening or might have taken a little notice <e> <s> probably the only advantage of tonight is that we shall hog the whole of yesterday in parliament instead of having to share it with another place but that is an argument for sitting tomorrow and the day after and not for finishing tonight <e>", "<cs> no which shows that these matters are being dealt with by the certification officer when complaints are made <e>", "<cs> my noble friend must leave me alone at this late hour because i want to be brief <e> <s> i have been through all this myself in my own union <e> <s> i recall all the events connected with contracting in and contracting out <e> <s> the main issue goes far wider than the exercise of individual rights of trade unions wider than the issue of democracy in trade unions <e> <s> it has really become part and parcel of the financing of our political parties <e> <s> i was chairman of a committee on this subject and my noble friends lord underhill and lord mccarthy were members when we were looking at the wider issue of how we were financing our political parties in this country <e> <s> the way the labour party is financed out of trade union levy substantially has to be looked at in the light of the way the conservative party is financed which comes from so-called donations and contributions in very large amounts indeed <e> <s> we have the present two main <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> but exactly what they did and exactly what the certification officer decided is all in the report <e> <s> from what they put in the report it is clear to me that the union argued that this was not expenditure but an investment and that the purpose was not the furtherance of a political object but profitable investment <e> <s> the certification officer disagreed with that view and he made it clear in all the reasons he gave that the union should have known and did know that this was for the furtherance of a political object and he therefore disallowed it <e>", "<cs> my lords my concern about this amendment is that i think it is quite unworkable <e> <s> what i object to is the reliance on a definition of motivation here <e> <s> we have come up against this same kind of thing in connection with taxation for example where the law has sought on occasion to rule out from allowance or exemption action taken mainly or wholly for the purpose of avoidance of tax <e> <s> in the past these provisions have proved quite unworkable because courts have had great difficulty in deciding what the motivation really was whether a particular action taken was for the purpose set out in the act or whether it was for some other purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i was taking the page as a whole <e> <s> it seemed to me that what i was saying was relevant to the whole package of these amendments to clause <e> <s> i hope i am not wrong in thinking that we are dealing with a group of amendments to clause which is set out on page of the marshalled list of amendments <e>", "<cs> then my lords i will reserve what i have to say until we come on to the next one <e> <s> it is in fact more relevant to the next one than to this one <e> <s> i think that these particular amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to prolong this discussion but may i for a moment continue the point i raised inappropriately earlier on <e> <s> it seems to me that however complex an amendment however obscure its real purpose there must somewhere along the line be a capacity to explain it in simple terms <e> <s> i am sorry that we have not had this amendment before us for a little longer so that we can really dig into it and see exactly what it intends to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that it is proposed to extend this ridiculous protection of children act which applies to england and wales to scotland <e> <s> i had always thought that in scotland they had an enlightened approach to moral laws and that their own common sense and strength of character was quite enough by itself without legislative protection <e> <s> the act was a ridiculous piece of legislation it was panic legislation we were threatened with an avalanche of indecent material relating to children coming from the united states <e> <s> it was all nonsense <e> <s> i am surprised that scotland swallows this mary whitehouse stuff and incorporates it in the last stages of this bill <e> <s> if the government had any intention of doing this they should have done it earlier because it would have been salutary to have taken stock of the operation of this legislation in england before extending it to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt noble lords opposite were wondering what i was staying for <e> <s> i do not dissent from the commons amendment <e> <s> indeed i think that by the time we have agreed with the commons in over amendments this bill will be a model of painstaking legislation <e> <s> it is quite extraordinary really how a bill introduced into your lordships house going through the careful and vigilant scrutiny of noble lords on both sides of the house should receive so much amendment in another place <e> <s> it is a tribute i think to the way in which parliament deals with legislation of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend knows from our long and affectionate association how shy i am of putting my spoke into matters affecting scotland <e> <s> it is almost holy ground to me <e> <s> it becomes a little less so only when the government go in for the things that i criticised earlier on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the pet animals act regulating the sale of pet animals <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord lord nugent relates particularly to the undertaking given by the noble lord lord belstead when this matter was being debated in your lordships house on rd november <e> <s> he has made that clear <e> <s> what is it that the noble lord lord belstead said <e> <s> he said that the home secretary had decided that it was <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness looks at the record tomorrow she will find that i did not use those words <e> <s> i did not say that in my opinion children were not affected by television <e> <s> i was referring in general to the statement made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford that television is the biggest influence in all our lives but i did not refer to children in particular <e> <s> however if that question was asked of me i franky confess that i would not know what influence television does have on children <e> <s> it would be interesting to know whether anyone can be quite certain what that influence might be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to say whether my noble friend can have a free vote or what he should have <e> <s> all i am doing is reporting to the house the policy that was adopted by the conference of the labour party as recently as last october <e> <s> whether that becomes a matter of discipline upon members of the party is another matter <e> <s> i am merely saying that there will be opportunities to open up the whole of section if this bill goes into committee and i think that prospect is not one <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try to get on because i have a few remarks to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to confirm or deny that at all <e> <s> i am merely reporting what is a matter of public knowledge and what is in the hands of all noble lords on both sides of the house and that is the declaration of policy made at the labour party conference last october and there can be no doubt at all that it runs firmly counter to the proposal which has been made by the noble lord who has moved the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i will not read it out but it is there on the record as to what the policy document said and what the labour party conference approved <e>", "<cs> my lords if the right reverend prelate will permit me to intervene i did not use in this connection the word party <e> <s> i said academic exercise but not party <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me deal with the select committee <e> <s> i regret that i am not prepared to accept the suggestion that i should withdraw my amendment in return for the noble lords indication a moment ago that he would be willing to consider referring the bill to a select committee <e> <s> i will certainly accept the idea of a select committee unprejudiced by this bill but not as the basis of considering a bill which i regard as fundamentally wrong and against which there will be widespread revulsion if it gets a second reading in your lordships house tonight <e> <s> the fair offer is an unprejudiced open select committee with suitable terms of reference <e> <s> that is how to investigate this matter in the way that i think it will have to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must beware that members of this house do not forsake entirely some semblance of representative capacity <e> <s> i should hate to join issue with the noble and learned lord lord denning but in my type of laymans way i have held the view that if you use the law to give guidance you make it the law and in making it the law you intend to make it enforceable <e> <s> if you intend to give guidance guidelines or a code of conduct that is a different mechanism for trying to achieve the same purpose <e> <s> but if you put it in the law <e>", "<cs> i am advised that it is in order for me to make a comment and a suggestion on this motion <e> <s> i do so because immediately after this motion two items of business will be taken during the break for supper and i raise particularly a matter on the first of those two which is the commonwealth development corporation bill <e> <s> it has been the practice in this house ever since i came here and long before that for non-contentious business to be taken as desired during the supper breaks in a long committee stage of a bill <e> <s> but i think care has to be taken if i may say so respectfully not to include items to be taken under these conditions upon which noble lords would otherwise wish to have a modest time for debate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but sometimes one measures importance by the degree of attention given to it <e> <s> the point is that it is important but it will be seen to be important if we give more attention to it than the opportunity given during supper time in this house by a virtually empty chamber while most noble lords are busily occupied in refreshment elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by making a protest about our business <e> <s> i did this last week in connection with the important question of the commonwealth development corporation being spatchcocked into the supper interval <e> <s> now <e> <s> tonight we have this important collection of draft orders and we are under pressure because for a very well understood reason the house wishes to rise a little early <e> <s> but why cannot we have proper time in which to discuss these important matters <e> <s> this house sits only four days a week the other place sits five <e> <s> why cannot we have a five-day week if that is necessary in order to discharge our business in reasonable conditions and with reasonable time <e> <s> the other place spent the whole of friday discussing the report of the select committee which is associated with these draft orders <e> <s> here we are for the first time for years considering draft orders which update the in-word of today the codes and regulations that were introduced a decade or so ago <e> <s> i do not think it is fair on the house and it is not fair on those of us who do a lot of work on these matters and spend our private time our weekend time trying to master subjects to be told when we get here can you be brief <e> <s> i let it pass at that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i know that noble lords can say hear hear but so far the debate has been conducted by farmers about farming <e> <s> however now and again a layman has a point of view on these matters and i claim the right in your lordships house to express it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not get as far as death i think i said peck each other to pieces <e>", "<cs> i am not sure i heard all of that <e> <s> the minister in another place in the debate on th november said that the great majority of veal calves were now bred in better conditions than crates <e> <s> i asked for evidence of that and i was told in reply to a question that i tabled that the evidence came from a variety of sources <e> <s> i am not at all sure that that evidence is convincing <e> <s> the point i am on is whether this marketing organisation will be able or will feel able to distinguish between the different methods of rearing animals for food <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble earl for his full and careful explanation <e> <s> i am convinced from what he says that it would be difficult to include in the bill a statutory provision of this kind when the food from britain organisation can be open as i assume it can to representations from consumer interests at any time on any matters within its purview related to the marketing of these products their quality and anything else that is relevant to the sale of goods of this kind <e> <s> i think that it is to that organisation that we should send our representations in due course although it may be that the real remedy is not at this end but at the production end that of prescribing more adequate conditions under which animals shall be kept <e> <s> that is receiving attention as the noble earl knows better than most of us on the farm animal welfare council and in the industry generally <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> i take the points that he has made <e> <s> the address of food from britain when we know what it is is the place to which we might send our representations on this and other matters <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause provides for the statutory bodies mentioned on page to make such contributions as they wish to the work of food from britain <e> <s> i cannot understand why food from britain cannot require some contribution from these various statutory bodies who are engaged to some extent in the same type of business <e> <s> really and truly this whole scheme is a subsidy by the taxpayer in order that some organisation should sell his food to him through a quango and a body which is financed out of public funds <e> <s> the inference behind the title <e> <s> food from britain is that it will be exported <e> <s> we do not want to talk about food from britain when it is our own food grown here because then it would be food from within britain <e> <s> food from britain is presumably the food we send to somebody else from britain <e> <s> so although the whole concept is really export orientated a great amount of the products of food from britain will be sold in this country <e> <s> why cannot some contribution be required <e>", "<cs> again i am very much obliged to the noble earl for his explanation <e> <s> i rise only to disabuse his mind of the suggestion that i am insinuating something <e> <s> i owe the committee an apology because i was prevented by other engagements from taking part either in the debate on the second reading of the bill or in the more general agricultural debate later last week <e> <s> but i must say how astonished i was at the uncritical reception of almost anything relating to the agricultural industry <e> <s> in one debate i doubt whether any noble lord spoke who did not declare an interest <e> <s> it seemed to be if i may say so a very cosy discussion on both sides of the house full of self-congratulation at the performance of the agricultural industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the speech of the noble lord lord beloff in introducing the amendment did not do justice to the importance of this subject <e> <s> he treated it with a little levity at one stage in his speech <e> <s> i had expected from him a speech of great historical interest and a powerful argument but i submit with great respect that we got neither from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for that reply <e> <s> if i may say so it is in favourable contrast to the speeches i have received on earlier occasions <e> <s> indeed looking further back i am sure that ronald russell would have been glad to hear anything resembling what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i was prevented from taking part in the debate on this clause during the committee stage but on carefully reading the debate that took place then on nd february i must say that i was left with a feeling of considerable confusion and unease as to precisely what powers were to be given and to whom under this subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this debate <e> <s> he is a master of the art of introducing thorny topics with the sharper points nicely honed down with polished language and lucid exposition <e> <s> he is a master of that <e> <s> we are grateful to him for raising this subject <e> <s> probably he will think of another subject equally difficult and probably underlying considerable differences of opinion for our consideration on another occasion <e> <s> i echo the words of the noble lord lord rochester at the end of his speech <e> <s> we really should be talking more about co-operation and how we can all work together rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not explained any victory or defeat by reference to what happened to the political levy after the trade disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said more than once before that i am a vice-president of the building societies association and a candid friend of the building society movement <e> <s> i claim that my thinking about building societies is a step ahead of most of those engaged in the daily practice of building society work <e> <s> it is a long time since i was directly concerned with the management of a building society and then it was quite a small one <e> <s> through this connection and others i have kept closely in touch with what is happening in the world of building societies <e>", "<cs> my lords the two noble lords who have spoken have produced a veritable washing list of points to be raised on this draft order and matters which in other circumstances would occupy the committee stage of a bill <e> <s> i want first to make some comments on procedure <e> <s> this order really emerges out of the twilight of parliamentary democracy in relation to northern ireland <e> <s> if it applied to any other part of the country it would require an act of parliament because this order contains substantive new law and as my noble friend lord underhill pointed out there are articles covering pages <e> <s> this shows the problem of the governance of northern ireland by this instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now on the third reading of this bill and may i therefore take up a moment or two to comment upon it <e> <s> i rather missed my opportunity on second reading because matters seemed to go back to the noble lord lord renton rather quickly <e> <s> it is a great pity that we have to deal with this bill in this way <e> <s> i know it is an extraordinary situation but when important bills get dropped in bundles of the finance bill gets mauled about because the opposition will not swallow it and we have other bills that are to be sent through your lordships house at high speed it is not a very satisfactory way of dealing with the nations affairs and not a very dignified way in which to end a parliament <e> <s> i am concerned about this on those grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i would always wish to do my best to help my noble friend lord ardwick to get any bill on the statute book <e> <s> having myself had some experience i know of the great difficulties that there are in doing such a thing <e> <s> usually any old bill which my noble friend wished to introduce would do except this one <e> <s> we are in the unusual position of having from another place bills which do not bear the inscription of the place from which they come <e> <s> what the bills tell us is who is moving them <e> <s> sometimes it is more important to know more about who is moving a bill than what they are moving <e> <s> when i look at who were the sponsors of the bill in another place <e> <s> i see that among them are some individuals who would abolish your lordships altogether if they get the chance and three of them at least i shall predict will not be in the next parliament <e> <s> we cannot really accept this kind of legacy from such a nondescript source <e> <s> i sincerely hope that we shall say that with the greatest regret the bill cannot proceed at this hour in this way since in another place it has not gone through with the benefit of really serious discussion <e>", "<cs> when people listen to the noise from another place they wonder what sort of rabble there is down there <e> <s> why then should we join with them in some joint enterprise to consider how we should best present ourselves to the public or communicate with them <e> <s> my lords we have our own technique <e> <s> we have our own style <e> <s> we have our own appeal and we are in an entirely different position from the other place <e> <s> as i said to noble friends around me we are about to be sent on an enforced holiday with no praise no pay and no prospects <e> <s> this is a dismal condition in which to say goodbye to this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords usually the queens speech gives us enough to talk about and a great deal to do <e> <s> however at the outset of a new parliament we really need a queens speech for a parliament rather than only for a session <e> <s> we want to lengthen our perspective when we are beginning a new parliament especially when the government have such a secure majority as the present one <e> <s> we should aim in every parliament to bring under review some areas of our institutions which are candidates for change and reform <e> <s> i do not know whether this government have within their machinery a committee known as the committee for future legislation but it is worthwhile for any government to have a programme for the whole of their term to foresee the measures that they will bring forward from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall probably make a few more yet <e> <s> secondly i should like to mention the electoral system to which several noble lords have made reference <e> <s> i say to my noble friend lord wells-pestell that if we are to examine the theory of the mandate look at the total votes cast and relate the total poll for particular parties to the number of seats that they have in the house of commons then we have to carry that discussion to its logical conclusion and look at the question of changing the electoral system <e> <s> the question of the mandate can crop up with any government <e> <s> if there had been a labour government committed to the shift of power from one section of the community to another it would probably have been done with a substantial parliamentary majority resting on no greater mandatory strength than that of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords it was i who moved the instruction to the select committee on the opposed provisions of this bill on th march last year <e> <s> it is on that instruction that the select committee has produced the special report which is now before the house <e> <s> in view of that i think it is suitable for me to express grateful thanks to the select committee for having gone so carefully into this tedious affair of the burnley dogs <e> <s> in particular i think one must mourn the passing of lord hinton of bankside who was the chairman of the select committee <e> <s> for days the select committee listened to counsel and petitioners on these clauses in the county of lancashire bill related expressly to the restrictions in the borough of burnley upon the use of parks for the walking of dogs <e> <s> i draw the attention of the house particularly to paragraphs and of the special report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness permit me to say that these percentages small though they are are considerable in terms of numbers <e> <s> some thousands of animals are involved in the per cent <e> <s> of the total number of animals involved <e> <s> we are talking in millions <e> <s> the number represented by a small percentage is rather greater than many people would imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed to noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i think it has been worth while to have this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot congratulate the noble lord the minister on the way that he introduced this bill <e> <s> with great respect to him i thought that he sounded like an enlightened estate agent reading particulars delivered of a prime property coming on the market for letting if only the landlord could get rid of the legal entanglements in the way of doing what he wished to do <e> <s> i wish that the minister had been more specific about what lies behind this bill <e> <s> for myself if i thought that the government were bent on evil which lots of people think i should say that it is a sinister little bill <e> <s> if i wanted to arouse prejudice on these benches i should say that this is the beginning of the privatisation of somerset house <e> <s> but i am not very clear what the minister has in mind apart from freeing the hands of the secretary of state for the environment to do something with somerset house that he cannot do at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone and myself are the only two laymen in this debate <e> <s> we have heard from the women and we have heard from my two visiting noble friends on this side of the house the noble professors lords mccarthy and wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> they both have not been content to floor the minister but they have driven him into the ground <e> <s> we have heard also from the noble and learned lord lord denning who has surely shown that the english language can be used to express principles and ideas provisions and regulations in terms which people can understand <e>", "<cs> well my lords i will not detain the house any further <e> <s> it is obvious that the minister has something more to say <e> <s> i think i have made my point <e> <s> i can only conclude by reinforcing the appeal i have just made to him <e> <s> this house is noted for reaching agreement where accommodation is possible <e> <s> i think that the attempt should be made because it will be a great pity if this important addition to the regulations is issued in face of the discontent and indeed positive dissent of so many people who believe they understand them who are not satisfied with what they read and who are entitled to have their wishes met especially if there is no real grievance to be overcome no real difference to be overcome between the minister and the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i have unexpectedly the great pleasure of congratulating the noble earl lord attlee on a most remarkable and moving maiden speech <e> <s> we have listened to a testament of youth of one who underwent experiences in circumstances which we realise imposed a great test upon the character of the person concerned <e> <s> we have heard of the problems of young people who are suffering from disablement <e> <s> those at school young people are sensitive but probably moving among others who care little for their disabilities and can often be very cruel indeed <e> <s> we have been greatly moved by hearing from the noble earl <e> <s> when he left the merchant navy he did not take the soft option <e> <s> he became assistant public relations officer to british rail which was a great adventure undertaken i am sure with confidence and courage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to carry on for a little longer if i may <e> <s> the noble earl will have an opportunity to reply at the end <e> <s> i am only saying at the moment that i think he probably has underestimated the problems of construction definition and interpretation which his bill would create <e> <s> after all discrimination is the making of a distinction and a distinction has to be either self-evident or readily ascertainable <e> <s> it has to be defined <e> <s> it is necessary then having defined it to say what one is going to do about it whether one standard of nondiscrimination applies throughout or whether there are to be refinements of choice between one person and another which in some circumstances are reasonable and in others not <e> <s> there are many problems here which have to be faced if we attempt to legislate too definitely and too quickly on this subject <e>", "<cs> please my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i regret the reproach that the noble earl has made <e> <s> i was here sitting in this chamber long before he came in <e> <s> i do not think that that is a very courteous reference to make to a friend and colleague <e> <s> i listened to his speech throughout i heard his testimony to the united overwhelming opinion of the voluntary bodies but i am entitled to point out that he failed to mention one important society that expressed a dissenting point of view <e>", "<cs> if i may proceed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to proceed <e> <s> the select committee which was appointed to consider the sex discrimination bill by your lordships provided the main body of material from which ultimately legislation was undertaken <e>", "<cs> i may have misunderstood the time we arrived at this stage in our proceedings but it is usually seven oclock <e>", "<cs> then i hope those who are having supper will not hurry back because we have business to do <e>", "<cs> i thought that this was almost common form <e> <s> there are various ways whereby ministers can lay proposals before parliament <e> <s> it can be done by regulation it can be done by statutory instrument in certain circumstances it can be done by orders-in-council <e> <s> i did not think there was any difficulty about this <e> <s> it was just that the bill allows the minister to do what he likes and this amendment asks the minister to lay his proposals before the house in suitable parliamentary form <e> <s> perhaps i may now comment on the remarks of the noble lord lord mancroft <e> <s> it was not my intention that one should produce a schedule with his main proposals something like the charter of the bbc <e> <s> not at all <e> <s> i had in mind that what would be laid before parliament was the broad framework of what it was proposed to do with the whole or part or that part it was wanted to lease of somerset house to whom it would go what sort of lease was in mind and what the general covenants would be regarding the purposes for which the building should be used <e> <s> that seems to me to be the way of doing it <e> <s> of course it may be that the minister will adopt another alternative perhaps a statement to the house when something could be commented upon <e>", "<cs> i hope noble lords do not think that i am being unnecessarily concerned about this matter but may i be permitted to read to the noble lord the announcement that the board of inland revenue have made to the staff <e> <s> then i think we shall see the full significance of it from their point of view <e> <s> i read <e>", "<cs> i was dealing with long leases not the use of the building on occasions of the kind the noble lord just mentioned with other buildings <e> <s> i am concerned with long leases and as i said earlier a lease that would run for a generation <e>", "<cs> i apologise for being in such ill temper <e> <s> i had better draw my contributions to <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill and so do many organisations concerned with the welfare of animals <e> <s> because of its numerous provisions over a fairly wide area the bill may need rather more attention in committee than it is possible to give it on second reading <e> <s> this is probably the one week in the year when one might concentrate on slaughter and i shall have a word or two to say about that in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords at least i suppose i should acknowledge that the noble lord the minister has tried <e> <s> he did do what he said he would do he would think about it <e> <s> i am grateful for that <e> <s> i think that he does himself an injustice in suggesting that he cannot find an alternative which would be more acceptable to those of us who are criticising the present form of words <e> <s> i am sure that if he were to be set in a test paper find suitable words as an alternative to he thinks fit he would reveal how much better an education he has had than i have and would find a suitable alternative <e> <s> so i am rather suggesting that although he tried he did not try very hard <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has put up a very reasonable case <e> <s> i do not wish to labour the point unnecessarily <e> <s> once again the minister firmly asserted the governments intention which will be on the record <e> <s> if in future anybody feels any doubt about the use of somerset house he will be able to refer to it as almost a ministerial assurance upon which both parliament and the public can rely <e> <s> with that i shall have to be satisfied <e> <s> it may be that with my next amendment one could apply the ultimate safeguard <e> <s> but we shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> well my lords it is <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has done everything except put it into words in the bill <e> <s> i can see that he has had some difficulty about putting words into the bill <e> <s> there are times when ministers ought to put words into a bill without having their hands restrained by the civil service behind them <e> <s> i know that might be somewhat adventurous from a legislative point of view but what a change it would be if one could see words in a bill that one liked to see in a bill benign words containing provisions which <e>", "<cs> certainly they may be spoken to together my lords <e>", "<cs> all right my lords i will not detain the house any longer <e> <s> i see the problems that the minister has raised and again i can only take comfort from the explanations given by the minister which will be on the record for future guidance <e> <s> i think i shall be content with that <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise a matter on clause i which is linked with clause and it is a matter of which i have given the minister notice <e> <s> i recently received a letter from the cotswolds wildlife preservation society expressing fears that clause with the powers of entry prescribed in clause was an additional threat to badgers giving additional powers to go in search of and to seize live badgers <e> <s> i have not construed these clauses as doing that <e> <s> i have taken advice on the matter from other sources and my own fears if there were any have been removed <e> <s> however if the minister would be so kind as to make the position quite clear it would probably remove any misunderstanding <e> <s> i only raise the matter on behalf of a society of this kind because their letter was closely argued although i think it was mistaken in the conclusions that it reached <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i suppose that anybody on these benches has difficulty over clause <e>", "<cs> of course one can go to the directory and read them all out but they are not relevant to the point that i am about to make <e> <s> this is a government-appointed council it is not a welfare body in the sense that other bodies may claim to be welfare bodies it

plenty of trade interests around that will have to be consulted will they not <e> <s> they will have plenty of time to consider where their interests lie in anything that the government may do <e> <s> i am not talking of them <e> <s> they are the interests and are referred to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is making it worse <e> <s> he now says it is not a statutory body so he begins to run it down <e> <s> the fact that it is not a statutory body is immaterial <e> <s> it is the advisory body on the welfare of farm animals appointed by the government and the only one of its kind in relation to this bill <e> <s> surely that gives it a status which is not enjoyed by any voluntary body or other pressure group that may be consulted and properly consulted when matters are under consideration <e> <s> this is the primary advisory body of the government so constituted and strengthened by this government to make it a stronger force in the chain of consultation and formulation of policy than the old committee <e> <s> therefore surely it has a place in a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> clause removes from the act in section the words <e>", "<cs> no i thought we were about to have a statement <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e> <s> i am sorry to delay the statement but i still have quite a lot on clause yet <e> <s> i accept the ministers explanation of why the exemptions were included in the bill <e> <s> they are there as i understand as the longest of long stops against any dubiety arising in certain extreme remote or almost impossible circumstances so that it is just a waste of print and it does not really matter <e> <s> in those circumstances there is no point in spending further time on it <e>", "<cs> i wonder what the government have been doing all this time since this matter was first brought within the terms of reference of the farm animal welfare council in <e> <s> the first thing that the farm animal welfare council did when it was reconstituted was to go to the minister and ask for an extension of its terms of reference to bring slaughter into it and he granted that <e> <s> they said the first thing we want to deal with is slaughter the care of birds before slaughter the methods of slaughter and slaughter generally <e> <s> that is what they have been doing <e> <s> the farm animal welfare council took this on board in july and reported in january and it is their report of january that we are referring to constantly in relation to this bill <e> <s> it is now january <e>", "<cs> i shall not take up the time of the committee in replying to the noble lord in the vein to which i am accustomed <e> <s> i shall leave him alone for a minute or two because i want to be left alone myself for a minute or two and make way for my noble friend lord john-mackie <e> <s> i think that it is about time he had a go <e> <s> i am becoming a little weary and there will be quite a lot else that will engage the attention of the noble lord the minister when i come to a subsequent amendment <e> <s> so i shall put greater reliance on the understandings i do not say undertakings that we have gained from the debate on <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord john-mackie responds may i underline one point <e> <s> the amendment speaks of on the farm slaughter and farmers have been referred to through-out the discussions so far <e> <s> i hope that we can distinguish between on the farm slaughter that is the farmer slaughterer and the small poultry slaughterer <e> <s> there is a distinction <e> <s> one can concede something to the farmer given an order for a dozen hens or cockerels for christmas who says i will slaughter them and dress them <e> <s> i am anxious however that we should not be led into thinking that cover can be given to someone who sets up as a small slaughterer <e> <s> he is not a farmer <e> <s> he is just pulling in birds and slaughtering on a small scale <e> <s> then he becomes a slaughterer on a big scale or a bigger scale <e> <s> so the thing grows <e> <s> we want to be clear that we are talking about on the farm slaughter <e> <s> the noble lord the minister in considering the matter further will have to bear that distinction in mind <e>", "<cs> is that in the schedule <e>", "<cs> at the moment i have only moved amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> we are almost getting on friendly terms and i am grateful for that <e> <s> i appreciate too the intervention of the noble earl lord shannon <e> <s> this gives me the opportunity of paying great tribute indeed to the work being done by enlightened leaders of some of the trade associations <e> <s> a good deal of expense is being incurred by the british poultry federation for one in trying to seek answers to deficiencies of which they are as fully aware as anybody who goes to look at them and probably more so <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the last thing in the world i would do is to put a pistol at the governments head in case it was loaded and accidentally went off <e> <s> the minister has given a full explanation of the difficulties <e> <s> i am bound to confess that in my own amateur way i have tried to pick out suitable subjects for debate on the bill in committee <e> <s> i realise that in this matter i have only half the problem and it is a difficult half as well but all in <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the minister has just said it would be a mistake to continue to reproduce different definitions of free speech in different statute law dealing with different aspects of our affairs if we are going to do this we should do it comprehensively arising from the convention and let it be the general umbrella under which our freedom of speech is centred <e>", "<cs> this is the amendment for which i have been waiting because i have a very close interest in what it wants to achieve <e> <s> i have encountered the problem of the act and the broadcasting of scenes which in a film-showing would contravene the act but the bbc particularly have claimed that it did not bind them <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems as if so far there is not violent disagreement with the governments proposal to do something about the so-called divided loyalties of civil servants especially in this area very sensitive responsible and confidential <e> <s> it is probably the manner of doing it that has excited so much resentment and objection <e> <s> in particular it has been very difficult to accept the idea that loyalty has a price and if the price is big enough then you can buy it <e> <s> that has left a very unpleasant taste in the mouths of many respectable citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords i always want to agree with my noble friend and i do so on this occasion though i hope that the minister will not fall over himself to make exceptions <e> <s> i uttered a cautionary word at the committee stage on the possible size of these farmer slaughterings that might be undertaken <e> <s> having taken advice on the matter since it is as well to say that these exceptions should be restricted to what is common sense and should not be given too freely <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> probably i had become a little mixed up between the places where birds are reared and where they are slaughtered <e> <s> it is not always possible to trace hack how different conditions affecting the same livestock are covered in respect of some hazards by different acts of parliament or by different regulations <e> <s> i am quite content with the explanation which the noble lord has given and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have now broken my duck on this bill and my score is equivalent to that of the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> we have not yet finished and one never knows there might be more to come <e> <s> however i am grateful to the noble lord and i am happy that the proposed new form of words will be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am quite content with his answer and therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the present i think that i am persuaded <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue the matter further at this time of night or indeed in this particular debate <e> <s> i believe that wider issues arc involved here which it might be more suitable to ventilate on another occasion <e> <s> it would have to do with enforcement of the law in relation to cruelty to animals which is not by any means as good as it ought to be <e> <s> i shall not say any more but beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i expressed serious misgivings about the bill on second reading and i have been greatly worried about it ever since <e> <s> i do not think that we are going about the bill the right way to achieve the purpose that so many of us have in mind <e> <s> quite frankly i feel embarrassed at having to participate in proceedings which i believe are almost futile from the legislative point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords having taken rather longer on the committee and report stages of this bill than is customary for a bill of this kind i ask leave to make a few comments before the bill finally passes through your lordships house <e> <s> this is a useful bill and we have improved it slightly in the course of its passing through the house <e> <s> it is not a criticism but it is a disappointment that i have that the bill does not contain a great deal more along the line of reform of the conditions under which animals go to slaughter <e> <s> clauses to are a distinct advance on present conditions and we look forward to the regulations and the codes of practice which will be issued under the provisions of those clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that motorists are now the new criminal classes in our country <e> <s> there are more law breakers among motorists than among any other section of the community <e> <s> because there is such widespread disregard of the law of speeding on our roads the government are proposing a new kind of principle in law-making <e> <s> they say that if enough people decline to comply with the law we must change the law to comply with the wishes of the people <e> <s> we are now adjusting speed limits to those which have been widely adopted by those driving different kinds of vehicles on our roads today <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister why the draft new guidelines have been sent only to those noble lords who spoke during the second reading debate <e> <s> does it not count that one has sat right through the debate albeit without saying anything <e> <s> those who want to facilitate business are deprived of the opportunity of looking at what the government are up to <e> <s> why do the guidelines come out at the

want to forestall someone else who is going to make a move on a matter of this kind <e> <s> i will not comment on this amendment at the present time except to remark that we have a numerous attendance of noble lords on a subject which i must say does not excite quite so much interest among other noble lords <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has overlooked the fact that last night the committee decided that clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord will read line five of the bill which he has in his hand he will see the words save as permitted by licence under this act <e> <s> those words are now in the bill <e> <s> it would be out of order in my submission for anything to be said or done now which seeks to remove those words from clause which the committee agreed last night shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord is attempting is to undo the second reading of the bill <e> <s> it is not surprising that on this subject almost every speech and every amendment sparks something off <e> <s> it certainly sparked something off in the noble lord a moment ago <e> <s> where we have got into a mess is that the noble lord lord alport agreed with the noble lord lord stanley and others to the deletion a moment or two ago of subsection on page <e> <s> by the deletion of subsection on page the ban has been taken out of the bill <e> <s> it has not been taken out of the title but it has been taken out of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> it is clear then that the moment he indicated that he was willing to wheel out the bandwagon the triple alliance climbed on to it <e> <s> they were going to make quite sure that the noble lord lord alport deleted subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am about to supplement the question asked by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister likes to answer every question in turn that is all right <e> <s> i will then ask my own question in a moment or two <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this is a task of enormous complexity <e> <s> it is far in excess of any problems set to beveridge in <e> <s> can he give some more impressive evidence of the competence of this system of reviews to produce the results which are being sought <e> <s> as my noble friend said a moment or two ago we have a battery of committees reviewing different aspects of the comprehensive scheme <e> <s> how are they all to be brought together <e> <s> how are they to be presented <e> <s> what hope is there of accomplishing the task within months from now <e> <s> something more impressive must be sought to ensure that this tremendous review can be accomplished and concrete results brought about <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in the congratulations to the noble lord lord ashbourne who has given a very thoughtful maiden speech on this difficult matter <e> <s> i think the noble lord will find that if he wishes to prohibit showing he will either have to prohibit showing in the home or prevent things from getting into the home at all <e> <s> this will provide a most difficult question of civic freedom for parents to decide in certain circumstances what they take into the home <e> <s> however they may be supplied and under whatever restrictions they may be supplied it is difficult to forbid parents taking things into the home <e> <s> unless we have legislation to prevent people from getting video recordings to show in the home which can be seen by adults under club conditions what the noble lord is seeking will not be attainable <e> <s> this was a matter of considerable controversy in the standing committee and i shall refer to that again a little later <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been sat down for quite a minute or two <e> <s> the reply to the right reverend prelate is that i have not read the whole report <e> <s> i was not in a position to pass judgment on it myself <e> <s> i have

of the sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i sat through the whole debate and have heard every speech <e> <s> i think i sense the mood of the house and that your lordships would like the bill to go straight to a committee on the floor of the house <e> <s> in those circumstances i threaten you with joining in the fray and i will not move my motion that the bill be committed to a select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a private members bill and i assume that the remarks of my noble friend a moment ago do not necessarily bring the debate to a conclusion <e> <s> my worry about the bill right from the beginning has been that to proceed with it puts this house and the bill in a false position <e> <s> the bill has already been rejected in another place and whether it was in circumstances that we liked or of which we disapproved does not matter <e> <s> it was defeated in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords there are probably two things that i shall never see in my lifetime one is a fixed easter

in the field of commerce and industry but in employment too <e> <s> if we are to wander into the range of exports without full knowledge of what the consequences or the advantages may be we shall be repeating some of the unwisdom that has already occurred in the earlier stages of this bill in another place <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must detain the committee for a short while to make some comments on the bill with special reference to clause <e> <s> before embarking on that i should like if i may with great respect to compliment the noble lord lord nugent for taking full responsibility in the committee for his sponsorship of the bill <e> <s> on private members bills i am all in favour of keeping ministers in their place <e> <s> their place is to advise and not to control and not to assume control <e> <s> i have witnessed in your lordships house on a previous occasion how a minister took complete charge of a private members bill <e> <s> we hardly heard a bleat from the sponsor because the matter became so complicated and difficult that it took a minister of state to pilot the reconstruction of the bill through the house <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord nugent is valiantly taking a stand <e> <s> we shall be delighted of course i speak for myself but i am sure with the agreement of the whole committee to have the advice of the noble lord lord elton whose courtesy and ability we like and admire <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did consider at what stage in the bill these remarks would be more appropriate <e> <s> it seemed to me that it was desirable to wave this particular flag over the proceedings to begin with rather than to leave it to the end <e> <s> it was as simple as that <e> <s> i believe that it should colour our approach to various amendments and considerations that we shall have to give to the bill as we go through it <e> <s> i am not at all satisfied with the bill obviously <e> <s> i want to make some contribution towards its reshaping and rewording and the greater revelation of itself in the course of the committee stage <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i am astonished at a lawyer advocating the bypassing of the normal processes of the law <e> <s> this is a short cut to imposing controls without going through any legal process for the purpose that is really what it amounts to <e>", "<cs> to which amendment is the noble lord referring <e>", "<cs> frankly i am not sure <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments that have been made on this matter <e> <s> i think probably there is some misunderstanding between us to some extent <e> <s> i believe that the whole clause is so <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> it clarifies the matter <e> <s> but the exemptions that are provided for later in this clause are separate from the conditions of subsection <e> <s> they are as it were absolute <e> <s> if the videos are produced by people for the purposes specified in the subsections they are exempt and they do not have to go through the hoop as to whether or not what they are doing is substantially stimulating sexual activity <e> <s> i am sure that they will be greatly relieved by that some of them <e>", "<cs> yes i know but i am one voice among so many and minority views are to be heard in this chamber with endurance if not patience <e> <s> your lordships will certainly have to rely on both before this bill is finished <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> the case that i made out for referring this bill to a select committee is being supported every quarter of an hour in this debate <e> <s> it is quite obvious that a great deal should have been gone into much more deeply before we went on to legislation <e>", "<cs> i have finished <e>", "<cs> i have said enough <e>", "<cs> i am not as satisfied with the noble lords reply as i had hoped to be but i can see his point <e> <s> when one embarks on legislation in this and in other fields one finds the need to be precise to get definitions right and to be sure where the boundaries in various areas are drawn <e> <s> the classifications the problems of legislation and the bureaucracy behind it all loom into view <e> <s> in talking about submitting to the authority the noble lord did not for a moment mention what happens when the authority gets choked up with all the things that it has to look at consider and classify <e> <s> we shall come to that a little later especially when we have to consider what will happen about the backlog and so on <e> <s> i can see that the noble lord is not hostile to any acceptable area where it can be sufficiently defined to avoid having undesirable people straying into it <e>", "<cs> lend me your other ear <e>", "<cs> i shall take the first part at its face value but the second part with great respect i shall not because i am sure there was a tinge of asperity in the chief whips comment <e> <s> i paused only because i thought it was desirable for the noble lord to hear what was being said on that side rather than listen to what i was saying <e> <s> that was the only reason i paused <e> <s> it was not with any feeling of upset <e>", "<cs> we had better come back to this at a later stage and see whether the home office know anymore about what this phantom censorship board will be able to cope with <e> <s> it has no idea it is not there yet and it does not have the people <e> <s> they will have to be trained first and so on <e> <s> as the minister said we want to get on with the bill even though we cannot get on with the administration of it <e> <s> it will be a bill without a body by the time we have finished <e> <s> there will be nobody to work it <e> <s> however i shall defer further consideration of this amendment and beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the answer to my noble friend lord mcintosh is clear enough that is that we are handing over to the censorship board the power to withhold altogether from lawful viewing some of the horrors or violence which we may have seen in the course of conflict and other disasters and which have been shown on current affairs programmes <e>", "<cs> i cannot possibly withdraw this amendment <e> <s> no hope is held out of making either common sense or reasonableness apply to the provisions of this bill <e> <s> it seems that one can only plough on and exercise ones parliamentary right to resist what one profoundly believes to be wrong <e> <s> in the course of parliamentary affairs some people have to make a stand against the tide at the time because they believe the tide is wrong <e> <s> wiser counsels will prevail in due course <e> <s> already people have lost interest in the nasties because they think it is all tied up and dealt with and here we are grappling with the consequences the backlash the backlog the widening area of the whole problem the intrusion into the personal lives of individuals <e> <s> to continue is merely to repeat what i have already said before <e> <s> i regret that i cannot withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both noble lords who have spoken have raised some interesting points on the amendment <e> <s> it all needs a little sorting out <e> <s> it is true that we have had the model by-law published while this bill has been before your lordships house and that there is some relationship between the two <e> <s> indeed that brings me to the important question namely what will the governments intentions be about this bill when it has passed through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am satisfied with that reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> it may be that i am a little premature <e> <s> if the eec felt that harmonisation in this area might be attempted this kind of difficulty would be removed <e> <s> i am very strongly in favour of as much harmonisation as can be achieved by eec countries <e> <s> it would make for interchange of trade and for the acceptance of common standards <e> <s> no area from my point of view is so important as the harmonisation of the treatment of animals particularly in the laboratories of europe so that people are not able to go from one country to another conducting experiments as they become <e>", "<cs> then i am quite content <e> <s> if this amendment is unnecessary then it is unnecessary <e> <s> if the matter is taken care of then okay <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that this has not become a little too complicated for me <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> by way of explanation may i be permitted to say that some interests which are concerned with this bill find that i am the only member of your lordships committee likely to take up the points they have in mind <e> <s> they realise as i do what an unfriendly atmosphere we are all in those of us who seek to probe to reform and in certain circumstances to resist <e>", "<cs> but we are doing our best <e> <s> to save the further time of the committee i had better beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i still want to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i may add that i have read through the <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one comment about clause stand part <e> <s> i regret that in clause we are creating a new offence <e> <s> the offence we are creating as i understand the bill is that while in the relationship between neighbours friends and relatives one may pass on unclassified video recordings which are not for reward and not in the course of business if there is reward or it is done in the course of business then it is an offence <e>", "<cs> i will not keep the committee more than a couple of minutes or so <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mishcon for reading out what of course i have already read <e> <s> nobody is perhaps receiving more communications at the present time than i am from the british video association <e> <s> i try to read all that they are saying <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree that that would be most convenient <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl who has just spoken has mentioned this matter received a great deal of attention in the standing committee <e> <s> as a matter of fact one half of the total time spent by the standing committee in another place was spent on this clause <e> <s> this question of the functions of the censorship authority went almost to and fro in the committee in various phases of tolerance or extremism which came under review from time to time <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend does not let me get on i shall be accused of filibustering which is the furthest thing from my mind <e> <s> what i wish to say to the committee on this matter is first i do not believe that this kind of directive is appropriate in this clause <e> <s> this clause deals with the authority to determine the suitability of video works for classification whether or not they are suitable for classification <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that supporters of the bill shift their ground <e> <s> when this bill was introduced to headlines of a dramatic character about the proportion of young children who were seeing nasties it was to protect the children <e> <s> that it was that was behind the wave of moral indignation at what was believed to be going on in the homes of britain <e> <s> indeed in the earlier stages of the preparations for this movement the organisers of the campaign were stressing if we can make it children it will make this legislation irresistible <e> <s> so the children were put in the forefront of the campaign <e>", "<cs> i have not said anything about the roman caholic bishops <e> <s> i have said that any person representing the catholic church being an honourable man like mr nicholas coote would disown a report which he believed was constructed upon either no evidence or cooked evidence <e> <s> that is what i am saying and i hope that my noble friend would not wish to infer that mr nicholas coote would leave the proceedings of this committee on any other grounds than his discontent with the way it was being run <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get involved in close analysis of what is alleged about the <e>", "<cs> i shall not pursue the matter any further on that line because i have full documentation and there are steps being taken to publish a full account of what transpired <e> <s> no doubt noble lords will in due course be able to read it for themselves <e> <s> all i want to do is to come back to where i ought to have finished earlier on <e> <s> i do not think that the words in the home are relevant to this clause <e> <s> there is no need for direction <e> <s> we are dealing with function and the overriding task is to decide what is suitable for classification for certificates <e>", "<cs> i think the classification comes in at clause <e> <s> the bill is not bound to follow the jargon of the british board of film censors in this connection related to the film industry <e> <s> it will probably have to find its own descriptions and they may or may not be the same <e> <s> a great many people are hoping that they are going to be the same because it will then mean that films shown in the home will at least be of a type that one can see in the open cinema <e> <s> that is what most people are hoping <e> <s> otherwise a fresh sense of grievance will occur that people would be forbidden to view in their homes what they can go up the street and see in the cinema <e> <s> i was not sure when <e>", "<cs> because the words sex shop come here in clause all i wish to say is that so far as i am concerned it will be without prejudice to our bringing before the house probably at report stage a scheme which a number of people are working on at the present time to substitute licensed video shop for licensed sex shop <e> <s> i shall not go into any detail about that because i know what conditions would have to be satisfied in the circumstances <e> <s> i just enter a caveat against the words sex shop at the moment because lawyers are at present at work on this alternative and it is receiving a considerable amount of support <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has been very helpful and i accept what he said <e> <s> i do not think i am slipping yet but i would not have suggested an appeal being heard in public when the film itself should be shown <e> <s> i thought that it was almost like a secrets case <e> <s> they would see the dirt in private and come out and give their judgment in public <e> <s> but that might be a misconception of how it should be done <e> <s> i think that the open court is probably not as important as the composition of the tribunal its procedures and its permissive power to pay costs <e> <s> at the moment i am satisfied with what the minister has said so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i can help in that way i shall not move my amendment no <e> <s> now and will defer that to another occasion <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i am astonished that a bill should be introduced making provision for this extensive system of chargeable services without any idea being given as to what they are likely to cost <e> <s> i should have thought that this was an essential part of a bill that is imposing burdens of an unknown amount upon individiual traders and under which consumers may be threatened by increases in charges of an unknown amount <e> <s> if this had been a charge on public funds and i assume that there is to be no charge on public funds we should have heard a great deal more about it <e> <s> some estimates would have been made the matter would have been gone into and much more information would have been available as to the cost of the scheme <e> <s> but we have been given nothing at all it is all to be on trust <e>", "<cs> i shall detain the committee for no more than two minutes <e> <s> i am still not reconciled to clause l <e>", "<cs> is the lord deputy chairman putting the two clauses together <e>", "<cs> again i think we are entitled to a little information about the process of appointing the designated authority <e> <s> there seem to be a lot of matters that are uncertain <e> <s> we have been told though it is not in the bill that the designated authority will be the british board of film censors <e> <s> that body is an unofficial body appointed by and financed by the industry and it is to be brought into commission for the video work <e> <s> little has been said about who will be on it how it will be composed and generally how the suitability of that body for this work commends itself to all concerned <e>", "<cs> i point out that the clause that we are dealing with is not only a classification clause but one which creates an offence if a video tape is supplied to a person under the age specified <e> <s> your lordships will see that upon the paper <e> <s> if ages are to be at the discretion of the designated authority it can alter the whole scale of retail trade by altering the ages <e> <s> indeed i think that we all realise the difficulty at the present time that many establishments have in being able to distinguish between a person who is under and a person who is or over <e> <s> anybody in pubs and off-licences and elsewhere will tell you that <e> <s> similarly when we look at the age of or thereabouts there are equal difficulties in deciding who is and who is <e>", "<cs> that is most helpful <e> <s> nevertheless <e> <s> i shall not be deflected from the final comment that i was going to make <e> <s> i constantly hear from the noble lord the minister about those of us who have seen these horrible things and those who have not seen these horrible things the inference being that those of us who have seen them really do know what this is all about and those who have not by their own choice have in some way contracted out of an experience that they ought to have gone through in the interests of knowing the reality of the problem <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> i understand that there is some flaw in the clause <e> <s> indeed i hear that as it stands it is unworkable <e> <s> can the minister throw any light on this <e> <s> is he in difficulties about this clause <e> <s> ought we to know about the difficulties that have arisen <e>", "<cs> no i was merely asking the minister whether he had heard anything about this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate which is to follow i notice that almost as many noble lords wish to discuss the protection and conservation of our heritage as those who wish to take part in this debate <e> <s> that is how it should be <e> <s> frankly the future of our heritage is probably more important than the future of the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> that is probably so <e> <s> i think the noble lord was probably referring to my later amendment amendment no <e> <s> which is on a similar point <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> dear oh me <e> <s> i really think that it is making life very hard for possibly innocent people <e> <s> this really relates to the main proposal of the amendment <e> <s> it is the long traditional basis of our system of jurisprudence that a person charged with an offence has to be proved guilty <e> <s> the onus of proof is not usually put on the accused person <e> <s> it has been done i believe on previous occasions in a similar connection to this <e> <s> it seems as if we have one system for one classification of offence and another system for a different classification of offence <e>", "<cs> i have never met a humble lawyer yet least of all my noble friend <e> <s> i shall not take more than a minute or two because we want to get on <e> <s> however i do draw the attention of the committee to the allied clause in the same context <e> <s> this states <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the minister wishes to say anymore on this <e>", "<cs> yes i shall readily do that <e> <s> should not spend the time of the committee commenting further except to say that i am very grateful to my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> when he comes out on my side my case is strong indeed and i have no need to presume to add words to the case that he has made <e> <s> i am very grateful to him <e> <s> i was hoping that somewhere during the passage of this bill the lawyers would take up these very important questions of civil rights <e> <s> however i am beginning to digress <e> <s> what shall i do <e> <s> i think that i shall withdraw the amendment so that we are free to come back to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord monson would agree that perhaps this question could be linked with the matter that is to be given further consideration <e> <s> what was the origin of this heavy fine <e> <s> it was due to the fact that in the standing committee in another place a group of members wanted there to be prison sentences <e> <s> they were discouraged from that by the minister himself <e> <s> then they said well if we cant send people to prison we can put up the fine <e> <s> they had a figure of and so they said well double it <e>", "<cs> very well <e> <s> let us forget it as quickly as possible <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i do not regard that very carefully explained justification for keeping this anomaly in the bill as being satisfactory <e> <s> it seems to me that if we leave this matter as it is it will prejudice the independent judgment of the designated authority in the discharge of its task <e> <s> all the time it will have to consider what the reactions are of the police up and down the country to classified material already in circulation <e> <s> indeed i read out the passage from last sundays issue of the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mishcon has now deserted me and the government have put up the noble baroness to trample on me so what chance do i stand <e> <s> especially in view of the result of the last division i stand very much alone and my noble friends who supported me then are the heroes of the day <e>", "<cs> i beg my noble friends pardon <e> <s> there have not been very many of us <e> <s> probably he will join me in having some views on the present subject but they do not matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i appeal to the minister to reconsider his position <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble viscount lord hanworth that if the forthcoming bill does not contain something equivalent to this then this clause will never be put back <e> <s> there will be no authority to put it back <e> <s> we cannot in a video bill have powers given to the police that they may not possess in connection with their fight against crime <e> <s> parliament can speak with only one voice it seems to me on a matter of this kind <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is the title of the bill <e> <s> is that right <e> <s> i have rather lost where i am <e>", "<cs> i not only wanted the bill to have a more literal description i also wanted to bring some prejudice into it <e> <s> the noble lord could have brought prejudice into it by accepting this amendment <e> <s> he could have waved his finger at all the nasties and all these horrible people who are engaged in the trade and said now you rogues you have a censorship act against you <e> <s> but no he has now become tolerant at the end of this long debate and i am disposed almost to respond to that and to let it go as it is <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> this is another amendment which i need not press <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> according to subsection the various provisions of the act will come into force at different dates <e> <s> is the minister able to say which will come into force first <e> <s> he ought to bear in mind that the bill though it may be passed within a matter of days from now will not in some respects be in operation before the police bill has been through this house <e> <s> perhaps therefore the minister will consider this point together with the other matters he has taken back for further thought <e> <s> as an act of courtesy may i indicate that at report stage certain of my noble friends and i will propose that the bill should lapse five years from now subject to renewal by both houses of parliament <e> <s> there is precedent for this procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is years this week since the last major review of teachers pay was undertaken <e> <s> many sectors of the public services have been reviewed <e> <s> some have permanent review bodies and others have been the subject of more recent reviews <e> <s> is it not time that another independent inquiry into the pay and structure of the teaching profession should be undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed that neither the sponsor of the bill nor the minister is prepared to stand up and defend the right of your lordships house to include in this bill our most noble vocation <e> <s> why should politics take a place in the list of exempted works subordinate to sport or for that matter music <e> <s> i leave religion in a more pre-eminent position but why sport <e> <s> what special quality is there about sport which claims a particular place here <e> <s> politics is something by itself <e> <s> it is not information education or instruction it is an activity and a contentious one <e> <s> it receives a great deal of publicity and can give rise to deep passions anger and other human emotions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord has fully explained why this transfer of some items from the list of exemptions to the list of exempted supply is called for <e> <s> this surely is a downgrading to a classification which is subject to the earlier part of clause of items which in the bill as it stands are exempt works and receive with the exemption all the freedoms of movement and so forth that an exemption confers on a video recording <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be grateful to the minister for what he has just said but since there is a good deal of mutual respect going around i shall say to him with respect that at this stage in the consideration of the bill it is incumbent upon the government to show their hand a little more firmly and a little more clearly as to what they are prepared to do <e> <s> after all these discussions have been going on right from the beginning of the consideration of the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> there was a very unsatisfactory debate on this matter in another place in standing committee and i believe on report <e> <s> this is a very grave matter and unless the house is prepared to show some determination of its own to get suitable accommodation on this question we shall not get from the government the response that the matter deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the shower of gratitude which is now being poured upon the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> praise is difficult to get in this debate whichever side you are on <e> <s> i think that i should say that i am grateful to the noble lord for having taken the trouble to meet us <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i must say that he cannot have it both ways <e> <s> my first proposition was that words as words not perhaps having any very useful meaning should be left out <e> <s> but no they had to stay in because they had a significance <e> <s> therefore my word privately has a significance <e> <s> i am adding a word to words <e> <s> if with great respect the noble lord wants to keep the words then i want him to add this word <e> <s> he may say that it does not add very much <e> <s> all i am saying is that it adds what i think should be added <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am pressing the noble lord to add a word which has a significance to the mover of the amendment which the noble lord thinks does not add anything to the words already in the bill does he not attach any importance to the desire of someone to put it there <e> <s> it may be that this is all semantics and that we are only playing with words <e> <s> if the noble lord reads his own speech tomorrow he will if i may say so see that at the end of it what he should have said was nevertheless in the circumstances if the noble lord presses for the word to be there i will accept it but i warn him that it does not seem to me to make any difference <e> <s> if he thinks that it does who am i to stand in his way <e> <s> that is what i expected the noble lord to say <e> <s> i was waiting for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord really meant it when he talked about my forbearance <e> <s> i accept his compliment with humility <e> <s> i certainly do accept what the noble lord has said and i look forward to the result of further consideration of the matter <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer two or three observations here <e> <s> the danger in the bill as at present drafted is that it leaves open the possibility that at some stage the classification of videos might be pressed to run with certain

this point of order just one stage further <e> <s> what i am anxious to avoid is amendment no <e> <s> being put to the house and decided upon which might preclude me from putting my subsequent

disqualification then we can start the main debate at any moment <e> <s> there will be one debate but when we come to decide on which alternative the house may choose to have we would reach separate decisions on separate amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefer the version on this matter that i already have on the marshalled list because if i may say so to my noble friend his amendment requires a very long tail to it <e> <s> the conditions under which the premises shall be licensed are required to be spelled out for inclusion in the bill <e> <s> that is an intricate task as my noble friend

of parliament for years would they after having listened to this patronising lecture from my noble friend <e> <s> i am fully aware of all the problems and circumstances here <e> <s> but your lordships

official record <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to get it on the record i must formally move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am satisfied with that explanation <e> <s> it may be that in the course of my researches i came across an antiquity in an earlier act of parliament when they were more meticulous about these things <e> <s> i can quite see the difficulty of having a named constable throughout the piece especially in these days <e> <s> in any event i think this will all come out in the wash on the police and criminal evidence bill if it is of sufficient importance to raise it there <e> <s> with the leave of the house i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord nugent is extending the possibilities of the range of search far beyond what will ever be regarded as reasonable or necessary in cases like this <e> <s> i have in my possession a good deal of evidence of what is happening in the courts in different parts of the country concerning prosecutions being undertaken under the obscene publications act <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for that <e> <s> all i can say is that the range of possibilities in searches under this bill will be far wider apparently than any possible under the obscene publications act <e> <s> what will this look like in practice when raids are made on private homes shops and warehouses and documentation is sought which may give evidence of an intention to supply contrary to the bill <e> <s> really the search for firearms could not go further could it <e> <s> when cases of this kind occur there will he the most appalling row as to the effect of this bill on the rights and privacies of citizens <e> <s> this particular case in leeds contained other quite disgraceful elements <e> <s> the jury after six and a half days threw out the charges and awarded costs against the police <e> <s> but it takes a pretty good firm to be able to stand up to that kind of treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose one can only soldier on and hope that some of the aspects of this bill which have a bearing on general conditions of citizens rights in similar circumstances will be attended to <e> <s> i feel very discontented with any explanation given when i find that one trader who had tapes taken from his shop after a raid on th april although a list of them was given to him heard nothing about them afterwards <e> <s> it is now th june <e> <s> what is so vexing about these raids is that many of the spools already have classifications as films from the british board of film censors <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be brief <e> <s> this is a monstrous provision in a bill of this kind <e> <s> to relate this power to what we are dealing with is absolutely ridiculous <e> <s> i am beginning to wonder whether this bill is dealing with the most dangerous product in circulation in britain today or whether it is that the sponsors of the bill and its supporters have lost their sense of proportion <e> <s> i think it is the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i want to be satisfied about that reply <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will answer just one question <e> <s> the powers are there <e> <s> does this mean that if the powers are not exercised then forfeited material remains as it were in the air <e> <s> is there a finality to it or has there to be a positive decision on destruction <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the matter has gone as far as is possible now and i am as content as one can be in this difficult problem <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps a little more research is desirable into the pedigree of titles of bills so as to get at the truth of the matter <e> <s> i started this the other day when i asked the library if i could see the licensing act <e> <s> no one would suspect from the title of that act that it was an act for preventing the frequent abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed books and pamphlets and for the regulating of printing and printing presses <e> <s> on the basis of what the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has said i suppose that the time to bring books into the title would be if there were another licensing act to follow the act of that did something else with books <e> <s> then it would be the licensing regulation of books act <e>", "<cs> my lords so we could go on <e> <s> but i promise not to go on <e> <s> my little bit of entertainment can finish here and now <e>", "<cs> the noble earl a moment or two ago referred to the inland revenue staff federation <e> <s> he was not quite correct in the account he gave of what happened at the conference last december <e> <s> it is quite true that a survey of the members independently undertaken showed that per cent <e> <s> of the membership were in favour of a pre-strike ballot <e> <s> the noble earl said that when that proposition came before a delegate conference they threw it out <e> <s> that is not quite correct <e> <s> what the motion failed to get was the necessary two-thirds majority of the delegate conference to become effective <e> <s> that is somewhat different <e> <s> it was not thrown out in those words it just failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister is in a predicament but then so are we <e> <s> my difficulty in voting that clause stand part of the bill is that i am not sure that it is going to stand part of the bill <e> <s> so we are all in this dilemma <e> <s> some noble lords will vote for clause to stand part because they are in favour of its standing part as it is <e> <s> some noble lords will vote in favour of clause standing part without knowing what is to stand part <e> <s> i wonder how the committee can come to a sensible conclusion <e>", "<cs> i will not take more than a couple of minutes of the committees time <e> <s> i feel that for the time being at any rate

i utter a cautionary word here <e> <s> to bring companies into any kind of relationship with the trade unions in regard to contributions to party funds will not help matters in the least <e> <s> it may give a feeling of superficial fairness but i warn the committee that if shareholders were required to vote money to political parties through company meetings company donations would <e>", "<cs> my lords all i hope is that my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey arrives in time to deal with the point concerning human sexual activity <e> <s> i should not like to be left on my own with that <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been one of the features of our debates that the noble lord lord nugent and the noble lord the minister have been in complete harmony throughout while on this side my noble friend and i have been in almost constant conflict with our own front bench <e> <s> i am glad that i never deposited my conscience with the labour party it is far too precious for that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a painful experience to sit here and see men of the distinction honour and authority of the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe and the noble lord lord buxton virtually crawling to the government to sustain the prestige of the broadcasting authorities which parliament has created and through which such estimable services have been given in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be an imposition on the time of the house to pursue this matter further <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the changes that he has made <e> <s> i cannot really say that the distinction is as clear to me as to make any substantial difference of approach <e> <s> if presumably the british board of film censors are still going to be the designated authority although i would think they are probably getting a bit fed up with the idea by now then who am i to stand in the way <e> <s> i think the best thing i can do is to ask leave to withdraw the amendment and enable the noble lord to move his amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do not deny that <e> <s> but we have to keep a sense of proportion in all these matters <e> <s> we are dealing with legislation affecting the whole community <e> <s> however i take the point that the noble baroness makes <e> <s> i am not running anything in <e> <s> i am just suggesting that we take a long time to conclude that bills are obsolete or no longer of the value that they ought to be to justify their retention on the statute book <e> <s> i do not rest on that point particularly <e> <s> i am just being quite candid with the house about what is in my favour and what is not <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now spent minutes on my amendment which is before <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise a matter on clause <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will not be surprised to know that i am going to relate it to what we did recently in regard to clause of the video recordings bill which provides for powers of entry search and seizure <e> <s> it seems to me from what study i have been able to give to the matter that there are two categories of entry search and seizure <e> <s> one is the more complex difficult probe into possible fraudulent activities and so on which appears to be covered by clause <e> <s> this provides for the conditions to be satisfied in the event of reasonable grounds for believing that a serious arrestable offence has been committed <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning in quoting from the supplement to the report <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question on clause <e> <s> on page paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the new version is an improvement on the previous one <e> <s> however i note that we are now legislating very much in arrears <e> <s> the report of the farm animal welfare council upon which this bill is based was issued in and i hear that very rapid changes are taking place in the handling of birds in this particular industry that mass production is being accompanied by mass slaughter and that the mechanisation of some operations in the handling of birds has advanced a considerable stage since the farm animal welfare council conducted its own investigations several years ago <e> <s> therefore the power to make regulations here is not only comprehensive but it gives the minister an opportunity to make sure that what he is doing is up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for myself i am grateful that the government have carried out the promise that they made when the bill was going through your lordships house that before the bill became law they would introduce a plan to implement recommendation of the farm animal welfare council <e> <s> this naturally pleases the british veterinary association who have sent a note to some of us to express pleasure at seeing the several recommendations made in the commons particularly the undertaking given by the minster that local authorities will be asked to utilise suitably qualified services to have a look at the smaller places that are not suitable for licensing but where slaughter may take place sometimes the terrible things are done in the smaller rather than the larger establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords on th june i did not speak on the amendment though i voted for it <e> <s> this afternoon we are in the same position as we were in then <e> <s> your lordships house seems to be anxious to hurry to a point of registering a vote on matters which in my opinion have not yet been considered fully and which are gravely mistaken <e> <s> i fear that we are on the way to another fiasco in trade union legislation <e> <s> i voted for the amendment last time not because i thought that a postal ballot was free of difficulties in fact i emphasised them on another occasion probably earlier in the same debate but because it was the best scheme on offer which fulfilled the principles which i think we must stick to when dealing with electoral law <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e> <s> if a statutory duty is imposed on the unions is any statutory duty imposed on the members <e> <s> is there anything in this which requires or can compel a member of a union to supply his private address to his union <e> <s> does this have to be in the rules <e> <s> some members may take the view that they do not want their union to know their private address in case the pickets get hold of it <e> <s> this seems to be an extraordinary duty to impose on trade unions when there is no means of fulfilling it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question <e> <s> would the function of the certification officer extend to pronouncing upon the new clause that we have after clause which states <e>", "<cs> my lords had it not been for the conservative party we should already have had a change in the financing of political parties <e> <s> it was a conservative party in opposition that stood in the way <e> <s> the liberal party and the labour party were both committed to state aid <e> <s> michael foot in his latest book reiterates that <e> <s> i presume that the liberal/sdp alliance is in favour of changing the basis of financing our political parties <e> <s> it is the government party therefore that stands in the way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a comment <e> <s> one of the beauties of english law is the number of people who immediately devise ways and means of getting round it <e> <s> any trade union leader of any experience could write a correspondence course on how to evade the conditions of the trade union act and they will be doing the same here <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief comment <e> <s> we are all in the difficulty that the certification officer was brought into this role at a very late stage in the debates on this bill <e> <s> if we had had this important proposal before us at the committee stage we could have gone into it more freely than we were able to do on report <e> <s> but the certification officer has been dragged into this quite late in the day and it makes it very difficult to deal with all the implications of his new role <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly wish to endorse very warmly indeed the compliment which the noble lord lord rochester has just paid to the noble earl the minister <e> <s> he has been courteous <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to be the first to congratulate the noble lord on his most felicitous and interesting maiden speech <e> <s> i envy his feeling of ease and harmony with your lordships house in making his first speech <e> <s> i remember my own years ago <e> <s> although i had had years experience in another place i still trembled when i came here <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the return of my noble friend lord davies of leek <e> <s> sitting beside him during his speech i felt the vigour and the bitterness of what he had to say <e> <s> i recall that a colleague of mine in another place once said that he was converted to socialism during a long illness from which he had never fully recovered <e> <s> that cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to extend the provisions of section of the wildlife and countryside act i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw the question on the order paper by the noble lord <e> <s> lord somers i was a little doubtful whether this <e>", "<cs> yes you have <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether it will be within the terms of reference of the select committee to consider the additional hazards of accident to noble lords who may fall over the cables and other apparatus who may collide with the stages upon which the cameras are to be mounted or bump into the crew and otherwise sustain additional risk of accident <e> <s> is this a hazard which the select committee will endeavour to safeguard us against <e> <s> will it consider what financial compensations are available if unfortunately this happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than gratified that i had the good fortune to draw this place in the ballot and i am much more satisfied than i thought i would be before raising this particular issue <e> <s> i really was not sure how your lordships house would take this subject at this time of the year and i am very gratified that your lordships should give such careful attention to it <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for more than a moment <e> <s> nine times out of i follow the view expressed by the noble and learned lord lord denning and i certainly support him on this occasion <e> <s> but i really rise to recall the bill which went through another place in and which i had the honour of introducing at the request of lady summerskill <e> <s> i took that bill through all its stages in the house of commons without uttering a single word of explanation <e> <s> when the speaker said second reading <e> <s> what day <e> <s> all that i had to say was now sir <e> <s> when it went into committee i said now sir <e> <s> when it went out of committee i said now sir and when it went into third reading i said now sir <e> <s> that is how the bill was carried <e> <s> i had no idea what history i made that afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thanks the noble lord for his interesting introduction of this order <e> <s> i think that he has given to us in this house a rather fuller explanation of the order than his colleague the parliamentary under-secretary for northern ireland in another place gave to members of the house of commons <e> <s> but i suppose one must recognise that the arrangements for the government of ireland are so unsatisfactory and makeshift that one gets matters relating to northern ireland at all sorts of difficult times <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend lord john-mackie in congratulating the noble lord lord alport on his persistence <e> <s> the noble lord has two qualities persistence and independence <e> <s> both have been recognised by the party of which he was previously a member <e> <s> in fact one might say that they have been conceded to him in your lordships house not that we notice any difference from the time before but i thought he put a very formidable case indeed before us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i take all those points into consideration but there is no clear indication at the present moment that surplus production in foodstuffs in some countries is reaching the third world of starving millions <e> <s> the organisation of the worlds food supply really needs brushing up <e> <s> a fresh look needs to be taken at the organisation of the worlds food in order to see how the world is going to be fed <e> <s> there will be economic aspects attached to this there seems to be no escape from that <e> <s> that has to be so either at government level or at private level but money will enter into it either in the form of taxation or in the form of profit on production <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take up too much of the time of the house at this stage especially as i am due to speak in a subsequent debate of some importance <e> <s> however i want to say straightaway that this bill makes me very cross indeed <e> <s> i am astonished that the noble earl lord ferrers should be so complacent about some of the proposals not the provisions in the bill but the proposals in connection with the bill <e> <s> my grievance concerns the treatment of the depositors of whom i like the noble earl am one <e> <s> my membership goes back many years with my father before me we have well over years as depositors in trustee savings <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble earl for not having acknowleged that he referred to the point <e> <s> had not the noble earl lord iddesleigh referred to it i would have fastened on to what the noble earl said in that regard <e> <s> coming from the quarter it did from a member of the central board i thought that i was entitled to refer to what he had said <e>", "<cs> my lords if the television cameras were in the chamber at the present time your lordships house would offer a strange appearance to the viewers with the alliance benches packed the labour benches empty and a fairly representative attendance of noble lords on other sides of the house <e> <s> i make no claim therefore to be speaking on behalf of any of my noble friends <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon will have the unenviable task of replying on behalf of his noble friends who are not here <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which is not confined to scotland because the root of it is what assent has been sought and given for the proposals in the bill <e> <s> in particular reference to scotland my experience in government was that where a case could be made out for a separate bill not necessarily separate treatment for scotland but a separate bill for scotland the secretary of state was always anxious for all sorts of reasons to have a separate bill <e> <s> that is why we have so many acts of parliament relating to scotland which are not dissimilar to corresponding acts of parliament relating to england and wales <e> <s> i would have thought that scotland was an identifiable nationalistic part of the kingdom and its sensibility to separateness and separate identity would have required special considerations <e>", "<cs> the nub of the debate on this amendment is going to be the same as that throughout subsequent amendments <e> <s> are we going to give the depositors a better deal in this transaction or are we not <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> these amendments are all designed to seek some way of breaking the mould of the proposed transfer to shareholders throughout the country clamouring for a bargain on the stock exchange <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> it is clearly a criticism of the amendment before the committee at the present moment but it is probably not a criticism of what may follow later in trying to give the depositors a better deal on the share transaction <e> <s> we shall come to that later <e>", "<cs> i do not see in the comments of the noble earl anything different from what i said <e> <s> one cannot do what he says the government wish to do unless the ownership of this property is put beyond doubt <e> <s> it cannot become a proper bank unless it has an ownership permanently and firmly established because this property which belongs to nobody has to go to somebody <e> <s> that is where we start <e> <s> the bank is not short of money <e> <s> it is not having an issue of shares because it wants to enlarge its capital resources <e> <s> it is not issuing shares because it wants to bring the equity of the company more in line with the capital employed <e> <s> none of those reasons applies for this issue <e> <s> this issue is part of and inseparable from their conception of the transfer of ownership <e> <s> they want it to go to shareholders and for it to go to shareholders it has to be bought by shareholders <e> <s> this is the simple transaction of accomplishing that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can make what comment he likes <e> <s> as soon as he is finished i shall make what comment i like <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> is there any way of getting sir john read a little closer to this committee <e> <s> why should he be at arms length writing letters to the chancellor of the exchequer telling him what he will do when he gets hold of the company <e> <s> it seems quite unsatisfactory that we are dealing with this problem at one remove <e> <s> the government are the parliamentary agents as i said on second reading of the trustee savings banks <e> <s> although the noble earl said that this was a matter of public policy the fact is that private bills have dealt with interests as extensive as this in the past <e> <s> however this is a matter of procedure and i sometimes think that we do not always adjust our procedures to the requirements of the situation <e>", "<cs> i will leave it there for the moment <e> <s> there is plenty of time <e>", "<cs> the comments which the noble earl lord ferrers has just made are an enlightening piece of information about how the conservative mind works <e> <s> the divide here is partly political and partly ideological <e> <s> i can quite see why people make money and why the banks and everybody else who has to do with money can make money <e> <s> it is because they make no concessions <e> <s> they say have you the right <e> <s> we will honour it or have you no right <e> <s> dont come to us <e> <s> this is the line that is drawn <e>", "<cs> oh yes <e> <s> you can see it running right through the proceedings in another place and the result is slovenly legislation and inadequate debate <e> <s> otherwise this would have received far more attention in another place than it did receive <e> <s> i am considering what to do that might possibly help carry the matter a little further <e> <s> since the government take the view that it is not for them and by implication it is not for us as parliament to tell the board what to do i think i am disposed to leave the matter open until we come to the report stage so that the board can if it so wishes say a little more about what it would propose to do <e> <s> after all there is great reliance on the letter from sir john read <e> <s> whether it was written spontaneously by him or by arrangement or by agreement with the chancellor of the exchequer i do not know <e> <s> however quite obviously he felt that he had to say something that had been put to him by the treasury <e>", "<cs> in some ways we in this country appear to be stuck in a rut <e> <s> we beseech our people to have new ideas to be responsive to change and to use more imagination and go into the future <e>", "<cs> my lords after such a notable speech from my noble friend lord murray of epping forest i am sure that the house will welcome one more brief tribute to my noble friend who i am sure we all agree is a great accession to the prestige of this house <e> <s> like other noble lords i have known him for many years and i have had very close contact with his work in the trade union movement throughout his career in it <e> <s> those of us who know him realise that he is a man of great ability deep intelligence and strength of character and i am sure that we shall welcome any contribution in the future which he may feel that he can make to our troubled deliberations on this and allied subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a very satisfactory reply because as i said a moment ago since the treasury hold the reins on the change because they are in charge of the vesting day then somebody on the government side should be able to give some assurances about the considerations they will take into account in deciding on the vesting day <e> <s> in fact as i also said a moment ago the order for the vesting day has to be by means of statutory instrument and that can only be introduced by the government and the treasury are going to decide the day <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances there is no point in going on with the amendment at the moment because i do not want to divide the house on it at this particular time <e> <s> however i can say that i am not satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> i was not aware that it was going to be a pure formality that the board of the trustee savings bank would say we want the vesting day to be on a certain date and the treasury would say very well we will lay the necessary instrument <e> <s> i thought there was more behind clause than is implied by what the minister has said <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment because i will probably have something to say about this at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble earl and i need say no more except to thank him and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support this amendment <e> <s> it is possible that amendment no <e> <s> may be preferable that is a matter for consideration <e> <s> certainly there has to be some consultation with those who represent the consumers <e> <s> one reads in the explanatory and financial memorandum that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did promise that i would not do it again <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises the question of what are the rights of the conscientious objector <e> <s> there is room for a little private enterprise which will recommend itself to noble lords opposite and that is that there should be an encouragement to private enterprise to put fluoride extractors on to the market at a reasonable cost so that they can be installed by the householder and that will enable him to get rid of the fluoride <e>", "<cs> i think there is a simple point that might be put to the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> that is that it is one thing to have a water supply which probably from time immemorial or at any rate for a great length of time has been of certain composition and in respect of which the residents and different sections of the community have become inured against harm <e> <s> if you bring other water supplies suddenly as from midnight from the very next week up to some very different standard of composition that may have an effect on the consumer which is quite different from that as concerns people who have been on that kind of composition before merely because of the suddenness of the change <e> <s> there is surely some laymans point about that <e> <s> therefore it may be that just to say that other people are drinking water with this fluoride content and have not come to any harm so therefore it will not harm you if you bring yours up to the same level or even let it go a little above may not really be a tenable argument <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i think that this is quite fundamental <e> <s> are the consumers of this fluoridated water to have any say in whether or not they have it imposed upon them <e> <s> if we regard the citizen as having some right to decide what shall be done for him and to him where he is individually concerned it is not a social matter it is an individual matter then i think we have to review our approach to the democratic process <e>", "<cs> i want to make two or three very short points <e> <s> the simple issue is that if water is to be treated or added to in any way where is the authority to do so to come from <e> <s> under statutory powers no health authority has the power to do anything about health which is comparable with doctoring the water of the community nothing <e> <s> it may be concerned with hospitals social services and the rest but this is water <e> <s> this is forced upon every member of the community <e> <s> i ask where is the authority to do that to come from <e>", "<cs> the only function of the local authority is to act as the electoral body in these circumstances <e> <s> so the local authority has no power to stop anything or to agree to anything when the poll can test the issue finally on behalf of the people as a whole <e> <s> noble lords opposite are either democrats or they are on the side of the bureaucrats and the indirectly elected authorities <e> <s> they have certain powers but some powers they should not have nor should they be given them <e> <s> i think that this is quite fundamental and that we should fight it all along the line <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is very well-equipped with information and he is making very skilful use of it <e> <s> does he have any evidence at all of experiments using fluoride on animals <e> <s> under the ld test have animals been pumped full of fluoride in order to see how much they can take before they die <e> <s> any information on that subject would be very welcome <e>", "<cs> the minister should use this amendment as a basis for sales promotion <e> <s> the government do not for a moment want to admit that anybody can suffer any harm from the fluoridation of water <e> <s> they have resisted many amendments on the basis that there is no such evidence <e> <s> they say that there is no evidence of anything harmful in this <e> <s> all right why not use it in a boastful spirit and say not only will it do no harm but if it does you can have your money back <e> <s> it is a conventional sales promotion <e> <s> the boastful firm always offers to return the money without question if you are dissatisfied <e> <s> here is an opportunity for the government to challenge the dissatisfied customer to say that he has pimples on his stomach as a result of fluoridation and to claim compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that welfare codes relating to calves kept in intensive rearing conditions have been seriously undermined by the failure to get a conviction in the recent storrington case where a religious order have a large veal calf unit and have admitted persistent disregard of the conditions of the welfare code <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl take steps to repair his unawareness of the case which i cited <e>", "<cs> on a point of order when the deputy chairman says that any noble lord <e>", "<cs> i beg the deputy chairmans pardon i had not realised that one could speak as many times as one liked at the committee stage <e> <s> i may have spoken more than once on occasions but i was unaware that one could speak a lot of times <e>", "<cs> it is an extraordinary commentary on this bill that a substance which is to be put into the nations drinking water should fall within the provisions of the dangerous substances legislation and have to be labelled poisonous <e> <s> does the noble earl know of any other substance that has to be labelled poisonous and which is poured into the nations drinking water or is this the only one <e> <s> a gentleman arriving from mars would wonder what sort of crazy business all this is that the nations drinking water has to be doctored with a substance which in more intensive conditions is poison and has to be labelled as poisonous to safeguard the health of those who have to handle it <e> <s> i find the whole thing so extraordinary that i wonder whether any government in their senses should be forcing this on the public <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness may find she can deal with this matter more

very well discuss amendment no <e> <s> because it has not been moved <e> <s> we cannot very well discuss the revised version the correct version of the noble baronesss speech earlier on because we do not have it before us so we really have to take this amendment as a basis for a fairly wide consideration of the subject of consultation <e>", "<cs> i apologise for being absent from the chamber for a little while but i was called out by the daughter of the late admiral lord keyes who has handed to me a file of her experiences of arthritic fluorosis <e> <s> i am bound to say from a preliminary glance at what can happen to people who have an unfavourable reaction to fluoridated water that i shall have to refer to this at a later stage in the proceedings <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> the noble baroness explained that the purpose of this amendment was to cover the health authorities where fluoridation is already in operation <e> <s> i can well understand that they want to be legitimised at the earliest possible moment and this amendment would do that <e> <s> i do not think we want health authorities to be in serious jeopardy for any length of time <e> <s> they may have been acting illegally up to now <e> <s> they are probably lucky to be at large <e> <s> but we will forgive them because they did not know what they were doing when they did it and the law does not really legitimise what they have done now that they have done it <e> <s> but is it necesary to cover future schemes in this way <e>", "<cs> but with great respect and affection the noble baroness is in error surely <e> <s> the bill as printed states in clause <e>", "<cs> to make applications and to advertise and all the rest <e> <s> but why was this delay of two months put in the bill <e> <s> why did she want to delay the starting pistol for two months for new schemes in the bill as it stands whereas now she tells me when i want to keep it in for future schemes that it is all nonsense <e> <s> there is either a misunderstanding or there is some lack of appreciation of what the point is <e> <s> probably the noble earl might have a go <e>", "<cs> on a point of order which amendment are we talking about <e> <s> i addressed myself to amendment no <e> <s> and that is the one which i thought was before the committee at this stage <e> <s> we drifted on to europe in anticipation of the next amendment which has not yet been moved <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i misunderstood the mission that she was on at that particular moment but it is a second or two since she said that there was no reason at all why there should be any delay in the effective date of this bill when it became an act of parliament <e> <s> all i can say on that is that it was in the bill it is in the bill and it is now proposed to take it out <e> <s> very well then the noble baroness ought to get up and say it was in the bill we have changed our minds we have made a mistake and we propose to take it out <e>", "<cs> if i may say so with great respect to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes she is sometimes more ministerial than the minister <e> <s> she rises effectively to put a kind of three-line whip under the observations of the minister to emphasise their importance and their conclusiveness <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness still has to justify wanting to take out of the bill something that was put in in relation to new schemes <e> <s> the point about continuation would be met if her amendment were to exclude from clause those schemes that are dealt with under the amendment that she moved amendment no <e> <s> which refers specifically to continuation schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords from where i have been sitting an observer might have been forgiven for thinking that these proceedings were the building societies association at prayer because i see so many building society people around <e> <s> i am one myself <e> <s> the noble earl who asked the question is the chairman of a building society of which i am a member <e> <s> i will not mention its name in case i am accused of parading a commercial <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk was chairman of the building societies association for years and a very trying period of office he had <e> <s> the noble lord who has just left i noticed was also a director of a building society <e> <s> that probably increases the respect that we are going to have for the subject under discussion though i am bound to say that although i have been a member of a building society all my life i have never prayed for one and i have mostly been a dissenter because there are things to disagree with in the building society <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness who introduced the bill was speaking i reflected on the awful things that can happen to an intelligent back-bencher when the system promotes a member of this house to be a minister <e> <s> i am sure that while underlining the congratulations that are certainly her due we all feel great sympathy for the noble baroness for having to introduce a bad bill which she has done efficiently and agreeably <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the noble lords experience but if one may be permitted to draw on ones own experience i am bound to say that the only time i received corporal punishment at school it was not for misbehaviour of any kind but for what was alleged to be lack of effort <e> <s> to say that i knew what i was being punished for and that i well knew the rules would be entirely wrong i did not know that rule anyway <e> <s> i was not conscious of having done anything wrong <e> <s> that injustice has stuck in my mind for years <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> i beg to support the noble lord lord chelwood <e> <s> i think that he has presented his case concisely and with admirable clarity <e> <s> i firmly believe that if we had had proportional representation as the method of election of the metropolitan county councils and the greater london council we should not be discussing this bill at the present time <e> <s> i am absolutely certain in my own mind that the political inspiration behind the abolition of these councils is the way in which at least one of them has been behaving and we should not have heard about this as an urgent political and parliamentary priority had we not had the eccentricities of the leadership of the greater london council publicised so widely and for so long <e>", "<cs> surely the reply to the noble lords point is that this body is distinctive <e> <s> there is no other electoral body like it under our system <e> <s> that is why an innovation could be tried in this instance without all the implications that the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> it was in my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will agree that the noble lord lord rochester introduced this debate in a spirit of objective analysis of the very complicated problem <e> <s> i listened to my noble friend lord murray of epping forest as we all did to see what his approach to this matter would be <e> <s> i am sure that we all recognised the reproaches contained in his speech against the way in which the government introduced trade union legislation last year and in earlier instalments <e> <s> we had a good deal to say about that at the time we deplored the lack of consultation and probably regretted the disinclination of the trade unions to enter into consultation <e> <s> both sides were probably reluctant in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pushed for time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not saying for a moment that the strike does not become legal although i am not sure that i could pronounce on the legality of some of the strikes <e> <s> all i am saying is that the result of a ballot may determine whether or not there is a strike <e> <s> if that is so then the ballot should in the public interest be seen to be fair and efficient <e> <s> my final word is this trade unions will never be privatised they will always be publicised <e> <s> i think they should bear that in mind in what they do in relation to their obligations to the public as well as to their own members <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to endorse the words of congratulation that have come from several parts of your lordships house to dr clark in another place for his courage skill and perseverance in sponsoring and conducting this bill through all its hazards in another place <e> <s> he was perhaps too bold to believe that his original bill with its wide scope for controversial issues would be a suitable one for introduction under the private members bill procedure but i am myself delighted that he took a chance <e> <s> it nearly came to grief but i think we can all feel satisfied that the bill as it has arrived in your lordships house is worth going on with <e> <s> we should safeguard its prospects of being passed into law <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already explained the circumstances in which i now beg leave to withdraw the wildlife and countryside act amendment bill <e>", "<cs> this bill is concerned with what we do about a decision of the european commission of human rights <e> <s> this is the only reason we have this bill at the present time <e> <s> a judgment of the commission of human rights has required us to decide the extent to which we will implement the decision of the european court <e> <s> there are three ways of doing that <e> <s> one way is to carry out the full implication of the decision of the commission and abolish corporal punishment altogether <e> <s> a second way is to accept the judgment of the commission so far as it goes but comply with it to the minimal extent <e> <s> a third way would be to comply with the decision of the european commission to the maximum extent short of complete abolition <e> <s> the government have decided on the minimal compliance with the judgment of the commission <e> <s> as i said they accept it as far as they want it to go but they do not believe in it <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee more than a few moments but there is one matter that arises on clause which i think is in need of further consideration though probably at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> so long as we retain corporal punishment even under the terms of the bill we are likely to be at variance with the code of conduct set out in the european convention on human rights and corporal punishment <e> <s> i refer to the troublesome question of article which says <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give my noble friend a rest just for a moment <e> <s> the noble lord just now said that it was necessary to put scotland in this bill in order to comply with the judgment of the european court of human rights in respect of the per cent <e> <s> of the scottish children still subject to corporal punishment <e> <s> but the judgment of the court of human rights does not require this form of compliance at all <e> <s> what it said was that corporal punishment should not be retained at all and the compliance that the minister is talking about is not a compliance with the judgment of the court <e> <s> it is merely to bring it into line with what the government wish to do to meet the judgment of the court which is an entirely different matter <e>", "<cs> may i raise a point of order <e> <s> it is now a quarter to eight and it is customary on a tuesday evening when the supper is being served to have a break for supper <e> <s> it seems to me that we are tending to get into the bad habits of another place which long ceased to have a break for a evening meal and plodded on and did the work <e> <s> i do not mind plodding on and doing the work but i think that if that is so then better arrangements will have to be made for refreshments after we have completed the committee stage of this bill and we should not be told that the service of refreshments ceases at twenty minutes past eight <e> <s> i think therefore that if the noble lord the chief whip or his representative thinks that the committee can keep going during the supper break then some more civilised arrangements should be made for us to be fed when we have finished the committee stage <e> <s> some of us have to go a long way on the water flouridation bill to follow and i do not think it is fair that we should go on and on just to meet the convenience of the benches opposite <e> <s> i therefore hope that we can now have a break of one hour to get some refreshment and come back to finish the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole idea of enforcing a prescriptive medicine on the consumers of water is wrong in principle and i think it is quite monstrous that people should have this imposed upon them for the satisfaction of a minority interest a minority health interest throughout the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no confidence in continuous reviews <e> <s> i know from my own experience how that phrase is misused to hide an intention to do damn all <e> <s> i believe that some term should be set for the implementation of an application when it is made by a health authority <e> <s> only if that is done will they monitor the working of the scheme carefully and get away from the unrecorded propaganda on this process in the way which may be needed to keep a check on its efficacy or its possible <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in this motion of a dilatory or obstructive nature <e>", "<cs> do i have to say it again <e> <s> i am relying on standing order no <e> <s> which was made on th march an event which not even the noble lord lord shinwell can remember <e> <s> it begins <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl allow me to rise on a point of order <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a procedural matter <e> <s> where is the authority on the front bench opposite to deal with the proceedings of the house at this moment <e> <s> that is what i want to know <e> <s> this is not a departmental matter it is not a matter relating to a particular department <e> <s> it is a matter relating to the procedures of the house and we ought to have on the front bench opposite either the chief whip or his deputy so that we know who we are dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not be put to the vote for a moment or two <e> <s> i am sorry but if noble lords on the front bench opposite are so unskilled in the art of parliamentary activity and understanding it is their fault and not mine <e> <s> there is less understanding of the oppositions position being shown in this matter than i was accustomed to over many years in another place <e> <s> after all oppositions are regarded as having some claim upon the consideration of the government of the day and upon the time of the house more particularly on the time of the house <e> <s> a certain amount of time is customarily allotted to opposition members or parties <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord trying to assist me or is he not <e> <s> i am sorry then i cannot give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i cannot give way <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i cannot give way my lords <e>", "<cs> no no no no my lords <e> <s> i resume what i was saying <e> <s> this would have given only a little more licence in the course of debate to deal with these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for the noble lord on the woolsack to decide whether the question shall be put <e> <s> if i may say so it is not a matter for the noble earl <e> <s> i shall continue speaking unless the noble lord on the woolsack intervenes to say that i must resume my seat because he proposes to put a motion to the house <e> <s> if he does that obviously i shall obey his ruling but in the meantime i ask the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot help what the house may want <e> <s> the house is doing nothing to help me and i do not propose to do anything to help the house <e> <s> i am advised that the thing to do in order to quieten the restiveness of the noble lords opposite is to get on with the motion and let us proceed from there <e> <s> however i was about to say that we have still to get through the amendments whether in committee or on report <e> <s> the house can have it whichever way it likes <e> <s> however noble lords opposite must not expect any accommodation from this side of the house on getting things through more quickly their way than they would have done our way <e> <s> they certainly would have gone through them quickly enough our way <e> <s> the noble baroness would have been on her feet long ago moving her amendment no <e> <s> and we should now have been well into the debate on that amendment <e> <s> but they are so stubborn about this <e> <s> they do not understand the workings of parliament and the feelings of opposition especially on an issue of this kind <e> <s> thus all i can say is that i move my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with noble lords who have already spoken that we must get a little more democracy into this bill <e> <s> i join other noble lords in congratulating the noble baroness on having succeeded in getting rather more than there was <e> <s> i must say however that it is an indication of the state of the government if the noble baroness had to fight with them to get more democracy into this bill which the opposition in another place failed to get <e> <s> it shows that at times your lordships perhaps carry rather more weight with the government than the opposition in another place because we are the only chamber in which the government can be defeated <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall beg leave to withdraw my amendment and i shall consider <e>", "<cs> my lords did i get a reply or just a comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have heard perfectly all that the noble baroness said but in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take one moment to express satisfaction that the committee is leaving unamended clause of the bill <e> <s> it took us a long time to get where we are and there has been general satisfaction at the fact that a way was found of overcoming the difficulties that arose when the bill was in another place <e> <s> i have no more to say and i shall not delay the bill <e> <s> once again i thank all those concerned for bringing about this compromise which i hope will be the foundation of the tighter application of the law against breaches of the original act <e>", "<cs> i shall not keep the committee more than a minute or two <e> <s> the importance of this amendment really lies in the fact that it is on the marshalled list at all <e> <s> as my noble friend lady white said a few moments ago a dozen or years ago one would not have seen an amendment of this kind on the marshalled list <e> <s> this is a sign of changing opinion of greater awareness of our environment and our anxiety about what is happening to it <e> <s> probably it is a sign of greater anxiety of what may happen to it with the increasing pressures of growing population <e> <s> indeed if the country makes a substantial economic recovery then there will be more pressures on the environment for recreation holidays and all the other purposes for which land is required for the expansion of society and the amenities that it desires <e>", "<cs> that is splendid <e> <s> of course he was not <e> <s> i agree <e> <s> my memory is at fault in that regard <e> <s> he is a lawyer a solicitor i understand <e> <s> perhaps he was not there long enough to make a firm enough impact as a non-farmer <e> <s> i do not want to be taken too seriously <e> <s> but there is a serious note and the response of the minister will be of some importance <e> <s> as there has been insistence on this matter in both houses it would be a great comfort to have in words of the noble lords own choosing if he likes an assurance that this is the policy of the government and that all that the amendment contains and implies will be taken fully on board by the government in their future exercise of responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my words of appreciation and congratulation to our four maiden speakers this afternoon <e> <s> in the week before wimbledon one might describe this afternoon as a unique and absorbing display of mixed doubles <e> <s> i am not sure whose side they were all on but the noble baroness lady warnock had limited political choice of a partner although she would have been able to choose between a lawyer and a banker <e> <s> however we have heard four new voices in your lordships house <e> <s> we hope to hear all of them again well informed and experienced as they are <e>", "<cs> i want to address myself to amendment no <e> <s> although i too am very impressed indeed by the arguments used by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> perhaps noble lords will allow me to say that the moralists in another place always tend to run away with themselves <e> <s> i believe that it is the duty of this committee to put a restraining hand on the moral fervour of members of another place <e> <s> certainly this bill is to deal with a nuisance <e> <s> i was very much in favour of the remark made by the noble and learned lord lord denning that the bill is to deal with a nuisance not to deal with morals <e> <s> therefore we must ensure that the bill deals with a nuisance <e>", "<cs> may i just make one further observation <e> <s> i noticed the words used by the noble lord the minister although i am not sure whether i have the words correctly that kerb crawling <e>", "<cs> i shall give your lordships committee the words of the noble lord and we will see whether i have reason for anxiety <e> <s> he may have been using shorthand terms but he mentioned kerb crawling <e> <s> kerb crawling by itself is not an offence <e> <s> kerb crawling is done for a purpose <e> <s> i do not think one should ever use the words kerb crawling as though that action of itself were an offence <e>", "<cs> more than once i have drawn attention to the fact that private members bills are legislation by lottery <e> <s> they depend wholly or almost wholly on successfully emerging from a ballot in another place <e> <s> this bill is a case in point <e> <s> it was taken up by a member of the house of commons on his name coming out of the ballot <e>", "<cs> yes if the noble lord will be patient for only seconds more he will see the point that i am getting at <e> <s> i feel that noble lords <e>", "<cs> i did not say that it was immoral i said that it was monstrous <e>", "<cs> accepting what the noble lord has said the government notwithstanding allowed this important clause which was to implement the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee to be at the hazard of a private members bill <e> <s> when the private members bill now before us came temporarily to grief in another place the government were not prepared to give extra time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to detain the house for only a moment or two on this motion <e> <s> this is a private members bill which arrived here on a very choppy sea <e> <s> i hope that anyone who is now making a study of the private members bill procedure will have a look at how this bill came here and at the drawbacks and hazards that it overcame <e> <s> it is fortuitous that clause is in this bill <e> <s> at an earlier stage i expressed an appreciation of this provision being here and i am grateful to all those who used their endeavours to insert it and keep it in the bill <e> <s> however i want to underline the appeal that i made at that earlier stage of the bill to the hunting fraternity and to the british field sports society <e>", "<cs> we appear to be increasing piecemeal the number of offences that will be subject to a life sentence <e> <s> later this afternoon we shall be considering a clause in the sexual offences bill which has nothing whatever to do with the main purpose of that bill which is to legislate against kerb crawling but it appears in the bill because the government are seeking a suitable vehicle for implementing a recommendation of the law revision commission <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be tiresome and i shall not detain the committee for more than a moment <e> <s> what my noble friend has just said emphasises the point i made earlier about tackling this serious matter piecemeal <e> <s> here we have a little bill dealing with substantially one matter to increase a penalty for a certain type of very grave offence <e> <s> later on we shall have a clause in another bill to do the same thing <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend permit me <e> <s> perhaps i may respectfully say to him that after paying him a compliment i do not expect to have to listen to a lecture from him <e>", "<cs> my lords we see how difficult it is to legislate for a real and as we believe it to be definable mischief <e> <s> the more time we spend on this bill the more difficulties we shall run into as i understand it and i have been seeking to get as much information as possible the real problem here is the prostitute <e> <s> if there were not prostitutes for gathering in certain places there would be no kerb crawlers <e> <s> kerb crawlers do not just go along the kerb on the off-chance of picking up somebody without knowing whether or not it is a happy hunting ground <e> <s> if they did that they would kerb crawl for miles in order to find the weak spot <e> <s> if you can get rid of the prostitutes you get rid of kerb crawling because on the whole they want to find somebody who is willing to do business <e> <s> they do not want to accost people who are going to spit at them or rebuff them in a less objectionable form they want to find somebody quickly and be off <e> <s> after all they are in that state of mind <e> <s> they do not want to shilly-shally and hang around <e> <s> they want to find a woman <e> <s> i do not know why we are in such difficulties about it it is prostitution <e> <s> my advice is that if you can stop soliciting for prostitution you will get rid of kerb crawling as far as it can be got rid of at all <e>", "<cs> my lords they are probably shorthand in both cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this new clause contained in amendment no <e> <s> is an absolute shocker <e> <s> i really wonder how it got here <e> <s> what is the noble lord lord monson doing with his name attached to the latter part of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise but we are on the most serious point <e> <s> i ask the minister whether he did not realise that in taking the decision we did in committee we decided that on a single occasion the soliciting of a woman did not and could not of itself constitute a criminal offence <e> <s> we said that only if it is persistently done that the citizen was entitled to ask for the protection of the criminal law <e> <s> the minister is now introducing a single incident of annoyance as the basis for a charge and conviction under this bill is he not <e> <s> he is altering the whole sense of the bill as we left it in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether it is a unique occasion but i would remind your lordships that this afternoon we are being asked to impose the maxim um punishment of life imprisonment for crimes which previously have not carried such severity <e> <s> we are asked to do this twice in one afternoon to create in one afternoon two new crimes incurring life imprisonment <e> <s> i doubt whether parliament has ever done that before in all its history <e> <s> i should have thought that one was enough to be going on with and we have already done that earlier this afternoon <e> <s> now we are asked to do so a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of what we were discussing i accept what the <e>", "<cs> first i ought to remark that this is the only amendment which has been tabled on the marshalled list by the noble and learned lord lord denning of which we have had prior notice <e> <s> all the rest of the amendments are new and i am seeing them for the first time <e> <s> we evidently do some of our business in great haste and we can hardly get here <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask a question on this point <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning is usually so kind in his speeches to your lordships as to explain from his vast knowledge and experience what his amendments mean <e> <s> i am almost at his footstool on occasions when he is explaining the law <e> <s> what are the consequences of the noble and learned lords amendment <e> <s> i have a feeling that he is stepping outside the intentions and framework of the bill <e> <s> i may be wrong <e> <s> on this occasion for once how rare it is the noble earl the minister is going to be right on this bill throughout the piece <e> <s> he knows what the bill is intended to do <e> <s> he does not want it to do any more and he does not want it to do any less <e> <s> he knows that he has a flank behind him on the other benches opposite and behind me who would wish to push him <e> <s> they are nudging him to push him a little further than the scope of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble and learned lord was providing by amendment no <e> <s> for the carrying of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thought he was clearing the decks to enable his amendment no <e> <s> to be the governing clause in clause <e> <s> but on a closer look at it it seems that having failed by withdrawing amendment no <e> <s> he still feels that he wants to remove the surrogate mother from the provisions of subsection <e> <s> it is very confusing and difficult to follow as to what the combination of the amendments really amount to <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the desire of the noble lord that what has to be done shall be done without undue delay <e> <s> this is a very important matter and there is a great deal of legitimate public interest quite apart from the blown-up emotions that can be created on a matter of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if we get all the speeches over now we might be able to get more quickly through the rest of the business <e> <s> the first observation i wish to make is one of sympathy with the noble baroness who has taken on this thankless task <e> <s> this was a bad bill when it came here and she ought to have known it <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> i think that it is a reasonable request <e> <s> i think that there is a steady flow of opinion that fluoridation is government policy and is being foisted on the people by the methods of the bill <e> <s> that may be a mistaken view and it may also be wrong to think that if the health authority decides to make an application the water authority will necessarily comply with it <e> <s> the word may is to be found in clause the <e>", "<cs> my lords what this bill does is to say to the people we think that fluoridation of your water is so good for you that we dare not entrust the final decision whether or not to have it to you <e> <s> we must listen to what you say but we need only have such regard as we consider appropriate to what you say before reaching a decision but we are not bound to take any notice of what you say <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment is the final test of the democratic principle in this bill and indeed in what we are doing not only in this bill but probably in other directions as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will accept this amendment <e> <s> she really cannot be so impudent if i may put it like that <e>", "<cs> as to reject a simple plea like this <e> <s> as i said earlier the words used in the bill are contemptuous they are worse than wishy-washy they are really insulting <e> <s> i think they should be replaced <e> <s> i would have been willing to concede the phrase due regard but regard is not very much more than due regard <e> <s> we have been playing with words on a number of bills in recent days <e> <s> we have had the word persistently and now we have regard <e> <s> i hope quite seriously that the noble baroness will do what we ask <e> <s> then she will go out in a blaze of glory with the milk of human kindness to follow in amendment no <e> <s> and we shall finish the bill in a good mood <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the noble baroness does not have in her hand a brief which says that this amendment will presumably be rejected <e> <s> that is usually what is in the brief of ministers when they come to the committee and report stages of bills <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in the bill i have just come to terms with reality <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the same old sorry story to the end is it not <e> <s> it is very disappointing <e> <s> it is almost disheartening <e> <s> i do not think that i should like to be a minister again if this is how they have to go through life <e> <s> what satisfaction do they get out of it <e> <s> they do not please anyone <e> <s> the public do not think any better of them <e> <s> one wonders why they are there <e> <s> i am sure that before very long we shall have some technology that can give us all these ministerial replies in rooms upstairs and we can choose which one we go into <e> <s> there will be no need to sit here to hear the same old reply given to all suggestions for improvement <e> <s> i have not suggested for a single moment that this scheme for milk is a complete alternative to the fluoridation of water <e> <s> i am advised from what i have read that it is not desirable to have both <e> <s> if children are having fluoridated water there is no need for them to have fluoridated milk <e> <s> in fact it might be harmful if they were taking above the approved dose <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is becoming more terse every time <e> <s> i can understand how weary she must be <e> <s> so are we <e> <s> at least she has what little satisfaction there is in being a kind of inverted micawber waiting for something to turn down but she cannot treat my noble friend lord monson as brusquely as that <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the boldness of the prime minister and the sense of purpose and determination of her majestys government and having listened to all the arguments right from the beginning of this bill i should not have been a bit surprised if the government had said fluoridation is good for you and you are jolly well going to have it <e>", "<cs> my lords they could then have said we shall pass a bill which if necessary will go through all its stages in one day in both houses in order to make sure that your health is safe with us <e>", "<cs> my lords they did not they just played about with it all the time without tackling the fundamental issue <e> <s> with regard to those ministers who gave pledges and who voted with the government apparently there was a free vote for everyone in another place but the payroll vote was conscripted <e> <s> it is the conscripted payroll voters who are now being called to account by constituents who say you promised us otherwise <e> <s> how do you account for what you have done <e> <s> in the replies that i have seen and i have seen one or two they say that it is government policy and that as a member of the government they have to follow it <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook not to speak on the remainder of third reading and i have kept to that but we can spare just a minute or two to consider the extraordinary position in which this house has been put and the way in which the co-operation of strong opponents of parts of the bill has been given to ensure that the bill shall have a passage to another place <e> <s> i am not labouring the subject but the sponsors of the bill should recognise that a good deal of forbearance indeed more than a good deal has been exercised by those of us who hold very strong views about some parts of this bill <e> <s> i hope that that has been noted and will be noted elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has probably listened a great deal more than he has spoken during our debates but he has just made up for it in a most impressive way <e> <s> we all listened enchanted by the catalogue of medical achievement and argument in favour of this bill <e> <s> it sounded very much like what the doctor ordered but we are used to that from doctors <e> <s> even my noble friend lord winstanley sounds like a doctor occasionally <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say just one word to the noble viscount the leader of the house whom i see in his place <e> <s> he must be feeling that this has been a very long day and that he has taken enough thank you very much <e> <s> i offer just one humble word of advice that i think we are moving into a different regime in this house <e> <s> we have become more important and more publicised and there is a desire to become more powerful and to take a more definite place in the combined activities of the two houses of parliament <e> <s> i think that what we are suffering from is the inability of our present arrangements occasionally to respond as i think is needed to the mood of this house <e> <s> that is due to the fact that the government front bench in this house comprises people of great ability who are gaining in experience but who do not have the authority to do what a minister in their place would very frequently feel bound to do or at least feel that it was desirable to do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express with great respect to the noble viscount my appreciation of the change in the terms of the order before the house today <e> <s> i must say that the original proposal caused a great deal of perturbation among members of your lordships house because it is surely only under the pressure of an emergency even amounting to a national crisis that either house of parliament should suspend the rights of debate in order to allow rush legislation to reach the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i am very grateful to the noble earl for the <e>", "<cs> my lords during the course of this bill it has been necessary for the noble earl the minister with my unusual support to emphasise that the bill outlaws commercial surrogacy and does not deal with the principle of the matter <e> <s> it is a narrow bill to deal with a problem which if left uncurbed might extend rapidly and create a great deal of public disquiet and objection <e>", "<cs> my lords what is wrong with three is that it is not a large enough number <e> <s> three does not give the scope for the representation of interests or outlooks <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble earl lord halsbury knows enough about committee life to realise that some committees are regarded as too small as some are regarded as too large for the discharge of their particular tasks <e> <s> all that i am saying is this <e> <s> show me where in the whole outfit of the board the consultative council and the appeals committee the authentic voice of the working class and the general run of homes in britain is to be heard <e> <s> certainly it is not on any of these committees or boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the best service i can do for the house at this hour is to keep my concluding remarks as brief as possible <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate whether or not i agreed with what they said <e> <s> it was probably unavoidable that i and others should rehearse some of the arguments that we used in the course of the passage of the bill <e> <s> it is difficult to confine oneself wholly to the administration and the nitty-gritty of the scheme when there is this emotional background on both sides <e> <s> all i will say to the noble lord lord nugent and others who have been a little concerned at my working-class overtones if i may put it that way is that we are a democracy and democracy involves participation <e> <s> that is all i am pleading for <e> <s> i know it is only classification although there are marginal qualifications to that <e> <s> after all part of classification is to exclude things from classification altogether and expose them to the rigours of the criminal law <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move that the revised proposals for designation of persons as authority to determine the suitability of video works for classification laid before the house on th june should not be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish for a few minutes to deal with some of the matters which are in the bill itself <e> <s> i know that there is a certain freedom and a strong temptation to regard a debate on the finance bill as an occasion to study our economic and fiscal policies <e> <s> however when there are important matters in the bill itself which should concern your lordships house then someone ought to say what those matters are <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very late in the day to stage a major disagreement with another place <e> <s> i have no doubt that earlier when this amendment was before your lordships house i supported it <e> <s> i supported it because at that time not only this amendment but others of importance were being put as an expression of the opinion of your lordships house on matters that needed more thought and attention <e> <s> i was under the impression that after having passed several amendments and the board and the government having had an opportunity to consider the matter further a lot of water has gone under the bridge <e> <s> i was under the impression that some kind of tolerable understanding had been reached between those who were sponsoring this and other amendments and representatives of the treasury and the bank <e> <s> i was not involved in any of those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether within the knowledge of the noble lord the trustee savings bank has made any announcement that it is going on regardless which gives rise to the press report that that is just what they intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i thoroughly enjoyed the three maiden speeches that we listened to earlier in the day <e> <s> it was fascinating to see how when members of another place come to this house they are converted from politicians into statesmen <e> <s> that is a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i count it a special honour to be asked to follow the minister the noble lord lord glenarthur in moving the second reading of this bill <e> <s> your lordships will have noticed <e>", "<cs> i notice that the word procedure is mentioned in this amendment and i wish to raise a matter of procedure <e> <s> my noble friend has been very inconsiderate to the committee in putting down amendments yesterday for the committee stage today <e> <s> those of us who have been following this bill closely and wanted to devote ourselves to it throughly were at a disadvantage today in not finding these amendments until we saw the marshalled list at lunch time <e> <s> that is not good enough <e> <s> i know we work without rules here but we shall soon have to have some <e> <s> otherwise i think we shall have an imposition on the patience of the members of the committee <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words on this <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur kindly <e>", "<cs> i want to echo what was said a few moments ago by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> yes but i thought that that was too much to ask the committee to swallow at once and it is possible to separate this item from the others <e> <s> with the permission of the committee if it will agree to this small change of person or persons the main issue can come later in its proper place <e>", "<cs> this just shows the problems of the statute law when you try to spell out what reasonable people should do prompted by their own common sense in a certain situation <e> <s> it is impossible to provide for every eventuality but let me say that the duty rests upon the personal licensee to take care of the animals that he is using which are within his project licence and within the scope of his responsibilities <e> <s> that is his duty <e> <s> if the day-to-day care officer and the veterinary surgeon either or both of them are of the opinion that an animal in the care of a personal licensee is in need of urgent attention and that something should be done to relieve its agony or that it should be destroyed they first get the personal licensee <e>", "<cs> as i understand the position the words health and welfare are of wide application not only in an emergency but in general <e> <s> there may be some lack of care over a whole collection of animals in a particular establishment or animals in a certain section of an establishment <e> <s> so it is a responsibility that has to be exercised in the broadest sense <e>", "<cs> i have already dealt with the eternal difficulties about may and shall <e> <s> mostly may means shall <e> <s> mostly shall means that there are exceptions to be found to make sense of it <e> <s> that i fear is the position here <e> <s> if shall is inserted it may lead to needless bureaucracy and to avoidable friction <e> <s> we have to realise that personal relationships will be involved in laboratories where animals are being used and feelings may rise a little between one person and another as to the treatment being given to particular animals <e> <s> i feel that the wording of my amendment is right <e> <s> it is the clear duty of a responsible officer named nominated and given the statutory position he would occupy as day-to-day care officer and the veterinary surgeon similarly to decide quite fearlessly when he should report a matter to the inspector and he does not need the statutory direction to do so <e> <s> the fact that he may do it and may be expected to do it in certain circumstances would be enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot see that to introduce this new form of institutional surveyors of the administration of the act is going to serve any useful purpose <e> <s> the new thing suggested in this amendment is to bring in two independent assessors <e> <s> where are they to come from <e> <s> find me two independent assessors in this field <e> <s> we will soon have to have a panel of independent assessors <e> <s> i think that having got in place the animal procedures committee which is going to be the substantive body for reference by the secretary of state we ought to leave it to work these things out in its relationship with the secretary of state <e> <s> i think it can be done in that way otherwise we are complicating our machinery and we are doing some of the things all the time as a matter of fact which the general framework of the bill was intended to avoid <e> <s> having given the secretary of state a good deal of discretion and having imposed upon him a good deal of authority and an awful lot of responsibility we then seek to limit his discretion or to define its boundaries and thus complicate the bill with clauses which are meaningless in statute law form <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am astonished at the turn of events <e> <s> it is evident that the noble lord lord adrian has spiked everybodys guns <e> <s> i want to tell the noble lord lord glenarthur that in no way is his amendment acceptable to those of us who were part of the collaboration on this consensus bill <e> <s> the minister is fully aware of that <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur has not said a single word about the history of this matter <e> <s> anybody would think that it had just come up that the debate during the committee stage was the beginning of something and that he had promised to give further thought to it and led the noble lord lord adrian to repeat his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a good bill <e> <s> i have not the slightest doubt about that and i wish to congratulate all those noble lords who have contributed to bringing this bill forward after many years of consideration and consultation <e> <s> this bill comes as close as could be to being a consensus <e> <s> it represents the result of wide consultation and the bringing together of interests and forces in society which in their day proved almost irreconcilable but which of late have considered that co-operation is probably the better way of getting progress in this difficult subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble viscount for giving us the opportunity of going over the ground of an important catalogue of institutional questions which i believe should receive more attention <e> <s> i am sure that the noble viscount will be gratified that remaining to hear his opening speech were two former prime ministers <e> <s> we also have the honour of the presence of the noble viscount the leader of the house to listen to the debate <e> <s> i am sure that he will be interested in some of the comments made in this debate and i look forward to whatever remarks he may make at the end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the weakness of the eternal triangle in our education system is becoming ever more apparent <e> <s> the system is breaking apart because it is really based upon the concept of a local service provided and run by a local and elected authority when of course in fact it is controlled by the central government <e> <s> this system of dual financial control has proved unsatisfactory for many years <e> <s> it is an odd situation when teachers refer to their employer yet the employers to whom they go for their negotiations are not in control of the finances of the pay structure which they are seeking to obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble viscount for giving way <e> <s> he will recall that it was when the house of lords rejected the rhodesian sanctions order that the then prime minister took a very truculent view of the behaviour of the conservative opposition and brushed aside the co-operation of the opposition in the house of commons to secure the passage of the reforms of the house of lords <e> <s> he said that the labour government could do it off their own bat and having lost the cooperation of the opposition failed to get it through his own supporters <e> <s> that really is the story and it is a very complicated one indeed <e> <s> but it was not just failure to get it through <e> <s> after all the labour prime minister dismissed the official opposition from the scene and said he could do it from his own strength but he failed in the end to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very unusual debate for your lordships house because <e>", "<cs> my lords after more than minutes of injury time it is a little difficult to get the ball back into play <e> <s> whether or not your lordships can remember it we were debating charities <e> <s> i am following the noble baroness lady faithfull after her most interesting speech <e> <s> i agreed with most of it particularly in regard to the ineffectiveness of the institution of the charity commissioners and the need for a charities board offering guidance and counsel to overlook the vast and growing industry of charity <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have had my time so i cannot rise again <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never before taken part in a debate on education not in either house <e> <s> that is not because of indifference it is through lack of experience <e> <s> i had far too little education as a boy <e> <s> i have had no family to tell me what education in later years has been like and no grandchildren to wave their banners denouncing the secretary of state <e> <s> so that is a great handicap and looking at the list of noble lords and noble baronesses who are taking part in this debate i feel at the same disadvantage as i nearly always do in the presence of those who are masters of the administration of education <e> <s> one has to grasp so much of complex detail on the distribution of authority the exercise of power and all the conditions of making appointments with regulations relating to discipline and all the rest of it all this one has to get through before one reaches the point of seeing a child being taught to read and write <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness before she sits down when the government will counsel those rampaging randy stags about having unlawful sexual intercourse with girls under the age of <e> <s> it is a criminal offence <e> <s> the whole bias of the debate and her remarks has been that it is girls who are to blame and that they are the people whom we must counsel all the time <e> <s> the sexual drive of young men is responsible for the whole situation <e> <s> when will we hear more about that <e> <s> we have heard nothing about restraining mens sexual drive <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel privileged to follow the noble lord who has just proposed the second reading of this bill <e> <s> we ought to thank him for bringing forward for our consideration a matter of great constitutional as well as practical importance <e> <s> earlier i was thinking that this was a day of debates on large subjects but with small attendances <e> <s> however i am glad to see that the chamber has filled up somewhat for this topic which is one of profound importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the public think that it matters more than some political propagandists were saying <e> <s> on the other hand they have not received a particularly favourable impression from some of the noises coming from another place that they have heard on the radio <e>", "<cs> my lords the level of debate so far has been of a very high order indeed <e> <s> my own attraction to this debate was mainly through the terms of the motion on the order paper which i think is very significant indeed coming from the sources <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment and the speeches made by the noble lords lord beloff and lord henderson <e> <s> i saw this letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a few comments about this bill and to raise a particular point which i hope your lordships will not think too small to intrude into the debate on the third reading <e> <s> unfortunately i was prevented by other engagements from taking part in the earlier stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it was possible to say on third reading whether we liked the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is either on the motion that the bill be now read a third time or it is on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood from observing conventions in your lordships house that there was hardly any time when you could not speak on a bill so long as it was still before the house <e> <s> anyway i presume to continue my remarks until somebody puts me down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord for that reassurance <e> <s> i can now regain my confidence <e> <s> in the past i have supported all bills in similar form to this and this is not the first time that this principle has been before the house in a bill <e> <s> therefore i am fully behind the motive and purpose of this bill <e>", "<cs> when the minister replies will he throw a little light on what is going on between the teachers organisations and acas at the present time <e> <s> i understood that the reference to acas covered conditions of service and other matters in dispute between the secretary of state and the teachers unions <e> <s> the impression i had was that this matter was part of conditions of service and was therefore within the scope of the discussions they were to have with acas <e> <s> they have been given a few months to try to come up with something permanent agreed and comprehensive <e>", "<cs> my lords has the prison officers association made any claims or set of demands that can be put on the record so that the public may understand what the dispute is about <e> <s> if we are to resolve it is it not a good idea to know what it is about <e> <s> although i have followed all the events i have great difficulty in knowing what the row is about and what justifies the action <e> <s> the public must be as uninformed as the rest of us <e> <s> what is the reality of the dispute <e>", "<cs> i must re-emphasise my view that this clause has no suitable part of this bill <e>", "<cs> the mover of the amendment ought to tell us where this independent assessor will come from <e> <s> it might be a parent of a child at the school <e> <s> the child might have carried tales about the school to his parents <e> <s> i presume that the teacher would have the right to object to the assessor in the same way that an accused person can object to a juror on the grounds that perhaps he would not get a fair deal <e>", "<cs> i did not say that it was the right thing to do <e> <s> i said that i could understand it and i made the confession that if i were the secretary of state for education it was what i would want to do <e> <s> however that is not quite the same thing <e> <s> let us get the record straight otherwise there will be more trouble <e>", "<cs> one of the most likeable things about the noble and learned lord lord denning is that despite his long and distinguished career in the law he still has an attractive instinct for simple justice and simple remedies for delinquency <e> <s> if i may say so i cannot understand why he can support an amendment of this kind which is quite clearly defective and inadequate for inclusion in statute law <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the motion that we should approve the commons amendment i should like to say that this amendment includes in the bill a proviso that it was always intended should be borne in mind by the secretary of state in granting project licences <e> <s> but so many people have wanted to see additional safeguards in the bill and these are the additions that are being made for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference between may and shall is one of the bugbears of the statute law and of parliamentary debate <e> <s> i do not know how many hours i have spent in both houses of parliament debating the difference between may and shall <e> <s> i think we need an act of parliament to resolve this difficulty in the statute law and to declare once and for all that may means shall and that there is no further argument to be conducted about it <e> <s> anyway in this case may has been translated into shall <e> <s> of course we know that it meant shall all the time but i need not pursue it any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to this amendment earlier on and i rise just for a moment or two to stress its importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong this discussion at all but perhaps i may put forward a laymans view of this matter <e> <s> i always understood that if an act of parliament lays down that a minister shall do something then failure to do that can be met by a charge of breach of statutory duty but if it were said that he may do something and he fails to do it he cannot be so charged <e> <s> the obligation is there but the statutory duty is not quite there <e> <s> is this the explanation or need we not bother <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to welcome the comments of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the final amendment with which we have to deal this afternoon and in supporting that we should agree with the commons in this amendment i should like before we part with the bill for the royal assent to express my great appreciation of the co-operation on a number of sides of the house in the compilation of the bill and in discussing the amendments dealt with in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak for a few moments on the subject of schools and skills because i think we are all deeply concerned about the need for this country to be fit in every respect to recover our industrial strength <e> <s> this is industry year <e> <s> we usually give a year to an attempt to stimulate fresh interest and to regain our enthusiasm for a worthy cause which otherwise might flag in public interest or in popular esteem <e> <s> we shall not notice industry year in a year of another royal wedding be sure of that <e> <s> if industry year is to commemorate anything it is years of industrial decline years of education for industrial decline since the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether he has any information regarding the scale of newly-published videos which are requiring current attention <e> <s> is he aware that something like new films for video are likely to come under review in the near future and that many more thousands represent the backlog <e> <s> is this not a task which to begin with was never foreseen in its magnitude and which cannot be accelerated with any pretence of looking carefully at the films to be classified <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the gentle gloom that is now descending upon us i am not a candidate for the chorus of discontent on this bill <e> <s> there is a great deal in this bill that should be welcomed and it would be a mistake to undervalue its purpose and its achievement <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness on the lucidity and the flow of her presentation of a very difficult explanation of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i changed places with the noble lord lord kagan in the belief that as an active businessman probably the only active businessman to speak in this debate he might have something more worth listening to than what i had to say because i have had no experience of wages councils at all <e> <s> certainly i went into an area of very low pay when i began in the inland revenue many years ago but we were not classified as a sweat shop and so did not get the protection of the wages councils <e> <s> i spent all my life in wages and conditions of service nothing else in fact except how to make the best of conditions and get the maximum reward for the highest quality work <e> <s> if i may say so with great modesty one thing that we have done in the inland revenue is to promote the skill and the professional standards in dealing with complex fiscal policies and techniques and to try to get higher standards of remuneration for it <e>", "<cs> my lords no i know <e> <s> of course there are many quotes from winston churchill on pretty well any given situation <e> <s> however there we are <e> <s> i shall sit down but i want to stress the need for close examintion of this problem <e> <s> i think we want to know a little more about the practical side of the businessman for whom my noble friend lord kagan has just spoken <e> <s> there must be something here which needs the closest examination afresh to see whether it has the importance to justify interfering with the well-established conditions of the wages council system <e> <s> that is really the main issue of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not another confession of failure regarding the problems of northern ireland <e> <s> i am merely a distressed observer of the condition of northern ireland i have been that for the last years <e> <s> this latest move almost confirms the belief that we have an insoluble problem on our hands <e> <s> your lordships should be a little sensitive to suggestions that parts of the institution of parliamentary democracy should be abolished when it is believed that they have ceased to be useful <e> <s> we are ourselves very sensitive to the word abolition <e> <s> we ought to be on guard against believing that institutions have failed when miraculously they have shown a new <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i believe that the enjoyment of the countryside will become of greater importance as the years go by <e> <s> i think this whole question of land use and the rights of the public to have access to the countryside will become a major social and political issue <e> <s> surely before very long the present madness of growing to excess cereal crops that apparently are going to benefit nobody but the russians will have to come to an end <e> <s> the question of land use will arise when cereal growing has ceased to be the prevailing economic lunacy <e> <s> then the time will come when either we have alternative crops or we find alternative uses for our land <e>", "<cs> i shall not keep the committee for more than a moment <e> <s> i must say that i feel that there is everything wrong with this amendment except the good intention behind it <e> <s> this really is setting government an impossible task <e> <s> surely it is about time that we got rid of these weasel words striking the balance between <e> <s> it is the most difficult thing in the world to strike balances between good and evil and good and less good or good and not so good <e> <s> it seems to me that to set a minister this task he probably being neither a good writer of english nor a poet raises the question of how he can produce the kind of guidelines and codes that are being sought in this amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that there is a tax bias in favour of occupational pension schemes <e> <s> tax relief is given on all contributions <e> <s> other reliefs are given to the pensions institutions <e> <s> taking them all together about billion a year in revenue is forgone in tax concessions for occupational pension schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord shuttleworth on his most competent and informative maiden speech <e> <s> i sincerely hope that he will find it possible to be with us in the later stages of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that we would like to draw on his temperate and well-informed approach to this problem <e> <s> i have a special regard for the noble lord because he was a director of a society which has now lost its identity in a merger with which i had long association and he was helpful and wise when i was chairman of the civil service housing association <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nowhere else for them to go <e>", "<cs> i do not think that any right reverend prelate on the bishops bench should scorn a discussion of principles <e> <s> that is the last place i would have expected a protest to come from about debating principles <e> <s> of course we are talking about people but we are talking about human dignity as well as about human need <e> <s> my approach to this problem all along on social security

few words on this amendment <e> <s> in fact i almost threatened the committee with doing so but i shall not get as worked up over this amendment as i did over the last one <e> <s> last time it was the provocation of the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham that started me off and i apologise to him if i was too harsh <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that response <e> <s> may i make a comment in passing <e> <s> i think it is always unwise for members of the opposition upon getting a concession then to ask whether it is the first of many <e> <s> it does not auger well upon getting one concession to ask for more <e> <s> however i am grateful for this one <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> all right <e> <s> we will get it right this time <e> <s> not moved <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with that reply <e> <s> the government have precipitated this problem through their proposal to discontinue supplementary benefit to cover one half of the interest payments during the first six months <e> <s> that has sparked off this problem <e> <s> if people are not to get the full cover for the interest on their mortgages during the first six months in the same way that occupants of tenanted accommodation get full cover for their rent what are the borrowers expected to do <e> <s> the building societies association in its evidence to the joint advisory committee has suggested that the probability is that the borrower will want to capitalise the interest that is not being covered by social payment <e> <s> the regulations apparently already made by the government provide for benefit to cover interest on capitalised interest <e> <s> that is a somewhat cynical way of dealing with the difficulties of the borrower <e> <s> in many cases it will only pile up more indebtedness to the building society and leave him in difficulties later on <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend on this amendment and disagree with the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> it seems to me that the paragraph concerning the functions of the commission place it under an obligation to secure the word secure is used that the fund-raising activities of building societies shall be concentrated upon getting subscriptions or deposits from members <e> <s> i doubt whether that takes full account of the possibility that at some time or other the state and the building societies may be in competition for personal savings <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord a question about subsection which states <e>", "<cs> i take it that the appointment will be for a fixed term of between three and five years <e> <s> that seems to be quite definite because it has been repeated so many times <e> <s> for the time being i shall take the noble lords answer because i do not want to delay the committee any longer on a matter of this kind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i

the commission are very wide indeed <e> <s> it is quite obvious that the treasury has insisted on this array of safeguards restraints oversight and authority for giving directions so as to avoid building societies misusing their new freedom or being negligent in using it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can think of any circumstances in which a direction would be given

this direction might be given have any right to be in business at all <e> <s> it seems to me that what has been prescribed within the powers of the commission is so authoritarian and so complete in

giving the commission more opportunities for intervention on this matter the commission ought to have a look sometimes at what boards are doing when they come to co-opt members to fill vacancies <e>

possibility that the board may have some favourite son it wishes to appoint the new responsibilities of the boards of building societies will i believe justify getting in some new blood <e> <s> i do not know how they are going to get such new blood otherwise <e> <s> the chances of a candidate being elected to a board of a building society against the will and consent of the board are very remote indeed <e> <s> moreover experience has shown that the boards of building societies have a real box of dirty tricks when it comes to keeping off people who are candidates for election to the board

point <e> <s> the noble lord has just spoken in a most engaging way and i admire his candour about his state of mind on this amendment <e> <s> however this is an important matter concerning the

prescribed amount in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> i shall be returning to that subject at a later stage in the bill but in the meantime i draw attention to the fact that is much less than the average industrial weekly wage <e> <s> it is really a minimal sum to prescribe either as a qualifying condition of voting or for the purposes of this clause <e> <s> i am not moving an amendment because i have not tabled one but i think that to provide that no society can require a candidate to have more than invested in the society is to put it at a very low value indeed <e>", "<cs> whatever the noble lord may have said about the close collaboration between the building societies association and the government i really cannot believe that the building societies association thought up this one <e> <s>

stage and i do not propose to repeat that <e> <s> what my noble friend has done is to expose the difference of opinion on this matter which engaged quite a lot of time in another place where some were uneasy about the option to be given to convert into a public company and others thought that the hurdle was too high <e> <s> i proposed earlier on that the hurdle should be lowered and that one part of it should be removed all together but i did not get very much support from my noble friends on the front bench <e> <s> now my noble friend is suggesting that we ought to object to any option at all

discussed as the noble lord said in more propitious circumstances <e> <s> not only does this provision come at the end of a very complex bill that is full of problems as well as opportunities for the building societies themselves but we are discussing it at a late hour and at a time when so many late hours have probably made members of the committee rather weary of the process of legislation <e>",

ministers statement <e> <s> however may i say with great respect to him that he should not keep on saying it would be wrong when it would not be wrong <e> <s> it might be undesirable it might be

said last time the government seem to have no conception of how the public service trade unions nearest to them are being run <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me a question to which the answer is yes <e> <s> i have already pointed out that under this bill and previous legislation executive committees must be elected according to the conditions of the five-year interval <e> <s> they

special relationship <e> <s> however i deeply regret the way in which whenever education reform comes before parliament the preoccupation of parliament and a good deal of public opinion is with education in religion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jakobovits the chief rabbi said that what is lacking today among young people is the recognition of accountability to something on high to which they must pay reverence and from which they might conceivably i do not know receive rewards or punishment according to their degree of accountability <e> <s> that argument is extremely complex for

my lords is the minister aware that similar difficulties arose in connection with the labelling of seal products <e> <s> the government made difficulties legal and otherwise canadian and otherwise until europe stepped in to make it obligatory for ec countries <e> <s> it accomplished what the british government had been unable to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to pursue the matter that i raised at the time when the house was asked to agree to all stages of the finance bill being taken on the same day <e> <s> i wish to introduce into this discussion upon it that is the relationship between your lordships house and the house of commons matters of finance public expenditure and administration <e> <s> there is an element of urgency in this i believe <e> <s> from my point of view i have been dealing with this matter now for several years and i believe it to be of great importance to the future of your lordships house i do not believe enough interest is being taken in how relations between your lordships house and another place may develop as a result of the growing assertion of confidence and strength on matters of public affairs in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> that is why i am going to make the best of it while i can <e> <s> the second urgency from my point of view is the pending implementation of recommendations of the keith committee on administration and enforcement of inland revenue <e> <s> the keith committee reported in having been charged with the duty of looking at the administration and enforcement of taxation and at two areas of self-government in this country <e> <s> one area was the customs and excise the other was the inland revenue <e> <s> the recommendations have been under review for some years <e>", "<cs> my lords for many years i was the staff representative in the civil service who had much to do with these and many other matters relating to staff interests <e> <s> i am not speaking this afternoon in any representative capacity although i speak from very wide experience in this and the allied field of confidentiality <e> <s> in the inland revenue we probably had the widest area of confidentiality in the public sector <e> <s> obviously many problems arose because of that <e> <s> but they all fell short of the official secrets act because we were operating within the disciplines of the income tax acts which contain their own requirement of declaration of observance of confidentiality of citizens affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be left out of a debate on animal welfare <e> <s> however i promise my noble friend lord mccarthy that shall occupy the least possible time <e> <s> i know that he is waiting to deal with an unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the most dignified thing the house could do would be to end this debate without dividing <e> <s> at any rate i must resign myself to the appointed role of being the only defender of the governments position in the debate today <e> <s> i was trying to save them from the humiliation which might otherwise befall them <e> <s> i was trying to bring the house to a dignified conclusion to a most interesting and i think valuable debate <e> <s> however i must hand the government over to the tender mercies of their so-called supporters <e> <s> i cannot help them any more <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly wish to endorse the compliment which my noble friend lord mishcon paid to the government on their courage in tackling this difficult and controversial subject <e> <s> many governments have said that they would do something about the redundancy of the official secrets act but none of them managed to achieve anything in that area <e> <s> whether a government are courageous or foolhardy at least an attempt to tackle the question is to be commended <e>", "<cs> my lords i rely upon my noble friend to acquit me of any personal involvement in bigamy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i can set his mind at rest <e> <s> the information i gave about the contents of the finance bill to come have already been announced publicly to the staff of the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> i apologise for coming in after the amendment has been moved and seconded but i have been unavoidably detained upstairs <e> <s> however i have come in especially to deal with this amendment because i had an experience when i was in government which casts serious doubts upon an amendment of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a shocking proposal to put before the house during the supper break <e> <s> i have constantly complained about the abuse of the supper break to ask the house to deal with business which although presumed to be non-controversial can be acutely controversial <e> <s> this is certainly an example of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disposed to fight for causes these days and not for wide grandiose political purposes <e> <s> i have been years in that game and they have been entirely unrewarding <e> <s> any party that has its eyes on the salvation of the planet is probably thinking more of the reality of the future than those who are bothering their heads about nuclear bombs the level of inflation or anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords intervention was nearly as long as my speech <e> <s> i am sure that he will rise to speak in a few minutes and enlarge on that point <e> <s> i am trying to help him <e> <s> i am pointing to where the political future of some of our smaller parties lies at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that an attempt is being made to undermine my confidence and make me feel a little guilty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am protesting because the business is being taken at this time <e> <s> if it were tabled for another time it would not be necessary to make these reproaches <e> <s> moreover i do not see any battery of legal luminaries in the chamber at the present time indeed they are entitled to their supper like everyone else except us <e> <s> therefore we are bound to feel some consideration for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very glad to comment on that point <e> <s> i fully understand my noble friends argument and at least from that angle there may be some justification for what we are doing <e> <s> that is probably why in another place and in this chamber too for that matter members may feel that this matter is almost part of the indexing of certain elements in our affairs <e> <s> however i draw attention again to the fact that nothing is being done at present to raise the amount of the deposit for parliamentary elections here <e> <s> that is left where it was put <e> <s> in the deposit at home was put up from to <e> <s> that was a big increase but it had been for years and years right back to my time and i was elected years ago <e> <s> if i am right it was then and it remained until <e>", "<cs> my lords we can well understand why no government have attempted to amend the official secrets act all these years <e> <s> two acts were passed in the year that every government since have said should be changed and no government have done very much about them <e> <s> one affects your lordships house and the other is the official secrets act <e>", "<cs> my lords is this another official secret or may we be told what it is about <e> <s> i am bound to say that for the last half hour i have found it distracting to see many comings and goings around us between those who we felt had some problem which they wished to be resolved <e> <s> what is the trouble and for how long are we asked to suspend the debate <e> <s> some of us are already building up our eloquence on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill and like many noble lords i am relieved that at last a government have tackled the long-standing difficulties doubts and dissatisfaction with the official secrets act <e> <s> i am astonished to discover that when i entered the civil service in the official secrets act was two years old <e> <s> it was drawn to my attention and i have had to live with it ever since <e> <s> the inland revenue decided that although i left the department to become a full-time officer of a civil service union the oath of secrecy that i had sworn so many years before still held me in its grip to my dying day <e> <s> i am not sure that we would all accept that construction of the official secrets act or the doctrine behind it <e> <s> nevertheless as a former member for many years of the civil service national whitley council and having seen many cases go through the courts which have disturbed the staff element as well as the official element such a bill is long overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend has said is true <e> <s> the only thing i can say is that when there has been a division that is how the divisions have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble viscount lord falkland to my noble friend and to the minister for the remarks they have made about this bill <e> <s> i am glad that i left the noble earl plenty of scope to describe this bill with greater clarity and precision and to give an edge to it which with my softer approach to these animal matters i probably did not do <e> <s> the noble earl is absolutely right about the powers in the bill and how important they will be if applied to cases which otherwise would be regarded as a scandal or a danger to public welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the debate this afternoon disqualifies parliament from having anything useful to say to industry commerce or our institutions about modernising their methods and procedures economising on manpower and finding more modern methods of discharging business <e> <s> it is no good rehearsing the merits behind these two amendments this afternoon because they are of no consequence in another place they do not care what the merits are <e> <s> those in another place are concerned about whether it is a breach of their privilege on matters of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier in the debate the chamber looked somewhat like an old boys network <e> <s> i counted five if not six former treasury ministers in their places in the house <e> <s> surely that is the most elitist gathering that i have yet seen on the finance bill in your lordships <e>", "<cs> if this is not a hot potato it should be <e> <s> and that is one reason why i intervene <e> <s> i support my noble friends contribution on this subject <e> <s> we are in danger of having religion brought into a great deal of our legislation <e> <s> it will increasingly intrude in our debates on various legislation unless we are clear in our minds about our attitude in principle to those who come here or who are born here and have religious views which bring them into conflict with the law of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that a well-bred pig is more intelligent than a great many human beings <e> <s> secondly is she willing to prevail upon the media to let the consumer see more of the miseries of the rearing and slaughter of that sensitive animal <e> <s> thirdly will she prevail upon the authorities of the house to give the right message to the consumer by banning pork veal and venison from our dining room until we are satisfied that the animals are more humanely treated and slaughtered <e>", "<cs> my lords the building trade employers organisation has strongly urged me to move the amendment and is fully behind my actions <e> <s> therefore i suggest to the noble lord that he need not concern himself with the uncertainty of the employers because they want this measure of possible relief from the rigidity of the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to those who have taken part in the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will have concluded in listening to the debate that the extremities and rigidities of our law regarding racial discrimination are quite extraordinary <e> <s> it is pursued to the nth degree <e> <s> that is why in this particular matter if indirect racial discrimination is alleged no other defence of justification is possible <e> <s> that must be determined by the court on the ground of indirect racial discrimination <e> <s> i suggest that that answers the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> if racial discrimination is brought into it there is no other justification <e> <s> the matter has to be decided by reference to the allegation of racial discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that the amendment proposes to introduce the opportunity to an employer of advancing justification for what he did in answer to the charge made against him <e> <s> at present he would not be able to advance any justification for what he did <e> <s> he would have to advance the case against the allegation of racial discrimination <e> <s> that is the basis on which as i understand it the matter would have to be decided <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that at i am suffering from certain deficiencies of hearing and i have not heard what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were any members of the parliaments of europe listening to our debate they would think that we were still in the primary stage of our political development <e> <s> i am glad that reference has been made to the committee of which i had the honour to <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that noble lords opposite will dodge this subject whenever it is raised <e> <s> whenever an opportunity occurs they try to get on with the tiddly-winks <e> <s> that is what we are doing again this afternoon <e> <s> from my point of view it is not of profound importance whether we stick to what is in the bill or whether we put something else in its place <e> <s> that is the smallest beer in relation to the major issue of who is financing our politics <e> <s> this measure is one little nudge forward to get one little bit more democracy into the method of financing political parties from public companies when we should not receive money from that source of vested interest at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit to being one of the principal grumblers about this matter <e> <s> it is quite humiliating that the opposition should have to make an application to have use of the time of the house <e> <s> i believe that sometimes we have a stronger claim than appears to be conceded <e> <s> when i speak to more experienced members about this kind of situation they say oh but we never do <e> <s> that is the trouble with this house we never do <e> <s> i am suggesting that for a change we do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend sections and of the abortion act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords of the three maiden speeches of very high quality that i have heard today i was particularly attracted to the speech of the noble lord lord walton of detchant who <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord whitelaw has exposed himself to some attention <e> <s> without looking at him i will say that all home secretaries share the blame for allowing the charity commission to fall into the decrepit condition that it has been in recently <e> <s> it has been utterly unable to discharge the responsibilities meagre as they are under the existing law <e> <s> it has no hope of coping with problems which are now arising fast and somewhat furiously in the charitable world <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to follow the noble and learned lord who has just spoken <e> <s> with great respect i agree with everything that he has said <e> <s> i feel a little exposed on these benches this afternoon because although my noble friend rightly said that it is not a party political matter the decision of government on whether to follow the recommendations of this document will become a political matter <e> <s> anything that comes into the public domain for governments to decide clearly becomes a political matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help what other people may say and i do not always hear <e> <s> i had hoped that a high moral line would be taken right from the beginning and a decision made as to whether in all the circumstances there was any justice to be gained <e> <s> justice is not a divine edict it is man-made <e> <s> justice is within the law and the law is made by secular bodies that is by parliament <e> <s> therefore if we talk of bringing people to justice it is that conceived by parliament to meet particular forms of crime and deliquency <e>", "<cs> my lords with the brevity of speeches lately i shall have to try to conform with the new pattern <e> <s> i would not have missed the <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that we still have to deal with the scottish clergy widows <e> <s> widows are very impatient people these days so i had better be brief <e> <s> there has been trouble over teachers pay ever since i can remember <e> <s> that dates back to about <e> <s> i had my share of it years ago when at this time of year a committee over which i presided was beavering away late into the night in order to get a report completed and printed by christmas and a advance on arrears of pay in the pockets of every teacher <e> <s> for several months before that when we had our lunches alongside our work there were bottles of teachers whisky on the table <e> <s> none of us dared touch it <e> <s> not until we had completed our report did we drink any of it and then there was soon none left <e> <s> but the serious part of this is that we were trying to do an impossible job in too short a time <e> <s> i believe the same thing will happen again <e> <s> whenever there is a target that can be extended it is nearly always extended <e> <s> when there is a target that cannot be extended there is nearly always a desperate rush at the last minute <e> <s> that appears to be human nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in view of the time at which we begin this possibly somewhat lengthy debate i must keep my own speech strictly within practical limits <e> <s> i hope however that i may be permitted one personal recollection <e> <s> it is years since i sponsored the first abortion law reform bill in the house of commons <e> <s> i have lived through it all <e> <s> on that occasion although the ill luck of the ballot brought us abysmally low on the list of preference three catholic members of parliament put down the same motion to that bill as the noble duke the duke of norfolk has put down to this one <e> <s> however we had two minutes two minutes <e> <s> and that was the end of that <e> <s> it took years of balloting in this absurd private members bill procedure in the commons to get further debates on abortion <e>", "<cs> no my lord i shall not give way <e> <s> this inquiry had taken well over a year to reach conclusions so that well over a years hard work and debate and taking of evidence lies behind the bill that the house is discussing tonight <e> <s> noble lords should hesitate before casting it into outer darkness <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief as the hour is now late <e> <s> the noble baroness is to be congratulated on this comprehensive survey of the situation <e> <s> her reply has covered many of the points which i should wish to raise or which should be raised in the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> however i must say to some noble lords that they cannot stand up and say that they will support the amendment to cast out the bill and then ask for a committee stage on the floor of the house to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> if your lordships give the bill a committee stage we will tell you <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke has got it all wrong <e> <s> i have emphasised that we have stiffened the conditions of lawful abortions after the end of the th week <e> <s> that is what the clause says <e> <s> i have gone over the wording and if the noble duke wants to find better words to stiffen it up and reflect the meaning of what we think we have conveyed here then let us give the bill a committee stage and let us examine it <e> <s> that issue cannot be decided on second reading <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble earl should suggest that this amendment can be taken away for its merits to be reconsidered because it does not have any <e> <s> it is highly discriminatory <e> <s> when one considers this matter in relation to present social trends sexual relationships and the matter of non-discrimination between men and women the whole idea is victorian <e> <s> we have to avoid legislating in victorian terms on a forward looking bill of this great importance and imagination <e> <s> we do not discriminate in abortions <e> <s> we are about to stop discriminating as regards taxation <e> <s> we provide state services to women therefore women are entitled to be considered by reference to their status in relation to those services and not solely in relation to the legalised married state <e> <s> that theory has been tested on women <e> <s> they were all against the discriminatory idea that these services should be available only to married couples <e> <s> some single people can make perfectly good parents <e> <s> if one examines the social aspect of this matter one can become a little confused about the blessings of family life or indeed the confidence that many young people have in it <e> <s> in those circumstances we must deal with this matter as relating to the rights of women and in response to the social trends of the day <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether members of the committee realise that the speeches we are hearing in favour of this amendment are going absolutely against what is now public policy in this country that is the policy of non-discrimination <e> <s> it is that issue of principle which will be taken as the judgment for what members of the committee are asking us to do <e> <s> we have the equal opportunities commission to support a non-discrimination act and to persuade all concerned in all circumstances that they must not take marital status into account <e>", "<cs> the noble earl surely knows that if his amendment were carried it would throw the international planned parenthood federation into confusion <e> <s> the whole world is waiting for a better contraceptive <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent the weekend reading the report and much of the evidence <e> <s> i thought not for the first time that the government need look no further than a report of a select committee of your lordships house for the material for an act of statemanship <e> <s> it is contained in that report <e> <s> the committees opinions are expressed clearly sympathetically and wisely as to what opportunity lies before this country at present on this among other matters related to our membership of the ec <e> <s> but unfortunately governments can scarcely wait to hear from select committees before they begin to rubbish their conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble viscount will not press the amendment <e> <s> i should like to point out one or two difficulties about it <e> <s> the amendment applies only to the post -week cases <e> <s> that is its effect <e> <s> if this were carried we should have two doctors for a gestational period up to weeks and three doctors afterwards <e> <s> one can imagine the borderline problems which would be aggravated by that provision <e> <s> the question will be asked are you a three-doctor woman or a two-doctor woman <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether anything i can say will influence the minister in the reply which he has before him and which has already been written <e> <s> however it will probably save me making two speeches if i can just explain my own position in relation to this amendment <e> <s> not for the first time the noble earl and i have come together to try to overcome an impasse in parliamentary treatment of a highly controversial moral issue <e> <s> our first collaboration took place on the laboratory animals problem that is the use of animals in research and for other so-called vivisectional purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in full spate <e> <s> i do not want any help from my noble friend with great respect <e> <s> my engines are going all right at the moment <e> <s> i wish to get this stuff off my chest because i believe that it is an issue of considerable constitutional importance <e>", "<cs> i did not expect very much more than we got <e> <s> i fully understand that we could do with a little more eruption in northern ireland on this question and then notice will be taken of it <e> <s> why so much liberal opinion in northern ireland is suppressed is difficult to understand but there is an ethos about northern ireland which i am sure would be very unpleasant for many of us and they are probably suffering from it in matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should be grateful to the noble lord for raising this matter <e> <s> it is appropriate that it should come before your lordships house because it concerns the liberty of the subject <e> <s> it raises important legal and constitutional aspects of our life and i am sure that we are all deeply concerned about it <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order is there no one who can protect the business of the day <e> <s> this is not the business of the day <e> <s> if we are to have a debate let us have a debate but a statement should not dislodge the business of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must warn the house against creating more government inspectors <e> <s> they are a terrible nuisance not only to the people they inspect but also to the bodies to which they belong <e> <s> what should we call them this is one of the important questions embryo inspectors <e> <s> i warn noble lords that if we start a cadre of

career <e> <s> even in the upper echelons of the legal profession in the civil service they want a career and an outlet <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a small but serious point to raise <e> <s> there are many things mentioned in this bill which i have never seen before in any act of parliament <e> <s> we are all embryologists now <e> <s> we have read in a bill which will become an act of parliament many things that we scarcely knew about before <e> <s> i have never seen any previous act of parliament which mentioned a hamster by name <e> <s> this is not a laughing matter it

danger of becoming a little too cosy about this bill <e> <s> when the bill leaves our care for a stormy passage elsewhere it will meet with misrepresentation abuse and a ferocity which no sergeant

out of our care temporarily <e> <s> it has to return and we are all deeply concerned as to its future progress through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords friday is always a good day on which to debate electoral reform <e> <s> this morning following yesterdays by-election we have had the advantage of seeing our electoral system in action <e> <s> another fact that we also find on a friday in these circumstances is that certain noble lords are disposed to celebrate the victory of those whom they favour by wearing a highly-coloured tie which has a political notation <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord holderness was joining in the conventional practice of celebrating the victory of a candidate at a by-election <e> <s> i have only one red tie <e> <s> i would never have bought it

in a debate which unusually has been introduced by a right reverend prelate <e> <s> it is infrequent that our debates are initiated from the bishops bench <e> <s> i was attracted to the debate for two reasons <e> <s> first it was being introduced by the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester <e> <s> it was in worcester that i made my only address in a cathedral and it was on a topic to

the slightest doubt that the right reverend prelate has indulged in such thoughts during the course of his administrations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is about time that more leaders of affairs in politics religion industry and education came into this debate <e> <s> some of us have been working in it for many years and although there has been widespread interest in our work throughout the world governments themselves have not entered the debate as they should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very fortunate <e> <s> my general views were expressed in a leading article in this mornings <e>", "<cs> my lords the presence and the speech of the noble lord who has just spoken lend added importance to the debate <e> <s> it is obvious that the government do not regard it as an important debate

television fans have been denied the full publicity and approval that he receives for his many speeches defending her majestys government <e> <s> the noble lord is so popular for his defence of the

there are at least two tory cabinets in this house yet we hardly hear a word in defence of the government from them <e> <s> that is because they all have grudges against the government <e> <s> i keep wanting to call the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter my friend and i venture to do so because we have worked for so long on different sides of the house on matters of close personal interest <e>", "<cs>
