["<cs> my lords i rise with more than the normal amount of trepidation because i am inserting myself into a debate most of which i have not heard <e> <s> my only excuse is that i have spent the last hour in the chaos of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no complaint that there is no more detail than that on the point that i raised since my late arrival prevented me from giving the noble lord any hint of what points i may have raised <e> <s> when <e>", "<cs> i should not like to see the noble lord lord inglewood go unsupported on this <e> <s> i must say that i agree with him <e> <s> i knew nothing about it until i listened to the exchanges but i found the answers exceedingly unconvincing <e> <s> they are the sort that i would expect the fellows in the office to put up to any rather compliant and easily satisfied minister but then this place is rather different <e> <s> if it is urged that the special constables are involved in all the things except pay which properly fall within the ambit of the negotiating board it does not seem to me to be convincing to say that the chief constables will take care of their interests on all those matters because it may be precisely a matter of issue between a man and his particular chief constable <e> <s> a chief constable or a number of chief constables or the association of chief constables may take a line with which the special constables do not feel able to be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i think we have now got out of the minister the real nub of this <e> <s> it is not really any of the things he has been saying <e> <s> it is that the bodies on the negotiating board the other associations and trade unions and this is an old trade union argument <e>", "<cs> my lords as i lead my own party i do not see why i should always give way to the other opposition party below the gangway <e> <s> nor do i see why the minister cannot answer questions put by more than one back-bencher at a time <e> <s> i wish to put forward a point which may be overlooked here is it not the position and have those of us who have been responsible for that office not always taken this position that there have to be very powerful reasons to justify not maintaining diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level with other countries if we wish to be in a position adequately to look after and make representations on behalf of our citizens and on behalf of our interests <e> <s> it is not a question of being called on to approve the way in which the chileans conduct their domestic affairs or the way in which they deal with foreigners when they are there <e> <s> i am strongly in favour for all the reasons adduced of the idea that our ambassador should be put back there and that they should have an ambassador here because i am quite sure that at that level we shall have much more effect on the chileans than we can possibly have while we maintain the existing position <e>", "<cs> my lords the other half would have been the better half <e>", "<cs> my lords sitting here listening to this debate reinforces the view that we ourselves hold and sometimes others outside express that the standard of debate in this house on issues of this kind is not only high in itself but notably higher than tends to be the case in the other place down the corridor <e> <s> but in noting that one has mixed feelings if one is then proposing to take part in a debate oneself not merely because of the risk that one will be agreeing with so much that has gone before particularly when like me one is coming at the end of a procession of present and past foreign secretaries and anticipating a positive horde of permanent under-secretaries who are to follow one also is rather frightened that one may not hold the standard and it is not altogether to ones comfort in starting to speak <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend lord home that he may well rush and catch his train there is not any grave likelihood of my overthrowing much of what he has said or indeed any of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i know what the noble lord lord gladwyn was saying i heard him the first time <e> <s> he said that he did not think that it was either here or there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just put this point to the foreign secretary <e> <s> this must be the third renegotiation since i first tabled the appli <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the foreign secretary whether or not the advance of the soviets in the way of acquiring offensive facilities in this area is so terrifying that it would be absurd for the west to deny to itself the very limited and inadequate resources that we are acquiring for defence against the acquisitive and offensive operations which the soviets have been carrying out for some time now <e>", "<cs> my lords on a day when the state of israel is most flagrantly defying the other equal part of resolution of the security council by annexing east jerusalem and declaring jerusalem to be the capital of israel may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the government to be careful that they phrase their replies to questions such as this in the spirit which enabled us to get resolution unanimously adopted by the security council and keep that as a basis of a policy in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are many countries in the world where to use his phrase the human rights situation is less satisfactory that we would wish and that some of us feel that this continual singling out of this particular country whereas the others are never mentioned is an example of double standards which some of us find very hard to defend <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the government spokesman would help some of the rest of us in his answer to the question raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter which he said went rather wide of the amendment <e> <s> he said that he was willing to write to the noble lord who said he would be obliged if he could do so <e> <s> some of us have reason to think that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had reasons for asking that question <e> <s> may the rest of us be let into the answer that the government give <e> <s> will the noble lord put it in <e>", "<cs> there is no particular reason why the government spokesmans noble friend should be in a special case about this <e> <s> i too should like to know because i too have civil aviation friends who are asserting to me that such a thing happened <e> <s> the governor of hong kong it is no secret was once my principal private secretary <e>", "<cs> yes a very good one from whom i benefited very much <e> <s> many of us are rather concerned to know whether a message or messages were received which were not heard at the hearing not introduced at the hearing <e> <s> if there were a number of us would wish to know whether they were taken into account <e> <s> therefore i must insist that this is not a private matter concerning only my noble friend and he is my noble friend as well as the governments noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> this is a matter between the government and many of us in this place <e> <s> will the noble lord therefore please make whatever reply he proposes to make to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter available to the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords is not there a fatal flaw in the argument that the minister himself is using <e> <s> is it not true that the government have required the public suppliers of electrical energy in this country quite unnecessarily quite artificially to raise the charges that they make to commercial enterprises far beyond anything that is necessary to run their own enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i am fascinated always by what he says and by the way he says it <e> <s> he and i are very old friends and i regard him as one of the most radical thinkers on that side of the house today <e> <s> may i ask him whether he would like to identify what he is now saying with the attitude that we were taking in and with the national plan and the prices productivity and incomes board concept of those days <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister help me and possibly save me some embarrassment as i am about to proceed to milton keynes to deliver the alan ashton lecture in memory of the first director of the milton keynes corporation <e> <s> as the lecture is being sponsored by that corporation should i sympathise with them or applaud them as i intended to do for the great work they have been doing <e>", "<cs> that of course is perfectly true but is the minister telling the house he does not really know whether the milton keynes development corporation is one of the bodies to be abolished <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> you <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to refer to it <e> <s> i am asking the minister who owes a duty to this house <e> <s> one can get very angry about this <e> <s> if ministers choose to come to this house to make a statement inadequately briefed the house has a complaint <e> <s> now has the minister referred to the statement made by the prime minister in another place yesterday and does the minister know whether the prime minister included the milton keynes development corporation in her statement <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> has the minister read it <e> <s> i will persist with your lordships permission so long as it takes the minister to ask the people in the box who are there for the purpose of advising him <e> <s> is that one of the quangos that was abolished in the prime ministers very long written answer yesterday <e> <s> if it was too long for the minister to read and too long for his advisers to read why should i plough through it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has now received the advice from the box may i ask him to acquaint us with the contents <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask guidance here <e> <s> in the other place there is a procedure which can be invoked <e>", "<cs> when a minister deliberately and as it seems to me in this case quite obstructively declines to help <e> <s> i do not know who answers here but may i ask the leader of the house what procedure is available in this house to a noble lord who is quite deliberately refused information which is now quite clearly in the ministers possession because we all saw the note passed to the minister and who wishes to prevent further business from being conducted until the minister discloses what he clearly is now in a position to disclose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i now chase the noble lord himself <e>", "<cs> you will not shut me up that way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return to my question to the leader of the house <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether he is the leader of the house or the acting leader of the house <e> <s> if he says that i am being unfair and am doing no service to his noble friend or to the house by what i am now doing may i just make it quite plain that i will seek the highest advice as to the way in which a noble lord who on the whole if i may remind him has supported his government at great cost to myself can in fact proceed when i should have thought i was being treated with gross discourtesy by the minister concerned <e> <s> the minister cannot know how many quangos are being dismissed unless he knows the list of the quangos that are being dismissed <e> <s> it follows <e> <s> i simply serve notice on the noble earl who is acting as leader of the house that whatever disservice he thinks i have done to the house he has done a very considerable disservice to himself and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down this seems to be rather interesting and with the indulgence of the house i should like to pursue it <e> <s> earlier on my noble friend spoke about the importance of reaching an agreement with the russians and he hit the dispatch box in the old-fashioned way to show how much he meant it <e> <s> does he not realise that every agreement that we have made with the russians has been used by the russians to advance their strength while we observe the agreements <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords may i suggest to the minister <e>", "<cs> certain noble lords may consider themselves good at detail my lords <e> <s> may i ask the minister to be very careful please about this sudden tendency towards teachers profiles of pupils <e> <s> speaking as one who never passed an o-level in his life may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware that nevertheless i have a tremendous appreciation of what a teacher who might have disapproved of my personal rebelliousness or whatever they might have chosen to call it could have put into my profile <e> <s> will the minister please go very carefully on this matter particularly at a time when as most of us know the teaching profession is very much infiltrated by people with particular political motivations <e>", "<cs> the minister must at least undertake to reconsider the matter <e> <s> i was for a long time a minister responsible for the operations of the forestry commission <e> <s> we never assumed that it operated on the basis that it was part of any of the departments for which i then answered <e> <s> it was always accepted that it was a commission for the reasons we said it was namely that it had the authority which the act gave it and that we could not as a ministerial act simply tell it what to do as one would tell maybe a principal assistant secretary what to do <e>", "<cs> this is not a question of my having reminiscences of long ago <e> <s> this is a question of a quite new and rather junior minister trying to alter a state that has existed historically for a very long time <e> <s> while there may be no sanctity in having been at the ministry of agriculture or years ago there is certainly no very great distinction in having suddenly arrived <e> <s> i suggest that the minister really ought to go and find out as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe was saying to him how this body grew up why it was invested with the authority with which it was invested and how it has exercised that authority for very many years going back to a time when the noble earl the minister was still in short pants <e>", "<cs> only on the advice <e>", "<cs> what does even mean <e>", "<cs> the treasury solicitor i suspect <e>", "<cs> i am fascinated with the reply of the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> he has just spent a long time on the previous amendment telling us that the forestry commissioners are not forestry commissioners they are a government department <e> <s> he has now read out to us a letter which he said he will place in our library which the minister of that department will write to himself in his capacity of that department and which will bind him so long as he is the minister for that department and he suggests that in some way that meets the purposes of this bill <e> <s> either his defence on the previous amendment was wrong or this one is absolutely ridiculous <e> <s> ministers writing letters to themselves may occupy interestingly and amusingly a part of their time but it cannot possibly be a substitute for giving protection to the forest of dean to those who are interested in forests in general and to those who live there <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mcnair answers that point would it not be better knowing the ways of governments government departments and draftsmen for us to insert the amendment leaving the government to invite us to take it out in place of another amendment at a later stage <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will believe me when i say that i am not seeking here churlishly to reject or to react to what he thought was an unchurlish act on his part <e> <s> but if we do not put the amendment in and it then comes back later at another stage perhaps at an inconvenient time or at an inconvenient point we shall be left without any defence at all <e> <s> i invite his reaction to that <e> <s> i also invite the reaction of the noble lord lord mcnair <e> <s> i must say that my own reaction would be to try to put the amendment in at this stage with the assurance genuine assurance on the part of all of us that if the government then come back with some other amendment which seems to meet what we want we would not resist them replacing our amendment with theirs <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this has very much more to do with the nations economy than it has to do with the cruising public whoever they be <e> <s> the minister said that the waterways board is free to decide its priorities within the funds allocated to it <e> <s> is it not true that that is no answer at all to the question <e> <s> if heavy freight is not carried on these waterways then it will aggravate the situation that we now have on the m the m and i would not know how many other roads which are breaking up because heavy freight which could go on the canals cannot go on the canals because the government will not decide upon a priority <e> <s> may i therefore ask the minister to go back to the question which is whether the government using their judgment about priorities will make more funds available for the waterways board so that the waterways board can more sensibly use its judgment about its priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking on behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister make it clear to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise two brief points and they will be brief <e> <s> one of them concerns the question of what weapons the police should use <e> <s> may i ask the minister to accept from a very large number of us that there is no regret no hesitancy over the use of cs gas or water cannon if these methods prove to be the best way of breaking up these mobs <e> <s> i do not weep any tears for those who would be on the receiving end and i ask the minister whether he believes that that is in fact the view of most of the people of brixton <e> <s> i know brixton i know southall <e> <s> i do not know thescousersin toxteth but i suspect that they too believe much the same <e>", "<cs> may i say something very briefly because i do not want to repeat the arguments already made <e> <s> i should like to say with great respect how much i disagree with what has just been said by my predecessor and my successor at the foreign office in the s <e>", "<cs> i have always been rather puzzled that the french who were much harsher colonialists than we ever were have always been so willingly accepted by the united nations committees in terms of their relations with their ex-colonial territories whereas we are always accused of being the oppressors

france and its <e>", "<cs> my lords not having put down my name to speak it would be improper for me to seek to deploy a long argument at this stage <e> <s> on the other hand i ask your lordships permission to say a few words because things have moved as i rather thought they would not and i have found myself possibly surprisingly to some in a large measure of disagreement with some things

took a slightly unpopular position the other day on the question of the use of force here <e> <s> i will not repeat all that today although i think we are still talking much too easily about the use of force to retake the falkland islands <e> <s> may i follow up something said by the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> if we are in fact to persuade the world that we are seeking negotiation and a peaceful solution before we arrive at any question of using force is the noble baroness able to get her right honourable friend the prime minister to back off some of the statements which have impaled

lords lord bishopston and lord skelmersdale is not naturally available to them although obviously it can be acquired <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to interrupt my colleague but he is glossing over an important point <e> <s> i think that he should face it honestly for the sake of himself as well as the house <e> <s> when in and we attached ourselves to investment in the future he led a union if i may say so with great respect that was insistent upon retaining restrictive practices <e> <s> as near as damn it that was what lost us our markets <e> <s> we can all change our minds <e> <s> we can all grow up <e> <s> we can all be different <e> <s> i think however with great respect that the noble lord should perhaps simply say i did play a pretty lousy part at that time <e>", "<cs> vote for the sdp <e>", "<cs> my lords they should have done it when they had the power <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just put to the noble viscount whom i welcome of course and this is my first opportunity to say so the simple point that until the rest of western europe recognises us as a full political member of western europe we will go on having these ridiculous arguments about how much money we get or do not get <e> <s> is it likely that in the next four years of this government in with the minority of votes but with the majority of seats we will convince our friends in the rest of western europe that we believe in western europe and will stop arguing about the figures <e> <s> does the noble viscount accept that if we do that we might get the figures right <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord the minister is having his consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple point that i wish to put to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords if you put it to the noble lord then you are asking him <e> <s> is not the answer to the noble lord lord beswick and to many others who intervened that this country cannot survive on a financial and leisure basis only <e> <s> is it not true that we have to he a manufacturing-based country <e> <s> thirdly we have a deficit on our manufacturing base not just because we are not investing but should he not have said to the noble lord <e> <s> lord beswick <e> <s> because the trade unions by their practices are refusing us permission to make use of the investment we are making <e> <s> should he not invite the noble lord lord beswick to use his influence to bring the trade unions to understand that restrictive practices are also at the bottom of our problem <e>", "<cs> but my lords the noble lord never did accept any criticisms <e> <s> may i ask the minister to make it quite clear that he advised me about rolls-royce when i was the economics minister <e> <s> if the thing went wrong it was because i accepted the noble lords advice <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i never was <e> <s> the noble lord has even got that wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been listening to this debate and was not intending to intervene <e> <s> i do not know very much about the subject except that i was poor <e> <s> as i listened to a stinkingly rich labour front bench i remembered what bernard shaw used to say <e> <s> solicitors lawyers landlords on that bench know more about what the poor need than the poor themselves know <e> <s> i agreed so much with what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> okay when we are poor deal with us help us as a matter of social service but do not deny us housing <e> <s> what i do not think the noble baroness understands and what i do not think any lawyers or solicitors understand is that we will not rent a house or a flat unless it is within our means and at the moment it is not <e> <s> properties are not being offered for let <e> <s> i wish that the labour party would get hold of the point that they are denying to our people what they want which is the ability to rent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is in the same situation as i am except of course that he has a rather bigger pension than i have <e> <s> so he is a little better off than i am <e> <s> i know exactly what his pension is and he is a bit better off than i am <e> <s> but neither of us is quite in the class of the noble baroness lady birk <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness really wants to challenge me about her situation and that of mr ellis birk i will be challenged <e> <s> she is exceedingly and by my standards quite stinkingly rich and i suggest to her that she does not challenge me on that <e> <s> she is in the millionaire class <e>", "<cs> i am not being silly <e> <s> the noble baroness is very rich <e> <s> i would advise her to leave that alone <e> <s> we are talking about poor people who need to rent flats in london and i think that they will be helped by passing this bill <e> <s> they will not be helped if we refuse it a passage <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby is another landlord <e> <s> the labour front bench is now made up of landlords solicitors and rich people <e> <s> could somebody speak for poor people <e> <s> i as an sdp member am happy to speak for poor people and i consider that we ought to pass the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i do not pretend to be an expert on this but i was rather shaken by something he has just said <e> <s> he said that the department of the environment will take the decision and that there will be no appeal from that <e> <s> it just struck me as an ex-departmental minister that he is enunciating a new principle <e> <s> if the department takes the decision surely it has been the whole of our practice previously that there has to be an appeal against that to somebody to parliament says the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the question relates to documents which the government have borrowed from the public record office and the reply that she has just made refers to documents in the foreign office <e> <s> therefore am i not right in saying that there is no reason to borrow from the public record office documents of which there are copies in the foreign office <e> <s> as one who as a minister was involved in all this over the years may i ask her seriously to represent to the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs who was erroneously referred to in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise slightly for moving my position but i was listening with interest to the minister <e> <s> i understood him to say that the case for the boards increasing their charges that is to say the gas and electricity boards had been made clearly <e> <s> but is he not misleading the house <e> <s> is it not true that the chairman of each board has made it plain that the last thing on earth he or his board wanted to do was to increase their charges because it was unjustified and that in fact they were required by the government to place what was a hidden tax upon the charges for gas and electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble viscounts pardon <e> <s> with great respect it has everything to do with it because the minister said it <e> <s> all i am doing is asking the minister to justify a statement which i would have said is clearly not true by reference to the statements made by the chairmen of the boards <e> <s> with great respect to the noble viscount how can that be not relevant since the minister is denying what in fact was said <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do so <e>", "<cs> here i am supporting the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> we are now and i am glad that the noble viscount has returned in a state of real confusion here <e> <s> what happened was not a minor matter but quite a major thing <e> <s> here i am calling into account my experience in the other place and a lot of us have had that <e> <s> the obvious point now would be for the minister to rise and say in whatever words are used in this place the equivalent of what would have been said in the other place which would be that he would move progress and ask leave to sit again <e> <s> in this chamber presumably we have a different set of words <e>", "<cs> one keeps on getting interrupted here <e> <s> that does not really help either <e> <s> if you really want to make enemies out of friends this is a good way of doing it <e> <s> would it not be sensible now to say that that was a watershed that something significant happened <e> <s> the government may want to fight but they have to think how they will do it <e> <s> i really suggest that it would be more sensible in whatever sense is right in this chamber to do what i know we would do in the other house which would be to break off for a while to let the government think what they want to do and then to resume it from there on <e> <s> i do not know quite how we do it but i support the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> at least let us take supper go away for a short while and then let the government consult <e> <s> the minister here can presumably consult other ministers possibly take the thing away for a day or two and bring it back to us when they have made up their minds <e> <s> but if they really want to fight it and they are going to lose then let them do it <e> <s> we cannot go on like this in a piecemeal way taking amendments which make no sense in the light of what we have just done <e>", "<cs> before the question is put let us be quite clear <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> has made it perfectly plain that he wants it in so that when it gets considered elsewhere there is an alternative to consider <e> <s> with great respect an amendment has just been carried by this committee by votes that is no mean majority <e> <s> let us not kid ourselves the chief whip on the other side did his utmost <e> <s> and the arguments i heard deployed were very convincing on both sides <e> <s> the committee took a very very strong view an unusually strong view by a large majority <e> <s> why should we now mislead the other place mislead the public or mislead anybody by putting in with great respect to the noble earl something which let us face it the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has been quite honest about it will then be put up as a possible alternative <e> <s> i do ask your lordships to realise what we are being asked to do <e> <s> we are in fact being asked by a subterfuge to undo <e>", "<cs> i do not know what other word to use except subterfuge but with great respect there are noble lords on the other side of the committee who do see it in that light <e> <s> there must be a better word than subterfuge and if there is i will obviously use it <e> <s> but it will be put as though we took one decision we then took another one if it were to be carried and i hope that it will not be carried and then the other place have got an alternative to consider <e> <s> i do not know that subterfuge is a non-parliamentary expression <e> <s> it is a normally good word <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> i am not used to being interrupted this many times <e> <s> may i put my own point of view and will the committee be kind enough to listen to it <e> <s> it is my point of view and with all the background of the noble earl lord halsbury i still have a background as well that this will be seen in this way <e> <s> it would be better not to move it <e> <s> after all it began as an alternative to the amendment <e> <s> do not let us kid ourselves it did begin as an alternative <e> <s> it was originally put forward as an alternative so let us be quite clear <e> <s> if we now go putting it in we are putting in the alternative to the one we have already carried and we are offering other people a chance of considering two alternatives <e> <s> if that is not a subterfuge i do not know what is <e>", "<cs> as one who has served in many governments but who no longer has any hopes and who fell foul of the noble viscount over the language that i was alleged to have used may i say how much i believe that he has done the right thing <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords as the foreign secretary who in the name of both houses of parliament and on behalf of the country actually laid the application by this country to join europe may i ask the minister to make it clear to all noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are in europe we shall be in the world and there is no other continent we have ever been in but europe <e> <s> may i ask the minister quite seriously to make it plain that we speak as europeans <e> <s> we would love to have the spaniards and the portuguese alongside us <e> <s> we shall solve the economic problems as we go <e> <s> but can we for once the prime minister does not but can we for once speak as what we have always been europeans and recognise that the rest of europe would prefer us rather than france germany or anyone else to lead them <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that two remarks he has made must be considered bothersome even to him when he reads them tomorrow <e> <s> first he said that employment in service industries has risen by i think million he also said that our investment in that had increased enormously <e> <s> a little later in answer to the noble lord who is sitting below me he said that exports of food and drink and he was involved in drink had increased enormously <e> <s> i mean in the production of drink my lord chancellor not what you choose to think <e> <s> perhaps he knows his colleague better than i do <e> <s> these two matters take <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that these two matters bother those of us concerned with manufacturing either on the capitalist side the provision of capital or on the labour side the provision of labour <e> <s> they bother us most <e> <s> of all the figures that the noble lord has given there is nothing that can possibly disprove that when our population is greater than ever we are moving from a manufacturing country to a service industry country which cannot possibly support the population <e> <s> would he please ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i am talking too long but it is worth it <e> <s> would the noble lord please note that all these figures show that great britain which built itself great as an industrial manufacturing country is trying to become a switzerland when it cannot possibly be one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness to convey to sir geoffrey howe the foreign secretary the regret of two of us sitting in this house at the moment the noble lord lord maclehose and myself that it should be sir geoffrey who is credited with an agreement which we made in with the then spanish foreign secretary but which we were not allowed to carry through by the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx and the then labour cabinet on the ground not that the agreement was wrong but that one should not do such a thing with a fascist dictator <e> <s> we were told we would have to wait until there was a social democratic prime minister in spain <e> <s> they now have one a good one <e> <s> i am therefore first delighted and secondly i say to all my colleagues above me on the gangway do not go back on what at that time you thought was right but did not want to do with franco which obviously i understand <e> <s> you thought it right then let us stick with it now felipe gonzlez needs our help <e> <s> this is one way we can give it to him <e> <s> thank heavens the foreign secretary never said in the case of gibraltar that the wishes of the inhabitants had to be paramount <e> <s> that is what has saved us from making the same mistake in gibraltar as we have made in the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that in those of us who are old enough to remember went through exactly the same situation <e> <s> there was no mr macgregor there was a scargill then called a j cook <e> <s> exactly the same problem arose <e> <s> is he aware that it took nine months to solve it <e> <s> is he aware that it was solved only because the tuc then had a man called ernest bevin who was willing to face them down and did <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister willing to remind the noble lord lord beswick that the noble lord lord beswick and i were once radicals <e>", "<cs> we were set upon creating precedents <e> <s> finally is the minister aware that whether the macgregor appointment was right or wrong at the time whether the terms were right or wrong at the time our business now is to do as bevin did in we have to face scargill down as bevin faced cook down <e>"]
