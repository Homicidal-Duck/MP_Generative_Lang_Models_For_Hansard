["<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord lord tanlaw has put down this unstarred question on this very important matter which i think it is vital that parliament should debate before we go into recess <e> <s> i agree if i may say so with a great deal of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i must first congratulate the noble earl lord gowrie on his appointment as minister of state for employment <e> <s> i am glad that the noble earl will also act as i understand as a spokesman for the department of energy although i am sorry that there will be no actual departmental minister in this house <e> <s> this is of course no reflection on the noble earl <e> <s> lord gowrie who indeed used to say the same sort of thing to me as an energy spokesman when he was in opposition <e> <s> but then the last labour government had a much smaller team although this did include an energy minister at one time <e> <s> the new government now number noble lords in this house including seven ministers of state and three parliamentary under-secretaries <e> <s> but my lords in spite of this galaxy of rank and talent there is no departmental spokesman for what is basically one of the most important departments of all since energy resources are surely fundamental to the future of any advanced country <e> <s> moreover there is a great deal of technical knowledge and expertise on the back benches of your lordships house as i found when i was the government spokesman <e> <s> i hope therefore that this omission will be rectified before long <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government whether they are to continue the r d expenditure amounting to about million given by the previous government or will that be a victim of the economy axe <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government confirm that they will continue the previous labour governments policy of a per cent <e> <s> participation by bnoc and adequate control over our national oil reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble earl agree that it was only because of the previous labour governments policy that the present government are now able to make arrangements to accept oil in kind rather than in cash <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of what the noble earl lord lauderdale has said is it not a fact that the bnocs per cent <e> <s> participation does not give it an overriding role as regards policy decisions and it acts only as an adviser and is not concerned with regulating contracts <e> <s> that of course is in the bnocs annual report as a statement of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that in the course of this review the government will not consider handing back control of the north sea to the multinational oil companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl lord gowrie that we have had a very good debate and i should like to thank noble lords from all parts of the house who took part in it <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble earl lord gowrie for his careful attention to all the points raised including mine and i should like to congratulate him on both his speeches but particularly on his winding-up speech <e> <s> having taken part from that dispatch box i know myself how difficult it is to cover all the points raised in the fairly short time available and i should like to congratulate him on the way he did it and on his attention to all the points raised <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government to confirm that they do not intend to sell off the north sea assets of the british gas corporation and that they will continue to encourage a british presence in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that the present arrangements will include the per cent <e> <s> participation agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of what my noble friend has said will the noble earl confirm that the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government if they agree that their present answer is rather more encouraging than ones given so far during this parliament <e> <s> will the government confirm that they intend to maintain national control over the depletion rate as happened before <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the second question which is to confirm that they will continue to maintain national control over the depletion rate of our oil or will they let it rip <e>", "<cs> my lords these three reports are most relevant to the current energy problems that face us in europe and i am glad that the house has been given the opportunity to debate them before the recess <e> <s> we are most grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for initiating this debate and to both him and to my noble friend lord lovell-davis for introducing these reports <e>", "<cs> my lords these were figures published the other day in the press by the electricity council that due to the shortage of oil the demand for electricity is nearly eight times as high as in the same period last year <e> <s> this is of course for central heating <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to confirm that the government will retain the labour governments ring fence on north sea profits made by the multinationals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not confirm that during the fourth round without the ring fence million annually would have been lost to the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble earl the minister for explaining the purposes of this order <e> <s> i understand that as the noble earl has said these powers have already been used to provide formulae valuation for electricity gas and railway undertakings in scotland and also for the post offices scottish telecommunications network <e> <s> as the noble earl has said formulae valuation on broadly similar lines for docks and harbours has already been introduced in england and wales and is i understand operating satisfactorily <e> <s> i have no detailed points to raise on the order and i hope that your lordships will approve it <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order the noble earl must move the first order he cannot move both orders together <e> <s> he must move the first order standing in his name although the house gave him permission to speak to both <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was probably under a misapprehension <e> <s> i have presented many of these orders from where the noble earl is sitting now <e> <s> the noble earl has two orders in his name on the order paper <e> <s> the house gave him permission to speak to both of the orders and he very properly spoke to both of them <e> <s> in fact he spoke to them the other way round but that is a small matter <e> <s> however at the end of his speech he should have moved the first order standing in his name <e> <s> that would then be dealt with and then he should move the second order formally if he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble earl for repeating so clearly the statement which is being made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> it is certainly not as sweeping as it might have been if one remembers the conservative election manifesto but no doubt the government have had second thoughts as they begin to know more about the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down the point i was trying to make was this i concede immediately that the officials of the department are very valuable advisers who gave me a great deal of advice but we thought it was important that the government should be advised by oil men with direct experience who are actually working in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i must say that i have frequently paid tribute to the private sector and its important role in the north sea which we on this side of the house recognise <e> <s> i have said that frequently in our debates on this subject <e> <s> unfortunately we did not have the advantage of the noble lords presence at the time <e>", "<cs> they would not win it now <e>", "<cs> my lords is it intended to restrict private investment in bnoc to british companies and british citizens so that control does not pass into the hands of foreigners <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the government have said that they have no present plans to sell off bnocs north sea assets will they also confirm that they have no future plans either so that since their very commendable u-turn the first i hope of many the oilfields may remain safe <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government hear in mind that the ever rising price of paraffin combined with the governments abolition of the electricity discount scheme will probably fall very heavily on the poorest sections of the community this winter <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of what the noble viscount said may i ask the government whether they are aware of the very great work that mr red adair and his team from texas did in capping the ekofisk blow-out work for which we are all indebted <e> <s> what are her majestys government doing to ensure that a british team is trained for this very important work should a similar emergency arise in our waters <e> <s> i am sure that the government would agree that this is too important a matter to be left to individual companies <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government do something in the leasehold sector <e> <s> bearing in mind that it was largely due to them that security of tenure was put on in the early s would they look into the leasehold sector <e> <s> where people who have had houses on long leases sometimes for or years and who would be entitled to leasehold enfranchisement cannot take it up because of the enormous sums sometimes over that they are being asked to pay for a new lease <e> <s> that is causing great distress <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that very often when a householder spends a lot of money on putting in insulation in order to conserve energy the rating authorities then come along and increase the rateable value <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he will try to do something about this <e> <s> in the department of energy there was great concern but we were not able to do anything with his department <e> <s> can he try to have more success than i had <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is important that the house should have some information from the government about their policy in this field especially as there has been a good deal of press speculation lately <e> <s> it is also of the utmost importance as the noble lord lord campbell said that we should begin to have some idea of our national energy objectives and policy over the next two or three decades otherwise standards of life as we know them will become increasingly difficult to maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says when the need is there <e> <s> are the government not aware that effective insulation is very important for the conservation programme in an energy crisis on which all our future prosperity depends <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this happen already <e> <s> if a valuable work of art from a private collection is on loan to a national museum is not that indemnified by the government <e> <s> it always used to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord <e> <s> i am very glad that the government have done something with which we can agree <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government not agree that wherever the converter station is located nevertheless an electricity link with france will be of great benefit to our two countries <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble earl lord gowrie for repeating that statement <e> <s> we agree with the general point made at the beginning of the statement that it will be difficult if not impossible to meet this countrys long-term energy needs without a sizeable contribution from nuclear power <e> <s> on the other hand there is considerable public disquiet about nuclear installations and i welcome the fact as confirmed in the statement that the government attach overriding importance to nuclear safety and that they want to ensure that the lessons of events at three mile island have been learnt <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the wise words of the late lord brabazon that if you cannot say what you want to say in minutes you should go away and write a book about it <e>", "<cs> it has been done away with my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this has been a very good hard-hitting and well-informed debate <e> <s> having had the great good fortune to hear every speech and to have been on this bench since pm <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will be glad to hear that i intend to say very little at this stage <e> <s> i must comment briefly on what the noble lord lord orr-ewing said about the timing of this debate <e> <s> he implied somehow that we put our motion down after the debate had been arranged in another place <e> <s> in fact our motion was put down about days ago long before the debate in the other place <e> <s> however it does not really matter <e> <s> what is important is that the government must by now realise the amount of feeling that there is in both houses and throughout the country about these increases <e> <s> as my noble friend lord kaldor said there has been a barrage of criticism <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill was perfectly correct when he said that the government have had a very bad press <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount answers for the whole government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government whether they are aware that if it had not been for the timely intervention of mr geoffrey rippon the glc would have allowed the property developers to demolish almost the whole of covent garden <e> <s> will the noble lord ask his right honourable friend the present secretary of state to try and carry on in the spirit of mr rippons excellent example and try to save this hall because as the noble lord lord avebury has said its preservation is supported by the victorian society the civic trust and many other amenity societies <e> <s> will he do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble lords answer may i ask him whether he will take his original answer a little further and confirm that the government have no intention of introducing museum charges into the national museums and galleries in view of the almost universal hostility which their original proposal engendered <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble earl for moving this order and for explaining its purposes <e> <s> i understand that it passed through another place yesterday and we certainly do not intend to oppose it <e> <s> i accept the reasons for it <e> <s> i should like to raise one or two points arising out of it <e> <s> is it a fact that for the year ended st march the authoritys accounts were still in surplus to the extent of <e> <s> while the accumulated surplus of income and expenditure account at <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how indebted we are to my noble friend lord northfield for initiating this debate on the fast breeder reactor which as my noble friend said was not discussed by your lordships in our previous debate <e> <s> i must say that the attitude coming today from the liberal front bench is rather different from the one that we have become used to in our previous energy debates <e> <s> i note what the noble lord lord avebury said it is a point of view but i do not think it is one that is at all realistic as i shall hope to show <e> <s> my noble friend lord northfield is a member of the council of europe and for all of us who take a realistic view of future energy requirements unlike the noble lord lord avebury it is most reassuring that the draft resolution comes down fairly and squarely in favour of keeping open the option for the fast breeder with the reservation that recourse to fast breeder technologies in europe should be taken only after wide democratic debate <e> <s> as my noble friend says this is a most significant resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with the proponents of the low-energy society is that they look back to sunny happy days before the industrial revolution when they are usually in the manor house and not in the cottage or they are riding in the rickshaw with someone else drawing them along between the shafts <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government also make representations concerning the protection of the indians living in these forests whose numbers have been considerably reduced in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords if the regional orchestras are to be cut will the government confirm that they will now not require the arts council to cut the already meagre grants to the national orchestras <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all very glad that the noble earl lord lauderdale has put down this motion since conservation must play an important part in any future energy policy <e> <s> when the noble earl said with a charming slip of the tongue that he hoped the debate would not last for two and a half years i was reminded of one noble lord now long since dead about whom it used to be said that his speeches seemed to last for three weeks although in actual fact they only took days <e> <s> i congratulate the noble earl for having managed to attract a good many speakers to his motion <e> <s> i shall try not to be guilty and to speak as briefly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of confirmation given in the other place about members of another place will the noble lord confirm that no member of this house is having his telephone tapped in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the original intentions of the leasehold enfranchisement act were very drastically altered during the short parliament of by the party of the noble lord to require the market price of the house to be charged at the end of the lease <e> <s> will he consider this so that the original <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that up to this change people were able to buy the freehold of their houses for only a thousand or two pounds if they had been there a long time whereas now others in the same street whose long leases are coming to an end are being asked <e> <s> does the noble lord think that that is equitable <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of what my noble friend has said will the noble lord confirm that with regard to the scarcity value with regulated tenancies it is clearly laid down under section of the act that this should not be taken into account <e> <s> will he confirm that it is the governments intention not to rescind this particular piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i should like to say how grateful we are to the noble lord lord sherfield for moving that the house takes note of this report <e> <s> i had the privilege of serving on the sub-committee under if i may say so the noble lords able and distinguished chairmanship and as the noble lord has said we were well served by our technical advisers and our clerk <e> <s> i should also like to add my thanks to his to all those who gave evidence either written or oral <e>", "<cs> my lords as the notices about possible heavy fines which are displayed in many of the streets of london seem to have absolutely no deterrent effect may i ask the noble lord whether a single prosecution has ever taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bring to the attention of the rent tribunals the fact that scarcity value should not be taken into account <e> <s> will they also take account of the fact that vastly increased rents are probably a more inflationary measure than anything else and that their present policy if they do not change it is leading to the increasing foreignisation of the inner residential area of london <e> <s> perhaps they like this <e>", "<cs> my lords acknowledging the great work done by the national coal boards research station at stoke orchard and remembering that very little research work of this kind was done by the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord has said why is it that the department of the environments new proposals do not include any requirement for floor insulation <e> <s> why do they allow for example architects to trade off wall insulation against roof insulation <e> <s> how does the noble lord think that this will help the nations conservation programme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that these are the department of the environments own proposals <e> <s> does he not realise that <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that due to their lack of action companies manufacturing insulation materials are laying off men and that there are very heavy redundancies now in employment <e> <s> do they think that this is consistent with their policy of trying to conserve energy with the ever-increasing costs of petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to confirm that the government will do all they can to encourage the home-grown timber industry in the united kingdom so that we do not have to rely quite so heavily on imports from finland and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the agreed code of practice over disconnections will be sympathetically adhered to as people with lower incomes are finding it increasingly difficult to pay their fuel bills with the escalating costs since the present government came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the late lord methuen who was not only a very respected member of this house but also a distinguished artist arranged for the bath academy of art to be located in his beautiful house corsham court and that the students have greatly benefited by those surroundings and the contents of the house <e> <s> will the government do their utmost to make representations to the avon education authority conveying to them the grave disquiet of many distinguished artists at the move that is contemplated <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government consider introducing a pound coin since this would be more difficult to deface and would also take account of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is the governments unrealistic financial policy that is leading to pit closures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider increasing the financial limits that they have placed upon the coal industry to a more realistic level <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble earl has said may i ask the government whether they are aware that if productive pits are sacrificed on the altar of short-term monetary fanaticism they will not be easily forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with the leave of the house since i am taking part in part ii of the bill which is just as complicated as part i which is coming before your lordships today i may endorse what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government are so furtive about this bill why they cannot be more open about it <e> <s> i absolve at once the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> we know very well that this is not his personal decision but a decision made by his right honourable friends in another place <e> <s> but this is a very complicated bill <e> <s> it is of great interest to a great many private tenants outside this house who wish to understand it <e> <s> they wish to know how the government are proposing to change the various contracts of tenure which they are intending to do in the bill <e> <s> they want to understand the bill <e>", "<cs> wasting time <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the government cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> as i said before it would have been much better if they had started this new experiment with empty properties and allowed security of tenure on existing inhabited dwellings <e> <s> i do not think that they have any idea of the sense of insecurity that they are bringing to people who do not own houses but who live in these dwellings <e> <s> when they go into a dwelling of this kind they do not know how long they will be there it may be one year three years four years or five years <e> <s> they will be there entirely at the whim of the landlord who of course will bring all kinds of pressures to bear upon them in other ways in respect of not going to the rent officer and so on <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this series of amendments was effectively to give the shorthold tenant the option to remain where the landlord intends to continue renting and where there is no reason why if he is a good tenant the landlord should not continue renting to him <e> <s> however clearly they are not acceptable to the government and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord he is always so courteous <e> <s> what happens if somebody wants to move who is at present a regulated tenant <e> <s> the only choice that he will have will he buying a house probably at a price he cannot afford or becoming a shorthold tenant <e> <s> what protection is that for regulated tenants <e> <s> the government assume that people will remain in their dwellings for the rest of their byes <e> <s> people have to move <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i must say that i think the noble lord lord evans has a point here <e> <s> i do not want to repeat the excellent arguments that he has put forward but i may say that should fears on this question seem exaggerated it is worth noting that a survey by shelter in and of local authorities policies regarding applicants coming out of out-of-season lettings showed that four authorities as policy judged all such applicants as intentionally homeless <e> <s> also in a regional newspaper the local health and housing officer was reported as saying that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the government three questions on clause <e> <s> i am bound to ask these questions because as we said at the beginning of this committee stage they have not made <e>", "<cs> i think that the governments amendment goes some way although it does not go far enough <e> <s> we shall probably deal in more detail with the service charges when we come to schedule <e> <s> but i may say that as a result of one case i think that it was <e>", "<cs> we should be grateful to accept the noble lords offer <e>", "<cs> the amendment to leave out clause is not to be moved <e>", "<cs> i think this amendment will greatly strengthen schedule and we welcome it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord janner for what he has said and also to the noble earl lord kinnoull who knows a great deal about this subject <e> <s> there are many good landlords but i am afraid that there are some bad ones <e> <s> as the noble earl lord kinnoull said the question of service charges has to be seen in the context of the apartment houses of london and some of the other cities <e> <s> ten or years ago we allowed what were ordinary rented flats which went up in an orderly way and which were run in what i call a dolphin square way indeed in the way dolphin square is still run to be acquired and suddenly to become long leaseholds <e> <s> this happened in a very few years but what we did not do was to back it up with a proper system of law <e> <s> the french have owned their flats for most of this century and a lot of the last but they have a proper system of law <e> <s> the tenants there own the freehold of the flats <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak also to no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree that the figure of is derisory and i think is more realistic <e> <s> we felt that was probably more appropriate in these days but there we are if the government want and it is not a sufficient deterrent perhaps they will consider putting it up later <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i think it is very important to have this on the record particularly for people outside who are very interested and affected by this <e> <s> we are grateful and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we will study carefully what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i support what the noble earl has said <e> <s> the explanatory and financial memorandum attached to this bill is one of the most laconic and brief that i have ever read <e> <s> it is no help at all <e> <s> i hope that the government will consider this in the future <e> <s> may i repeat the plea that i made before that they will publish a plain mans guide or perhaps i ought to say also a plain womans guide to this complicated legislation <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord evans has said gives me the opportunity to ask the government what in general they are intending to do about leasehold reform <e> <s> a century ago vast areas of birmingham cardiff london and other industrial cities were developed on -year leases <e> <s> these are now beginning to fall in or will fall in within the next few years <e> <s> i think it is true to say that in london which i know well there are very few freehold houses at all <e> <s> there are only the houses which are clustered round what were the old villages and they are rare <e> <s> these leases are expiring and will be expiring in very great numbers <e> <s> there will be thousands of houses where the leaseholds will be running out and many elderly leaseholders are faced with an extremely worrying choice between buying the freehold extending their lease or being thrown into the insecurity of the private rented sector <e>", "<cs> i accept that but people did sometimes buy houses or years ago which is a long time and at that time it was an accident really whether you bought a freehold or a very long leasehold <e> <s> if you were unfortunate enough to come down on the side of buying a long leasehold house now at the end of your life you are probably finding that it is beginning to run out <e> <s> i know there is a lot to he said on both sides <e> <s> as i mentioned before in the case of the rented fiats and the large mansion blocks in london this is a problem which the government ought to take on board because thousands thousands and thousands of long leasehold houses granted years ago are <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must move it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the troubles that the amount of time allowed for the pedestrian to cross is much too short <e> <s> will the government consider recommending that there should be a longer time span to cross the road <e> <s> would they not agree that at least a few more seconds would not really inconvenience motorists very much <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the question may i ask the noble lord the premier baron what the government are proposing to do about these huge continental juggernauts which are shaking our beautiful cathedral cities and villages to pieces <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said this is a problem <e> <s> of course one of the troubles is that many of these leases were signed some years ago with standard wording which was used in more spacious should i perhaps say more gentlemanly days when these blocks of flats were owned by old family trusts and so on <e> <s> there was never any problem <e> <s> but now the wording is being interpreted in a most ruthless way to extort all sorts of sums large sums from tenants and i have seen some of these letters <e> <s> they are threatened with the forfeiture of their lease if they do not pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he said and implied that i did not bring forward any cases <e> <s> i did refer to one case and indeed this was referred to in another place where in a block of flats in central london the tenants were asked to pay a substantial capital expenditure for future repairs <e> <s> the block was sold and the funds so collected were mysteriously whisked away the tenants being asked by the new landlord to pay that money again and they had to go to court <e> <s> all the amendment seeks to do is to see that tenants money is accounted for separately <e> <s> it is not seeking to stop sinking funds or to do any of the other things over service charges that we have discussed at length in committee <e> <s> all it is doing is earmarking the tenants money in a separate account which they themselves will control jointly with the landlord <e> <s> this is an important amendment and we must press it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what my noble friend lady birk and the noble lord lord evans have said <e> <s> only last sunday i happened to meet a lady in fact i sat next to her at a luncheon party an elderly lady who has lived in a very small flat in the centre of london for years <e> <s> she told me that the building has recently been taken over by one of these big property companies and they are doing their utmost to persuade her to move from her flat because they want to amalgamate it with a neighbouring flat and make a large penthouse as i think they are called <e> <s> they have offered her carpets curtains and so on to move to a slightly larger flat for much about the same rent <e> <s> what they said to her wasof course you will have equal security <e> <s> you are a regulated tenant at present and when you move to your new flat you will still be a regulated tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted carefully what the noble lord lord bellwin and the noble lord lord monson have said <e> <s> i think i probably know the conservative manifesto better than the noble lord himself <e> <s> he doubted whether what i said was accurate <e> <s> perhaps i might read him the actual words <e> <s> this is how the copywriter put it <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends how one interprets the wording but i should not like to ask the conservative party to adhere to their manifesto any more than any other political party <e> <s> i have noted what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am disappointed that the government are going so fast <e> <s> i think it would be much better if they had brought in this experiment in a restricted way but in view of the fact that they will not meet me i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord barnby referred to the rent act which is of course dated only <e>", "<cs> my lords these are very useful amendments considerable improvements to the bill and we welcome them <e>", "<cs> i support what was said by the noble lord lord hooson and what was said on a previous amendment by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> this gives me the opportunity to ask the government what type of people they will invite to be members of this commission <e> <s> we have heard a lot about the three wise men <e> <s> of all the modern clichs that is the one i dislike the most <e> <s> it assumes that someone who is eminent in one sphere has a monopoly of wisdom in another <e> <s> the press council for example has experience of press work and i hope that when the members of this commission are chosen they may be eminent but they will at least have their feet on the ground and have some experience of television and of how the ordinary viewer watches and the interest he takes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what time the first bus will start in the morning <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the first tube

difficulties stems <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment to which i have added my name <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has said the immense short- and long-term savings in energy consumption which could result from insulation of the nations housing stock are recognised by both the government and independent analysts yet progress towards high national levels of insulation has been slow and patchy <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont mentioned loft insulation and i too have referred to that in previous debates <e> <s> today i should like to say a few words about double glazing <e> <s> a study of the usage of multiple glazing in the eec at the request of the eec commission shows that the potential energy conservation achieved by further double glazing in europe amounts to between and per cent of the european annual energy consumption that is just for double glazing <e> <s> it also shows-and i am sorry to keep on saying this that the united kingdom lags substantially behind every other member state in usage of double glazing and in the encouragement of double glazing by incentive tax concessions and grants <e> <s> the survey also showed that there are no climatic reasons for this differential <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask the noble earl in view of what he said about double glazing why it is that in every european country on the continent the incentives apply to all forms of domestic insulation whereas the grants available in this country exclude double glazing <e> <s> our partners on the continent attach importance to this <e> <s> this seems to be a case where the united kingdom is the only one in step <e>", "<cs> not all of them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lord beaumont has said under the act it is the central duty of the central electricity generating board to provide an efficient co-ordinated and economical system of supply of electricity <e>

conservation has changed in that quarter of a century <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley has said <e> <s> i agree with him that the title is misleading

amendment from the government <e> <s> we shall look forward to seeing it on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is likely to be a world uranium shortage early in the next century would the government agree that a fast breeder reactor policy is probably essential for our future energy requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to all that the noble lord the chairman of committees has said but would ask whether this proposal with regard to amendments on third reading refers also to government amendments <e> <s> because very often a government amendment is put down on third reading

water rights of millers who had either to shut down or to obtain a licence and pay water rates <e> <s> the various water authorities have been using quite different yardsticks for calculating these rates <e> <s> the problem is not that the charges generally have been exorbitant in fact the noble earl said at an earlier stage that three out of the water authorities in england and wales do not charge for abstraction but they are there and they could become so at any time <e> <s> one region as i said at an earlier stage had to pay a very large amount <e> <s> this was increased from i think to overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government do something to try to speed up the immigration points and the entry points and are they aware that it takes much longer to gain entry at heathrow than say at paris where one can often go through the immigration point within a few minutes of disembarking whereas in london it takes anything from half an hour to an hour <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but why do holders of british passports have to be subjected to long delay when arriving in their own country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from this side of the house to congratulate the right reverend prelate for bringing this bill to this stage of the proceedings <e> <s> as i have said throughout it is an excellent bill and if i may say so seems to be a good example of an ecumenical

another place <e> <s> we on this side of the house are very glad that the secretary of state has now agreed to meet with the national coal board and the national union of mineworkers tomorrow for a preliminary meeting <e> <s> to have deferred a meeting until next monday which understand was the original intention of the noble earls right honourable friend would have been far too leisurely <e>

situation will improve but if it does not i must ask the government what the position is regarding coal stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of what the noble earl has said several times now about exports he did not answer my point would he not agree that while the volume of exports has been large the profit has been much less because of the exchange rate <e> <s> this again is as a result of the governments policies <e>", "<cs> my lords although the government have not got any exact statistical evidence would they tell the house if they have any idea whether the births are keeping pace

discussed the housing act <e> <s> it is certainly a revelation to me to find that there are not only absentee landlords but absentee owners of aircraft whom apparently it is impossible to find because they have disappeared to some kind of offshore situation which is the euphemism used for these kinds of owners <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given an account of what happened during the time the bill was before this house <e> <s> the noble earl lord gowrie did move a government amendment on third reading which we felt and i said so at the time was something but did not go far enough <e>

charged <e> <s> what steps are being taken to prevent a recurrence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that until recently it was a long tradition that all our museums in the metropolitan area were always open on bank holidays <e> <s> are they aware of the educational value <e> <s> will they try to do something to get back to the original tradition because this means a great loss particularly to children and young people <e>", "<cs> my lords on the subject of short-holds i wonder whether the noble lord has seen some of the figures given by his right honourable friend in <e>",

supplementary petroleum tax is a positive disincentive to further exploration <e> <s> will they enter into discussions with the oil industry over this matter as several companies are saying that the prospects of return are not commensurate with the investment involved <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for explaining this bill to the house <e> <s> he has done this most competently if i may say so as one would expect but i am sorry that one of the noble lords first bills from the government front bench should be a bill for which there seems to be little

glad to have him here from europe <e> <s> having served in government i have as much respect as he has for the secretaries of state <e> <s> all i was asking is how this can be defined <e> <s> it may be that the secretary of state for energy may not want it <e> <s> he may be overruled by a more powerful department say the foreign office who might want to have this sale <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord why a helicopter could not have been used <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the

startling about this it is part of our democratic procedures and they are procedures which i hope will long continue <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord skelmersdale asked why this company should remain

the fusion of scientific talent and research associated with the atomic energy authority <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why i think it is of importance that the company should remain closely linked with the aea <e> <s> i can understand why the government do not want to increase their borrowing capacity because the psbr has gone up so greatly since they came into power and started

stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept that too <e> <s> we would be prepared to have the report received today provided that we are given an adequate interval of i think at least a fortnight before third reading <e> <s> then at third reading we shall have the answer for which i asked from the noble lord lord skelmersdale so that the third reading will not be merely formal but we

just briefly congratulate the noble lord in piloting his small ship safely into port <e> <s> this seems to be a case of youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm if i may say so because this totally unneecessary privatisation of a successful and profitable public company such as amersham is little more than a piece of government self-indulgence and <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware

situation are the government aware that the present excessive tax rgime is a positive disincentive to exploration in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords when considering the representations made by the oil industry about the excessive tax rgime will the government also bear in mind the question of the short-term fields <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the increased grant may i ask the government whether more financial help could not be given to the national orchestras as these are finding it very difficult to break even at present <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consult with the bbc

sir frank layfield qc as inspector to the inquiry <e> <s> the policy of the last labour government on nuclear energy was to have a continuous programme of nuclear power construction together with the development of the fast breeder reactor which is essential for self-sufficiency in energy on a long-term basis <e> <s> but the need for safety is crucial <e> <s> that cannot be stressed enough <e>",

for example particularly london where very few freehold houses exist <e> <s> they are practically all leasehold because they are the possession of the old ducal estates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether the present government adhere to the view of the previous government which i put forward when i replied to the debate three years ago in your lordships house that most of these so-called sightings can be accounted for as natural phenomena <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the previous question does the noble lord agree that the french get on very well with a central control of the curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government agree that a full inquiry is necessary as the safety of the crew is at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord mansfield for explaining the purpose of the bill which as he said makes provision for government financial support to the coal industry <e> <s> it is an important bill providing investment i do not like the word subsidy in what is perhaps with agriculture our most important basic industry <e> <s> i think that the bill is also somewhat unusual in that it was passed by another place without a division on either its second or its third reading <e> <s> certainly as far as these benches are concerned we shall do nothing to impede its passage particularly as i understand from the point of

view of the energy needs of this country it is a very disappointing statement <e> <s> the national coal boards first application was put in four years ago <e> <s> the inspectors report was submitted a year ago and it has taken a good while for the department of the environment which i understand made the decision to make up its mind <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government whether they think that any of these ufos are manned spacecraft coming from a planet outside the solar system as is believed by the ufologists <e>", "<cs> my lords following what my noble friend has said are the government also aware that a great proportion of this money also goes to help music and the arts out of all proportion to the small peripheral publications which are mentioned in the question <e>",

matter and it is one that we shall have to press <e>", "<cs> it is some comfort to have the reassurances of the government as described by the noble lord but as my noble friend lord ross has said this

of the reasons that they gave for not being able to go on with this project was the onerous tax regime <e> <s> will the government consider this and do something about it because the whole of our production from the north sea as the noble earl has said is beginning to become in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that ukooa are on record as saying that they are very disappointed with the budget since it contained absolutely nothing for them <e> <s> they put up a very strong case last autumn to the chancellor which i have seen and very little action seems to have been taken on it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether it is true that there was a cut last year in the fusion research project and in view of the importance <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of what the noble earl has said is he aware that the very high tax rate is becoming a disincentive to sales as it is putting whisky particularly malt whisky beyond the reach of the ordinary consumer will the government do something about this or will they allow the whisky industry to be run down in company with so many other industries since they came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the government are aware that building societies are finding it very difficult to carry on their traditional role due to increasing competition from the banks

collections were given to the victoria and albert muxeum on the understanding that a theatre museum would be established <e> <s> furthermore may i also ask him whether he is aware that there is great concern in many quarters about the attitude shown in the rayner scrutiny report to this particular project and will the government confirm that whatever happens it will not be scrapped <e>", "<cs> my

present minister whose heart we know is in the right place <e> <s> it was to have been started later this year and now it has been postponed pending a decision on rayner <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether the government are aware that the present chinese embassy in portland place has great historical associations for the chinese and they are very anxious that it should be restored to its original state <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister if it is not true that the british embassy in madrid has asked for these spanish service broadcasts to be reinstated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the figure he gave of a sample is a very large sample indeed <e> <s> if extrapolated it makes around listeners <e> <s> that is just as large as the gallup polls on which the government continually rely in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs>

importance <e> <s> is he further aware that it provides an important service in any area where there are not many cultural amenities <e> <s> finally is he aware that this proposal has been received in bethnal green and elsewhere with a sense of outrage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the government are on record as saying that they do not propose to introduce entrance charges to

so as the noble lord is as the house knows the distinguished chairman of sub-committee f which has produced this thorough and far-reaching report <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him if i may on the clear and concise way in which he has introduced this complicated subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to my noble friend lord brockway for tabling this unstarred question for debate this

done for the future of our heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government allow the bbc to re-open the spanish language service <e> <s> are they aware that its absence was bitterly regretted by the british embassy in madrid during the falklands campaign and continues to be regretted considering the attitude of the present spanish government to gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to

agree with him that from time to time we have to try and look at new structures and he of course is the architect of a completely new board of management such as we see at the british library <e> <s> but if i may say so with great respect i think that what the amendment does not do is face up to the question of responsibility <e> <s> it deals with structure <e> <s> the noble viscount i know is very interested in management structure and he elaborated on that in his speech <e> <s> but we come down to the question of who is to be responsible for the objects and the very valuable objects in the museum <e>", "<cs> this is a very interesting suggestion and an attractive amendment <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the speech of the noble lord lord montagu <e> <s> however in spite of all the noble lord said it will cause difficulties <e> <s> to nominate seven out of trustees that is about one-third of the total is rather too many in my submission <e> <s> the other difficulty is that once you start on the nominations path there exist many bodies that are equally worthy to nominate trustees <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and also to my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale with regard to amendment no <e> <s> which is to delete sub-paragraph in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> my noble and learned friend attempted with his tremendous legal experience to give us a gloss on the meaning of this obscure paragraph but even he with all his experience had to admit that he was baffled by part of it <e> <s> in view of this i hope that the government will have another look at it so that it will be made more immediately intelligible <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for his offer and for what the noble viscount has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and also to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble earl has said and i think there is a good deal in what other noble lords have said that perhaps three years off is rather long and that a year might be better <e> <s> i would like to think about it and perhaps we could come back to it at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty <e> <s> i wonder if

withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> well that certainly is some reassurance <e> <s> i must say to my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington that i had much more in mind not so much the case of the

their term of office <e> <s> i know of two people on the advisory council goodness knows why they were appointed by the prime minister of the day it was not this one who never turned up at all <e> <s>

noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly to my noble friend lord hutchinson for what he has said <e> <s> as the noble viscount has said recycling is coming to an end <e> <s> one of the defects of the amendment which i have only really put down as a talking point is that it does not permit enough cross-fertilisation and there are certain advantages perhaps in a trustee being

they may be <e> <s> it is a lazy way of proceeding <e> <s> what we must do is get the people whose job it is to come up with names and suggestions to do some rather more creative thinking <e> <s> with

noble lord lord reigate i support this amendment and i should like to say that my noble friend lady white strongly supports it and is very sorry that she cannot be here tonight to speak on it herself

support this amendment to which i have given my name <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> although it has always been taken that art and design include the

important part of the work of the victoria and albert museum and as i said before during our discussions they are connected closely with the craft work which the royal college of art is doing <e> <s> it was very much a part of prince alberts conception as the noble viscount has said and i warmly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment which i think attractive and which as the noble lord lord reigate said would do a good deal to reconcile the opponents of charges of which i was one during the time of the government <e> <s> the trouble with this has always been that the treasury would never agree to what i think is called hypothecating which is a hideous word <e> <s> the money always has to go into a general pool <e> <s> if the noble earls government

that the contents of these houses which came of course as the committee knows from the dysart and jersey families respectively are at present the property of the victoria and albert museum <e>", "<cs> i should also like to raise the question about the victoria and albert museum library <e> <s> i did not move the amendment to delete subsection of clause because i realised that the wording in question is the same as that in the british museum act which works very well <e> <s> but there is some concern about the governments policy in view of the rayner recommendations <e> <s> these were particularly insensitive and short-sighted concerning the victoria and albert museum library <e> <s> in fact the man who wrote the report did not seem to have the remotest idea about what the library stood for or the service that it carried out <e> <s> the report referred to material of fleeting interest ephemera and so on and advocated a weeding out process <e> <s> of course in an art library of this kind it is very necessary to collect all kinds of material be it ephemera or not such as catalogues of exhibitions of the last century and so on which are very important for dating purposes and for use in art historical research <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government will confirm that they will not accept this section of the rayner report and that the victoria and albert museum will

coat i must respond <e> <s> as he said i was very much against entrance charges to museums but i am not against entrance charges at kew and never have been <e> <s> i think that they are essential for
