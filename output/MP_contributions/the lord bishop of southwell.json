["<cs> my lords i am sure the house would feel it very remiss if there were no comment from these benches in this debate <e> <s> i speak not as one who has any personal responsibility within my church or anywhere else for any of these matters i speak as one who is concerned as a citizen as a christian as a parent and as one who in his own diocese must have some responsibility for seeing that social problems of one kind or another are studied and worked at <e> <s> i am sure the whole house will be grateful to the noble earl lord kimberley for introducing this debate and for the way in which he did it with such clarity and sympathy <e>", "<cs> i wish from these benches to add my support to this group of amendments <e> <s> it happens that i have to hold a fairly lone station here this week as my fellow bishops are all in conclave but i am sure that if they were here i should have more support <e> <s> it seems to me to be a matter of vital importance that the law should be the same on both sides of the border and if i understand the arguments that have been put forward that is the intention of these amendments <e> <s> beyond that there is also the question of humanity and i believe that where one is dealing with accommodation for old people as well as for the handicapped it is right for the government to err on the side of humanity <e> <s> i therefore add my support for these amendments and hope the minister will accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government as we are one of the five united nations contact countries give an assurance that they will not agree to any further delays in a cease-fire and in the implementation of the united nations plans for namibian independence <e> <s> will they further give an undertaking that they will not agree to any electoral reforms which do not recognise the rights of swapo to seek the support of the namibian people <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn i wonder whether i may intervene and ask a question <e> <s> i think the only place where i can profitably ask it is on the wording of this amendment as it straddles both clause and clause <e> <s> it may seem a rather strange point but i should be grateful if the government could help me <e>", "<cs> it would be a mistake to suggest that all such persons are clergymen <e> <s> the vast majority of them will be laymen <e> <s> i take the point which has been made that there are difficulties in drafting a bill to make sure that there are no unseemly loopholes but the majority of persons to whom i am referring are very genuine persons who at present are british citizens <e> <s> they like other people who have gone abroad to serve serve with great devotion the countries to which they go <e> <s> however when they retire they will come back to this country because they have gone out in the service of perhaps a missionary society or the church overseas for a period of time <e> <s> they are not intending to become nationals of that country <e> <s> i hope that we shall receive some assurance on this point <e>", "<cs> may i say that i was intending my remarks to apply not just to the church of england <e> <s> i am not aware that the roman catholic church sends out any missionaries who would be likely to bear children but most of the protestant missionary societies do have married missionaries <e> <s> i hope the committee realises that i am speaking for all the churches and not just the church of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of us taking part in this dedate feel that it is tragic that we should have to debate this issue at all not only because drug addiction destroys those who <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will wish again to congratulate the noble viscount lord buckmaster on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was a very different speech from any other maiden speech i have ever heard and it reminded me of an important fact namely that all too often we forget that considerable minority of people who live among us who have very strong religious beliefs indeed <e> <s> i sometimes wish that the press were as sympathetic towards christian sentiment as they are often towards the sentiment of other religions <e> <s> i think sometimes we are gravely deficient in the way in which we regard the feelings of christian people <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord harvington for initiating this debate <e> <s> it is a difficult debate because it is not easy to define its scope <e> <s> i am told that there are very few people who are totally deaf <e> <s> the great majority of people have a tiny capacity for hearing even if it is almost indistinguishable <e> <s> at the other end of the scale there are few people who do not have some hearing deprivation however small <e> <s> on any estimate therefore the number of people we are talking about this evening is very large indeed as the noble lord said about million <e> <s> as we are not talking about the profoundly deaf for whom there is a lot of sympathy let us note that we are talking about a sizeable minority of the population who do not stand out from the crowd because quite largely there are so many of us that we are not noticed <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that in any assembly not all the members are always in the house in order to vote that the general synod of the church of england is not famed for being unanimous in its votes and that in fact this was rather a rare vote with considerable support for this particular motion being given right across the membership of the house <e> <s> would not the noble lord also agree that it is very difficult for this matter to be raised as a private members bill with any chance of it being looked at seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too begin by congratulating the noble lord lord bottomley on his maiden speech <e> <s> he has an affection as i have for a part of the world which ecclesiastically is called london over the border and where i spent some very happy years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx for initiating this debate and i speaking from these benches should like to add my quota of thanks <e> <s> it is not within the competence of the church to declare which programmes are better suited than others to provide long-term solutions to the problem of unemployment <e> <s> what is within our competence is to comment on the human consequences of any policies and to suggest the kind of criteria which should be borne in mind if we are to act in a responsible way <e> <s> my brief contribution has that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to echo the congratulations and thanks which were offered from this bench by my noble friend the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln to the noble earl lord stockton for what he said to us tonight <e> <s> it was one of those rare parliamentary occasions which i think all of us will treasure all our lives <e> <s> secondly i must apologise to the house for the fact that i cannot stay to the end of the debate <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i am as aware as the noble lord opposite whose name i am afraid i do not know that this is sadly true of some people in the unions <e> <s> i was trying to express what i believe to be the attitude and feeling of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what the noble viscount says <e> <s> i know that this is true <e> <s> the industry has offered a great many assurances of that kind <e>"]
