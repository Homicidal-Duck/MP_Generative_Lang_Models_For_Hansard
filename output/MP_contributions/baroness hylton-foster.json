["<cs> my lords i should like to open my speech by adding my congratulations to those already extended to the noble lord lord adrian upon his most thoughtful and informative speech and i hope that it is but the forerunner of many more to come <e> <s> i welcome the bill for three reasons <e> <s> the first is that i am connected with and interested in research into migraine as well as blindness <e> <s> secondly i believe that the bill should curb the experiments done by irresponsible people <e> <s> my third reason can be expressed in the words of professor hutt counsellor for research and director of the max rayne institute across the water at st thomas hospital <e> <s> professor hutt hopes that the bill will help to demonstrate to the general public that research workers who are often denigrated by prejudiced groups are <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with other noble lords in thanking the right reverend prelate for initiating this very timely debate <e> <s> youth needs helping and it needs encouraging to do something useful which will exercise both body and mind <e> <s> some get into trouble because they are bored some get into trouble because there is no discipline or example in the home and some get into trouble because there is difficulty in getting suitable and satisfying employment <e> <s> therefore i believe that a period of some kind of obligatory possibly voluntary national service would help them to grow up and realise that our welfare state is there to help those in genuine need and is not there just to be used to see what can be got out of it <e> <s> there are so many gaps to be filled with real job satisfaction that volunteers can do and which young people are so very good at <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness reminded me a little while ago about the moorgate disaster <e> <s> the red cross members did not go there in the end to do the first aid that they were expecting to do but were invited to take charge of the care of the relatives of the casualties in the disaster <e> <s> by the time the relatives arrived it was after hours and there were no social workers present so it fell to these mature boys and girls to look after the relatives and to try to help and advise them as to what they should do the following morning where they should go to find out about death grants pensions mortgages and many other things <e> <s> this was after they had taken the relatives to sort out the belongings of the casualties the deceased <e> <s> they then took them to the mortuary to identify the bodies some of which were dismembered <e> <s> i feel that this was an example of the support and guidance of more mature people being such a very great help to the young graduates who although trained in all these matter because they are still young are very apt to be emotionally upset when confronted with very distressing cases <e> <s> i would point out that in social work continuity is of tremendous importance and the young do like to move around <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness lady young to bear these points in <e>", "<cs> my lords it was at the last cross-bench peers meeting that i was asked to convey to the noble lord lord soames our very warm congratulations on his splendid achievement <e> <s> we should like to extend our appreciation also to lady soames who must have been such a tremendous help to him during this time <e> <s> i am sure that my colleagues here would not think me out of order if i said that we are also very appreciative of what the noble earl lord ferrers has done in the absence of the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> we welcome lord and lady soames back very warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like to confirm that the present delegation that was in afghanistan which was an international committee of the red cross delegation have been recalled to geneva for consultations and probably when those consultations are over those delegates will be back again in afghanistan doing their very difficult and sometimes rather dangerous job looking after the detainees <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that any publicity or pressure at the present moment would be likely only to hinder the international committee of the red cross in the very delicate negotiations which are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords sitting on the cross-benches are very happy to be associated with the terms of the motion proposed by the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> cross-benchers are jealous of their position as independents and they do not normally speak with one voice but there are always exceptional occasions and i am delighted to say that there is no doubt about their unity today in their devotion to her majesty the queen mother <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say just a few words about what is expected of the three voluntary aid organisations <e> <s> we understand that we are to man the first-aid posts <e> <s> however we have not the remotest idea how many there are throughout the country or their locations <e> <s> will the noble lord be bringing any pressure to bear on local authorities and whatever the appropriate authority in the health service now is to encourage them to tell us what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give any indication as to whether the voluntary organisations are likely to get any financial help towards the additional training of the public that they are going to be asked to undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that this is an occasion when the cross-bench peers would also like to be associated with the good wishes and congratulations from this house to his royal highness the prince of wales on this happy occasion of his engagement to the lady diana spencer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that apart from teaching first-aid in schools which is already done by the red cross one of the most important things is to educate the public <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it would be a great help if the government were to advise the public to take advantage of the courses currently being run by the two voluntary aid societies st john and red cross so that they could learn the importance of not moving a patient with a back injury until professional help arrives <e>", "<cs> do ambulance personnel undergo regular refresher training to keep up with ever-changing modern techniques my lords <e>", "<cs> having listened to excellent speeches on both sides of this question i am still not satisfied that i feel i am safe if i wear my seat belt <e> <s> i should like to say why <e> <s> it is a personal reason like that of the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> i was in an aircraft that crashed and i could not be got out because the buckle of my seat belt buckled <e> <s> had the plane burnt i should have been burnt to a cinder and not be addressing your lordships today <e> <s> i should like to make two suggestions <e> <s> one is that if we are to have seat belts and many people wear them and i wear them myself sometimes although they are not comfortable i think they ought to be standardised and then we should not have to puzzle how to put the seat belt on how to take it off how to make it comfortable for then it would be the same in any kind of car that one got into <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those sitting on the cross-benches will want to be associated with the feelings of thankfulness that no harm came to her majesty the queen on this occasion and also to express our congratulations on her courage at this very difficult time <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment but i have reservations about the type of release device <e> <s> i think one would have to leave that to the experts but with respect i suggest that the release device selected must be something which both the rescuer and driver can get hold of in a crisis so probably it should be connected at the point where the seat belt is attached to the car on the left- or right-hand side of the car according to where it is fixed and not down between the seats <e> <s> as noble lords will agree some seat belts are difficult enough to unfasten anyway <e> <s> indeed it is sometimes almost impossible to get out of them in the dark particularly if one is in a strange car <e> <s> i therefore feel that if some quick release device were invented and standardised then if we are to have the compulsory wearing of seat belts that would be a considerable reassurance to those who have to wear them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment although it does not go as far as i should have liked <e> <s> as some of your lordships know i should like seat belts to be standardised but i have a feeling that the noble lord lord lucas will tell me that the manufacturers are either not able or prepared to do that <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether the government could not consider that this amendment is a very moderate one <e> <s> if it was accepted perhaps it would give more members of the public the confidence to wear seat belts <e> <s> after all if they wore them because they were not uncomfortable were easy to put on and even more easy to take off it would mean that more people would wear them and surely there would be fewer problems for the police <e> <s> i do not believe that the police could possibly deal with this situation at the moment <e> <s> they have far too many and far more important matters on their hands than to worry about whether or not we are wearing seat belts <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords sitting on the cross-benches wish to be associated very warmly with the terms of the motion proposed by the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> there is perhaps an added pleasure for them in doing so since it was from these benches that his royal highness made his very eloquent maiden speech on sport and leisure <e> <s> the marriage of the heir to the throne is of course a happy family occasion but inevitably has wider significance also <e> <s> it will bring great joy to the nation as a whole to the commonwealth and to all those throughout the world to whom his royal highness has endeared himself during his many visits and travels <e> <s> we wish his royal highness and lady diana spencer every happiness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those sitting on the cross benches would also like to be associated with the tributes already paid to the noble lord lord soames who as a most distinguished leader of this house was as has already been said the leader for us all irrespective of party or no party <e> <s> we thank him for a job well done and wish him well <e> <s> we also wish to congratulate and welcome the noble baroness lady young and wish her well with her new and very great responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support the noble lord lord chelwood on this amendment <e> <s> i was brought up within sound of the call of the curlew and it was always regarded as absolute sacrilege if anybody shot one <e> <s> when i was in scotland this year i listened for curlews i knew it was past the time for their wonderful call but i asked why i heard so few and i was told that there were many fewer <e> <s> i only wish that the habitat of the curlew could be extended to many more places because i do not think it does any harm and with due respect to the noble lord opposite i do not think it should be considered for eating <e> <s> i think it would be sacrilege to do so and therefore i very much support the noble lord lord chelwood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those sitting on the cross-benches would also like to be associated with yesterdays tributes and with the message of sympathy to mrs bradford and her family as expressed by the noble baroness the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it was the funds of the joint committee of st john and the red cross and that they used their capital to rebuild and extend the hospital which was knocked down by a land mine in <e> <s> is he further aware that they now need those buildings for sheltered workshops and to expand the craft employment which is now being done there in collaboration with the local authority <e> <s> would the minister agree that the government save a great deal of money when voluntary organisations work for the disabled and do work which otherwise the government would have to do and to pay for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all who sit on the cross-benches will want to be associated with the congratulations to her majesty the queen his royal highness the duke of edinburgh and their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales on the birth of their son <e> <s> we rejoice in their happiness too and take particular pride in the new happiness of the most illustrious of the cross-bench peers <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the noble lord is still obliged to tell me that the israelis are not allowing supplies into beirut by sea by the international committee of the red cross but that they are allowing civilians to be evacuated out of beirut by sea <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the local health authorities should be encouraged to bear in mind that those patients who are still waiting for treatments and operations deserve some special consideration now so that their complaints are no longer aggravated by further delay <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the occasions when i can speak on behalf of the cross-bench peers as we should all wish to join in the tributes to sir peter henderson and to express our appreciation for his services <e> <s> as the cross-benches have no organisation secretariat or records they are constantly in need of information and guidance <e> <s> certainly we have frequently turned to the clerk of the parliaments for advice and have always been rewarded with the fruits of a wise well-stocked mind given in exquisite courtesy <e> <s> though his manner is modest and self-effacing he seldom left one in any doubt about the proper course to follow <e> <s> we hope he and lady henderson will enjoy his years of retirement and that sometimes he will reflect on the many members of your lordships house who have cause to remember him with gratitude and affection <e>", "<cs> my lords could the charge to private hospitals lead to an increase in charges to the patients <e> <s> if so is this fair in view of the fact that they have already paid their national health contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all those sitting on the cross-benches will want to be associated with the sympathy and tributes already expressed to the family of lord byers and to the liberal party <e> <s> it was the noble lords clarity of thought and therefore brevity of speeches that set such an example to us all <e> <s> he will be sadly missed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords today is one of the occasions when we on the cross-benches can be united in joining the congratulations and celebrations on this happy and memorable occasion of the noble lords centenary <e> <s> a wise man said that the art of living is the art of using experience ones own and other peoples <e> <s> this noble lord who is a very independent thinking patriot has confirmed that in full measure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the british red cross is very grateful to the government for supplying them with a hercules aircraft which will enable them to take to the disaster area vehicles shelters tents and blankets <e> <s> will the noble lord also agree how fortunate we are to be working with a very efficient and splendid ethiopian red cross society which is working with the international committee of the red cross with the league of red cross societies and with our own society which is itself supplying nurses and doctors to look after the sick and which is also very busy helping to feed at the feeding centres the pregnant women and nursing mothers who represent over per cent <e> <s> of the population <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that because of the overcrowding there is still a very terrible problem there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the bbc sent their engineers to investigate the problem of reception in strath glass and in particular at cannich and tomich and led the local community to believe that it would have a relay station for coverage in <e> <s> however according to a letter i received in october from the director-general nothing is likely to happen this year <e> <s> will the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an occasion when those sitting on the cross-benches are more than happy to support the tributes already paid to sir david and to add our own appreciation of the calm and competent way in which he has looked after his extensive kingdom including housemaids attendants doorkeepers police security and many other matters as well as your lordships <e> <s> his caring for welfare was especially appreciated on these benches <e> <s> i myself valued and shall miss very much the whispered consultations between black rods box and the cross-benches about whether the temperature in the house was too hot or too cold <e>", "<cs> my lords i start like other speakers by congratulating the noble lord lord nugent of guildford on pioneering this important piece of legislation <e> <s> i support the motion to approve the continuation of the wearing of seat belts <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may repeat a suggestion i made at the committee that is that some of us feel that a wednesday should be treated as a special day <e> <s> it should be quite possible to have both an informative and an interesting debate covering many different points of view without provoking a division unless of course a resolution has been tabled <e> <s> in that event the situation would be different <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that members sitting on the cross-benches would not want to be left out of this very happy occasion <e> <s> we like the others should like to wish the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor many happy congratulations and with them go our very best wishes <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the suggestion of the noble baroness for the teaching of first aid in schools <e> <s> the red cross and i think st johns already do that in a great many schools where it has now become a routine part of their lessons <e> <s> the children enjoy such teaching parents approve of it and it is useful for the children all their lives <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to give the amendment careful consideration <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the noble baroness lady cox and i should like to do so in addition on behalf of the british red cross society <e> <s> it has always been surprising to us that the care of children in schools did not come under the health and safety first aid regulations <e> <s> i know that the red cross and i am sure our colleagues in st john have already succeeded in training teachers in first aid who now also teach children as part of the curriculum <e> <s> why do we think this is necessary <e> <s> it is because children in these modem times are exposed to a great many hazards such as accidents in laboratories with gas and electricity in cooking classesby using sewing machines on the playing fields on expeditions or in coaches and arising from violence in schools <e> <s> there are of course also the health hazards which have already been mentioned such as diabetes probably followed by a coma heart attacks fits and so on <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i tell her that the first aid standard approved by the health and safety executive is extremely high <e> <s> anybody who holds that certificate would be perfectly capable of knowing what to do in the case of the accident on the rugger field and more importantly would know what not to do because the essence of first aid is not to mess things up so that the case becomes more complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the cross-benches should like to be associated with the remarks already expressed about our friendly neighbour and with the sympathy extended to his family <e> <s> lord shinwell was a great patriot and his going marks the end of an era <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the noble baroness lady cox as indeed i did on second reading and for the same reasons <e> <s> i shall not repeat those reasons but in modern times children are exposed to a great many hazards and of course those working in schools or any institutions where there are a large number of people are also open to hazards <e> <s> i previously listed at least nine or of them <e> <s> it is necessary that the standard of first aid that they are taught is up to the standard required by the health and safety executive which is not basic first aid but is serious first aid so that in an emergency people can if necessary save life <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the cross-benches would also like to extend our thanks to all the staff for their kindness and courtesy during this long and rather difficult period <e> <s> we should also like to join in wishing them and everybody a happy and peaceful recess <e>", "<cs> my lords my reasons for intervening tonight are first that my husband was the member for york and therefore one is always interested in things that happen in that lovely city and secondly that lord elliott of morpeth asked me to say how very distressed he was that he could not be here tonight to take part in this debate <e> <s> unfortunately he is tied up with a very long-standing engagement which he could not with any decency get out of <e> <s> he wanted me to draw the attention of your lordships to the freemen of newcastle-upon-tyne who are most active and work closely with the city council in a very independent way <e> <s> they would take exception to the idea that they are out of date and should be abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to extend our thanks to all those who look after us so well and of course wish everyone a very happy christmas with good wishes for the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords this is of course one of those occasions when the cross-bench peers wish to be associated with the sympathy and tributes to the late lord stockton and to his family which have already been so eloquently expressed <e> <s> perhaps we could just add how remarkable it is that one of the giants of the th century in british politics was always so approachable showing care and consideration for individuals both personally and as a member of parliament for his constituents despite all the burdens that he had to carry in high office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all those sitting on the cross-benches which are normally full to overflowing would like to reinforce the thanks that have already been given to the staff for their splendid advice and help which is always given with such kindness and courtesy <e> <s> we should also like to join with others in wishing both peers and staff a very enjoyable recess <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the cross-bench peers i should like to associate this part of the house with what has already with eloquence been said about the late lord soames <e> <s> not much has been said in the press about his distinguished leadership of this house from may to interrupted as it was by his five months as governor general <e> <s> despite this interruption he made a wholly beneficial impact on the house not only because he had great presence as leader of the house but primarily because he clearly cared about the house its traditions and its future <e> <s> we on the cross-benches appreciated his quality and his respect for back-benchers and for those who hold no party political allegiance <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the cross-benches are proud that one who graced our benches is now established on the woolsack <e> <s> we send him all our good wishes on his appointment and look forward to hearing from him <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness any knowledge of the caterpillar which specialises in eating bracken and does no harm to anyone <e> <s> i think that this caterpillar has been used in australia <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the cross-benches should like to be associated with all the tributes that have been expressed by the parties to the noble viscount lord whitelaw <e> <s> we should like to add our own special thanks for his understanding of the problems procedure and customs of the house and how they affect those sitting on these benches <e> <s> at this stage it is not possible to estimate his loss not just to the house but to the nation <e> <s> we hope that our loss will he his familys gain for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords from the cross-benches we also should like to join in the good wishes for the easter recess and also to express our thanks to those seen or unseen who look after us all so well <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the cross-benches also wish to express our thanks to mr grey for the courteous help and advice that he has given to us <e> <s> after nearly years here we hope that he will now be able to enjoy his boat and his garden <e> <s> we wish him a very happy retirement with his family <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate those who sit on the cross benches with everything that has been said by the leader of the house and the leaders of the opposition <e> <s> it is particularly fitting that this house should play its full part in the tercentenary celebrations in view of the distinguished role of the house of lords in bringing the events of and to such a successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords the cross-bench peers would like to endorse all the messages of thanks which have already been expressed and say how much we appreciate all the help and advice which we have received from all departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that noble lords sitting on the cross-benches would want to be associated with the tributes already paid to lord peart who was a very modest man with a great deal of common sense <e> <s> we on these benches admired his courage very much when he came back to this house after being hit on the head by robbers in his own home <e> <s> we join with other noble lords in sending our sympathy to his widow and son <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to keep the record straight will the noble earl accept that although st stephens hospital is in the fulham road it is in fact in the royal borough of kensington and chelsea <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the cross-benches would like to join in the tributes to the yeoman usher of the black rod <e> <s> we wish him and his wife a very happy and busy retirement <e> <s> his unpretentious manner has made it easy for unpopular decisions to be accepted and as a result of that he has endeared himself to so many of us <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider i hope that i have the terminology correct the airspace when considering the question of a second runway at gatwick <e> <s> i understand that there is already a great deal of air traffic <e> <s> will the minister agree that more would only make more problems for the poor air traffic controllers <e>",

to our cross-bench refreshment committee chairman <e> <s> we especially wish to mention those who refused to be defeated by the rail and other transport strikes and who despite all the frustrations that must have been aggravated by this hot and very humid weather were <e>", "<cs> my lords the cross-bench peers would i know like to be associated with the tributes already paid to lord ponsonby <e>

the occasion of her forthcoming th birthday <e> <s> the cross-bench peers are especially anxious to support all the expressions of congratulation gratitude and affection as we are honoured to have some of her family on our benches that is to say her eldest grandson and two nephews <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords on the cross-benches warmly support all the tributes that have been paid to the
