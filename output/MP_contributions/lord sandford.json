["<cs> my lords i hasten to reassure the house that i will not tell noble lords what the noble lords lord balogh and lord energlyn might have said in their speeches if they had been here <e> <s> in fact i can dispense with a number of pages of my own speech because the noble lord lord northfield has already said much of what i might have said and said it far better than i could have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the right reverend prelate for this debate <e> <s> however i cannot help comparing and contrasting it with the youth debates of yesteryear <e> <s> i took part in my first one some years ago when we used to have annual debates on youth <e> <s> at that time i was in my thirties and spoke because i was directly running a number of youth clubs <e> <s> it is sad that we have not had that element here today in this debate <e> <s> there must be a number of your lordships of that generation or vintage who could have contributed that sort of experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> i introduced this bill at second <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody is more gruntled than i am at horseriders at the pleasure that they get from riding in the park and at the fact that the numbers of riders enjoying the parks is increasing <e> <s> but it is of course the very fact that the numbers are increasing which makes it impracticable in the view of the devon county council and the national parks authority in particular to continue the completely unrestricted <e>", "<cs> my lords what a delight to hear two maiden speeches in one afternoon and both from charming ladies <e> <s> the sweetness and light we have received from them extends to and pervades all the parliamentary proceedings on the bill so far <e> <s> i am glad to see that it still has support from all corners of the house <e> <s> i think that that support also includes the view that has already been expressed at least twice in the debate namely that the best and the cheapest way of conserving and caring for the heritage is by keeping it in private hands <e> <s> that is particularly true of the small houses a point first made by the noble baroness lady stedman and it is particularly true too where it is important to keep the whole of an estate or a property intact with all its belongings in it <e> <s> no one is better able to care for those belongings the family heirlooms than the family itself <e> <s> it is for this reason that i particularly welcome the parts of the bill that seem to me to make provision for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why when derbyshire has had so many eloquent spokesmen of their own they should ask a southerner to speak for them but in fact the county council have asked me to say a few words and so i will do so <e> <s> i have also been asked to put a point by the buxton civic society and i also find myself speaking as a vice-president of the association of district councils so i have to choose my words rather carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords we all have to thank the english tourist board in the first case and the noble lord lord sudeley in the second case for enabling the house to turn its mind from the decline and decay of heavy engineering industry to the buoyancy and liveliness of cathedral tourism <e>", "<cs> it confers a power not a duty <e>", "<cs> i think that what my noble friend the minister has said is perfectly true in regard to ceramics and pictures <e> <s> the term preservation which is in the bill at the moment covers putting together something which is broken which is restoration and the term restoration when used in respect of pictures is much the same as preservation <e> <s> however i am very far from convinced that in respect of buildings it is conceivably possible to think of maintenance repair or preservation as covering restoration and i think that to leave out the term on the grounds that if it were included the trustees could not be relied upon to use their judgment as to whether or not to apply their funds appropriately and would go off and spend far too much on restoration is to underestimate altogether the calibre of the trustees whom we expect to see administering the fund and the range of decisions which we expect them all to take <e>", "<cs> my lords could i quickly raise a point with the minister not on the rate or the scale of his grants but on the administration of them particularly in relation to the proposals that i understand are going to be tabled later on this year in connection with sir derek rayners proposals for streamlining and simplifying the procedures <e> <s> the context in which i want to do this is the recommendation of an earlier report from the advisory council to the minister that adas who have such an important role to play in administering these grants should assume greater responsibility for the conservation of the landscape the conservation of wildlife public access to the countryside tourism and other industries based on farms <e> <s> that report was accepted and adas have been seeing how they can implement those extra responsibilities <e> <s> it has involved a good deal of work in those parts of the country where conservation policies are particularly important such as national parks areas of outstanding natural beauty nature reserves and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the speakers who have taken part in the debate and i am sure that all my colleagues on the committee will be grateful for the complimentary remarks that have been made <e> <s> i was particularly glad that the noble lord lord peart complimented the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> his contribution to our committee was as valuable and as distinguished as is the contribution of the development commission to the countryside <e> <s> i would have been disappointed and suspicious had we got through the debate without any controversy at all and therefore i was particularly glad that the noble lords lord mackie of benshie and lord peart crossed swords with me to a very minor degree <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot disagree with the noble lord lord peart about farmers and i am afraid that i am not anti-farmeri have to agree with him in being very much in their support <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that having welcomed in general the application of portugal and the other two applicant countries to join the community the time has come when we must in particular face the implications of that action <e> <s> would he confirm that the preoccupation that we all very properly have at present with our own budgetary problems in connection with our membership of the community will not be used as a complete bar to any proposals from the commission to consider pre-accession aid to portugal <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that although the proposals as regards conservation will not do in their present form it is only a consultation document at this stage and there is therefore ample time and opportunity to get the proposals right <e> <s> may i ask whether he will go a little further than drawing our attention to what his honourable friend said last month in the other place and give us the assurance now in respect of these particular proposals that when his right honourable friend draws them up after having established such economies as may be found in his department which is the proper thing to do he will ensure that under the new proposals it is easy and possible for the minister to discharge his obligations under section of the countryside act and also that under the proposals when amended it will be possible to move forward and implement the proposals of the strutt report proposals which were agreed in principle by his right honourable friend and welcomed by all bodies concerned with conservation and the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for the assurances that he has given us would he not agree that despite what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie was saying just now in this particular case it was the national farmers union who were the first and the quickest to point out the mistakes that are being made in this current consultation document <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he also agree that in a number of services which contribute directly to the efficiency of wealth-creating organisations in this country it is also a question of choosing the pace at which reductions if they are to be made are in fact made <e> <s> my noble friend will perhaps recall the agricultural development advisory service over which he once presided as being a service which cannot easily be removed at a stroke <e>", "<cs> i start by thanking the noble lord lord schon for introducing this motion congratulating the noble lord lord sieff on his maiden speech and paying tribute to both of them and to other noble lords who have taken part so far for furnishing the debate with so much of their own valuable first-hand experience <e> <s> i am not any sort of industrialist of any rank or level and i have little or no insight into the inner workings of commerce or industry <e> <s> but i take productivity to mean broadly making the most of what youve got and to be capable of a wider interpretation than the factors of production in the actual industrial process itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say a brief word on this amendment <e> <s> i have taken an interest in the subject for some time although i have not hitherto spoken to it <e> <s> i should like to start by thanking my noble friend lord bellwin for the letter he sent me on this matter explaining the position of the government but i have to say to him and to the house that having thought about it a good deal i am still of the opinion that my noble friends lord selsdon and lord morris are better advised than my noble friend lord bellwin in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with my noble friend that probably the best thing in the circumstances has been done in this case may i ask whether he would agree that it enormously reinforces the importance of getting a satisfactory strategic forestry policy for this country formulated and implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords both the people that i wanted to make my remarks to first are absent from the chamber <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle explained to me that his archbishop wanted to have a word with him so we can understand why he is not in his place <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to congratulate him in his absence and to confirm also in his absence what the right reverend prelate the bishop of london was saying namely how valuable it is to have bishops in this house able to convey to us the special flavour of their regional scene <e>", "<cs> i thought that my noble friend dealt admirably with all the points raised by the noble baroness and others like them in his second reading speech and no doubt if he wishes he will do so again <e> <s> but we are actually discussing clause of the bill <e> <s> it is as the noble baroness says a core clause enshrining the right to buy <e> <s> however she began her remarks by referring to the attitude of the association of district councils and as i am its president i think that i should respond <e>", "<cs> in coming to schedule we are coming to the part of the bill which deals with the exceptions to be made to the right to buy <e> <s> the whole committee will agree with the noble baroness when she says that the concern for the housing of the elderly is something which is shared by all the parties <e> <s> the association of district councils which <e>", "<cs> it may help the committee to decide how to deal with the amendment if i say that the association of district councils all of them who are the ones chiefly concerned with these rural areas have had all their anxieties in this general area met by the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> i am as keen on conservation as anybody else but i think this amendment is particularly unsuitable <e> <s> it is quite wrong to deprive people of a personal right which is being conferred on council tenants generally up and down the country in order to achieve environmental objectives <e> <s> furthermore it is quite unnecessary because the protection of a group of cottages like the swindon railway cottages can be achieved by the application of ordinary conservation legislation and if that is not precise enough article can be invoked in order to prevent such things as mullion windows being taken out and so on <e> <s> that is a much more appropriate way of dealing with it <e> <s> i hope the committee will reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> the provision and the maintenance of housing for letting in the national parks and other similar areas is a matter of paramount importance <e> <s> it fell to me to undertake a review of the national parks some seven or eight years ago in the course of which we had or public meetings and this issue arose in every single one of them <e> <s> i do not need any reminder of its importance or its significance and long before this bill was published long before the manifesto was printed i was at pains to remind my noble and honourable friends who are now in government of the importance of dealing with this question <e> <s> the manifesto clearly stated that special measures would be taken to ensure that the stock of private letting accommodation in national parks and elsewhere was safeguarded and taken care of <e> <s> the special provisions that were finally selected are those now embodied in clause <e> <s> once again the method was adopted by the noble lord lord greenwood and the noble baroness lady denington in respect of houses for the elderly that was adopted in this particular case and i am convinced that it is a better method than the method which would be introduced if this amendment was accepted <e>", "<cs> may i in reply say a word as it were on behalf of the association of district councils <e> <s> the noble lord opposite gives the impression that the government have published and produced this bill and dealt with the amendments without consulting the bodies that the noble lord now suggests should be consulted <e> <s> the truth is that they and the ama have been in constant consultation with my right honourable friend and my honourable friends in the department of the environment throughout this bill and in this particular regard the amendment dealing with stress areas they are content with the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> the association has a council elected from their total membership and a housing committee within that council made up of members of it <e> <s> the position at the moment in respect of this bill is that they have three amendments which they would still like to have moved and incorporated into the bill in some respects <e> <s> the first has already been dealt with <e> <s> it was the enlargement of the special measures made in respect of the elderly <e> <s> their amendment corresponds closely to that which has been moved by the noble baroness lady denington and to the amendment to clause which was moved not on behalf of the ama but corresponding to the one which the ama supported by the noble lord lord evans of claughton <e> <s> those are the two amendments which my noble friend lord bellwin has undertaken to take away and to reconsider <e> <s> there is a further amendment to which we shall come when we get to clause where they would like to sec the bill improved and two more amendments on clauses and <e> <s> there is another one to schedule <e> <s> in other respects they are satisfied with the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow my noble friend for a number of reasons but chiefly in this connection because he and i were joint chairmen of the committee which reviewed the national parks and as i mentioned to the committee last thursday this topic of how to deal with housing to let in national parks cropped up over and over again <e> <s> if i may say so i thought that the noble lord lord evans of claughton made the case which he is now making very cogently last thursday at what i believe was the proper part of the bill namely schedule which deals with the exceptions to the right to buy <e> <s> i am afraid that i also thought that those of us who indicated our agreement with his concern but our difference with him about the way in which to meet it also made our point cogently <e>", "<cs> the only point i would make is this we do in this house have extremely flexible rules of order and procedure <e> <s> my noble friend has two or three times or even four times urged upon our front bench that exceptions should be made in the case of housing stress areas and i have no objection to him making the point once <e> <s> but to make it under a clause the rubric of which is dwelling-houses in national parks and to start off by asserting that he is concerned with inner cities is really stretching our rules too far <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support to the noble viscounts amendment and to confirm that this amendment and the one that follows it are supported not only by the association of metropolitan authorities and the london borough authorities but the association of district councils <e> <s> so it has the support of all three sets of housing authorities <e> <s> that being so i hope my noble friend will indicate that it has his sympathy and that he will at least consider it if he cannot accept it straight away <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that the local authority associations do not like these two amendments leading to statutory mobility schemes and the one that they like the least is that of the noble baroness lady denington for the reasons that she has made quite clear <e> <s> that makes all the more welcome the fact that she has swung her support behind the preceding amendment which is much milder and the provisions of which would not come into operation except at the request of the local authority associations <e> <s> despite what the local authority associations say i think that this is the scheme to which the government should give their greatest consideration <e>", "<cs> i was glad to hear the noble lord lord evans say that he approves and supports the concept of shortholds <e> <s> i would have been moved and i am sure all noble lords would have been moved by the noble lord lord janner if this particular clause which has to do with shortholds affected at all the security of the existing tenants but it does not <e> <s> this proposal has nothing to do with existing tenants <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk put forward the argument that this must be a had clause because the tenants are not cheering for it <e> <s> of course they are not it has nothing to do with them <e> <s> this clause concerns people who are not tenants at the moment but who want to obtain property for a short let of something between five years and one year <e> <s> for them it is of enormous benefit <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could respond to that request for information from the noble lord lord evans before my noble friend replies to it <e> <s> it is a matter to which the housing authorities or at least those represented by the association of district councils or so of them have given a good deal of thought <e> <s> it is on their shoulders that the housing of the homeless under the housing homeless persons act chiefly falls <e> <s> their view is that when the shorthold provisions are enacted their burden under that act will he considerably reduced certainly reduced to some extent the extent depending on the extent to which the shorthold tenancies are or are not sabotaged by the labour opposition <e> <s> but they will be reduced to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house what steps the government have taken so far to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord goodman is recognised in all <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds i wonder whether i may make this point to my noble friend <e> <s> it may well be that the particular formula which the noble lord lord monson has moved is not the right one but i should have thought that the time had come and that the opportunity was presented by this bill to have a look at this charter and see whether it is sensibly divided between the landlord and tenant at the moment <e> <s> when one looks at the feats of repair work and maintenance which council tenants are quite capable of exercising in respect of their own motor cars for instance one wonders whether it is really necessary to involve local authority landlords in such things as changing tap washers <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> she has opened up another possibility and that is another very good way forward <e> <s> but the fact is that if this formula which has been discussed a great deal but not i think debated during the passage of this bill in the other place and therefore perhaps does deserve a little consideration now were looked at and the framework altered to encourage the kind of developments the noble baroness talks about we would make some progress <e> <s> it is not right to let the opportunity pass and make no changes at all in an area which everybody recognises needs to be modified in some way or another <e>", "<cs> may i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> there ought to be an all-party pact not to handle any more department of the environment bills in our house until we resume the excellent practice which the noble baroness and i both instigated that we have notes on clauses <e> <s> it is quite impossible to handle these complicated bills at the rate we are dealing with them without notes on clauses <e>", "<cs> may i say a word before we pass on from this particular clause <e> <s> this is in the general area of the consents which my noble friend has already mentioned <e> <s> the first part of clause says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> as my noble friends remarks have embraced amendment no <e> <s> i wonder whether i may comment before the noble lord lord stewart responds to say that in my view the spirit of amendment no <e> <s> ought to commend itself to my noble friend and ought to be accepted but with further amendment to make it applicable not just to a single authority but to authorities in appropriate cases or even to associations of authorities <e> <s> my view and that of the association of district councils is that this is a point on which they would like the requirement to consult to be incorporated in the statute and therefore i would support amendment no <e> <s> if the noble lord opposite were to move it or better still to invite my noble friend to consider carefully adopting this amendment and coming forward with one along those lines at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i will in a minute <e>", "<cs> no not on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like my noble friend to note following the remarks of the noble baroness lady fisher the enormous self-restraint i am exercising <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have come to the end of my self-restraint for a moment <e> <s> clause has a rubric which reads <e>", "<cs> in the absence of the two right reverend prelates but as a past chairman of the church army i should like to add my support of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support for the amendment and i am grateful to my noble friend for his recognition that there is here an issue which is perhaps worth looking into <e> <s> nevertheless i was impressed by his argument that if adjustments made one way must count then adjustments made the other way ought to count too <e> <s> that probably means that marginal errors ought to be discounted and that an element of rough justice around the margin ought to be accepted <e> <s> however if the errors have been fairly substantial and i understand that in a few cases they were because totally wrong plans were used in the assessment it ought to be possible to devise a way for the injustice to be corrected <e> <s> if my noble friend will undertake to look at the matter again with a view to dealing with those issues leaving aside the marginal ones which i agree will be more difficult i should be very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend will be able to deal with the substance of this amendment but i would before he does so take up the last point the noble lord lord evans was making when he was referring to the cost of all this <e> <s> the expenses involved are the expenses of investigating the right of the leaseholder to acquire verifying title valuing the premises and then eventually conveying the premises <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me see why that should fall upon the ratepayers which is what the local housing authority is at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> i have crossed swords with the noble lord lord evans at quite a number of points during the passage of this committee stage <e> <s> the association of district councils has not always seen eye to eye with the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> but in this <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord evans would like me to reply before he takes a final decision on what to do about this amendment <e> <s> my own feeling would be <e>", "<cs> i thought in the circumstances that it was better for the noble lord lord evans to have the final say but i am very happy for him to lead off if he would prefer it <e> <s> all i want to say is that i think my noble friend has answered amendment no <e> <s> in detail and given a technical answer which i should like to study with care <e> <s> i do not think he has in fact answered the main point which the noble lord lord evans and i were making namely that it is high time that the whole criteria for unfitness were looked at again and that this is a good opportunity to do it <e> <s> i therefore feel that it would be better to set aside all these technical matters which we can look at in detail and i hope that my noble friend can agree if the noble lord lord evans would like it this way to have some further discussion with the two associations and see whether an amendment can be tabled for the next stage preferably by the government which will have the effect of taking this opportunity to adjust the criteria in one way or another <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to consider two further points when he is formulating his own amendment <e> <s> when drafting an amendment it would be as well to refer not only to fire escapes which are of course important but to fire precautions generally such things as an adequate number of extinguishers proper provision of fire doors <e>", "<cs> my lords this topic of special provision for the elderly was i think rightly the most important point to which the committee gave attention at the earlier stage of this bill <e> <s> it is certainly something which the association of district councils representing of the housing authorities in the country much the largest number has been urging upon the government from the moment that the bill was first prepared in the department and throughout its passage through both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there was no decision either way <e> <s> also i certainly agree that the amendment which the noble baroness has now put forward is a great improvement on a similar amendment which she moved in committee and that it is much more tightly drawn <e> <s> nevertheless for my part i still greatly favour and so do the adc the approach to the problem which is represented by amendment no <e> <s> which stands in the name of my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> it provides for the right to buy not to be taken away from the elderly i should have thought that the case for that was very strong but gives the right to buy to the local housing authorities <e> <s> this is the amendment now favoured by the association of district councils <e> <s> therefore i strongly recommend my noble friend to stick to his guns and in due course to move amendment no <e> <s> and the house to resist amendment no <e> <s> i which certainly attempts to deal with the problem but which deals with it in the wrong way <e>", "<cs> my lords if amendment no <e> <s> b is a manuscript amendment i think the noble lord should read it <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that under the present circumstances in view of the figures announced today the point concentrated on in the youth opportunities programme is to improve on the take-up of the places available and particularly to do so with the school-leavers who have just left school qualified for those places <e> <s> could he tell us or write to me in more detail if he cannot tell us now what the current take-up of the places on the youth opportunities programme is at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the general figure is far lower than that <e> <s> would it not be valuable to have the answer to my question <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment we are invited to deal with two distinct but interrelated issues <e> <s> the first is the governments intention to bring to an end controlled tenancies and to make them all into regulated tenancies <e> <s> i should like to put it to the house that it is high time that this should be done <e> <s> it is overdue <e> <s> the position of the landlords we had a profile of the landlords who are concerned presented to us in committee in the case of controlled tenancies has been grossly unfair and unjust for many years and since the rate of inflation went into two figures the position has become quite intolerable <e> <s> if the properties in question are not so good as they should be and suffer from serious shortcomings the main blame lies in the perpetuation of the controlled tenancy system <e> <s> so the first thing to do is to bring that to an end <e> <s> the proposal that it should be made subject to certificates of fitness which would have to be provided by housing authorities in respect of some properties is to involve them in an appalling waste of their time and resources <e> <s> they have many other better things to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who spoke in committee on this cluster of points may i say how welcome this group of amendments is and how <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with the greatest courtesy to the noble baroness i think that we have just heard a piece of tremendous humbug and hypocrisy <e> <s> the operative word in this clause is may <e> <s> here we have the government giving to local authorities power and discretion to exercise their own judgment about the way in which they will combine the resources in their general revenue account and their housing revenue account <e> <s> noble lords and noble baronesses opposite have argued time and time again that the government are being inflexible and are interfering in the affairs of local government <e> <s> here in this clause the government are being less rigid <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for moving this amendment and i regret to some extent the less than cordial reception of it by the government <e> <s> through this bill the local housing authorities have lost their power to control overcrowding in their own estates through landlord control and in principle welcome the opportunity that the noble baroness has taken of using this bill to improve and bring up to date the criteria by which overcrowding is judged <e> <s> i would hope therefore that the government would look not necessarily at this amendment but this initiative by my noble friend with rather more consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to rise to support this amendment and to start by thanking the noble lord lord wells-pestell who is a vice-president of the association of district councils for being kind enough to put it down <e> <s> the amendment was not received by the association until last week th july and on that day i happened to be on business in brussels on behalf of a select committee <e> <s> but i would certainly endorse what he said and just add these points <e>", "<cs> my lords last week i spoke i fear rather roughly to the noble baroness lady david for pleading so often for flexibility and autonomy for local government and then for introducing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady vickers for having moved this amendment and also to my noble friend lord bellwin for the comment that he has made on it <e> <s> it is certainly the case that although housing authorities and i speak for the adc are fully seized of the problem which was thrown up and revealed by <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on the front bench on his mastery of this bill and marvel at the tenacity of the labour opposition <e> <s> i expressed the hope when we started that we might be able to enlarge the area of bipartisan approach to housing but i think that the noble baroness who is just leaving the chamber has seen to it that we did no such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew that

three local government associations apparently locked in battle with the government that i would like to support <e> <s> furthermore at present i find myself following the speeches of four vice presidents the noble baroness lady stedman the noble lord lord irving of dartford my noble friend lord duncansandys and my noble friend lord middleton which are presumably capable of indicating to your lordships that there is some consistent strand of policy to be detected among those four <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could interrupt the noble lord for a moment because he is dealing with a very important matter <e> <s> i would not deny that the criticisms that he is making of planning authorities do not in a number of cases have justification <e> <s> but i should like him and thehouse to know that i know of more than one district council planning authority which not only has taken all the advice that he has so far offered but which has gone rather further <e> <s> i think it is the north <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise first to express my wholehearted support for the intention of the minister my right honourable friend mr peter walker in his quest for a simplified and streamlined form of administration for the farm capital grants and i do not disagree for a moment with his choice of <e>", "<cs> my lords since then a prayer has been moved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of the housing associations that make up the association of district councils say how grateful they are that more than they had hoped for in respect of housing for the elderly has been achieved without their president having to take any active part in the defeat of his right honourable friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name has been mentioned as the president of the association of district councils perhaps i could make a short contribution at this point <e> <s> first in respect of the noble baronesss point my right honourable friend the secretary of state

position in that respect <e> <s> as to deals and discussions behind the scenes as described in the <e>", "<cs> i strongly support my noble friend <e> <s> as noble lords will recall the associations

september of last year then produced a white paper whittling that number down to about which they were in agreement with the associations <e> <s> the bill provides an admirable opportunity to enact legislation dismantling those but in fact the number here is far less than that <e> <s> i strongly agree with my noble friend that we should take this opportunity to dismantle far more of the controls between central and local government than are contained in the bill and the amendment would be a useful addition <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness on deploying the case as well as she has done <e> <s> it is not surprising that it is a good case because it is derived from the brief to the noble baroness from the association of district councils which is exactly the same brief as i have which more or less clinches the matter <e> <s> the only additional point that i should like to make and this is one which surely would commend itself to my noble friend is that the

ground <e> <s> these compulsory purchase orders are not made just like that <e> <s> they are made under the acquisition of land authorisation procedure act and the code regarding the amount of advertising notification the intervals of time that must elapse and so on is all fairly specifically laid down <e> <s> the right way to deal with the point which my noble friend is making about the danger of orders being slipped through unobtrusively when no one is watching is best taken care of by looking at that legislation and seeing whether it is firm and watertight not by requiring orders to be submitted to the minister if there are no objections <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> it seems that every amendment so far has required one to get into a different alliance on this occasion i wish to encourage my noble friend to resist this amendment from the cbi <e> <s> i say that because i think it can be fairly claimed that the pursuit of smoke control and after all that is what we are talking about by local authorities under the clean air act has been one of their signal achievements not an achievement by local authorities on their own but by local authorities and industry in concert proceeding by the well-known british practice of achieving the best practical reduction of smoke at the least possible cost <e> <s> for that to be done and to be sustained the important thing to concentrate on is the partnership between local government and local industry and all over the country there are partnerships of various kinds set up to deal with the various forms of pollution that occur <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend behind me accepts that welcome development i should like to say on behalf of the association of district councils that we should of course like to see not only this amendment which apparently does not work but the governments which i hope will <e> <s> i must reserve my position until we have had discussions on this <e>",

enough about it to move any further amendments but i rather doubt it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal that this

to ensure that the local authorities have open to them as many options as possible in deciding which method is appropriate in each particular case and that is what my amendment sought to do <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord amory because it incorporates a number of misgivings which i myself share <e> <s> i have other reservations about this clause which i shall deal with in my own amendment which follows but i think it is important that we stick strictly to the principle which the government have now accepted that all this should be done by way of voluntary codes devised by the associations in co-operation with the government and issued by the secretary of state but not on the whole prescribed in detail by statute through parliament <e> <s> the restrictions and constraints that my noble friends amendment recommends would fall in line with my general approach to the whole matter <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> the associations have had long discussions with the secretary of state about this <e> <s> it was his original intention to introduce a statutory code which would be binding and have the force of statute on all local authorities that make up all the associations and he would have powers to enforce it <e> <s> all are now agreed that a voluntary code devised by the associations in consultation with the department issued by the secretary of state is a much better way of approaching it <e> <s> the first two codes have already been issued so we are well on the way <e> <s> the principle has been agreed <e> <s> we are having a certain amount of discussion and argument about the next one <e> <s> there can be a whole succession of codes covering different subjects agreed to voluntarily by the associations <e>", "<cs> unless my noble and learned friend wants to comment further may i suggest having heard big ben signal the time for supper that we withdraw both of these amendments now and think again about the matter <e> <s> i am afraid i feel that the wording of the clause at the moment makes it too much like a voluntary code in a pretty firm statutory framework whereas i should like to see a voluntary code freely devised by the associations and the secretary of state and then issued by him with very limited statutory sanctions <e> <s> this has been a useful discussion <e> <s> there are two amendments my own and that of my noble friend lord ridley and i should prefer to withdraw this amendment and return to it in consultation before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly withdraw

remarks to cover for instance coastal protection works and sea defence works <e> <s> there are contracts in both which involve work to be carried out over a long period and proper tendering would be needed <e> <s> but in each of those fields that is to say making good the breaches in sea defences in the middle of a storm or during a high tide and dealing with the collapse of cliffs and the imperilling of property near to them these are times when the work has to be done as a matter of urgency <e> <s> it is important to be a little bit clearer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend

to table a manuscript amendment i wonder whether i might read the standing order on manuscript amendments <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we could return to amendments nos <e> <s> and in

councils and the association of county councils and i would think by parliament that at this point in the bi my right honourable friend the secretary of state is asking for powers too sweeping to achieve what he wants to achieve and more sweeping than it would be proper for parliament to accord him <e> <s> therefore would hope that my noble friend would respond to the suggestion made by the noble lord lord sefton not for discussions only with the ama but for discussions with all the associations to see whether we cannot arrive at a formula which achieves what the secretary of state needs

been the consultation on this particular issue there have been lots of consultations but not as to the date for introducing this part of the bill <e> <s> it is of course a fact that after the bill is enacted regulations and directions pertaining to this part will then have to be issued and only then will it be possible to get on with the detailed arrangements for accounting and tendering as prescribed in the bill and prescribed in some detail <e>", "<cs> so that there should be no doubt that that kind of flexibility is possible i moved my amendment <e> <s> i was not entirely convinced by the ministers reply <e> <s> if there are authorities which are daunted by the prospect of having to make invidious distinctions between one situation and another and one class of member and another

some approved duties are essential to the working of the council or to attract the full range of allowances others are useful but not essential and it should be possible to pay out-of-pocket expenses

district councils is disinterested in the matter of clawbacks smoothing year-by-year changes safety nets or multipliers i wish to join in the debate and say briefly that of the two proposed amendments spoken to i would prefer that in the name of my noble friend lord ridley <e>", "<cs> before we leave part vi of the bill i should like to congratulate my noble friend on his handling of the matter <e>

is no small feat to get something like this through the committee not only against the united and combined opposition of all three associations of local government but also against what has been rather ungallantly described as the solidarity of the three gracious baronesses from cambridge <e>", "<cs> it grieves me to have to get up once again and say that the governments proposals in this field are opposed by all three associations <e> <s> the reasons why we are opposed to them have been made very clear by the three speakers who preceded me <e> <s> all spoke for different sectors of local government <e>", "<cs> the minister speaks very convincingly from a long experience in local government but may i ask him this <e> <s> bearing in mind the fact that these proposals have been with us for a long time now and the bill has been before parliament from the beginning of the year how is it that if these proposals do have the merits the noble lord claims he and his colleagues have so far totally failed to convince the associations of these merits <e> <s> surely there must be something that accounts for that <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> the second point is this given that fact and it is an undoubted fact would it not be wiser if he thinks there are such merits and virtues in these proposals to spend a bit longer to convince local government that they do in fact exist <e>", "<cs> may i join in this debate in particular to support my noble friend lord ridley because i think that the claims that he is making for his amendment over and above amendment no <e> <s> a have something in them <e> <s> i think that amendment no <e> <s> a is opening up an important topic that needs to be dealt with but i believe that my noble friends amendment does it in a more all-embracing way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends allusion to the time when i was minister for slag heaps and a few other things like that <e> <s> although the noble lord lord evans introduced that <e>", "<cs> that may or may not have satisfied the noble lords lord evans and lord mishcon <e> <s> i do not want my noble friend to spend any more time in committee dealing with my point <e> <s> but it does not answer it <e> <s> for instance in the case of the national parks there is one park with about nine authorities represented on it and another with four <e> <s> if its

distinguished as the chief executive of one of the main county councils has misunderstood the bill to that extent the loyalties of parliament are being strained very considerably in being asked to allow a bill to go on to the statute book while that is the state of misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> the district councils will be glad to support this approach by the other two but in this particular case i think i favour the proposal from the ama coming from the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> luton is a distinguished member of the association of district councils and i must rise in support of the noble lord lord hill <e> <s> the malaise in the national economy which makes it necessary to have this legislation at all is the malaise which has arisen as the result of our spending more than we have earned and spending it before we have earned it <e> <s> the provision the noble lord lord hill is moving is for freedom for an authority which has an undertaking that has already earned some money to spend it after it has been earned on the profitable undertaking <e> <s> i submit that that fact alone wholly and completely puts that operation outside the ambit of the controls that we are having to discuss now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both noble lords for introducing the topic and i should like to confirm that a very large number of districts are actively engaged in trying to help small businesses to get started <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend to give us some guidance on what help is available either in this clause or elsewhere in order to deal with the problem which arises

planning authority of a district council but it is a duty which they will be fulfilling under the voluntary code <e> <s> i do not see any objection to having it in the statute if that is the wish of the committee <e>", "<cs> district councils are not at all nervous about taking this decision <e> <s> they think it a very straight forward one with the help of the local government act schedule

districts because as he will see in a moment or two everything will be sweetness and light <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the thorough discussion on amendment no <e> <s> b and all the other amendments that we discussed at the same time <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend for his wide survey review and decisive appraisal of what we have been discussing <e> <s> more specifically i am glad that he can accept amendment no <e> <s> because i think that is one of the best things this debate has led to so far <e> <s> it establishes the role of all concerned in relation to the structure plan

would not have been right to relegate merely to regulations <e>", "<cs> as i explained in the earlier debate the districts already have planning officers and i should have thought that under present circumstances that number would prove quite adequate <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to support my noble friend at any rate in his logic <e> <s> if there is a case for charging fees to private applicants for planning permission there is certainly one for charging statutory undertakers such as the central electricity generating board the north thames gas board <e>", "<cs> i think that we can feel reasonably satisfied that the general approach to this as expounded by my <e>", "<cs> yes i think i do so long as i can be quite clear that my noble friend is saying that his view is the same as ours at the moment <e> <s> he does not see the case for introducing refunds when the regulations are first introduced but he wants to retain the power to provide for refunds if in the future in some rare cases the need for them should appear <e> <s> is that understanding correct because if so i shall be very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it would be very helpful if my noble friend could respond to my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton and let us all see before we allow the bill to go how the

occasion to look at each set of regulations and adjust them <e> <s> therefore it is a question of choosing a point somewhere between putting the regulations on the face of the bill which i do not think is practicable and letting us see a little more than we can at the moment how the governments thoughts are developing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and will be very glad to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i should feel much happier if my noble friend would go a little further and say that having accepted the case i am making he and his department with all the

to do <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> this amendment is exercising into the realm of the machinery of government and i should have thought my noble friend would have no difficulty at all in confirming immediately to the noble lord lord cledwyn that if there is a case of agricultural land being taken for development against which there are massive or heavy objections he and his right honourable friend the secretary of state would without any question have consultations with the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> the same would apply if there were a proposal from the department of energy to build a power station if there were objections to that there would be consultation between the two departments or if there were a proposal for building a

environment <e> <s> all these consultations go on in my experience invariably when there are objections to these sort of proposals <e>", "<cs> there would probably be a public inquiry if there were heavy objections <e>", "<cs> the point i am making is that my belief is that the machinery of government requires a decision to call in a matter for a public inquiry to be taken by the secretary of state for the environment and the responsibility is his <e> <s> this amendment will take away that responsibility and place it with the minister of agriculture and i do not think that would be a correct division of responsibility <e> <s> i think this matter of when and under what circumstances to call something in for public local inquiry is a decision for the secretary of state to take certainly after consultations but it should be his own decision <e>", "<cs> i rise to confirm what my noble friends have said in support of the amendment namely that it is strongly supported by the association of district councils <e>", "<cs> certainly under the assurance that it can be done in some other way i should be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the opposition are making tremendously heavy weather of this <e> <s> the non-metropolitan district councils are glad to see the amendment because it makes clear that these powers are not designed for cities like bristol

within the terms of the bill rather than by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased to hear that but as a house of parliament i do think we are under an obligation to get from the noble lord a quite clear assurance that if following these consultations he and his colleagues do become convinced that it will be necessary to exercise the kind of controls the noble lord lord ponsonby is asking for it will be possible to do it through the bill without this amendment <e>", "<cs> the district councils to whom both these amendments refer greatly prefer the amendment of the noble countess and

of the block grant and so we are faced with a rate support grant which is incomprehensible and unpredictable as we feared it would be <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> is he going to introduce the dampening measures to make sure that these significant alterations as between this year and the next are really held within bounds having said originally during the consultations that the government were not prepared to introduce the dampeners <e> <s> if the dampeners are introduced will the levels of rate increase which local authorities will be obliged to charge be held within the single figures which his right honourable friend indicated at an early stage would be the case <e> <s> it is very important to know that <e>", "<cs> not safety nets dampeners

limited to the care of four window boxes and a small bay tree in smith square westminster <e> <s> therefore my responsibility is not so extensive as that of many other noble lords and makes me one of the rarer species in this house though perhaps taking a detached view which is in common with most of the citizens outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are greatly in the debt of the stevens committee and the verney committee for the advance that is represented by the bill <e> <s> i should like to express my particular thanks to them <e> <s> it was nine years ago when i was minister in the department of the environment and responsible for these matters that it seemed to me that two things needed to be done <e> <s> the first was a review of the procedures by which mineral working was controlled <e> <s> i appointed the stevens committee to carry out that review <e> <s> the second was to take steps to look a little further ahead and see what kind of resources the construction industry would need in the s the s and at the end of the century where they were going to be found and how they were going to be taken to where they were wanted <e>", "<cs> i should like to rise and console the noble baroness if it is a consolation that if she has now lost the support of my noble friend lord ridley and my noble friend lord mottistone she has now gained mine <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i appreciate that one of the reasons for referring to sites and not to permissions under which the sites are being worked is in order to catch those sites on which minerals are being worked without permission <e> <s> i appreciate that point <e> <s> but in adopting the wording they have used the government failed to capture the permissions which have been given and on which work has not yet started <e> <s> those permissions will normally unless something else is specified last for five years before they lapse <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is very nice to have been able to unite the noble baroness with her two erstwhile friends <e> <s> as i said this is a probing amendment and the main purpose of it is to ascertain from my noble friend where the duty to impose a restoration condition resides <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness and i are once again together <e> <s> i hope a number of other noble lords will join us in supporting this amendment <e> <s> i have not much more to add to what she said <e> <s> i think as a first step we want the addition of these words <e> <s> the same amendment will have to be made to the scottish section if the principle is agreed and there will have to be a few other changes <e> <s> but the main additional point is that it is realistic to think of land restored after mineral working to be used for agriculture or for forestry as defined in the bill that is to say for growing commercial crops trees or grain provided that the restoration condition included the stockpiling of the subsoil and the topsoil and that the topsoil and the subsoil have been properly put back again <e> <s> alas <e> <s> this condition has not in many cases been fulfilled and in some cases even in the future it may not be able to be fulfilled as completely as we should like <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could say a brief word in support of my noble friend lord craigton <e> <s> there seem to me to be two compelling reasons why his amendment or something very like it must be accepted <e> <s> the first is that it is quite clear from abundant evidence in this debate alone that the nature conservancy council have not been serving notices on the owners and occupiers of land for which they want the title sssi <e> <s> that is obviously very desirable <e> <s> the second reason is because of what my noble friend lord mansfield said in this house on th august in connection with farm capital grants <e> <s> i quote from col of <e>", "<cs> in that case i do not think that we should accept the amendment because if the department has carefully considered the matter and decided that it is appropriate to leave it to the counties well and good but if it has not considered the matter at all it is not by any means so satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i have only one minor criticism of this amendment <e> <s> it is in the second line where local will need to be amended to read county because the districts do not want to have anything to do with highways whether ancient or modern metalled or unmetalled green or any other colour <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord avon asks us to accept his amendment no <e> <s> aa which would have the effect of pre-empting the amendment of my noble friend lord ridley i hope he will confirm his assurance which he has already given tentatively to look again at the matter <e> <s> it is true that the arrangements for controlling afforestation in national parks have been improved since it fell to me to review the national parks early in the s when the situation was very far from satisfactory and had already done a considerable amount of damage notably in the northumberland national park <e>", "<cs> this is the first time i have made a speech on this long bill and i hope that the committee will bear with me for just a few moments <e> <s> my recollection of exmoor is printed on my heart <e> <s> it was the first national park to which we went to conduct my review <e> <s> the first of a series of public meetings took place there at porlock weir <e> <s> i clearly remember the womens institute of somerset taking over the first half hour in order to protest about public loos which were going to be built on dunkery beacon <e> <s> i rise to express full sympathy with my noble friend lord ridley for the intention behind his amendment though i would prefer a different way of achieving it <e> <s> i hope we shall succeed in persuading the government to put down amendments of their own to give effect to his intention before we reach the next stage <e>", "<cs> i beg to withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness lady david in this case <e> <s> one of the most valuable innovations which have been required for a long time has been the power to appoint wardens and have them working in those areas where the public have access by agreement with the owners and occupiers of land <e> <s> the fact that it may be difficult if not impossible to find extra staff at this moment does not seem to me to be any argument for not providing the power to make appointments when the resources are available <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel that the committee will be grateful for the reply from my noble friend lord bellwin to the amendment <e> <s> certainly in so far as solutions can be found by good management of the greenways they are preferable to legislation <e> <s> we shall need to be told something fairly substantial in order to be convinced on this point when we look at it again on report <e> <s> however in particular cases local arrangements can certainly be made in which it should be possible to reconcile the legitimate rights and needs of all concerned including the motor-cyclists and there are a number of local examples of that being done <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do with her amendment i am not sure whether it will be in the bill or whether the noble baroness is going to withdraw it so that the government can propose something else may i raise two further aspects <e> <s> the amendment as worded makes it possible for a single local authority to appoint a number of wardens <e> <s> there are a number of paths which will go through more than one local authority area therefore that ought to be in the plural even in respect of the fringe areas round our big cities for which there is certainly a need <e>", "<cs> the question whether one should leave the hedges in place in order to protect the footpath or should remove them in order to facilitate agriculture and farming is just one issue in the whole business of how through management to reconcile these two potentially conflicting uses of the countryside <e> <s> this is an art which has been pioneered and developed in detail over the last decade by way of the upton management experiment starting in the lake district starting first of all in one dale and then spreading to several and now operating not only in the whole of the lake district but in a number of other national parks <e> <s> whether it is concerned with grubbing or leaving in a hedge is neither here nor there <e> <s> it can amount to that it can involve other things <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the debate so far in particular to the remarks of the noble lord lord northfield who was speaking from the front bench <e> <s> i could not help comparing his own enthusiastic not to say fulsome support for the community and the ecps in particular with his colleagues not so very far away who are so disillusioned with the whole thing as to want to withdraw completely from it <e> <s> but it may be that we see opposite to us social democrats not members of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords i am impressed by the argument brought forward by my noble friend in support of amendment no <e> <s> za that we should as far as possible proceed by voluntary means <e> <s> but we do not know about this code <e> <s> it has only just been thought of and there has been no consultation on it

"<cs> my lords i am grateful for that support <e> <s> i think the house would now like to come to a decision on this <e> <s> i do not want to say very much more except to comment briefly on what my noble friend said in that last intervention <e> <s> of course it is true to say about agricultural grants generally that their main purpose is to stimulate the production of food <e> <s> but in the case of the less favoured areas directive i do not think my noble friend is right to say that without <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i may make one observation on the matter as the noble lord lord melchett mentioned the work of our committee <e> <s> my own feeling is that if the scope for designation is going to be extended in the future we have

what i hoped would be helpful suggestions about assisting hill farmers but whose suggestions may not have been entirely acceptable to the noble baroness i agree with her that that can be undone in a few moments through a failure to be able to enforce what is proposed by this amendment <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords as an outsider to this sub-committee i was glad to respond to an invitation from the chairman to take part <e> <s> i am a member of the select committee and on one or two occasions attended the deliberations of this sub-committee on <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly welcome the timely concise and astringent report that we are speaking to today and particularly the lucid delivery of it this evening by the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> he started quite properly with a reference to the noble aspirations which lie behind the regional fund and his conversations in paris with m monnet and others some years ago <e> <s> the report records the worthy political gesture of later endorsed in by which the erdf is looked to as one instrument among several designed to obtain greater convergence between the economies of the member states of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that point may i say that his remarks are not at all cryptic they are just contradictory <e> <s> it is a fairly simple committee making a fairly simple report and to have taken nine months to fail to arrive at any conclusion at all is just too much of a delay <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate i have only two points that i want to make <e> <s> i certainly do not want to say anything of a comprehensive nature about the report except to express my gratitude to our chairman for his conduct of our scrutiny and to say what a pleasure it was to serve under him <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise to the house straight away for intervening in the debate though i shall be very brief to make only one point without having put down my name to speak <e> <s> i have been attending a council meeting of the association of district councils which was fixed a long time ago <e>", "<cs> i am entirely in sympathy with the intentions behind the amendment put by the noble baroness lady jeger but i have to agree with my noble friend lord inglewood and my noble friend lord dulverton that for a whole variety of reasons this is not perhaps a topic that can be dealt with very conveniently if at all as my noble friend has said in primary legislation <e> <s> for instance it would not deal with the problem which concerns the district of forest of dean with which authority i have had some discussions about this <e> <s> public access there does not rest on rights but on privileges accorded to the crown so the public access there would not be safeguarded by this amendment even if it was passed <e>", "<cs> this is indeed a very important amendment and my noble friend does well to take care because unlike what happened with the first amendment he has now got i suspect something like gloucestershire peers on this side of the house ranged against him <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mcnair intends to press this amendment i too would have to follow him into the lobby <e> <s> but with my noble friend lord dulverton i do not believe that this is the best way of dealing with these problems <e> <s> i was greatly encouraged when my noble friend read out the instructions in the form in which they are so far which are to guide the forestry commission in this matter of the disposal of land <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that scotland is all right so far as this goes <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> well may i just stick to this amendment <e> <s> i suppose having taken it on board for the noble lord lord dulverton i am now responsible for it and all its defects <e> <s> i was grateful to my noble friend lord mansfield for his assurance <e> <s> i thought that he gave us a satisfactory assurance to the effect that he would consider the matter <e> <s> it seems pretty clear that we can deal with it by just repealing subsection of section of the forestry act and that would be much better than doing what is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i agree entirely with the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord evans of claughton when they say that hitherto it has been possible to claim i have often claimed that local government has been more successful in keeping within the limits imposed upon it by the policy of central government than have most central government departments and agents of central government <e> <s> however i disagree entirely with my noble friend if central government go on to say as i think they do that matters can be left as they are by the secretary of state for a moment longer <e> <s> a budgeted overspend of per cent <e> <s> is far too great to be tolerated <e> <s> if one-third of local government have already succeeded in keeping their budgets within the limits needed i am confident that a very substantial number of other authorities will be able to do likewise once the challenge has been put to them as it has been by this statement <e> <s> i would urge my noble friend however to rely for as long as possible upon the good sense and responsibility of local government to do what is required of it before taking any further steps which can be interpreted and misunderstood as an interference by central government in the affairs of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the first priority under present circumstances must surely be that as many young school-leavers and college-leavers as possible should get into a proper job where they can start earning a living for themselves and for their country <e> <s> when it comes to expanding or developing the youth opportunities programme would he also agree that there are two constraints one is what we can afford the other which may be the greater is finding a sufficient number of people adequately qualified and skilled to manage the schemes which make up the programmes <e> <s> unless the young people on the programmes are given an experience which is useful to themselves and provides something which is useful to the community the public expenditure is not justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his very detailed and thoughtful response to my amendment <e> <s> i was particularly relieved that he said nothing to indicate that what is proposed is contrary to the forestry policy of her majestys government <e> <s> that was certainly not the intention <e> <s> what i am offering the house is an opportunity to consider whether the way in which we are legislating here this particularly bare clause as my noble friend lord waldegrave put it is all that can be said as a background to all that is about to happen in the general field of forestry <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that unless something is done suspicions among a number of bodies will be aroused as to what the government are up to and those suspicions can easily be allayed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take advantage of the postponement of the withdrawal of the amendment to say how glad i am that the people of the forest of dean have had the assurances and will have the amendment that they were seeking <e> <s> i was sorely tempted when the noble lord lord mcnair suggested that i should incorporate something for the forest of dean in my amendment no <e> <s> because looking back i feel confident that with the peerage of gloucestershire behind me i should have carried amendment no <e> <s> quite easily <e> <s> however i do not think that it would have been consistent to have included the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i am most gratified that the people of the forest of dean have received the protection that they were seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that <e> <s> in fact i think the arguments that could be adduced in favour of amendments nos <e> <s> a and are even more cogent than those i adduced for amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think i know what the result of pressing this amendment would be and i do not see any particular purpose in doing that <e> <s> it is true that copies of the guidelines which i think ought to be in subordinate legislation are in the library we have all seen them and are enlightened to that extent as to what will happen <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords personally i do not think that there would be any point in dividing the house but i am more convinced than ever that we are not legislating in the proper way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as the noble lord who moved an amendment in this connection in committee thank my noble friend for bringing the amendment forward and say that if it is accepted i shall not need to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend on the front bench aware that i should like my noble friend who sits behind me to have his eyes open to the potentialities of what left us as clause of the wildlife and countryside bill of which will return to us shortly as clause <e> <s> could he confirm that his right honourable friend in another place mr tom king has given an undertaking that that clause which left us applicable to national parks will come back applicable to sssis <e> <s> in view of that would he not agree that it would be as well for all parties concerned to stand back from this issue and to see whether that clause which was designed to help resolve these issues cannot be applied to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that any stimulus to local authorities in this field is <e>", "<cs> my lords like the rest of your lordships i should rather be having my supper but we have to deal with this amendment <e> <s> as the father of what is now a family of amendments that bore my name i think i ought to say a word of two here to help guide the house about the two key words shall and may <e> <s> incidentally when i moved the original amendment it had the word shall in it and it was supported by almost all noble lords who have spoken so far <e> <s> i shall seek to help them realise why there is no occasion to change their mind just because the amendment came back from the commons in a slightly different form <e>", "<cs> my lords the time it takes my noble friend to reflect on amenity in scotland provides me with the opportunity to comment briefly on this matter and to thank the government for embracing the ideas in my original amendment and bringing them forward in the more comprehensive and extensive form in which they are now before us <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will agree that the partial data and figures that i was able to give about the operation of the so-called adas tea party are a significant factor in enabling us to judge the success with which this clause is likely to operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved a similar amendment to this at committee stage in this house and was glad to withdraw it on an undertaking by the government that they would move one of their own and i am very glad now to see it <e> <s> there are indeed cogent arguments for having a clause of this type <e> <s> the most direct one is that the district councils now have the staff and experience to handle development control matters in the whole of the rest of england and wales and it is sensible that there should be provision for them to join effectively in the discharge of those responsibilities by the county councils in the case of national parks <e> <s> there is the further reason that district councils have a major responsibility for the health and wellbeing and prosperity of the local economy <e> <s> that is a purpose which many people feel should be discharged by the national park authorities although it is not statutorily laid upon them <e> <s> to the extent that districts will as of right be represented on the national park authorities it will be easier for that role to be discharged effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the argument which was put by my noble friend lord buxton of alsa and i also agree with the noble lord lord melchett that the nfu and the cla would do very well to heed his warnings <e> <s> all the time there is this peril of having planning control brought down on farming and agricultural operations <e> <s> we already have a specific directive from the eec that such things as the draining of the halvergate marshes would be subject to an environment impact assessment <e> <s> i myself do not believe that amendment no <e> <s> a is necessary if the government are wholehearted which is the point that the noble lord lord melchett was making <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to confirm that the guidelines when they have been agreed will be laid before parliament by statutory instrument <e> <s> all our discussions indicate that they will be of the greatest importance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wonder whether i may speak again on this point because fully expecting the answer yes i asked my noble friend the question whether the guidelines will be laid before parliament by statutory instrument <e> <s> i should have thought that the house would certainly expect that to be so in view of the enormous importance that is attached to the question of whether or not the funds will be available to meet the management requirements that will be called for from time to time myself i think not very often under the new clauses introduced by amendments no <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that it is getting close to improper for the house to allow through an amendment such as this without knowing one way or the other whether that particular point will be so <e> <s> but if my noble friend could increase his assurances to the point of recognising the importance of parliament seeing these guidelines and approving them before they are introduced and using his best endeavours to ensure that they are laid by statutory instrument i should be happy to leave it at that <e> <s> but i do not think that the assurances should be any less weighty than that before we allow the amendment to be incorporated <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to draw attention to the hypocrisy in the laour partys amendment <e> <s> i invite the house to look at their handling of the economy in those parts of local government where they now have control and exercise direct responsibility <e> <s> it is in the metropolitan cities where enormous difficulties are being caused to industry and where great damage is being caused to business not by the policies of her majestys government but by the high-spending policies of labour councils elected last may and led in profligacy and irresponsibility by the greater london council <e>", "<cs> well my lords that is not my responsibility <e> <s> as i was saying in my view it is the failure of the labour party to constrain the irresponsibility being shown by these councils notably the glc that has obliged the secretary of state to consider what he should do about it and required the local government finance bill to be included in the queens speech and published last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that answer and for that undertaking to publish the results in full in the <e>", "<cs> my lords two factors impel me to take a dip in welsh water <e> <s> one is the parental concern to which my noble friend lord ridley alluded and the other is that

responsibility for introducing the water bill and passing it through your lordships house on to the statute book in <e> <s> the only two factors that i want to recall are these <e> <s> first for the whole of the three years from the formation of the conservative government in to the passage of the bill in consultations were going on about the structure of the regional water authorities and that is why the precipitateness of the secretary of state for wales on this occasion is so regrettable <e> <s> we are trying in a matter of a few months to undo something which took years to construct though that is not to say that the time might not have come for some reconstruction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question that is a little more specific than that asked by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend to confirm that the government will do their level best to ensure that this item remains on the agenda of every single meeting of the council of finance ministers until it is resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank my noble friend for his answer to the noble lords question although i believe he would agree that it was somewhat incomplete and slightly approximate <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend three questions <e> <s> first does he recall the wildlife and countryside act although he may not want to recall it in section i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this debate and i must express to him my personal thanks for the compliments he paid to my noble friend lord ridley and to myself about our experience in local government <e> <s> in the case of my noble friend lord ridley that compliment was entirely justified but it is less so in my own case <e> <s> however my experience does go back to the year mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> at that time i was serving as the chaplain to the rural district council of st albans <e> <s> i took advice on how to fulfil this role and i was told you look at the mayor you look at the councillors you look at the officers and then you pray for the people of st <e> <s> albans <e> <s> today i would add that one looks also at local government finance and prays for the people of st albans <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that we shall have to be careful that the social democrats do not steal our clothes <e> <s> before elaborating on that i should like to join with others in thanking my noble friend lord belstead for his lucid introduction to the bill and the government for the things which they have included in the bill <e> <s> i am only sorry that i shall spend most of my speech criticising them for what they have left out <e>", "<cs> my lords this is much the most important single point of the whole clause <e> <s> i think that local authorities must be absolutely clear as to what their powers are going to be before they willingly accept this measure of control from parliament <e> <s> it may well be that the approach which the noble lord lord harris has just suggested of deciding in advance that they are not going to have sex shops anywhere in the district is going to far <e> <s> but i would want to be quite clear that <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that point can he say whether the government intend to include in this bill these provisions to which he has just been referring or are they still undecided <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend two or three further questions arising from this matter <e> <s> does not this situation indicate that we must move to a position where each local authority sends the bill to the ratepayers for what the authority itself needs <e> <s> is it not the case that in this instance it has been the illegal action of the greater london council that has caused the problem and nothing that has been done by the london boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord hylton on his good fortune in succeeding in the ballot in being able to introduce this debate and in bringing before us this valuable report <e> <s> i should like to pay a tribute to him and to his illustrious colleagues for producing it <e> <s> in fact the report itself is so illustrious that one is hesitant to introduce any note of criticism at all <e> <s> however there is one small mistake in the report which i should like to correct and the noble lord himself has made the same mistake <e> <s> it is rather material <e> <s> a year before this report was published that is in in the local government planning and land act the planning functions that are relevant to what we are discussing were transferred from the counties to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the report does not make that distinction clear but the noble lord is perfectly correct <e> <s> the county councils retain their structure planning powers but the local planning powers which are the more relevant to housing matters are now with the districts <e> <s> this is important because the matter to which the right reverend prelate drew attention the splitting of the powers which had existed in the past had undoubtedly made things more difficult because the county councils have applied particularly stringent planning powers to conservation areas and so on and this has made the work of the housing authorities more difficult <e> <s> now that both those functions are held by the same authority it will be easier to reconcile them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord and i could have a word about that afterwards <e> <s> i should like to say that this debate has been very useful in throwing light on one area of housing which tends to get overlooked and i am most grateful to the noble lord for introducing the debate to us today <e>", "<cs> may i make one short comment on what the noble lord said <e> <s> first to welcome it very much and to ask him if he is thinking of extending the exemptions to bear in mind military tattoos as another possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been asked to speak on this matter by the borough of burnley and i am grateful to the house for its indulgence when these matters come before it <e> <s> last month it was the shrewsbury football club and now it is the borough of burnleys dog owners <e> <s> r am anxious to speak briefly because i want to preserve my failing voice for sex shops and amendment no <e> <s> of the local government miscellaneous provisions bill <e> <s> i believe i can be brief <e> <s> it is absolutely evident that this matter may have been contentious in burnley but it has now been resolved and i have to say that burnleys by-laws on this matter are not in any way out of the ordinary <e> <s> they conform entirely to the home office guidelines if they did not they would not have been approved and in addition they were confirmed by a high court judge in <e> <s> indeed several sets of further by laws more stringent from the point of view of dog owners have been approved by the home office since <e>", "<cs> i think it would be very helpful if my noble friend could respond to that point at this stage if he has had sufficient opportunity over the weekend to reflect upon it <e> <s> i do not think that we need an amendment on this point at this stage <e> <s> i think that it would be better for all of us to reflect a little further before that <e> <s> however it would be helpful to know the position <e>", "<cs> may i just reinforce <e>", "<cs> personally i think that that explanation is helpful <e> <s> many district councils will be glad to be left the discretion to define for themselves the locality to which their decision refers <e> <s> on the other hand i would put it to the committee that there are a number of small districts districts in rural areas which in deciding an application may be taking a decision in respect of a population a fraction the size of that of a metropolitan area or some of the larger districts <e> <s> in those areas it may not be so unreasonable or inappropriate to take the view that their definition of locality is the totality of their area <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> it will be of some reassurance to us but i am not sure it will be of much help to authorities seeking to operate this legislation because subparagraphs and do no more than make it clear that a person wanting to object has to state his objection as there laid down and that in taking their decision the local authority have to take that objection into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for this amendment <e> <s> it fully meets the point that i made at second reading <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and all those who have participated in this short debate particularly those who have supported the general spirit behind this amendment <e> <s> i was one who welcomed the consultation paper as an indication that the government were now seriously applying their mind to this issue <e> <s> i did say that i had a number of criticisms to make but i forebore to deploy them on this occasion <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for doing so and there is more that could be said of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lord may i return to the matter of this amendment <e> <s> i had always thought that the labour party were particularly keen to see access to private land increased <e> <s> if that is so could not the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones say as much and confirm that for those reasons and in this case this amendment in this bill would be acceptable to the labour party <e> <s> if he could say so would the amendment therefore be the more acceptable to my noble and learned friend on the woolsack <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can let clause go by without making one or two observations on the matters we have been discussing <e> <s> i think it is true to say that most local authorities have accepted that central government have the right to impose financial constraints on public expenditure and the great majority of them have succeeded in bringing their expenditure within those constraints <e> <s> the situation last summer was that the great majority had achieved that but by the autumn the efforts of the great majority had been completely set at nought by the irresponsibility of a few authorities led by the notorious greater london council <e> <s> it is for that reason that we are having to deal with this sort of legislation and it really is hypocrisy for the party opposite to pretend otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend has made clear this is a case where the assumption of the functions by the planning boards and the committees responsible for the national parks in lieu of the powers being exercised by the district councils will effect an economy <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment is very sensible and i hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend made the point that district councils for instance would object if an obligation were laid upon them to clear up the mess as he put it wherever it occurs whoever does it and whoever owns the building and indeed that they would object <e> <s> but this clause does not do that <e> <s> this clause gives them a power and that really is quite a different point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will know that the manpower services commission has now submitted to the secretary of state its proposals for the youth training scheme which is due to come into force in september <e> <s> i am sure that all the local authorities will want to make a major contribution to the scheme and in course of so doing they will take on as it were a number of young people <e> <s> they will not be apprentices they will not be employees <e> <s> what they will be is yet to be determined <e> <s> the present idea is special status carrying the title trainee <e> <s> all i would ask is that my noble friend in responding to the noble baroness should take that point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all noble lords who have just heard that statement from my noble friend lord avon will regard this as a happy outcome of a long saga <e> <s> it is months since the burns committee reported on this subject and it has required constant prompting to use the mildest term i can to get to this position <e> <s> the last of those promptings took place as recently as last wednesday as my noble friend has said <e> <s> but we are now there and i should like to thank the government for having <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> despite the title the matters that this bill deals with are more generally known as public local inquiries <e> <s> indeed the huge majority of such inquiries are heard in public and the evidence produced in the course of them is available to the public <e> <s> but there has in the past been discretion to the inspectors who conduct these inquiries to hold some part of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken in this short debate and for the welcome they have given the bill <e> <s> it was useful that my noble friend lord avon was able to give an example of the need to have the exception that has been incorporated in the measure and i hope that served to illustrate the kind of case about which the noble baroness was asking <e> <s> i shall read if i may the re <e>", "<cs> in view of all the eloquence that has been excited among the metropolitan authorities and the county councils i should not want it to be thought that the district councils were indifferent to this whole matter <e> <s> i think that they regard this intrusion by central government and by a national audit commission and the national parliament into the affairs of local authorities and their local electorates as entirely reprehensible and as unwelcome as it is unconstitutional <e> <s> on the other hand i have to admit that there are two factors which at the moment make it quite inevitable <e> <s> one is the combination of the defiance the extravagance and the inefficiency of a number of notorious authorities mostly left-wing which has left the government no alternative but to take some action in this field and it is now just a matter of discussion as to how extreme and effective that action has to be <e> <s> in my mind there is no question but that the government have to take some action <e>", "<cs> i too very much hope that my noble friend will accept this very important amendment <e>", "<cs> i must support the noble baroness lady birk because i think that my noble friend lord bellwin is now departing quite significantly from the understanding which was reached in another place when mr joel barnett moved the amendment which led to this new clause <e> <s> the concept was accepted although the amendment was not strictly on the understanding of the chairmen of the associations as i understand it that the question concerning any individual authority affairs being revealed to the comptroller and auditor-general as distinct from the commission was clearly agreed <e> <s> for my noble friend to say now that local authorities might welcome this intrusion by the comptroller and auditor-general is certainly not the case <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend lord ridley is going to do about his amendment but i would have thought that this matter was one that we should go into very carefully and thoroughly between this stage and the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support certainly the intention of my noble friend lord kinross if not his precise amendment <e> <s> my chief reason for doing so is that as president of the association of district councils the housing authorities who operate this scheme in england i am anxious as my noble friend lord drumalbyn has said that the same happy situation should prevail in england as already prevails in scotland <e> <s> i am not yet absolutely clear what factors lead to this state of affairs <e> <s> it could i think be one of two or three <e> <s> certainly the fact that the chairman and the president are the noble lord lord kinross and the noble earl lord haig is a help <e> <s> so is the fact that a friend of mine another former naval person is in charge of the pensions for the british legion in scotland <e> <s> that must be an advantage as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i must rise to support the noble lord lord darling in the last point that he made <e> <s> i have been watching this issue with some concern on behalf of the london boroughs association authorities that administer this legislation and the district councils <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend has no intention whatever of taking into account this exercise which amounts to little more than a straw vote in the reviews and reconsiderations to which he referred in the earlier part of his speech <e> <s> the exercise needed in this must be much more thorough <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in this parliamentary session the government have produced two local government finance bills to parliament and i am sure that parliament was right to reject the first <e> <s> it involved far too great and unwarranted an intrusion by central government into local government <e> <s> but i have to say that this bill must be accepted as a regrettable necessity brought upon us as my noble friend has said by the irresponsible and defiant behaviour of a small number of local authorities whose behaviour i hope the party opposite deplores as much as all the rest of us do but which alas they were unable to control <e> <s> so i think that we have to accept this <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i do think it is to say the least of it discourteous to make a statement like this in the house without giving local authority associations any notice that it was being made still less what was going to be in it <e> <s> he is aware of course that all the local authority associations would very much deplore this development <e> <s> my own disposition is to despair at the inability of my noble friends in government to see the danger of putting local services of this kind directly in the hands of major central government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that there was a consultation exercise into the alternative routes that this road might take as far back as or <e> <s> was it not the case that as a result of that time-consuming expensive and elaborate exercise the southern corridor passing south of naseby was selected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a further question arising from that reply <e> <s> what is the point of having consultation exercises on alternative routes if something as basic as a soil survey is not first of all carried out thoroughly <e> <s> secondly having now established why it is necessary to reopen this matter would my noble friend prefer to give the house some details of the soil survey now or would he prefer to respond to a parliamentary question for written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate and i welcome very much the decision of the noble lord lord melchett not to press his prayer against this project <e> <s> i welcome the project itself in fact i was welcoming it over three years ago when the concept first appeared from brussels and at the time i was chairing a sub-committee of your lordships select committee on european affairs on rural policy <e> <s> but i have to say that whereas then we held out high hopes of this project <e> <s> i must express my disappointment that we have not achieved more <e> <s> my disappointment arises from three causes first of all that the eec commission in brussels have still not found a way of assigning funds from the social fund or the regional development fund still less from the environmental fund in order to balance the funds that are assigned from agriculture without which balance it is not really reasonable to call this an integrated development project <e> <s> my disappointment also arises from the fact that the conservation element has not been adequately built into the project as a whole and we have heard enough about that already this afternoon <e> <s> there is recognition in chapter that because no one can reasonably he expected to earn a comparable income to use the eec term from agriculture alone it is necessary to create other enterprises associated with or outside agriculture <e> <s> but this whole matter has been most cursorily dealt with there are just a few platitudes in chapter and no more without those being properly developed we really are not justified in calling this more than a major piece of agricultural extension but of course it is welcome for that alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to express my welcome for this code of practice but for reasons very different from either of the two previous speakers <e> <s> i would like nevertheless to share with them my admiration for the thoroughness and the painstaking way in which the departments involved and the voluntary bodies consulted have co-operated together to produce this code and i would like to thank my noble friend for his comprehensive yet succinct explanation of it <e> <s> i welcome it for two limited reasons <e> <s> first because it corrects the absurd defect in the legislation for which parliament must take the blame of not requiring the nature conservancy council to notify anybody other than the local planning authorities of their designation and it rectifies the mistake which the ncc have compounded and continued ever since of not having the sense to see that if designated sssis were not notified to the land owners and occupiers of the land they can hardly expect the system to work <e> <s> both those defects are rectified in this legislation and to that extent it is a step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords may i invite your lordships to switch your attention from airports to town halls and may i as president of the association of district councils start by welcoming the noble lord lord underhill in his new capacity as president of the association of metropolitan authorities to <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by apologising for not having been here at the beginning but to assure my noble friend that i shall be here at the end and to thank him for letting me see the speech he made so that i can follow his remarks reasonably well <e> <s> i want to confine myself to the new commission and to the range of functions which are comprised in the overall care of our heritage <e> <s> some of these functions will fall to be carried out by the new commission <e> <s> other functions are being carried out by other bodies <e> <s> it is inevitable that when the new commission takes over the role from two existing bodies the ancient monuments board and the historic buildings council we are landed with the cats cradle to use lord hutchinsons phrase which we find in schedules and <e> <s> but that is no reason for not clearly setting out care of the heritage on the front of the bill the functions involved in clauses and <e> <s> the general tenor of this debate is that this is something which is not adequately done at the moment and that we ought to try to put it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether my noble friend expects a great whoop of joy from either the ratepayers or the councillors at todays announcement of this settlement <e> <s> there will be gratitude for the recognition which the secretary of state expresses of the efforts of the more thrifty authorities to keep within his targets but those efforts have to be very considerable to earn any reward and there is no guarantee under the system that the rewards when earned will be achieved <e> <s> but it is the extravagance of the minority of authorities most though not all belonging to the party opposite which has made it not only feasible for the secretary of state to take the kind of measures he has been taking over the past years but politically essential for him to take those measures <e> <s> i believe that they have to be accepted <e> <s> however we must get out of this situation as soon as we can and restore to local government some of the autonomy which the constitution requires for them <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend who has spoken from a background in the army and in county councils and to stress that the need for this <e>", "<cs> i should be very glad to settle for that <e> <s> the only other point i should like to make in addition to the ones i have made already is that another group of the bodies with whom the commission must be able to work effectively are the various branches of local government <e> <s> having said that i should be very glad to withdraw my amendment on the understanding that the government like the general approach and accept that it is necessary to have the aims purposes objectives or something of that sort set out at this point in the bill <e> <s> on that understanding i shall be glad to seek to withdraw this amendment and return to the matter at report stage preferably on the basis of a government amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in his plea that there should be adequate scope in the relevant parts of the bill for the full involvement of local government <e> <s> one need only ask where we would be with the conservation of the city of york if it were not for the city council <e> <s> how could the city of chester be conserved if it were not for the city council or the city of bath <e> <s> what about the conservation of the villages of the cotswolds if it were not for the involvement of the <e>", "<cs> i shall gladly come back savagely <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a fellow of the landscape institute i should certainly like to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> everybody welcomes the emphasis on the presentation of the heritage <e> <s> that falls into two parts education and interpretation <e> <s> they both need to be mentioned <e> <s> it is also important to get the formulation right <e> <s> just the bare phrase education and instruction is not correct <e> <s> it is not part of the job of the commission to provide education <e> <s> that is a job for the education authorities <e> <s> educational facilities and educational services is better <e> <s> i think that the formulation in my own amendment no <e> <s> is even better but the great thing is to make the point <e>", "<cs> i do not think so because my amendment no <e> <s> complements and must be read in conjunction with my amendment no <e> <s> and conservation appears there <e> <s> indeed i would say that conservation is so important as to be stated as a broad aim and objective whereas the functions are all set out in no <e> <s> as tasks the commission must discharge to achieve that aim <e> <s> however the noble lord has raised a matter which could be looked at again between now and report <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this short debate and for the assurance given to me by my noble friend <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk is right to say that any redrafting of the amendment must take fully into account everything else that has been said in our debates on clause <e> <s> indeed nobody would have been more surprised than i if the government had immediately accepted my amendment as drafted and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i also would like to support this amendment or the intentions behind it <e> <s> there is a good deal in the architectural standards of the psa which leave a good deal to be desired <e> <s> i share very much with the noble baroness a distaste for some of the modern buildings that it has put up for example post offices telephone exchanges and so on in highly sensitive central areas <e> <s> but i do not think that that is something with which we can deal in this bill which is to do with heritage buildings <e> <s> nor do i think that we can deal with all the problems at once in this legislation <e>", "<cs> although i am chairman of the redundant churches committee of the church commissioners i do not want to get involved in this discussion but before we leave this paragraph i wonder whether my noble friend can answer me this question not now but in writing <e> <s> he will be aware that the pastoral measure to which paragraph refers is dated and that last year we passed the pastoral amendment measure <e> <s> the amendment measure and this measure are now in the process of being consolidated by the church authorities and when that has been achieved they will come before the ecclesiastical committee and so on <e> <s> so we shall then be left with the business of the church measure referred to being consolidated with its amendment measure but the consolidation of the rest of this legislation pertaining to schedule not having been started but being urgently required as the noble lord lord kennet mentioned in connection with his first amendment this afternoon <e>", "<cs> the system in the noble lords amendment has some merit but i think mainly in france and not in england <e> <s> in france where their <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds to the noble baroness i should like to say that i believe the view of the planning authorities would certainly be that they do not want to be delayed in coming to decisions on applications with all due despatch <e> <s> there is very properly tremendous pressure on planning authorities to handle planning matters expeditiously <e> <s> certainly it is entirely appropriate for the commission if it is created to be given an opportunity to exercise its advisory role in relation to both the secretary of state and the local authorities <e> <s> the safeguard for those who feel that there are important heritage issues which must be protected is that the secretary of state can intervene either on his own initiative or after having heard the advice of the commission and call in the application <e> <s> there is a distinction between that and the executive actions of the planning authorities or the secretary of state if he calls in an application which must not be unduly delayed or interrupted <e> <s> i believe that the balance in the bill provides for the commission to exercise its advisory functions and to do so in <e>", "<cs> i believe it might be for the convenience of the committee and may help expedite our business and my noble friend in making his reply if i were to speak to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> while we are discussing this amendment <e> <s> i would point out that as compared with amendment no <e> <s> h my amendment is quite different and does not at all presuppose the abolition or extinction of the royal commission although i have to say that if i were drafting my amendment now in the light of the debates we have had so far for the word future i would substitute <e>", "<cs> and seeking to establish a body to adopt a single integrated approach to the care of the heritage i have little doubt that we would regard academic research into the heritage as being fundamental to the care of it and scholarly study of the heritage as needing to be integrated with the care of the heritage <e> <s> because of that when i came to draft amendment no <e> <s> on the aims of cfamahbfe i put recording before conservation <e> <s> i believe it is the absence of any reference to this academic dimension in the work of the cfamahbfe that is causing the concern which has been expressed by the noble lords lord beloff lord baker and lord blake in our debates and by the president of the british academy in <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment we are discussing and go for the shortest of the alternatives proposed for two reasons <e> <s> first it is quite unthinkable that the title proposed in the bill will last for more than a week or two <e> <s> if one attempts to use it either in its full form or in its abbreviated form for more than a few minutes one can realise that <e> <s> the second is to rebut the point being made about <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer the point just made by the noble marquess lord aberdeen and temair <e> <s> i have only put in the words knowledge of because that is a little broader in its effect <e> <s> if one has experience in which is what i am concentrating on that is limited to people who have been elected and served as councillors whereas as the noble lord said there are a number of people with a very wide knowledge of local government through having cooperated with it and so on who would come into a slightly broader scope and i am trying to be as broad as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could do so <e> <s> the assurances if one could rely on assurances are more than adequate but as we often say to ministers when discussing legislation what really counts is what is on the face of the bill <e> <s> when my noble friend said at the beginning of his remarks that he thought there were better ways in which to secure on the face of the bill the involvement of local government i was hoping that he would then go on and say exactly where and how that should be done but he did not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords <e> <s> the difficulty we are in is that on the one hand we must obviously avoid putting into legislation words that are not necessary and i would not want for a moment to disagree with the noble and learned lord lord simon about that <e> <s> on the other hand the secretary of state in proposing this bill at all is seeking to improve on the existing state of affairs which means pointing up here and there in the bill and specifically mentioning those items which have been neglected overlooked or not effectively discharged in the past <e> <s> it was in seeking to do this that i tabled this amendment <e> <s> but in the light of this discussion and particularly of the assurances from my noble friend i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that brief debate and i how to nobody in my admiration of the royal commission for the work they do and continue to do <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord adeane said in reply to my noble friend lord mottistone the extent of those records often proves to be insufficient for the kind of purposes which i illustrated in my reference to an imaginary by-pass around newark i could have used it in respect of a whole lot of matters <e> <s> such as central area development and so on and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord geoffrey-lloyd <e> <s> i am grateful too to my noble friend lord montagu for enabling me to make clear as i should have done in the first instance the kind of thing i had in mind <e> <s> it would depend entirely on the initiative of the owner as indeed does the application for grant under the agricultural development scheme <e> <s> i do not think there would be any difficulty in developing administrative arrangements which would entirely preclude the commission from intruding on anybodys private property and beginning to tell them how they should manage it what they should do with the contents who they should cater for how it should be insured and so on <e> <s> of course it is a matter for the private owner to take the initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we need to think about this a little more <e>", "<cs> moved as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not <e> <s> i have moved the amendment to give other noble lords an opportunity to put forward their comments i have nothing further to say myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend but i am not entirely reassured <e> <s> perhaps i may just recapitulate on the discussions we have had on this business of establishing committees <e> <s> the first point which we want to make and many noble lords have made it is that this is an important duty which my noble friend has not denied and it is in its best place if it is on the face of the bill and not tucked away among the various arrangements that are required for the internal working of the commission <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> moved as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be most grateful <e> <s> i think the principle would be introduced by what the noble earl has already put in in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been watching this part of the bill as a church commissioner and as a member of the ecclesiastical committee of both houses of parliament <e> <s> i am able to say that these amendments entirely meet the points that the general synod of the church of england was making to the department at an earlier stage <e> <s> so it is entirely satisfactory and i am grateful to my noble friend for the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a very good practice to use examples like that for designing legislation <e> <s> as my noble friend has been good enough to accept my amendment no <e> <s> which secures the influence of local government within the commission itself i think i can and indeed must give him an assurance that that is a far better way of dealing with matters such as those raised by these two amendments and the next three or four all of which if accepted would add quite considerably to the burdens on local government and the exchange of paperwork and the general building up of bureaucracy between local government on the one hand and this commission on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be for the convenience of the house as i have amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord adeane and to my noble friend lord avon for their response to what i had to say on the two amendments <e> <s> as the noble earl lord perth has suggested it is of course quite unreasonable to require the government to say here and now what should be the future working relationships between the heritage commission and the royal commission <e> <s> but neither of the amendments is asking for that <e> <s> all that is asked for is a statement from the government as to how they are going to handle in the bill the relationships between the royal commission on the one hand and the heritage commission on the other and any other bodies involved <e> <s> that is all that either of the amendments seeks to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by congratulating the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal for coining the expression watercrat <e> <s> it conjures up just the image that we need in front of us and on which to concentrate our minds in deciding what to do on this bill and to bring some sort of accountability to the people who will be operating the water industry <e> <s> i took pride some years ago in introducing the water act to your lordships house and i still take some pride in having taken a small part in creating the system of regional water authorities which have overall responsibility for the water cycle from raindrop to the rivers and to the sea <e> <s> but i take no pride at all in belonging to the party responsible for introducing this bill <e> <s> my shame chiefly resides in the total lack of accountability under which these regional water authorities will now be left to operate <e> <s> it strikes me as it has my noble friend lord ridley as very strange that a conservative government seems bent upon nationalising the water industry because that is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a delight to listen to a debate in your lordships house which results from what one might describe as the classic athenaeum-style campaign with its beautifully orchestrated debate and its well-timed letter to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want the noble lord to shrug off my compliments <e> <s> my main reason for taking part is the noble lords invitation to do so <e> <s> perhaps he did so as he said in his opening remarks thinking that as we were both vice-presidents of the youth hostels association we might share their views and indeed i do share their views <e> <s> their view is that this proposal for a trading account ought to be questioned and i do question it <e> <s> i should have thought that every noble lord who is taking part in this debate has questioned it <e> <s> but to get an answer to my questions i opened and re-read the report of the ordnance survey review committee <e> <s> the more i read the more my questions were indeed answered and the more i found myself being satisfied with the proposal that we have before us <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be one way of doing it but by no means the only way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness replies as the noble earl has mentioned my name may i say how grateful i am that he has undertaken to take aboard the concepts which i mentioned at an earlier stage of the bill under the general heading of management <e> <s> i am delighted to hear what he has said in response to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having indicated now so clearly that they appreciate the need for the concept of management in addition to the concepts of preservation conservation and promotion of enjoyment i hope the government will go one stage further during the passage of the bill in another place and make quite certain that the concepts of management being applied by this clause particularly to the ancient monuments which are the direct responsibility of ministers can be exercised by influence over the historic buildings which are in private hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am sorry i have not convinced him but let us see how the house feels <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been urging the government by a series of amendments throughout every stage of the bill to come to a decision on this matter before the bill leaves us <e> <s> i am relieved they have managed to do so on the very last day and i thank my noble friend lord avon for having achieved that <e> <s> the staff of the royal commission must be immensely relieved also <e> <s> i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord adeane for having first welcomed the decision and then gone on to spell out in such comprehensive detail exactly how the royal commission are to set about their work and how they see the important and fascinating business of working out the relationships between themselves and the new commission and between the new commission and the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords having had not one but three or four amendments accepted it would be churlish of me not to rise to thank my noble friend for his conduct of this bill <e> <s> it is rare for a bill to arrive with its heart missing but i think we would all agree that in introducing clause to the second part my noble friend on the front bench has indeed done a masterly job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to welcome the report <e> <s> i am grateful to the members of the committee for allowing me on one or two occasions to help them to produce it <e> <s> it alludes to and builds upon a similar study undertaken by sub-committee g the environmental sub-committee of the european select committee which i had the honour to chair some three years ago <e> <s> as the noble lord lord raglan has said this committee is well furnished with farmers and farming interests if not dominated by them <e> <s> therefore i find it particularly significant that this report dealing with the same range of topics and the same impending problems such as the accession of spain portugal and greece to the community the recession and so on is far sharper in its criticisms of agricultural policy as developed by the commission in brussels and by the ministry in whitehall far more urgent in its pleas and bolder and more radical in the remedies that it proposes <e> <s> that is just as well because as the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos indicated in opening the debate no nettles have been grasped since we pointed them out three years ago <e> <s> the one development of policy on which we hung our report three years ago namely an integrated development programme for the western isles has proved to be a misnomer and a disappointment <e> <s> as the minister of state for scotland said to one of our select committees only a few weeks ago it is little more than an agricultural extension scheme and a <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt my noble friend as he has left that point now because we do not quite have the record straight about this <e> <s> i said it had failed to meet our hopes and expectations of it that we expressed in our earlier report three years ago <e> <s> i am still convinced of that and the minister of state for scotland said as much to sub-committee g the other day <e> <s> he said that all we could claim for this was that it was a rather more elaborate and extensive agricultural extension scheme and in that respect i am sure it will be a success <e> <s> there are all the indications that it will be a success <e> <s> what we have yet to see is a proper fully-integrated rural development programme coming from the commission and supported by the government <e> <s> it is now too late for this particular scheme to fulfil those expectations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say a word as my name is linked to both of the amendments we are discussing <e> <s> i am sure that we should not get too excited at this stage because there is much rougher water ahead <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that we are changing from a system in which the regional water authorities <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may just intervene very briefly before my noble friend replies <e> <s> we have been discussing the assistance and advice which the water authorities can give overseas by way of large scale commercial contracts <e> <s> but i mentioned on second reading that there is considerable scope for them to give assistance overseas to much smaller scale projects by way of a charitable and voluntary effort <e> <s> that is an issue which i wanted to raise when we discussed clause but in view of the lateness of the hour and the considerable amount of work that we still <e>", "<cs> i was sorely tempted to stir up the squabble which i thought was developing between the two noble baronesses opposite but i will resist that temptation and say that the acceptance by the government of the idea of a power rather than a duty which results from the studies of our select committee and the report of the monopolies and mergers commission is the correct stance to adopt <e> <s> it only required the modification which my noble friend on the front bench indicated that he would add to the amendment he originally tabled to produce the accord which i ventured to suggest at second reading could be reached if we all applied our minds to this matter <e> <s> therefore i am very grateful for what my noble friend has said and i look forward to the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is certainly not the chief whips fault that we took over an hour and a half on a single amendment earlier today but nor is it my fault <e> <s> i feel that we have now reached an important part of the bill and we shall have to spend some time on it <e> <s> this is an amendment which bears the name of myself the noble baroness lady fisher who is leading for the opposition and my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> when my noble friend and i table amendments it is sometimes assumed that we are speaking respectively with the interests of the acc and the adc in mind <e> <s> in this particular case i have to say that my noble friend lord ridley wants me to start by dissociating the association of county councils from the whole conception of consumer consultative committees because he thinks they will be totally ineffective <e> <s> i share that view to the extent that as at present constituted they will be totally ineffective and i think that in parliament we have a duty to do what we can to remedy that situation rather than abandon it <e>", "<cs> it does put us in rather an awkward position because this of all the clauses is the one to which parliament should be paying the most attention but i hesitate to invite my noble friend to read what looks like a fairly formidable speech <e> <s> i wonder if i might suggest to him that it might meet the case if he caused the lengthy remarks which he says he has at his disposal to be published in the <e>", "<cs> in the light of that response with some reluctance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend could just confirm what he said or perhaps correct a point which i may have misheard <e> <s> i thought that he started off his response to amendment no <e> <s> by saying that we are dealing with two quite separate bodies and i agreed with him there <e> <s> there is the committee which is referred to in the amendment of <e>", "<cs> i really must urge my noble friend to take that advice and also to make provision on the face of the bill <e> <s> it does confuse the matter enormously if he continues to suggest to the committee which i really do not think he meant to do that what is contained in amendment no <e> <s> plus the additional factors which are quite appropriately being introduced by the noble lord lord melchett all of which require to be dealt with on a regional level corresponding to each regional water authority can somehow be dealt with not on the face of the bill but by guidelines relating to clause which have to do with consumer consultative councils which although we do not know as much as we want to know about them we know are going to be organised on a divisional basis <e> <s> they cannot possibly be dealt with in one and the same package <e>", "<cs> divisional <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask what is the purpose of having her majestys inspectorate of schools if they are not able to keep his right honourable friend supplied with important information of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think it is satisfactory for him to say that he hopes religious education will be taught in all our schools but not to be in a position to tell the house the answer to my quite clear question as to the number of schools in which religious education is not being taught <e> <s> does he agree that whereas head teachers have a wide discretion as to what they teach and how they teach it in relation to all other subjects in respect of religious education parliament has expressed the will that it should be taught to all children in all schools for the whole of their school life primarily according to agreed syllabuses which are certainly based on the christian faith but also in respect of other denominations and other faiths by withdrawal classes <e> <s> is it not really necessary for my noble friend his right honour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper that the bill be re-committed to a committee of the whole house in respect of clause <e> <s> i first of all owe the house an apology for having sprung this motion on your lordships at very short notice and with a small amount of consultation with only a few members <e> <s> i shall seek to explain the purpose of the motion in a moment but first i should like to deal with a misapprehension which has occurred in the mind of the chief whip and which may therefore have occurred in the minds of a few others of your lordships and of which i should like to dispose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the house for giving this matter the amount of attention it has had <e> <s> i think we need to stick strictly to the procedural issues and not deal with the substance of the amendments <e> <s> a number of references have been made to precedents <e> <s> i do not agree that this would create a precedent <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble baroness <e> <s> i agree with her that it is not necessary to say a great deal more because this is the same amendment that was debated very thoroughly at committee stage <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable concern to the local authority associations <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley whose name is on the amendment asked me to apologise to the house for not being here to join in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave amendment no <e> <s> this might be a convenient moment for me to raise a rather different point about the activities of the british water industry overseas of which i have given notice to the house and to my noble friend at two earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> it is to seek assurances and perhaps a blessing from my noble friend if that is not asking a bit much after the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble friend for introducing this amendment <e> <s> i like to think that with this he and i can say that we have patched up our quarrel of four oclock or so <e> <s> in introducing this range of amendments he has done everything for which the local authorities were asking if i may speak for the metropolitan authorities as well as for the district councils and rather more <e> <s> we are most grateful to him for it <e> <s> if he were to meet me in the bar when we adjourn i should like to offer him a drink on the strength of it <e>", "<cs> i have to agree with my noble friend lady elliot of harwood <e> <s> it is pointless to compare the regional water authorities and their consumer consultative councils with commercial companies <e> <s> of course it would be inappropriate to have the press and public present at meetings of the board of a commercial company in a competitive situation still less to reveal in advance their proposals to the press <e> <s> but the bodies we are talking about are totally different <e> <s> these are bodies which operate in the public sector <e> <s> they are monopolies and they manage a commodity of vital importance to every single citizen of the country day by day and hour by hour <e> <s> the situation is totally different from that of a commercial company <e> <s> we must not make the mistake of making these silly comparisons <e>", "<cs> they are not called super-bureaucrats they are called watercrats a term introduced by the noble baroness lady fisher but misprinted by <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee for a thorough debate of this amendment <e> <s> i think we are now making some worthwhile progress <e> <s> the first point that i want to accept from both my noble friend lord cullen and my noble friend lord skelmersdale is the fact that in all this we have to provide for a considerable amount of flexibility <e> <s> we are not setting up a single consultative committee for a single industry we are setting up divisional consumer consultative committees spread all over england and wales in a network amounting to seven or eight in the case of severn-trent in each of authorities <e>", "<cs> as i have said already i should like to welcome this amendment and in response to what the noble lord lord underhill said earlier i would strongly recommend to my noble friend on the front bench that if he accepts the idea behind this amendment and incorporates in any government amendment to it the suggestion that the guidelines should be laid before parliament by a formal statutory instrument this would enable us to place more reliance on them and make it less necessary to insist on all the other essentials which otherwise would have to <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is much confusion <e> <s> i think the committee is quite clear that when these guidelines are laid before parliament they must be laid by statutory instrument <e> <s> the only matter for debate and we can return to this at another stage is whether that should be by the negative procedure in which case they can be prayed against or by the affirmative procedure in which case there has to be a debate <e> <s> there is no question that any other less formal arrangement will meet the case <e> <s> it will not meet the case <e> <s> if my noble friend will accept this then he will help himself help me and help all of us in having to be less scrupulous about the essentials that go into the bill itself <e> <s> anything less than that will not have the slightest effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will agree that it has been useful to have these debates and this one in particular <e> <s> there was one important matter which i do not think my noble friend mentioned although we have discussed it before namely the assurance that the meetings of the consumer consultative councils will be open to the press and the public <e> <s> i do not think that there is any need for him to restate that now <e> <s> it was recorded earlier on <e> <s> but i should like it to be on the record again as it is one of the things which has been established in the course of the debates on this clause <e> <s> having said that i personally am well content to leave the matter now to the laying before parliament of the guidelines when they have been finalised <e> <s> that will be the moment perhaps to come back to the issue raised by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships for not being present when the bill was discussed at second reading <e> <s> at that time i was somewhat preoccupied by the water bill <e> <s> your lordships will know from those proceedings that i am not reluctant to cast my vote against the government when i think they are wrong <e> <s> equally i am not reluctant to vote for them when i am sure they are right as i believe they are in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first does he agree that when the district audit has completed the study that it is doing in this general field of the provision and management of leisure centres we shall be in a better position to assess these matters <e> <s> secondly would he provide us with a fairly comprehensive written answer to a question if i were to ask one after the recess on progress which i believe to be all too slow in the dual use of educational buildings for leisure and recreation <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord for having introduced and explained this code although perhaps it is stretching the terms of that convention to put it quite like that when there have been only seven of us in the chamber <e> <s> nevertheless we are grateful <e> <s> i think that local government is grateful too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal should not apologise in any way <e> <s> she has given us a very lively and spirited <e>", "<cs> i also wish to express the hope that my noble friend the minister will take the amendment seriously and look into this matter carefully <e> <s> several noble lords made the point earlier today that what we have before us now is a private members bill promoted by the nfu and the cla and it is our job to ensure that the public interests have been taken fully into account <e> <s> it is not in the interests of the public that all the land of this country should be managed so as to maximise agricultural production and to maximise yield from that land for the benefit of the landlord and the tenant although of course we all wish them well <e> <s> in many parts of the country the public interest lies in a quite different direction <e> <s> it does not lie in the ever-increasing production of more foods which are already in surplus <e> <s> it does not lie in further diminution of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment and i can do so quite shortly because i think he has explained it very thoroughly to the committee already <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the experience of the practitioners involved in the type of legislation with which we have been dealing as it has so far been drafted and so far enacted hinders rather than helps in the adoption of management agreements between public bodies such as the nature conservancy council the national park authorities the local authorities on the one hand and landlords or their tenants on the other for the proper management of land in the countryside in the interests of conservation and a whole range of other activities on the land besides that of farming and agricultural production <e>", "<cs> indeed i do and so do many of my noble friends on both sides of the committee <e> <s> this is what we are here for <e> <s> but i do not think that i need go into this matter much more <e> <s> all that is necessary is for the minister if as i hope he agrees with the general <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can answer that question before my noble friend the minister replies <e> <s> in the discussions which will go on between now and the next stage it may well be necessary to look at paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> perhaps i may first answer the point made by the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i think that what the upland management experiments in snowdonia and the lake district showed was that there is a halfway house between the purely informal arrangements which the noble lord described and which are adequate if the pressures are not too great though in the lake district they are too great and other arrangements <e> <s> on the other hand if the farmer has to deal directly with the highway authority he undoubtedly has a major problem of bureaucracy on his hands <e>", "<cs> yes i was going on to make that very point <e> <s> the upland management experiments went ahead on the basis of all the agreements being <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in the circumstances that is a question which my noble friend on the front bench might be able to answer a little better than i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i had received the same letter from the national trust but i did not raise the point just now because i was entirely satisfied that the amendment that my noble friend on the front bench had so helpfully drafted for us fully met the point <e> <s> i was going to tell them so tomorrow but now they will be able to read it themselves <e> <s> my own view in responding to what my noble friend has just said is that it would be well following any discussions that we have even if we find an amendment that we could put down to leave these amendments dealing with conservation alone <e> <s> they have been agreed and settled after long and difficult discussions and i would be loth to be instrumental in messing them about <e> <s> if we can find another amendment that deals with management agreements to do with issues other than conservation i would greatly prefer to try and get them into the bill as a separate exercise on another occasion <e> <s> but that is only a matter of tactics <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was unable to be present last week when this group of amendments was taken may i add my thanks to my noble friend lord belstead for the co-operative way in which the whole subject has been dealt with and for the governments very welcome acceptance of the projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate my noble friend on the front bench on his courtesy and doggedness in handling this bill and to thank him for three things <e> <s> first i should like to thank him for rating me up to the rank of viscount it was unexpected recognition at an unexpected moment and to thank him on behalf of those of us who sought to persuade him that this was a good moment to modify this legislation so that it allowed agriculture to have more regard for conservation both as regards estate management practised by the landlord and as regards the husbandry as practised by the tenant farmer <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister particularly for saying that he is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> it is of course the case that this amendment stems to some extent from the housing authorities one association of which i have the honour to represent as president <e> <s> but it also as my noble friend indicated stems from the experience of my noble friend lady faithfull with a lifetimes background in the social services of the county councils <e> <s> if the fact is that my noble friend would find it easier to see the force of this argument if he were able to study a few case histories then i will see what can be done in the way of providing them <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for what he has said and for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords how excellent was the advice recently profferred to the clergy to give up politics for lent <e> <s> but alas when i accepted the presidency of the adc some four or five years ago i did not stipulate that i should be allowed to indulge in such abstinence <e> <s> so here i am to my dismay and certainly i am sure to yours up to my neck in politics <e> <s> my first link with local government began years ago when i was a full-time curate recently invited by one of my parishioners she was the village postmistress to be her chaplain <e> <s> she was then the chairman of the st albans rural district council those were pre-reformation days of course <e> <s> i had to ask my rector what this new duty involved <e> <s> well john he said to me you call the council to prayer you look at the chairman you look at the councillors you look round at the officers and you pray for the people of st <e> <s> albans <e>", "<cs> i too welcome this amendment not so much for the detailed proposal that it makes but for the opportunity it has created for a debate on this matter before we embark on the committee stage on the bills specific proposals <e> <s> i very much agree with the noble baroness when she says that this is a matter which concerned a very large number of those of us who took part in the second reading debate <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee would allow me to intervene briefly once more before the noble lord lord underhill responds to the minister and decides what to do with the amendment in his name <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench very properly and very much as expected spent a great deal of time dealing directly with the amendment <e> <s> i welcome the amendment not so much to support it as to say how useful i think it is to have this type of debate at this stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness winds up this debate i should like to respond with thanks to what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> what i and my noble friend lord broxbourne have been asking for and what the noble lord lord stallard was just supporting was the suggestion that we owed it to the house and to the committee in debating this bill to have a discussion with my noble friend before we get any further into it <e> <s> the discussion could be on those simple agreed minor improvements to the rating system which can now be considered afresh in view of the fact that all proposals and all commitments to abandon the rating system have now themselves been put to one side <e> <s> that is the small change which makes it possible to have that useful discussion <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in the amendment which he has moved on our behalf <e> <s> may i stress immediately that i am not doing so as president of the association of district councils <e> <s> various hit lists of various lengths have been mentioned <e> <s> not only the numbers to but individual local authorities have been cited but not in a single case i believe has a member of the association of district councils been cited <e> <s> we are not high spending authorities and to a very large extent we would be exempted by the million criterion which is to be found later in the bill <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is right and i am sure that he must be in indicating to the committee how these reports will be received and dealt with in each house under clause then there is surely no difficulty in his accepting one or other of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> if he will say to the committee now that he is minded to accept one or the other preferably no <e> <s> i think we shall find it easier to proceed <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> only puts in statutory form what he has just indicated <e>", "<cs> no but my noble friend was indicating in reply to the noble lord lord graham that these reports would be open to discussion in each house of parliament and that is what we expected him to say <e> <s> we were glad to hear it from him <e> <s> if that is so then there is no difficulty <e>", "<cs> that is a most helpful suggestion from my noble friend because the notes on clauses are quite specific as the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> if my noble friend is now prepared to consider what provision should be made to ensure that there is a proper debate in each house of parliament when this report is laid that is a considerable advance and i think we should be grateful to him for that <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might intervene briefly before the noble lord lord evans does what i think he is going to do and presses this to a division <e> <s> we are debating four amendments nos <e> <s> and and i think it might be for the convenience of the committee if we did not have to go over the ground again when we get to amendments and <e> <s> my noble friend a moment ago was speaking i thought in a helpful and constructive way in response to the debate we were having on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be helpful to the committee and save time which i am sure the chief <e>", "<cs> i am enormously encouraged by that reply <e> <s> the principle has been fully accepted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment to seek a more appropriate and acceptable formula for giving effect to it <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on what my noble friend has just said before the noble baroness lady stedman decides how she wants to wind up this debate <e> <s> i hope she will not press the amendment because i think it could be drafted better to achieve the purpose she has in mind <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord broxbourne and my noble friend lord renton that the noble baroness has a point of some substance and i am afraid do not think my noble friend on the front bench has met it <e>", "<cs> clearly and without any question the extravagant overspenders from all the rest <e> <s> i beg leave to differ with him on that <e> <s> if that were so if that could be done by now we should not be being told about or authorities who might or might not be designated we should be told quite clearly who they are <e> <s> we know they include the glc almost certainly hackney and possibly basildon but that is about as far as it goes <e> <s> as to the rest there is no great certainty as to which they are because these two instruments of grea and target have been shown over and over again ever since they were introduced to be grossly imperfect <e> <s> they were imperfect for the purposes for which they were introduced <e> <s> they are now being used for quite different purposes and they are even more imperfect <e>", "<cs> i should just like to round off this matter <e> <s> we must not go on too long on this particular point <e> <s> but if my noble friend feels as strongly as he does would it not be very simple to spell out the principles by which we can determine these or authorities and have their names and then we should know where we stood <e> <s> that is the way in which to justify the argument that my noble friend is putting forward <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause i feel obliged to ask the committee to reflect on two very undesirable features which the debate on this clause has revealed <e> <s> first of all we spent the early part of this sitting on the bill discussing a number of proposals by different noble lords to give special emphasis to a <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to members of the committee who have taken part in this debate and particularly to my noble friend on the front bench for the information he has given us <e> <s> so far as i am concerned there is no question of rejecting this amendment because i am not going to press it <e> <s> i said that it was a probing amendment to elicit some more information from the government about the circumstances in which this part of the bill is likely to be used the reasons for it and the justification for it <e> <s> to some extent it has succeeded in that <e>", "<cs> we will go on pressing but i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to this amendment and i speak to it now because i want to invite my noble friend to say a little bit more about the circumstances in which this part of the bill will come into force <e> <s> one of the reasons given hitherto has been that the government envisage circumstances in which local government expenditure as a whole will become out of control and will begin to distort their general economic policy <e> <s> if that were so then there is a justification for the general powers but i very much agree with the noble baroness who has just spoken that it is not proper for the government to expect parliament to give the government a blank cheque <e>", "<cs> every noble lord on the committee would agree with me when i say that there is not anyone here or in another place who has not viewed the prospect of part ii of this bill and clause in particular with the very greatest reluctance and caution <e> <s> that is why it is sad that the probing amendments today have so far failed to elicit any willingness from my noble friend and from the government to amend clause in any way so as to provide parliament with or to put on the statute book any indications at all or measurements of the circumstances in which the general powers these very wide general powers of part ii will be activated <e> <s> that ought to give us all cause for concern <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> i believe that the committee would agree with me that if for instance we had taken a vote at second reading and rejected the bill that would indeed have been voting down a decision by another place and very few of us would have dreamt of doing such a thing <e> <s> but to take a decision at the committee stage or at any stage on a particular clause in a bill which has the effect of making the other place debate it and think about it again is an entirely proper function for this house and one to which we quite frequently have recourse <e>", "<cs> may i make a brief point before my noble friend replies to the debate <e> <s> he was rebuking me mildly during the previous debate in respect of the association of district councils whose views i sometimes venture to impart to your lordships <e> <s> he said that they appear to be so grudging and do not show their gratitude for these concessions when they are offered <e> <s> i hope that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i take the silence of the other noble lords who are associated with these three amendments to indicate that they agree with what i was proposing <e> <s> before withdrawing this amendment i would hasten to say in response to what has been said by the other two noble lords that certainly there is now a case for a very considerable amount of thought and reflection on the various proposals for time limits which have been mooted at various times and the various objections which the government have raised to them <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench has confirmed that he has not anything further to say on any of these three amendments that he has not previously said so do not let us waste time dealing with each of them <e>", "<cs> with clause we come to the end of part iii headed other provisions relating to rates and precepts <e> <s> i want to make three brief points <e> <s> first we welcome the modest progress which has been made in this part towards improving and reforming the rates system <e> <s> secondly to thank my noble friend on the front bench for the meeting he arranged last thursday with a number of us to examine with him the scope for making more improvements and speeding up the rate at which those improvements are made <e> <s> finally to express the hope that before the bill leaves us and to a large extent between now and the next stage we may be able to identify together further steps that can be taken to speed up progress on the matters listed in chapter of the annexe to the white paper on a good number of which there is not too much progress to be seen at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not often intervene in scottish debates and so far as i can remember never to help the noble lord lord ross of marnock but i am provoked to do so now because surely all this points to the need for a very early revaluation of everything in both kingdoms of england and scotland <e> <s> there is not much benefit to be had from england because we have not had a revaluation for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend and in view of his acceptance of the principle and his undertaking to produce yet a further amendment though to be drafted by the government i am delighted to be able to withdraw my own amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to intervene on this amendment not so much to support the amendment itself as the idea behind it <e> <s> i should like to start by thanking my noble friend for sending me a copy of the letter which he wrote to the noble lord lord northfield after the debate which we had on the th may during the committee stage where we were discussing this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is an excellent amendment and it does nothing at all to upset the flexibility which my noble friend requires <e> <s> but unless i manage to collect some support from either the ama or the acc i shall obviously not have any luck <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for these two amendments <e> <s> they are the last in a series of amendments which we have considered and debated at each of the previous stages of the bill <e> <s> my original amendment was designed to have the effect of ensuring that the million threshold continued to have the same effect on the smaller local authorities after the passage of the bill as it had when the bill was presented to parliament <e> <s> i think that is the effect it now has <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate my noble friend <e> <s> that is a very good effort <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said at the beginning of his remarks that local government finance was running out of control and so it is <e> <s> one of the reasons is that there are certain units of local government which are being led by irresponsible defiant and extravagant leaders <e> <s> another of the reasons is that successive governments ever since have failed to keep local government financial arrangements a match for the situation with which they have to deal <e> <s> we are now in the position where the local electorates who are the right people to control local government finance do not have the mechanisms available with which to do so <e> <s> it is that which has to be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has done his best throughout the passage of this bill but i think so far as the two conservative presidents of the associations of district councils and county councils are concerned the less said about the bill the better <e> <s> the secretary of state is coming to our annual conference next week and i think i shall leave it till then <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak at this stage on the bill as i had only some points to make in committee when we reach clause <e> <s> but i find myself provoked by what has already been said to say a few words now <e> <s> i share the view of my noble friend on the front bench that this is an important bill which must be got onto the statute book with all due dispatch but i also certainly share the view expressed by the noble lord lord graham that it would be quite wrong to assume that this house is ready to pass it on the nod because a very large sector of the housing stock of the whole nation is involved <e> <s> very important very large sums of money are involved and very important judgments and balances have to be taken between the new increase in the private sector and the public sector and the expenditure required of central government and of local government <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord graham indicates what he wishes to do with his amendment may i say on behalf of the association of district councils that we welcome the governments recognition of the special case that arises where the local authority is having to deal with houses which were provided in the first place by other public bodies such as the national coal board the atomic energy authority and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened as i have done to the interesting anecdotes and reminiscences of the noble brothers mackie and mackie <e> <s> but if we were expecting to find on those blank sheets that were mentioned some indications of labour and liberal party policy in this difficult matter i think we have to say that the sheets still look a little blank <e> <s> i find this a welcome change from the rates bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for this announcement <e> <s> first the earlier date which his right honourable friend has chosen will be very welcome giving as it does greater time for consultation and deliberation on the issues raised by it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to address myself to the amendment <e> <s> all that the amendment asks us to do is to consider whether it would be helpful in dealing with this problem to impose a delay on designation by the secretary of state until such time as he and the local authority associations have agreed about the resources required <e> <s> i really do not think that that would be helpful <e> <s> there is a major problem here we heard all about it at second reading and on committee and we have heard all about it again just now <e> <s> the first way of tackling this is to define it with as much precision as is possible and the final stage in that definition is designation by the secretary of state <e> <s> so anything that would delay designation is going to be unhelpful <e> <s> therefore i would not want to see this amendment incorporated <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to do so too <e> <s> as my noble friend said a moment or two ago the bill deals with those houses which are now owned by council tenants who have exercised their right to buy and that is the problem that we are dealing with when <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we all owe a vote of thanks to my noble friend the chief whip for giving us this piece of prime time in which to debate these two important reports <e> <s> i should like to begin by adding my congratulations to their authors sir richard southwood and the noble lord lord nathan and to the noble lords lord ashby and lord nathan for taking the opportunity to put down their motions <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak for a few moments on a sector of the economy representing some one-quarter of the whole of public finance namely the financing of local government a topic which i think has not received much attention in this debate so far <e> <s> i rise to express three notes of welcome the first of which is a welcome for the absence in the queens speech of any more of the kind of legislation which we have received over the last three or four years <e> <s> i welcome that absence because most of that legislation has demonstrated what my noble friend lord ferrers describes as the ferrers principle <e> <s> he has often referred to this and many of your lordships will remember that this principle is that most legislation has the opposite effect of that intended <e> <s> that has been true of most of the legislation relating to local government finance that we have had over the last three or four years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend two questions arising out of that statement <e> <s> first may i thank him for repeating it and welcome a good deal of what is in it <e> <s> it must be a good thing to reduce aggregate exchequer grant and thereby take a step towards the position where more of local services are financed by taxes raised from local electors <e> <s> to the extent that the statement indicates a further step in that direction and a further step towards more accountability it must be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to what my noble friend had to say in explaining this statutory instrument to your lordships but i listened in vain for what i hoped to hear which was some response in the context of this statutory instrument which after all as well as dealing with the new marginal areas also consolidates all the material that bears on the payment of hill livestock compensatory allowances under the less favoured areas directive <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will also allow me to intervene i hope that he will not feel that discussion on capital grants which is another set of payments made under the less favoured areas directive is the only appropriate point at which to debate that matter <e> <s> that is quite wrong <e> <s> easily the largest amount of financial support that goes to farmers in the hills by far and away the largest amount is in the form of the hill livestock compensatory allowances <e> <s> capital payments and the differential rate for capital payments are another factor though a small one in comparison with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for this statement <e> <s> would he agree that this is the inquiry which is already known as the abuses inquiry and will continue to be known as that because it is the abuses that now prevail alas <e> <s> in a very small number of authorities which have brought this about <e> <s> would he agree that this is indeed a tragic situation <e> <s> would he also agree that as the noble baroness opposite said important as this inquiry is the radical inquiry into local government finance which his right honourable friend has at last set on foot is even more important and that we shall want to hear about that before very long <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill and i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for explaining its genesis and origin <e> <s> it is right to respond to abuses such as the <e>", "<cs> as one of the peers who has his name to this amendment i wonder whether i may now be allowed to come in and then perhaps the farmers can carry on <e> <s> i rise first of all to support the two noble lords whose names are also to the amendment in urging on the government the need to include in some way the article directions which are also involved in bringing under control the abuses which this bill is designed to deal with <e> <s> speaking for myself i have no intention today in any of the amendments that i have put down or on which i intend to speak in support of doing anything other than to probe the governments intentions and opinions on what is before us <e> <s> so as far as i can detect there is no danger of any of these amendments being pressed <e> <s> we do not want to get too excited quite yet <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount lord craigavon decides how to respond may i make one point to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> my noble friend said quite rightly that article directions are generally introduced in order to control a particular individual threat by some developer or land owner <e> <s> that is indeed the case <e> <s> but that is not the only kind of article direction <e> <s> they are sometimes this is the most important category for our purpose today introduced in order to support the application design guides in urban conservation areas or in order to deal with a general threat to the character of some rural area <e> <s> when the secretary of state has it in mind to confirm an article direction of that category the case argued by the noble viscount lord craigavon has rather different and greater merit <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend would undertake to look at this to see whether there is a way of extending the bill now before us to catch this particular category of article directions <e> <s> i accept entirely the force of his argument about article directions of a more specific kind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i had no intention of introducing this rather extensive topic under this amendment but as i said earlier i intend to do so under the next two amendments <e>", "<cs> to respond to what my noble friend said about amendment no <e> <s> i think that perhaps he and i may have to have some further discussion between now and the next stage <e> <s> i hear what he has to say <e> <s> i do not think that he is going as far as he reasonably could to meet the point which my amendment makes <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he said about section <e> <s> i hope i am right in detecting an assurance that further amendments will follow in due course <e> <s> i think it is a pity that more advantage has not been taken of the opportunity provided here because there really are a lot of anachronisms and oddities which make life very trying for the planning authorities <e> <s> i thought what he said about the landscape areas development order was ominously evasive <e> <s> perhaps i may read very briefly from <e>", "<cs> my noble friend spoke as though the <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness but do not intend to do so at any great length because she has made the case very well <e> <s> i put it to my noble friend on the front bench that it is a nonsense to have the full range of grant-making powers and controlling powers that are available to a planning authority in an outstanding conservation area but to leave this loophole wide open <e> <s> it cannot be right <e> <s> now that he and his right honourable friends have the english heritage commission to advise them on these matters i hope that they will take its representations to heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend on the front bench for those assurances which certainly are comprehensive <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is faced with a difficult decision when this amendment and the amendment that it amends are put to it <e> <s> the question is how far to go in the bill in dealing with the abuses the weaknesses and the loopholes that have been revealed <e> <s> all that i want to do at the moment is to leave the house under no illusion about the extent of these problems <e> <s> the noble viscount lord craigavon quoted just one letter from the city of chester a member of the adc and a distinguished one when it comes to conservation <e> <s> on the files at the association we have and could have many more similar letters from cities like norwich durham york bath chichester and all over the country all faced with the same weakness on the part of planning authorities wishing to control these abuses and the very strong likelihood that the loopholes will be further exploited and the abuses further perpetrated <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly want to support this amendment <e> <s> i think the house has been rather easily reassured by what my noble friend on the front bench has said and in not pressing any of the previous amendments it has shown a willingness to run quite large risks as to what might happen in our conservation areas and our countryside while these processes of consultation are going on <e> <s> we know that there is a good deal amiss in the countryside but it would seem that we are willing to wait until consultation on landscape area special development orders has gone on <e> <s> we know there is tremendous potential for abuse and very considerable weakness in the local authorities in being able to deal with it <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench says its all right <e> <s> the stable door is open but nothing has bolted yet so what are you worrying about <e> <s> we know more than enough about what is going on in these areas to be worried <e> <s> the character of the conservation areas in our historic cities and towns has been built up and safeguarded painstakingly and gradually over the past years or more <e> <s> all this is now at risk <e> <s> the least we could ask is for the government to accept this absolutely minimal amendment which has been introduced by the chairman of english heritage the very body which has been brought into existence to safeguard areas of this kind <e> <s> i shall be very disappointed if my noble friend does not indicate that he is willing to accept it <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the noble lord so early in his speech but i hope that what he has suggested about discussing the two amendments together will not preclude the committee having a further discussion an amendment no <e> <s> after this debate <e> <s> the issues are very different <e> <s> the metropolitan counties have a different range of functions which are to pass to their boroughs <e> <s> the scale of their activities is of a quite different order as is their complexity <e> <s> the operations of london have repercussions in the home counties not to be compared with those of the other metropolitan counties <e> <s> i therefore hope that we will have a further debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i rise to make four short points in support of the amendment <e> <s> i start by introducing properly to your lordships the standing conference for london and south-east regional planning <e> <s> it has already been mentioned twice and at the moment i have the honour of chairing it <e> <s> with the glc it consists of the home counties the london boroughs and the shire districts in the home counties <e> <s> i will not say any more now about the details of the standing conference except that because its existence bears on or of the amendments that arise in this part of the bill i have placed in the library copies of some documents which those members of the committee who have so far taken part might find useful <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> the conference i was referring to was the standing conference for london and south east regional planning <e> <s> i did not elaborate that any more because i did so when we were dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the letter i referred to was one that i wrote on their behalf actually on th january by which time the bill was already progressing through another place and it was addressed to the minister for local government <e>", "<cs> seurp <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to noble lords for the short debate that we have had and to my noble friend on the front bench for what he said about his willingness to have further consultations before the next stage <e> <s> the terms of my amendment were not at all even an attempt at producing a definitive solution to the problem <e> <s> it was just as i said at the beginning designed to produce a useful debate and i am glad that it has done that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i have only two very small points to make <e> <s> i do indeed think it would be useful if in the discussions we have we bear in mind not only the needs of london but also the needs of the other metropolitan counties <e> <s> i do not think it is for me to formulate amendments about metropolitan counties in which i have no particular stake <e> <s> i should not want to take that on <e> <s> however i should very much welcome an initiative of that kind coming from one of those areas and from the ama <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am sorry i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i was assuming that we certainly would not be able to resolve this matter by the time we reach amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what i was saying was that in the absence of any resolution of the matter i think i would be safe to go on the assumption that we shall reach a conclusion by report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord john-mackie for this motion which refers to four facets of rural life farming forestry the environment and industry <e> <s> but over the past years there has been only one overriding policy for the use of land in the rural areas and that is agriculture farming farming relieved of rates unrestricted by planning supported by subsidy selling into a managed market supervised by its own single-minded ministry untouched by any of the other changes in the machinery of government that have swept through whitehall in those past years <e> <s> that policy has been that there should be the maximum production of food from our own resources and a very good policy it has been <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with it at all <e> <s> it has stood us and is standing us in very good stead <e> <s> it is certainly not to be abandoned now just because a number of commodities have gone into surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend before he moves on as i think we have time <e> <s> that of course is welcome news but my noble friend would have to agree would he not that the power to assist in these ways has been in the directive for the last ten years <e> <s> it would have been much more helpful if the ministry of agriculture had made use of it a good many years earlier than this <e>", "<cs> ten years <e>", "<cs> if when the noble baroness replies she could tell the committee what progress if any she has made since we had that debate in persuading her colleagues in the ama to come to join us in this discussion we would be making progress <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before the noble baroness says what she is going to do about her amendment i may add a word or two to supplement what my noble friend on the front bench has said about the state of regional planning at the moment <e> <s> any member of the committee who took advantage of what i said on tuesday about papers from serplan being available in the library will be able to see from rpc that what my noble friend lord elton has just said is indeed the case in respect of the kind of guidance which is currently being issued by the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may make just a brief comment here <e> <s> the matter to which my noble friends amendment is addressed is one to which the standing conference for london and south-east regional planning has already addressed its mind and on which it wrote back in october to the minister of state for local government <e> <s> by way of a preliminary i want to endorse completely what my noble friend lord colville said namely that the judgment in this <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just comment <e> <s> this matter needs to be looked at again <e> <s> like my noble friend lord colville i must confess that in studying schedule i had not seen the possibility of examinations in public of part i of unitary development plans conducted jointly <e> <s> if the schedule is intended to work as my noble friend on the front bench says then i would put it to him that paragraphs and need amendment to make it clear that part i of the unitary development plans can be submitted to the secretary of state before part ii is completed <e> <s> that is because if there is going to be examination of part i jointly in public that must be conducted and completed before the metropolitan boroughs are asked to go to all the trouble of developing part ii <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with his amendment i should like to ask my noble friend on the front bench whether i am drawing the right inference from the fact that he has not answered the question asked by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> that was how many people are there on the london planning commission <e> <s> it is perfectly respectable not to know the answer or not to have decided yet because i hope that he and his collegues will take that decision when they have established the way in which the london boroughs will combine cohere and collaborate see how much they can do for themselves and in the light of that decide what needs to be done by the london planning commission <e> <s> that will keep the london planning commission to the absolute minumum <e> <s> are those the correct inferences <e>", "<cs> i share the view of those who have been speaking on this group of amendments that it is important that the countryside in the metropolitan areas and on the fringes of the metropolitan areas is properly and comprehensively managed and that the flora and fauna in them are looked after carefully and well <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps mention in that connection that my noble friend on the front bench and i are meeting tomorrow to pursue amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as soon as we have done so i have it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend on the front bench has mentioned my amendment and myself in his remarks it may be helpful to the house if i comment now <e> <s> first by way of preliminary perhaps i may say that i hope that all noble lords who showed an interest in this subject at the earlier stages have received a copy of the document published by serplan headed <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for imputing that to the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that other noble lords have received it <e> <s> i want to stress at the outset that what i am talking about is london and the southeast that is to say the topic addressed by amendment no <e> <s> and not at the moment the metropolitan counties <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the intention behind this amendment but to suggest to the house that it is not necessary or desirable to have it in the bill at this stage <e> <s> what it seeks to do is what my noble friend on the front bench is seeking to do after discussion with me and following consultation with the london boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me to emerge from this debate that the less one has to do with buses the easier it is to support the government <e> <s> but alas i am president of the association of district councils tory-controlled which as my noble friend lady vickers says has members spread across england and wales and of them operate bus services a total fleet of some as compared with the fleet of in greater london in the ptes and in the nbc <e> <s> small as we are compared with those <e> <s> i think that we represent the citizens of town and country users and operators and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend before he leaves the issue of cross-subsidy <e> <s> the department must have done some studies as to the effectiveness of cross-subsidy and what it has achieved <e> <s> plymouth has carried out studies which indicate that if cross-subsidy is eliminated or phased out another will have to be found from the rates <e> <s> therefore it is possible to do these studies <e> <s> i asked my noble friend to tell us what studies the government have done and i should like to have an answer so that we can look at them before the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the house was glad to give the noble lord lord kilmarnock leave to make a short point but i am sure that the house does not intend to give him leave to wind up a debate that he did not move <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord wallace would excuse me if i were to intervene for a moment as i was mentioned twice by the noble lord lord beaumont and so were the bishops <e> <s> there are a number of explanations as to why they are not here <e> <s> one is that they are in conference in manchester as it were rewriting the creed or if the house would prefer to believe it some of them may be at ascot <e> <s> but in any case i shall take it on my own shoulders to make sure that they read carefully what your lordships have been saying in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will have been intrigued by the late entry into the debate on these two amendments by two former labour chief secretaries <e> <s> each of them described their main motive as being that of controlling public expenditure <e> <s> each of them preached us quite considerable sermons on the importance of that <e> <s> i personally would have been more convinced by what each of them had to say if when they had the power to influence the party opposite they had so preached those sermons that when the labour party gained power in the glc we were not we londoners in particular faced with the exorbitant precepts under which we have all suffered these past two or three years <e> <s> a failure to control public expenditure more flagrant than the one we have all experienced under the glc is hard to conceive of <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that mv first remarks on this part of the bill would be to welcome the government amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> but it does not seem to have worked out like that <e> <s> we are now involved with the amendments concerning the provincial metropolitan county councils amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it was obvious was it not long ago when the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear from the noble baroness lady birk that she has received a copy of the serplan document which i sent as long ago as nd may to noble lords who were participating in our debates on this issue with the rather different purpose of helping those taking part to see the need for the kind of body that we now have in the bill <e> <s> but i believe that both noble baronesses are going too far with their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord shepherd decides what to do with his amendment in the light of those remarks from the minister i wonder whether i could put before the committee a few considerations from the side of the municipal operators <e> <s> first may i say how welcome it is to have an indication right at the outset of the committees proceedings that the government are now showing some signs of being ready to think again about some of the less practical aspects of the bill as it is being presented to us <e>", "<cs> i obviously cannot agree with both my noble friends but i have to say to my noble friend lord beloff that the view that we cannot have a patchwork of bus services across the country is really flying in the face of the facts because that is what we have <e> <s> there are cities which have their bus services run by ptes there are cities which have their bus services run by municipal operators there are cities which have their services run by the national bus company there are cities which have their services run by private operators and there are cities which have their services run by various combinations of all those <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words before my noble friend responds <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for the letter he wrote to me to which he alluded about the difficulty of conducting studies and his intention to rely therefore on the evidence of trials <e> <s> that is important and we shall need to look very carefully at the hereford trial in some detail not only now but in october when it has had a little longer to run because that cannot possibly support all the contentions that are being made <e> <s> it would be useful to know that that is what we need to concentrate on <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to say a few words before my noble friend replies to the debate <e> <s> i start with a comment to my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> i do not think the choice is between doing nothing at all letting these dismal trends continue or having the bill in its present form <e> <s> the choice with which the committee has to wrestle is whether this great lunge towards total abolition of regulation is appropriate or whether we should not stick to our manifesto commitment to embark on a further measure of relaxation carefully tested and tried <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend replies to the amendment i wonder whether he can bear in mind the sentence in the report of the hereford trial which reads <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he has said about this clause <e> <s> his intention to oppose it i think was first tabled on thursday <e> <s> the changes of course affect not only the members of the association of district councils who run their bus operations but also a number of others who do not do that but who run bus stations <e> <s> i shall not be in a position to have consulted them let alone to have received their responses by next wednesday when we shall be dealing with the amendments to clause so it will be the report stage at which i shall be able to give your lordships the considered responses of the various cities and towns which will be affected by this amendment <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend will appreciate that it is not possible for me now or next wednesday when we come to clause to say anything of consequence to your lordships for your guidance <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful and i think that my noble friend lady vickers will also be most grateful <e> <s> i am intrigued by this technique for getting amendments accepted by the government <e> <s> meanwhile i am very pleased to beg leave to withdraw the amendment on that assurance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also support the general thrust behind this group of amendments <e> <s> i too am a westminster resident and have the <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend a question before the noble lord lord ezra decides what he is going to do <e> <s> my noble friend opened his remarks by making the general point that local authorities had a wide range of powers effective for dealing with the kind of problems that we have been discussing <e> <s> he then went on to say something about the particular situation in london <e> <s> if they have such a wide range of powers which he considers to be effective why did they fail so signally to deal with the situation which arose when unregulated bus operations were introduced for trial in hereford city <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for the response which he has made to this amendment which i moved on behalf of my noble friends and other noble lords who have taken part in the debate on it <e> <s> i think they will be interested in what he has had to say <e> <s> i think that they will benefit by having the guidance that he has been able to offer them on how their amendment might be improved <e> <s> i do not think that they will be satisfied with the situation as it is left and i am pretty sure that they will want to return to it at the report stage <e> <s> however equally i am sure that they will not want to keep members of the committee away from their beds for any longer tonight and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had intended to speak to the second of the two amendments on this subject tabled by the noble lord lord grimond amendment no <e> <s> e and i shall still do so if he is going to move it <e> <s> but if he has now said all that he is going to say on both amendments i shall speak now <e> <s> i wonder whether he can guide me <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say what i wanted to say now but by way of preliminary to make it clear that what i am saying is not to do with the national bus company whose part of the bill we are in but the municipal bus companies <e> <s> the committee will have heard me say on many previous occasions that the municipal bus companies have a number of objections not so much to this policy but to the way that it is being implemented to the fact that we have departed from our manifesto commitment <e> <s> we are tackling this in one great swipe rather than by stages and it is being undertaken in our view with insufficient consultation research study testing and so on <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment if that is what he is about to do may i put this to him <e> <s> i am very disappointed at the lack of urgency registered by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i have in front of me the transition timetable for the formation of those companies and for the tendering that they have to be capable of <e> <s> on top of that we are now contemplating privatisation of those companies when they are newly formed and on top of that we are contemplating offering their employees share ownership <e>", "<cs> again i should like to thank the noble lord for introducing this subject and particularly this amendment the purpose of which is if anything a little clearer than the earlier one which was linked with it certainly to a layman like myself <e> <s> i should like to stress that at any rate as regards the municipal bus operating authorities it will so far as i can see be very greatly in their interest once they have formed the company required by this bill immediately and at the same time to consider not only privatising that company but also embarking on the possibility of employee acquisition <e> <s> we want a lot of help from the government in that area because it is a major undertaking to step from being a public service within a local authority to being an employee-owned private enterprise and i should like further assurances from my noble friend on the front bench not only about the timing but also about the assistance and encouragement that we can expect from central government in this field <e>", "<cs> may i at once say that of course i was not inviting central government to interfere in the affairs of local authorities <e> <s> my constant song is that they should do less of that <e> <s> what i was saying was that they are in a position to encourage us not the least by removing various impediments <e> <s> what happens if we saddle the new municipal bus operating companies with unacceptable pension liabilities in respect of their pensioners <e> <s> this is one of the ways in which the government can help and we shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> when we get to the subsection of this bill concerning municipal bus operators i shall explain to the committee how the various structures at present on offer in the bill are all entirely unsatisfactory and that therefore the best option for the municipal bus companies is to privatise themselves <e> <s> another impediment in our way which i alluded to at an earlier stage was the impossibly tight timetable that we have set <e> <s> it is impossibly tight as it is now but if the municipal bus operating companies decide that their best option is to become fully privatised and at the same time they enable their employees to take up shares in the ownership of the company then we need time to give effect to all these measures <e> <s> it is that kind of encouragement for which i was asking <e>", "<cs> i shall not take up time on it but if i may say so i think that my noble friend on the front bench has completely missed the point <e> <s> the duties of the county councils are set out at clause <e> <s> the power that is to say something which they can exercise if they want is properly given and this is an innovation which is welcomed at clause to the district councils in areas such as exeter torbay and plymouth and whether they run buses themselves is <e>", "<cs> we now come for the first time to that part of the bill which contains the special features for the bus companies run by the municipalities <e> <s> i had understood earlier from the chief whip that he did not want to go particularly late tonight but if it is the decision to continue i am happy to do so although i am anxious that all of these six or seven groups of amendments should be tackled fairly thoroughly and i hope that the committee will understand if i take a certain amount of time about these topics as we are now reaching them for the first time <e>", "<cs> i see that and i have not yet said anything about what it is that makes these hybrid arms length companies so impossible to operate <e> <s> that will come when i reach clauses and <e> <s> my noble friend has not really answered the point that i was making about the regime that governs direct labour organisations <e> <s> i am not aware that building firms carpenters plumbers and other people tendering and competing with district council direct labour organisations in reading or anywhere else feel that they are up against impossible competition because that is what the regime was designed to secure and to safeguard <e> <s> my noble friend has not said anything to explain why a system which works well in that area has not been at least provided for as an option in this area <e> <s> however we have other matters to discuss and i do not wish to stand in the way of clause any longer <e>", "<cs> i must say that i regard that response from the minister as very unsatisfactory <e> <s> i asked my noble friend a number of specific questions which arise in the case of the municipal undertakings and which have not arisen before in regard to either the national bus company or the ptes <e> <s> if i may say so he ignored the whole lot <e> <s> i know that it is late at night but that is not my fault <e> <s> we have only just arrived at the matters which concern the district councils and i really must have them discussed properly <e> <s> i am prepared to go on for as long as the chief whip wants me to go on but i expect to have better answers than that <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment any more tonight but i shall certainly press it a good deal harder at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i should much rather stop now <e> <s> through being pushed harassed and i think not really treated properly i have missed an amendment altogether <e> <s> i think it is rather unfair after sitting here all day that when the issues with which i am concerned come up we are not handling them properly <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to those who have taken part in this short debate and to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> it is helpful now to have on the record the remarks of the government on what one might call the dlo option <e> <s> it is true that the regimes which control direct labour organisations when they are competing and tendering in competition with the private sector are complex but they are familiar to the local authorities and they have stood the test of time whereas these hybrid companies are anything but familiar and they do not stand the test of close examination <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the great yarmouth bus company with a total of buses exactly requires of those at peak periods in the winter and in the summer so at various times and seasons there is a very considerable amount of spare capacity and it surely makes sense to use it to the full <e> <s> in fact if you do not use it to the full i cannot see how you can possibly compete in full-blooded competition <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i shall read his reply with interest and make sure that our lawyers look at it <e> <s> however it surprises me very much indeed to hear that the servicing of private sector vehicles lorries belonging to private companies has ever been or could ever be construed to be an activity in which a local district council is allowed to engage <e> <s> in that case i really do not see by what authority it could do that given clause <e>", "<cs> the marshalled list indicates that i had intended to speak to the effect that this clause should not stand part of the bill but in the course of speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i was satisfied for the time being by my noble friend <e> <s> however i understand that there may be other noble lords who may wish to speak on the motion that this clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> no that is certainly so <e> <s> if the debate we have had for the past hour or so has achieved nothing else it has certainly achieved that <e> <s> it is because of that coupled with the fact that the situation in which the municipal bus companies is so unsatisfactory and so different from that which they might have been led to expect by the white paper that inevitably and i say this to my noble friend it is not so much that it is their policy to privatise themselves but it is the only way in which they can extricate themselves or avoid becoming entangled in this unsatisfactory situation <e> <s> it is my own so to speak private opinion at this stage that many of them will see this to be the case <e> <s> maybe in the long run it will be the best way for the municipal bus companies to go <e> <s> however if it is not what the government intended it is odd and ironic that that should be the effect <e>", "<cs> i shall not respond to that if my noble friend will forgive me <e> <s> it is not the right tactics to press amendments at the committee stage on a bill that is so ill constructed <e> <s> i do not despair at all wide as the gulf is of at least having some effect on the thinking of my noble friends between now and october <e>", "<cs> at the beginning of todays proceedings i had occasion to thank my noble friend lord trefgarne for a long letter which he wrote to me in answer to the debate that we had on thursday about pension arrangements for members of the municipal bus companies but he and i were at something of a loss at that stage to know how to make that information availiable to the rest of the committee <e>", "<cs> it is of course the difficulty that we find ourselves in that we are planning and legislating very much in the dark <e> <s> the extent to which the loss of cross-subsidy will be made up by increased efficiency and by competition is not something which has been studied researched and measured <e> <s> that is the whole difficulty <e> <s> but when my noble friend says that such evidence as we have points in the right direction from his point of view i beg to differ because it was by operating just these sorts of powers that the county of hereford and worcester were able to achieve such success although it was pretty limited as they had at hereford <e>", "<cs> and amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> first am i right in interpreting it to mean that the authorities are not barred by the terms of clause as at present drafted from taking into consideration the kind of things which are included in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> secondly am i right in understanding him to say that a code of guidance which will give local authorities further indications of what they can and cannot do in this field is in course of preparation and that we shall be in a position to hear more about that from my noble friend when we come back to this clause at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i apologise to him and to the committee if amendments nos <e> <s> and are not drafted so as to make much sense but i think the debate has achieved what my noble friend would have wanted it to achieve and i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for repeating the statement <e> <s> i commiserate with him and congratulate him <e> <s> i commiserate with him because after dallying with the simplicities of the local government bill for the past few weeks he has now at last had to immerse himself in the horrors of local government finance <e> <s> i congratulate him because he reappears in your lordships house looking so fit to tell us all about it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the shift from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> aggregate exchequer grant must be a move in the right direction because it increases local accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords a little over six years ago i had the privilege of introducing the mark version of this bill to your lordships house <e> <s> it then went to the other place where it was sabotaged by a strange combination including hang-gliders and horseriders <e> <s> now that the mark version is before us i should like to take this opportunity as this is the first substantial piece of legislation leading to the proper management of a large area of common land to congratulate the devon county council and the national park officer in particular on having prepared this legislation the skill with which they have negotiated it and their perseverance in bringing it within striking distance of being on the statute book <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may endorse what the noble lord lord shepherd has just said <e> <s> the question of dates and whether we have them in the bill and how firm they are is a topic better discussed when we come to schedule <e>", "<cs> i would not want to join the noble lord lord mcintosh in criticising my noble friend on the front bench for showing all the flexibility that is represented in the changes made to schedule <e> <s> i think that we want all the flexibility that we can wring out of the government in a bill of this kind especially in schedule and i welcome the flexibility that we have obtained so far <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make it clear that although some fears may have been calmed it would be surprising if that was not the case it would be totally wrong to give the committee the impression that the association of district councils and the councils which run bus companies are remotely satisfied with the programme that is set before them at the moment <e>", "<cs> before we leave this matter i beg my noble friend on the front bench to be careful with this schedule <e> <s> this may be an excellent bill by the time we have finished with it but i have considerable misgivings at the moment <e> <s> it could be wrecked by asking all those concerned the national bus <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with almost all taxpayers but not with the noble lords who have spoken so far i want to express a welcome to these measures a welcome to the reduction in grants which were tending to excess production and to harm the environment and a welcome to the grants which have long been permissible under the less favoured areas directive for years in fact but which have not been implemented until now to enable and assist diversification especially in the hills and especially by young farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords the category of grant to which i was referring was those grants which would allow the farmer to diversify into tourism and craft industries <e> <s> there is no money to be had from environmental improvements but it is a good thing to be engaged in <e> <s> those grants ought to have been made available to farmers young and old in the hills when they were first permitted under the less favoured areas directive in <e> <s> it is a great shame for the farmers in question that they have not been available <e> <s> now that they are they are to be welcomed <e> <s> they are not of course available to farmers unless they are also in agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend does that i wonder whether i may draw him on the very important point that my noble friend lord radnor was making about food processing and adding value to the farm product <e> <s> if it is sensible to give a grant for farmers to diversify beyond farming into tourism and crafts surely it is sensible to encourage them to employ people to add value to the farm product before it leaves the farm gate <e> <s> that could be possibly the most useful thing to do both for the sake of the individual farmer and for the sake of the rural economy <e>", "<cs> ah but will they <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent some time at second reading of this bill expressing the view that it went unnecessarily far beyond our manifesto commitment it had not been properly thought out the consultations on it were not as they should have been and it had not been properly researched and tested <e> <s> but the house clearly took a different view and embarked on the bill in committee with a view to improving it and that is what we ought to be doing now <e> <s> therefore in my view it is far too late to introduce an amendment of the kind we are discussing at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> if he is saying that work must start only when this and that has happened i think he is in danger of misleading the house <e> <s> work started a long time ago <e> <s> i have in my hand here about pages of notes which the association of district councils issued to the districts several months ago without waiting for the department of transport <e> <s> if we were doing that we would never get this thing off the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a few words before my noble friend replies <e> <s> there is some force in what has just been said <e> <s> it may well be that within local government and within the local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for both those assurances <e> <s> i would suggest to the house as i did in my preliminary remarks that with a date only six months ahead we can in these circumstances rely on the assurance of ministers and not require anything on the face of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put it this way my noble friends answer in general was no more unsatisfactory than his answer to me in committee <e> <s> as i said at the beginning the fact of the matter is that the secretary of state is supremely optimistic about the upshot of all this and expresses tremendous confidence about the results <e> <s> he has no evidence to support that view <e> <s> all i have to say is that if he has the confidence which he and his ministers express then they really ought not to have any difficulty in accepting at least amendments nos <e> <s> and which do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i really agree with that <e> <s> the local authorities have some discretion as to how many of these liabilities they will assume or rather their ratepayers will assume and how many they will load on to their new companies <e> <s> how they will apportion the costs and the liabilities of all this is an extremely difficult business upon which i wish they would have several months to reflect instead of having to cobble the whole thing together in a matter of a few months <e> <s> that is what i meant when i said that it will be almost impossible to come to the right judgments or for the right people to make the right judgments <e> <s> most of the judgments will have to be made before the companies are formed and the companies will have to begin with the key decisions about the size of their operations their business projections having already been taken for them <e> <s> that certainly does put them at a considerable advantage as compared with the existing private operators <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that almost everyone present would agree with me that the controls exercised by central government over local authority capital expenditure are all outrageous <e> <s> we cannot wait to see some sort of reform of the whole of local government finance in order that they should be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will take the advice of my noble friend lord mottistone in dealing with this amendment <e> <s> it is not an amendment which strikes at the heart of the bill as my noble friend lord nugent sought to suggest <e> <s> the principle of the bill is that by introducing competition and private enterprise we shall have a happier state of affairs in the public bus services than we have now <e> <s> that is certainly something to which the house has agreed <e> <s> the bill is not drafted as though private sector competitive operations will meet all the social needs of the bus travelling public <e> <s> that was never claimed <e> <s> it recognises that there will be gaps left when all that the private operators feel they can do has been done by registering their services and they will be filled by tendering for subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to find myself in an awkward and unusual situation <e> <s> i am an inferior clergyman of the church of england but certainly i shall not be able to follow my right reverend leaders into the division lobby in support of their amendment <e> <s> ever since i became president of the association of district councils i have been a persistent critic of almost all the legislation affecting local government which the government have introduced but in this case i want to give them my wholehearted support <e> <s> that is a situation which perhaps calls for a word or two of explanation which i shall endeavour to give the house as briefly as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to no one in my love of and support for the national parks <e> <s> i am currently president of the friends of the lake district <e> <s> back in the early s i produced a report on the national parks published in the days when the rubbishing of reports before reading them was not such a developed art as it has become since <e> <s> the whole report was courteously received by a government of the opposite complexion to myself <e> <s> paragraph was taken over and used verbatim to form the kernel of circular / which is at the centre of the issue we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment from this side as the noble lord lord lloyd mentioned my name <e> <s> after the very cogent way in which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has spoken in opposing this amendment i myself do not think there is very much more to be said <e> <s> if i may say so i do not think that the noble lord lord lloyd dealt with any of the objections listed in the auld report from paragraph onwards about flexibility of opening hours <e> <s> but the noble lord asked me to comment on the enforceability aspect of all this <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak on the previous amendment or on clause stand part <e> <s> i did not of course know what the right reverend prelate the bishop of london had it in mind to do <e> <s> i was supposing that he would press the amendment <e> <s> as he has not i wonder whether i can ask for guidance from the chair <e> <s> the effect of clause unamended is to remove part iv of the shops act which includes clause to which is appended schedule <e> <s> if we now move on from this position with clause intact although a number of amendments can still be debated i would suggest that amendments nos <e> <s> and possibly and cannot be discussed because all relate to a clause in the shops act that is now no longer there <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could have an answer from the chair to the question that i put when we started debating that clause stand part <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment again since i am responsible for starting this rather awkward debate <e> <s> when i read the marshalled list i really thought that the right reverend prelate would move amendment no <e> <s> because so many other <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can demonstrate to your lordships committee why this amendment would be thought by the great majority of local authorities to be the second worst that we have considered the very worst being the form of local option which we were considering yesterday in which the local option was exercised through the town and country planning legislation <e>", "<cs> i am not prescribing how it can be done i am just saying that it has to be done by some means and i am giving an indication of the scale of the exercise <e> <s> whether people would be satisfied that they had been properly consulted if an advertisement or notice were put in a newspaper is another matter <e> <s> however certainly if we could subtract some of the children because they do not have any purchasing power we would have to add on a considerable number of people from outside the city of leicester because they go into leicester to shop <e> <s> again that is a matter of judgment <e> <s> all that will have to be done on that scale by way of a preliminary exercise <e>", "<cs> it is as plain as a pikestaff in the amendment <e> <s> there are various bodies which would be representative of some of the people concerned but by no means all of them and i have mentioned some of them <e> <s> certainly there is the chamber of trade and perhaps the rotary <e> <s> if this amendment is to operate at all effectively it will involve consultation with all those interests <e> <s> it says so specifically <e> <s> it refers to the retail employers in the locality to the retail employees in the locality and to <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord has done his best but none of the schemes which he has put before us will work <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench illustrated how perverse they are in their effects in some ways but i think perhaps he let the noble lord lord graham off a little lightly over his rateable value proposal <e>", "<cs> we can all see the principle but the detail eludes us <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing in any christmas pantomime can match the wonderland of horror and hilarity which now characterises the absurd arbitrary and totally opaque system of arrangements known as local government finance and this statement only adds to it <e> <s> i suggest that any of your lordships who believe that i might be exaggerating could usefully spend an hour talking to the treasurer of your local council during the recess and hear about multiple base positions composite multipliers and gain caps all three more pieces of jargon which have been added to the vocabulary in this statement <e> <s> i say that without seeing the actual details <e> <s> this is what we already know about <e>", "<cs> good <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend nevertheless agree that the fundamental flaw in the whole system which no government for ages have tackled is that far too many people are in a position to vote for things without having to pay any part of their cost <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may just add somewhat to what the noble lord lord mishcon said about the attitudes of local authorities in these matters <e> <s> the enforcement of this legislation is in the hands of authorities <e> <s> sixty-seven of them are metropolitan district councils and of them are district councils and i am the president of the latter group <e> <s> this is what the auld report said about the association of district councils <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may rise before we leave clause so as to make some suggestions to the committee and particularly to my noble friend on <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will agree with me that this has been a useful discussion and that the assurances given to us by my noble friend on the front bench about what he will try to do before the next stage of the bill are very welcome <e> <s> i should like to make just one further suggestion to my noble friend on the front bench namely that i believe the committee or it will be the house then would welcome it if he were able to persuade his noble friend lord young whose department is responsible for these matters to come and join us at the point when we shall be discussing this bill again at report because i think it would be helpful as my noble friend lord campbell was suggesting to have a clear view from the minister who is directly responsible on the philosophy of employment and employment protection which will underpin everything <e> <s> those remarks are intended to be helpful to my noble friend and are not the least bit critical of the way in which he is handling this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble baroness while she is speaking on the subject of the rate support grant it is not clear to me from reading the report whether or not the committee was aware when it reported of the impending change from target to grant related expenditure assessment as the main means of controlling local government expenditure <e> <s> can the noble baroness say what the committees view was of that matter while it was deliberating <e>", "<cs> my lords terms like all or nothing and take it or leave it are themes which appear in the preface of this report which seem to me to detract a little from its immediate usefulness particularly when one of those integral parts is the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend before he goes off on to another tack <e> <s> on the question of the resources for dealing with the housing stock it is not that local authorities do not have the resources we are not being allowed to use them <e> <s> that is the complaint <e> <s> whether we have the resources or not is a question which we have not reached yet because we are not allowed to use the resources that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene just once more my noble friend is putting up an enormous smokescreen to disguise one simple fact <e> <s> it is that millon is nowhere near enough to deal with the condition of our housing stock <e> <s> we all know that my noble friend is absolutely hamstrung by the treasury but for heavens sake let us encourage him to do all that he can to do even better <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to follow the advice and precept of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to keep off the detailed clauses of the bill and only to reflect briefly on the context in which it is being presented to us <e> <s> i invite your lordships to reflect frequently on this context when we reach committee stage so that we may better amend the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord for a moment <e> <s> would i be right in thinking that in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> he is also speaking to amendment nos <e> <s> and as well <e> <s> it would be helpful to know whether or not that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i was moved as i think other noble lords who were here were moved when the noble baroness lady ryder spoke on the previous amendment <e> <s> it is a pity that the noble baroness was not present to express views like that on second reading <e> <s> however as many of us made clear on second reading the fact is that with this bill we are not concerned to safeguard the character of sunday or the sanctity of sunday because we do not believe i do not believe the government do not believe and the majority of us do not believe that the sanctity of sunday is threatened by the deregulation of shopping we are concerned to ensure that the deregulation is done in an orderly way and that the interests of those who work in the shops are safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> i do not want to use extreme language at all and of course the views of the local authorities are not decisive <e> <s> but the auld report having gone through all the various ways of controlling sunday trading and pointing out that they had defects did say at paragraph that of all the options this was the only one which actually made the situation worse <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly to this amendment <e> <s> that is not to encourage those who have moved it to press it to a division at this stage even if they were intending to do so but in order to ascertain the mind of my noble friend on the front bench about section and if necessary to seek to change it between this stage and the next <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may comment before the noble lord lord winstanley responds to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said about his willingness to reconsider this i am glad that he is going to do so <e> <s> i do assure him that the present formulation he has chosen is about the most restrictive that could have been selected <e> <s> if he is looking for a better phrase and is still determined to depart from widdicombe and i really think that widdicombes argument for leaving things as they are is very compelling because the members of the committee knew as well as my noble friend did what has been going wrong in this area and if my noble friend is looking for another phrase that would do the job better the one used in the report itself which referred to matters which are the proper concern of local government is one with which i personally should be satisfied and it is better than what is proposed at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by humbly apologising to the noble lord who initiated this debate and to those who have taken part in it for not being here when he began <e> <s> it was pure inadvertence and very rude and i am most apologetic <e> <s> it leaves me guessing a little at what he said though this is an issue which i have of course encountered quite a few times already and i have had the benefit of hearing what my noble friend lord stanley said which was more or less on par <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i very much hope he will <e>", "<cs> my lords the very last thing that i would want the noble lord to attribute to me is the suggestion that a new policy which may well be needed in some parts of the green belt should be established by a series of planning applications and appeals <e> <s> that would be the worst possible way of setting about it <e> <s> what is needed is a fresh look at a number of policies in discussion as we already do it with the builders with the sand and gravel extractors and with the oil companies <e> <s> from those discussions a new policy emerges that affects the structure plans and the local plans <e> <s> but planning applications and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i want my noble friend to get away with that <e> <s> i cannot think of any industry that is better served at the national level than farming by the cla and the nfu <e> <s> if there was the drive from the department to make a move in that direction there are heaps of people who should be ready to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to both these amendments and to start by thanking my noble friend on the front bench for having fulfilled the undertakings he gave to us in committee which were that he would look at this matter again and if possible come forward with an amendment which met the points that we were making and he has done that <e> <s> on the other hand i have to remind your lordships of what widdicombe said about section <e> <s> the committee said that section should be left unchanged <e> <s> they rejected the view that this is too wide a scope for local government publicity and amendment no <e> <s> is the amendment which gives precise effect to what widdicombe recommended <e> <s> that was a body which the government called into being to advise them but in this respect their advice has been ignored <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e> <s> it is my own personal view which is what i normally express to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will firmly resist this amendment for all the reasons that the noble baroness lady david gave but most particularly for the reason that it is a matter upon which the main widdicombe committee has yet to report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> in fact my name is on the marshalled list <e> <s> before speaking to the amendment however i should like to say in agreement with the noble lord lord kilmarnock that i think it was a mistake for the house to have agreed to the foreshortening of the normal time that should elapse between the report stage and the third reading of a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the formal position i suppose is that having secured the floor of the house for the second reading of the bill we can keep it until we have finished the second reading <e> <s> but the convention is as my noble friend the chief whip has just described it namely that we are expected to vacate the floor of the chamber in respect of this bill in an hours time <e> <s> with five speakers beside myself i intend therefore to leave the explanation of the bill to the explanatory memorandum printed on the face of it and not to say anything about the bill that can be found there <e> <s> i assume also that members present and taking part in the debate will have read not only the explanatory memorandum but also the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly to my noble friend for his contribution and the assurances he gave towards the end of his speech about his willingness to join with us in making sure that in legislating for the sanctity of those ships in which many of the crew lie entombed we do not put the british interests of the salvage companies the divers and others at a disadvantage in international waters <e> <s> that is a matter we shall need to return to at committee stage meanwhile i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that prosecutions are now bound to follow the other place having affirmed their preference for the existing legislation covering sunday trading <e> <s> prosecutions are bound to be continued until all diy shops all garden centres the great majority of corner shops and all leisure retailing have been closed down on sunday <e> <s> does my noble friend think that the electorate will appreciate that change in the character of sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interrupt my noble friend while he is dealing with the grouping of the amendments <e> <s> it may also give him an opportunity to catch his breath <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that in following my noble friends suggestion about the grouping we note that manuscript amendment no <e> <s> a and amendments nos <e> <s> and are amendments to my noble friends amendment

avoidance of doubt by drawing up a list of the vessels which will be subject to this bill <e> <s> that must be an advantage <e> <s> i am sorry for my noble friend and to some extent for all of us that it has taken some or so amendments to do it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord should move it formally but he should speak to it <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be for the convenience of the committee to have all these issues aired at the beginning <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i thought it might be for the convenience of the committee if in the clause relating to licences i took this opportunity to put on the record the progress that is being made in the concept of an advance general licence for dealing with the situation in international waters and enabling uk ships and companies to operate without putting them at a disadvantage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may make one or two comments on the response of my noble friend to this amendment <e> <s> on the technical difficulty that he raised it was not i when i moved the original amendment who introduced the tortuous form of wording that members find in section which makes it difficult to amend the repeal in the way that the noble lord lord melchett indicated in his amendment <e> <s> i think that is a relatively trivial point <e> <s> it is quite clear that the noble lord lord melchett is seeking to avoid a watering down of the objective of the original clause of the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is putting up an even thicker smokescreen about charges <e> <s> the criticism which is being levelled by the noble lord lord melchett and which i share is that my noble friend and his department have used this opportunity to divest themselves of a statutory duty and have put in its place a discretionary power and my noble friend has not justified that move <e>", "<cs> yes i certainly would <e> <s> i should like to suggest that it would be appropriate for the committee at this stage to agree to that <e> <s> however i think that parliament ought not to let the report stage go by without having rather more assurances than my noble friend has given so far that these discussions will be fruitful <e> <s> i should have thought that it is certainly not in the interests of the british poultry federation to withhold its co-operation for this training to the point where its members begin to lose the health mark <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment because i have long wanted to do anything i can to encourage diversification on the farm <e> <s> i do so not particularly because i want to see farmers receiving yet more grants but because i want to see farming making not only a profit for the farmer but a better contribution to the countryside as well <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds formally to that may i ask my noble friend on the front bench whether when he comes back as i hope he will with another amendment to cover these points that have been raised from all sides of the committee he will also give us an indication whether the ministry of agriculture is now prepared to modify or at least reconsider the agricultural policies at the moment written into the structure plans and which in effect preclude movements in the direction we all want to see <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> which the noble baroness lady nicol has just moved relates to capital grants for farming in esas <e> <s> most experience in balancing the farming need for such grants with environmental considerations has been acquired so far under the special arrangements for prior notification relating to national parks under the ahgs scheme of st october <e> <s> there has been as well as the experience notable success in quickly negotiating in individual cases a balance between what the farmer wants and what the national park authority wants <e> <s> my belief and i think it is widely shared is that that success is due in no small measure to the existence of national park plans the official agreed authoritative background to all such negotiations <e> <s> clause is quite different <e> <s> it relates to grants for farm management agreements in esas not national parks and i am sure that we all wish them well <e> <s> there is no experience as vet in negotiating such agreements in the context of an esa <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interrupt my noble friend because i am sorry if i gave him that impression <e> <s> the question i was asking was can we have more information <e> <s> can we be told the processes by which the ministry of agriculture are going to achieve documents broadly equivalent to the national park plans which have contributed to the rapid and straightforward negotiation of agreements with farmers in national parks which were set out in circular no <e> <s> and which have led to the production of those plans <e> <s> that involved consultation between the national parks authority the nfu the cla district councils etc <e> <s> and a fairly extensive degree of public participation resulting in a plan which is reviewed every five years <e> <s> something along those lines <e>", "<cs> i should like to take this opportunity to thank my noble friend for responding when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> to the questions that i asked him then <e> <s> i did not speak at that point because i did not want to add to the number of topics that we were already discussing on the amendment of the noble baroness lady nicol <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass and in doing so i thank the small number of noble lords who have assisted in the passage of the bill and particularly my noble friend on the front bench for the amendments that he has introduced while the bill has been in your lordships house <e> <s> i think particularly of the concept of an advanced general licence and a code of practice which have produced a much fairer deal for british salvage companies operating in international waters <e> <s> at the same time they have safeguarded the concerns of the relatives of men who have gone down in their ships <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the debates which we have had on these amendments at this stage and the debates which we had on their predecessors at committee stage as well as those which we have had on other similar amendments to the clause have served a useful purpose because they have dealt conclusively with the suspicions and doubts widely held that the ministry of agriculture have been less than wholehearted in their commitment to conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> for the record perhaps i may say that i was president of the adc until last friday and am now vice-president but i am ready to see this matter through <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to my noble friend on the front bench for what he has done in this field and to thank him also for no less than three letters to me on the topic to which i should like to make some brief response <e> <s> the amendment of my noble friend lord peel was and still is specifically on the question of grants <e> <s> the amendment in the name of my noble friend on the front bench no <e> <s> a is also on the matter of grants <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not so much to support this particular amendment as to express the hope that in dealing with this and other matters like it to do with the protection of the countryside we try to improve our track record and our rate of response <e> <s> the nearest thing to a landscape conservation order on the statute book at the moment is the landscape area special development order <e> <s> that has been there since that is to say for years <e>", "<cs> my lords while the news that my noble friend on the front bench has given is of interest does he not agree that it is even more important to maintain firm policies in the green belts that we have not least in the decisions given by his right honourable friend the secretary of state following public local inquiries <e>", "<cs> i must begin by declaring an interest in that i am a church commissioner a member of the board of governors and responsible for settling the future of the churches of the church of england that are no longer needed for worship <e> <s> i also have a personal interest in this matter having been a minister at the department of the environment in in the early stages of the negotiation of state aid to churches in use <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by giving the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe top marks for topicality but if i was correct in understanding him to be adding his voice to those who see this as a north-south issue low marks for diagnosis <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to have become fashionable in this debate to start off by saying what <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on at last having begun a process which it was obvious we should have started at least six years ago when we were dealing with the wildlife and countryside bill <e>", "<cs> my lords about this time a year ago i was concluding a correspondence with the secretary of state at the department of the environment mr nicholas ridley <e> <s> may i say incidentally what a welcome innovation it is to allow a secretary of state for the environment to survive across a <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to refer to the final paragraphs of the select committee report <e> <s> despite the constraints of its terms of reference the committee felt obliged and i think rightly to draw attention to the need now to ensure that the benefits of the tunnel when it is built are spread across the country as a whole and not allowed to stop in kent london and the home counties <e> <s> the duty for achieving that falls fairly and squarely on british rail and only british rail can achieve it <e>", "<cs> i take this opportunity to raise a small but important point before we leave this clause <e> <s> i have given my noble friend notice of this <e> <s> as my noble friend has said more than once and as we all understand this part of the bill gives ministers the powers to bring forward a scheme of grants for diversifying farm businesses <e> <s> she was of course quite right to say that we shall have a debate on the scheme but we all know perfectly well and she knows perfectly well that that debate by long established convention cannot bring about any change in the scheme <e> <s> therefore we have to get things right while the enabling legislation is before us <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for her latter remarks which put the matter clearly on the record <e> <s> i think it would have helped if that had been said categorically at the beginning of our <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will resist this amendment because it goes too far <e> <s> there is a good deal of public sympathy for the farmers and the landowners over the mess in which they have been landed by the cap <e> <s> however i put it to the committee that that sympathy has limits <e>", "<cs> it is always gratifying to hear ones name mentioned in a debate like this particularly when it is linked to a principle <e> <s> when the noble baroness opposite looks at me in that inviting way i cannot but respond <e> <s> she was perfectly correct in the first part of what she said because she was quoting from circular which gave the views of the minister on the review which i undertook for the national parks <e> <s> what she did not do was to go on to the next paragraph which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help being struck by the impressive way in which the lively campaign initiated by the royal county of berkshire has developed over the last month <e> <s> on th february as the noble lord lord stoddart said there was an adjournment debate in another place with three tory members of parliament taking part <e> <s> now we have another debate here well furnished by residents from berkshire but also by no fewer than three labour front bench spokesmen albeit spokesmen who disappear to the other benches to speak <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear what the noble lord lord mcintosh will say <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not keeping myself up to date with the movements in the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e> <s> i was coming to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise as a fellow church commissioner not to support the right reverend prelate because he does not need it or to explain the measure because he has already done so but because nearly years ago when i worked on the bench opposite it fell to me to welcome the right reverend prelate to your lordships house and to congratulate him on his maiden speech <e> <s> i thought that i might take it upon myself tonight because this is one of his two swan songs to thank him on your lordships behalf for his contributions to our debate over those years to wish him well in his retirement and to say that although we cannot look forward to hearing him again we very much look forward to meeting him in those parts of the house to which he will still have access not least the bishops bar <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but i wish to make a short committee point <e> <s> although subjects are the matter of clause because of its unique nature religious education is being discussed now on clause <e> <s> the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate reintroduces advisory councils <e> <s> will he say whether teachers of religious education are nevertheless free to engage in all the discussions on curriculum development especially cross-curriculum development <e> <s> we debate those matters on clause <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the general thrust of the amendment moved by my noble friend lord craigton but to say that in my opinion it will not make a tremendous difference whether or not the amendment is accepted at this stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble baroness lady blackstone not exactly to support <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been involved in these issues twice in my parliamentary career first between and as a minister in the department of the environment and second from to as president of the adc before i was succeeded there by my noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> i do not wish to introduce any fresh subjects at this late stage <e> <s> i should just like to stress a few points that have already been made <e>", "<cs> over the last years i have frequently asked the government questions about the unsatisfactory situation we find in our schools where this act of worship prescribed in the act is not being properly carried out <e> <s> the answer which is almost invariably supplied to the ministers who have to reply is that the act does not prescribe that the act should be an act of christian worship and therefore it is almost impossible to keep tabs on what is going on <e> <s> they do not know what is happening and they will not provide answers inspect or monitor what is happening <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also add my voice to the misgivings of my noble friend <e> <s> my noble friend intends to be generous and his move is obviously welcome for genuine religious communities <e> <s> however it seems to me that as worded at the moment the amendment makes it quite possible now for me to wait until one retires on a good pension finds a number of colleagues with whom one is ready to pool ones resources devote oneself to prayer and contemplation and one is then exempt from the community charge <e> <s> is that really what is intended <e>", "<cs> has not my noble friend just explained that by leaving the discretion with the local authorities he and the treasury are prepared to contemplate that the cost of the relief might rise from million to the full amount of million <e> <s> i should have thought that that objection does not carry much weight <e> <s> in dealing with non-domestic rates are we not now dealing with rates which will be collected locally and then re-distributed on a national formula <e> <s> does it not follow from that that any discretion that local authorities exercise is almost entirely watered down and diluted so that it has practically no local effect at all <e> <s> would it not therefore be better to take this opportunity to give all charities the same full relief as is enjoyed by the churches <e> <s> where would be the harm in doing that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene again <e> <s> i should have thought that the right thing at this stage is for my noble friend on the front bench to look at the arguments which have been put and see whether there would not be a great advantage <e> <s> we are now moving to a much simpler system and it could be made even simpler still if we used this opportunity to give not only the churches but all the charities the full rating relief not just per cent but the whole amount <e> <s> this is something to which we could come back at the next stage after my noble friend has thought about it <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down and the noble lord responds can my noble friend on the front bench confirm that this being a charity will be included in the reconsideration that he has already promised to undertake <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i think the noble lord the lord chairman said just now that if amendment no <e> <s> a was carried and i imagine my noble friend lady gardner intends to move her amendment no <e> <s> it will pre-empt amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be for my noble friend lady gardner to speak to her amendment in the discussion on the noble earls amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise as yet another westminster ratepayer with a considerable direct interest in the way this matter is settled <e> <s> first i support the bill and agree with my noble friend lady gardner that there is indeed a case to be answered <e> <s> i was glad to hear my noble friend in his intervention say that he recognised that point <e> <s> i should like to follow up the comments made just now by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> there are a number of specific points which the minister has not yet made and which i think the committee hopes to hear either this afternoon or at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench will do no such thing <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross a moment ago spoke as though what we were discussing was the normal administration of a local authority <e> <s> everything that he said was perfectly correct in that context <e> <s> but we are not talking about that we are talking about a situation where it appears to the chief finance officer that his authority is about to embark on an unlawful course of action <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have <e> <s> it is quite true that clause dealt more specifically with that point than this amendment but we are still in the same area <e> <s> this whole part of the bill deals with the situation which has been created by a minority of authorities which have in a variety of ways distorted and abused the financial administration and powers that were in their hands <e> <s> it is entirely necessary to give the finance officer those extra powers <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago i used to be chairman of the church army <e> <s> we have one of these hostels in great peter street <e> <s> i urge my noble friend in the course of these consultations just to visit that hostel and possibly the salvation army hostel next door and talk directly to the people who administer them <e> <s> i am sure that if he does that he will not persist in this argument <e> <s> he will agree with the noble lord lord marsh that it is totally untenable <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend in resisting these amendments <e> <s> however when i saw what is now paragraph of the schedule at committee stage i and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter both found ourselves moved to comment that the whole paragraph is probably too loosely worded already <e> <s> i submit to my noble friend and to the house that any reasonably conscientious member of an ordinary congregation qualifies personally under paragraph a <e> <s> his congregation meets the requirements of subparagraph a <e> <s> any congregation engaged in normal evangelistic and missionary activity easily meets that requirement <e> <s> for those who are bent on abusing this paragraph it would not be too difficult to find a financial adviser who could arrange for those forming themselves into a bogus community to meet paragraph b <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree with me perhaps it is more accurate to say that he does agree with me that this provision is loosely worded <e> <s> he has looked at it again but so far he has not found any way of making it any tighter <e> <s> i do not think that he has convinced himself or me that it is satisfactory as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very thorough and comprehensive debate on this amendment <e> <s> my first hope after the committee stage was that my noble friend would have learnt enough from the opinions expressed then to have reconsidered this whole business of rate relief for charities and come back with the governments own scheme for providing per cent <e> <s> mandatory rate relief <e> <s> that would have been and still will be the best way to deal with this <e> <s> i was disappointed that my noble friend with his home office experience which points exactly in the opposite direction argues that the existence of the moonies the scientologists and the fringe charities was a case for discretionary rate relief for the local authorities <e> <s> he must know that that is quite unsound and that the remedy for that is a proper review of the law of charities and the enforcement powers of the charity commissioners <e> <s> i do not believe that anybody in this house and i do not believe my noble friend himself is persuaded by the force of that argument though it was i suppose inevitable that it would be deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend knows the position he will be in if he fails to deliver <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords in the sense that i had a categorical letter from the ama and a rather ambiguous telephone message from the adc <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i am almost as totally unconvinced by my noble friends arguments as i was at the previous stage <e> <s> i shall have to see my noble friends lady blatch and lady carnegy of lour afterwards i leave that argument until then <e> <s> the fact is that the government have come a considerable way and have agreed to the amendment of the noble lords lord hayter and lord allen <e> <s> my chief regret and disappointment over this whole affair is that when i had the votes of no less than right reverend prelates available mobilised by the opposite benches i failed to use them <e> <s> however in the light of all the circumstances and the debate we have had i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
