["<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord belstead for the very kind remarks which he made regarding myself during part of his speech <e> <s> i must confess that with the benefit of hindsight it seems to me that it was a mistake by the government in when they decided to put home defence on to a care-and-maintenance basis <e> <s> in this respect my lords i would in the short time that i shall detain you refer only to home defence in its civil defence aspect <e> <s> we were told in effect at that time that money spent on civil defence was in the nature of an insurance premiumand that it was the governments duty to balance the size of the premium against the risks involved <e> <s> the risks were supposed to have lessened and therefore the premium would be reduced and indeed so it was <e>", "<cs> my lords just for a short while it is my intention to speak specifically about the army to discuss army manpower and to refer to some aspects of its equipment <e> <s> before i do so however i wish to add my agreement to the general commendations which have been made this afternoon to the revised layout of the <e>", "<cs> my lords my attention was drawn the other day to a quotation which is as <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether it is true that there will be a saving of million per annum in the budget of the national health service and a reduction of per cent <e> <s> in the administrative costs <e> <s> on the other hand does he not feel that there is a fear that some of the administration might possibly be transferred from the middle tier on its abolition to the upper tier or to the lower tier and so diminish the hoped for reduction in costs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a closely-related question of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> has he seen the report in another place by an honourable member that in his calculation at least per cent <e> <s> of all civilians employed in that part of hampshire are in defence or in defence-related industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friends lord thomas of swynnerton and the earl of orkney and also to the noble lord lord mayhew on their distinguished maiden speeches <e> <s> we look forward very much to hearing them on future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to address my remarks to the political problems which we face in the antartic and the sub-antarctic and the decision which has been taken to withdraw from active use in the ice patrol ship hms endurance <e> <s> i am aware that these matters were covered fully in an excellent debate initiated in june this year by my noble friend lord buxton <e> <s> nevertheless it would be unfortunate if interest in something which is happening miles away at the other end of the globe should be overlooked because of other considerations nearer home however important and even grave the latter may be <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend major-general earl cathcart for his initiative in introducing this important debate today and for the most excellent speech which he made <e> <s> i hope that as a mere soldier of lower rank i may be forgiven the temerity of following two noble lords one a rear-admiral the other a captain rn in discussing naval matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any truth that there is still an argentine presence in southern thule <e>", "<cs> my lords as we understand that the maximum fine is is it not rather extraordinary that this amount should be so small bearing in mind that the total income of the unions is million annually and that million trade unionists are affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be courteous to wish the noble lord lord jenkins many happy returns of the day <e> <s> i would like to cheer him up if i may because i think that was really rather a distressing diatribe for ones birthday <e> <s> i think the noble lord does perhaps take the matter rather more seriously and paints a rather more gloomy <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of your lordships house who takes a keen interest in all defence matters may i just state how grateful i am sure we all are to my noble friend lord trenchard who is always accessible and receptive to the ideas and views of others <e> <s> his robust answers from the front bench and his trenchant speeches to coin a phrase have always been a pleasure to hear <e> <s> i am sure that we shall all miss him <e> <s> i wish also to congratulate and encourage my noble friend lord belstead who is now to bear an even heavier load of responsibility <e> <s> i beg for your lordships indulgence if some of the matters which i am about to raise have been mentioned already during this long debate <e>", "<cs> who is your leader <e>", "<cs> my lords having had some experience of private bill procedure in another place may i trespass upon your patience for a few minutes in defence of the parliamentary costs act <e> <s> i should not wish to talk about the decisions reached by the select committee except to say that i entirely endorse the decisions taken but may i suggest that if the act of were to be altered the only way in which it could be done would be that costs should in legal language follow the event i believe that that is how it is put which is the rule applicable to ordinary litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in the name of the earl of cork and orrery on the order paper and i have my noble friends authority to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister two further questions <e> <s> first can i have an assurance that when any unit embarks overseas on training an attached medical officer will be in attendance <e> <s> secondly could my noble friend devise an arrangement whereby units in the united kingdom which are on field firing and other exercises have adequate medical cover <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he will pay particular attention to the fact that the royal irish rangers are the only remaining link with northern ireland <e> <s> other regiments which have the word irish in their titles recruit from a wider range in britain itself and the royal irish rangers have the unique distinction of being the descendants of three famous fighting regiments with many battle honours <e> <s> they should surely not be relegated to training in england if it is at all feasible for them to remain in their own native land <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to my noble friend that it would be a good thing if it was not a private members bill and it was the government which took action in this very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any fear that belgrano-mania is a contagious disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply which to a great extent i had already anticipated may i ask whether he would not agree that this is an important matter <e> <s> in addition to the assurance that he has given can he give a further assurance that the legislation which we hope to see will come forward during the next session of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it is a question not only of water that is drunk but also of the very major problem of expenditure on sewerage repairs <e> <s> in many towns the sewerage systems are in a very bad state <e>", "<cs> my lords it is five years all but one month since i first took part in a debate on civil defence in your lordships house and in fact civil defence was on that occasion the subject of my maiden speech <e> <s> i think that we are all deeply grateful to my noble friend lord renton for bringing hack before our eyes and ears again this very important subject <e> <s> i am also very grateful to the minister my noble friend lord elton for the comprehensive review which he has given us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> has any study been made of the practice adopted by the swedish and swiss governments whereby they incorporate in new structures in both commercial and industrial buildings public shelters <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me the greatest pleasure to follow the noble lord lord st john of bletso <e> <s> he knows so much about the country in which he lives <e> <s> i should like to declare an interest too <e> <s> it is not a financial interest but one of family ties <e> <s> as an infant child my wife accompanied her parents from england to south africa and lived in johannesburg for nearly years before returning to london <e> <s> her sister still lives there and has quite a large family therefore my wife has many nephews and nieces who still live in south africa <e> <s> my own sister over some years has lived successively in swaziland zimbabwe and cape town <e> <s> her daughter and her young family live in johannesburg at this present time <e>", "<cs> my lords in a memorandum by the parliamentary bar presented to the joint committee and reproduced in the minutes of proceedings on page the following statement appears <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with some interest to what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby said <e> <s> i do not think that the house can be accused of being insensitive to the dreadful tragedies that have happened over the last weeks or months <e> <s> on the other hand a debate on a reasoned amendment on third reading is a very unusual occurrence in this house <e> <s> i should have thought that in view of the assurances that the minister has given this morning that the house will have the opportunity not once but twice to come to a decision in a specific debate on a motion the reasoned amendment put forward is not now necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that what is produced in libya under the present climate is more dangerous than what is produced in russia <e>"]
