["<cs> my lords my request for indulgence is more than a customary formality <e> <s> the main reason for it is all too audible despite all my efforts to master the language <e> <s> addressing such a distinguished chamber hallowed by great tradition i also stand in awe <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord seebohm for his motion <e> <s> that many people must be starving must arouse the concern and compassion of us all <e> <s> hunger and famine are concentrated in sub-saharan africa and south asia <e> <s> they are not general in the third world <e> <s> if they were the population could not have grown so rapidly in recent decades <e> <s> many people <e> <s> including some noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord lord hatch that the compulsory herding of millions of people into the ujama villages is a form of self-help <e> <s> what is certain is that its effect on food production has been devastating <e> <s> certainly there was considerable private trading in the market towns and rural areas of tanzania in large measure by asian traders who have been forcibly squeezed out <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord molloy why he regards the british colonial record in africa as so bad when he considers that ethiopia and liberia are two countries which are in a worse condition but have never been colonies of britain or of any other european country <e>", "<cs> my lords as a relative newcomer i am somewhat hesitant to address the house on the repeal of the rent acts <e> <s> i know much less about housing than some of the other speakers certainly far less than my noble friend lord vaizey or the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> however i feel impelled to support my noble friend in his courageous effort to advance this important and deserving if forlorn cause recognising that my remarks are at best a modest contribution an optional extra to the eloquent arguments of others <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord rachmanism could only flourish because of the existence of rent controls <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend lord trefgarne please inform the house whether the government regard as sacrosanct participation in the undp remembering that at the height of the falklands war the programme substantially helped argentina in face of the unavailing protest of the united kingdom representative <e> <s> is it not the case that under this programme the united kingdom has no right to veto spending even expenditure directly detrimental to britain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider substantial cuts in our taxpayers contribution to the ida <e> <s> i ask that question in view of the lack of any effective parliamentary control over this form of aid which may help to explain the numerous anomalies in regard to what it does <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with conviction and pleasure that i endorse the questions and arguments of my noble friend lord vaizey and those of the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> we should not censure the american notice of withdrawal from unesco but follow it <e> <s> that step was not an act of pique or isolationism but an appropriate and long overdue reaction to an anomalous situation <e> <s> my noble friend lord vaizey who is highly qualified on this subject has listed some of the anomalies of unesco <e> <s> but he could acquaint this house with only the tip of the iceberg <e> <s> noble lords who wish for fuller information will find it in an illuminating article by mr tom bethell in the spring issue of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had to overcome considerable hesitation in joining such a distinguished list of speakers <e> <s> i finally did so because i felt that some critical issues behind unemployment were often overlooked <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that none of my arguments depends upon perfect competition <e> <s> this has become an irrelevant stick with which to beat virtually any argument which is politically unpopular <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord hatch of lusby for his motion on two counts <e> <s> first it is an example of his determination to raise third world issues from which domestic concerns too often divert attention <e> <s> second it stresses trade as an instrument for economic welfare <e> <s> in what follows i must try to avoid the scylla of generalities and the charybdis of detail <e> <s> since the nineteenth century unrestricted trade has transformed many poor countries into flourishing developing countries where progress is linked with commercial contacts with the west and poverty with their absence <e> <s> one can contrast singapore and malaysia with aborigines and desert people <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is highly doubtful whether population pressure or growth are significant factors in world poverty <e> <s> is he further aware of the fact that many millions of the poorest people live in abundant lands as for example the aborigines and tribes-folk <e>", "<cs> my lords i too most warmly thank the sub-committee for its lucid concise and wide-ranging report <e> <s> the main issues fall into three broad categories first the general case for official aid secondly bilateral versus multilateral aid and thirdly the complexities of lom <e> <s> the report takes for granted the case for official aid <e> <s> i disagree with this axiomatic approach <e> <s> but following carlyles advice i accept the universe <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble baroness would say something about bilateral and multilateral aid <e> <s> as the government have repeatedly expressed their preference for bilateral aid <e> <s> and as a number of noble lords have given good reason for supporting it <e> <s> why is it that multilateral aid is expected to rise from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> as mentioned in the report of the sub-committee <e>", "<cs> may i rise in support of the noble earl lord gowrie to point out that the analogy between companies and trade unions fails partly for the reason which he instanced but also for the further reason that if a shareholder is dissatisfied with say the political contribution of his company he is in a position to sell his shares and leave the company <e> <s> members of trade unions are not in that position <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that all these refugees come from countries whose governments receive much aid from the international development association <e> <s> instead of making further demands on the taxpayer should not ida funds be used to alleviate the desperate plight of these refugees a course which might also discourage african governments from creating more refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords as one step for increasing jobs especially for young people would be the abolition of the wages councils <e>", "<cs> will the government put forward the necessary legislation early next session so that it will take immediate effect when the period of notice to the ilo expires in <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the point of such a target <e> <s> should not the size of our aid programme depend on its effectiveness and on our economic situation and not on an arbitrary figure derived from the pearson report of <e>", "<cs> my lords the speakers before me have already paid eloquent tribute to the exceptional maiden speech of the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> it would be otiose for me to add to their tributes except to thank the noble earl for the pleasure and instruction that i derived from his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is it right for the noble earl to belittle such matters as the expulsion of students from their courses for refusing to join a students union as has happened in bristol and manchester among other places <e> <s> is this not a deplorable restriction on access to higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the scale of our aid programme depend on its efficacy the needs of third world people and the conduct of recipient governments rather than on a completely arbitrary figure plucked from the air several decades ago <e>", "<cs> my lords many people in this house and many more but less fortunate outside will be grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for his motion and for the eloquent speech with which he supported it <e> <s> i should like also to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord brentford on his wholly exceptional maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this fund is one of three rival multinational organisations in rome with very similar objectives the others being fao and the world food programme <e> <s> have not their activities been much criticised by aid supporters as wasteful ineffective even corrupt because of lack of control by the donors and lack of independent budgetary control <e> <s> if opec withdraws from support of this fund should we not follow their example <e> <s> should we not in any case concentrate on direct bilateral aid which we can monitor more effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords many people outside this house and occasionally even some noble lords regard fluoridation as tedious and trivial <e> <s> their eyes become glazed at the mention of the subject <e> <s> in reality the debate highlights profound issues of politics even morality <e> <s> it recalls a memorable phrase by sir lewis namier the great historian of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am genuinely grateful to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for his motion <e> <s> the subject is not only of immediate concern but will i fear remain topical for a long time <e> <s> in the time available today i can only summarise arguments and state conclusions rather than develop them <e> <s> moreover many of us spoke on famine in july in the debate initiated by the noble lord lord seebohm and again last month on the motion of the noble viscount lord buckmaster on the closely-related subject of third world refugees <e> <s> some of us will speak again tomorrow on the related topic of foreign aid <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be wide gratitude to my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton for launching this debate on the value of foreign aid which is all too often taken for granted <e> <s> for at least years the primary declared purpose of british aid has been to relieve the worst poverty in the third world <e> <s> i do not think that official aid is suitable for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my mite of a tribute to the noble lord lord murray of epping forest for his notable maiden speech <e> <s> not all of us will agree with its central thrust but i think we will all agree that it was highly effective as indeed we had expected it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords the distinction of my noble friend lord home of the hirsel and the significance of his motion make it unnecessary for me to add to the tributes already voiced <e> <s> acquisition of client states by fomenting discord is a commonplace of history <e> <s> in the context of the third world the pertinent question is why is the climate so hospitable to soviet efforts <e> <s> ordinary people there are certainly not hostile to the west and its products <e> <s> they are eager for western watches transistors drugs and bicycles <e> <s> nor is poverty the explanation <e> <s> it is the relatively prosperous urbanised and articulate groups with western contacts who most readily embrace the communist creed politicians media men professional people and the politicised media <e> <s> they dominate the politics of the third world especially in africa and asia where there is a wide discrepancy in political power between these groups and the inarticulate and ineffective rural majority <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness know that in a recent study by us aid the operations of this fund were much criticised as being indiscriminate and lacking in systematic evaluation <e> <s> if the united states and opec reduce their contributions should we not do likewise <e> <s> if not should we not at least reduce our payments to the overlapping organisation fao in which from the director-general downwards hostility to the west is widespread persistent and shrill <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recognise that the major causes of famine in africa are not neglect by the west but the policies of african governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to pay tribute to our two maiden speakers today the right reverend prelate the bishop of leicester and the noble lord lord forres <e> <s> both in substance and presentation they spoke very well and it was most agreeable to listen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord hatch leaves this subject may i ask him this question <e> <s> does he equate giving more with doing better regardless of the political and economic effects of aid <e>", "<cs> my lords to speak to a motion of the noble earl lord stockton is an honour but it also advises caution <e> <s> the motion addresses wide and enduring issues rather than specific and ephemeral topics and so have most contributions to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the committee for their wide-ranging report which together with the evidence will serve as a useful outline of influential and widely canvassed opinion on the recurrent themes of public discourse <e> <s> i also have to apologise to the house if for reasons of health i have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i hope it will not be regarded as discourtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for his question and his compassionate eloquence <e> <s> he certainly did not overstate the conditions in uganda <e> <s> the repercussions extend beyond that country because civil wars there have cut the supply routes to rwanda and burundi <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> but is there not necessarily much state spending in many different directions <e> <s> also is there not much public interest in a variety of matters including children women sex and television among others <e> <s> do the government propose to set up ministries for these also <e>", "<cs> absorbs taxpayers money and adds to the number of ministers who have to vote with the government of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister please confirm that in dealing with this crisis and its aftermath the government will bear in mind that it arose out of the operations of a state supported cartel which moreover have benefited primarily relatively well-to-do people at the expense of the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recognise that neither the policies mentioned here today nor the adoption of the recommendations of the aldington committee nor changes in the price of oil nor increased rates of growth will much reduce unemployment without more labour-intensive patterns of consumption and production which require major reforms in the labour market in the housing market and in social security arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble baroness lady lockwood for her question and for her eloquent speech <e> <s> my remarks will focus on the linking of aid to birth control <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of the population of the united kingdom or the population of bangladesh <e> <s> the question is what parents decide about the number of children they want to have <e> <s> i tried to introduce my remarks by directly referring to what the noble baroness lady gaitskell said on this subject <e> <s> it is not an abstract concept such as the united kingdom or bangladesh <e> <s> it is the decision made by parents about the size of their families <e> <s> this is what matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he consider the third possibility namely that people will modify their reproductive habits if numbers threaten their welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> has the noble lord considered the third possibility that if the growth in numbers genuinely threatens peoples welfare they will modify their reproductive habits in the third world in exactly the same way as they have done in the west <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord bruce of donington in regretting the recent death of the noble lord lord kaldor whose contributions enlivened our economic debates <e> <s> it was not necessary to agree with him to recognise his talents <e> <s> he will be much missed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised to hear that <e> <s> i think this applies only because at least until recently companies were so taxed that they could arrange their affairs to pay little tax <e> <s> but this did not apply and does not apply to the direct taxation of united kingdom individuals and partnerships <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord bruce of donington for drawing my attention to this point and i shall try to word my remarks more carefully in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay tribute to the eloquence compassion clarity and vividness with which the noble baroness lady seear introduced her question <e> <s> i have long been familiar with these policies because for years the noble baroness and i were colleagues at the london school of economics <e> <s> nevertheless in the face of her sincerity i still wonder whether spending more to increase the take-up of benefits would exacerbate the conspicuous anomalies of the social security system especially those of universal benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to anticipate this question by expressing doubt as to whether after many years of the most active and extensive publicity there are still likely to be many people so ignorant or careless as not to know of these benefits <e> <s> i suspect that such people are far more likely to be reached by voluntary effort than by state-provided benefit <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he realises that there is no proper analogy between our exchanges today and official foreign aid to which he referred <e> <s> what we are talking about is how we can best help poor people in this country whereas foreign aid goes to and through governments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn opened this debate with a characteristically eloquent and good-tempered speech rooted in much social and economic experience which makes it a pleasure to hear him but makes one hesitant to speak against his motion <e> <s> in expressing scepticism about singling out manufacturing industry for special attention hesitation is particularly in order because over the past year or so doubts on this subject have already been expressed by distinguished speakers including my noble friends lord gowrie and lord young of graffham as well as by the noble lords lord seebohm and lord harris of high cross <e> <s> some remarks may however be permissible to supplement what has already been said on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether it can be arranged that copies of the demand notes are sent not only to the taxpayer but also to his or her professional adviser <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs very warmly for this debate and for her moving speech <e> <s> no one should be indifferent to the mass misery in africa some of which i have seen in refugee camps <e> <s> the misery is particularly distressing after many years and many billions of official aid and heroic efforts by voluntary agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether he recognises that the aid which we are giving does not go to the starving children and the other destitute people living in the third world <e> <s> it goes to their rulers <e> <s> that is a big difference <e> <s> quite often the rulers themselves are responsible for the appalling conditions which prevail in those countries <e> <s> sudan and ethiopia are only two examples among many <e>", "<cs> my lords the few noble lords present must warmly thank the noble baroness lady turner of camden for providing the opportunity to act not as a revising chamber but as a forum of discussion <e> <s> it is a role which inevitably recedes amidst much controversial legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of jewish extraction <e> <s> my father was killed by the nazis <e> <s> i emphatically support the amendment <e> <s> this bill is another step towards the erosion of the rule of law <e>"]
