["<cs> my lords i welcome the references to the european community which are contained in the gracious speech and i shall with your lordships indulgence concentrate on them for a few moments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one advantage in speaking towards the end of such an important and so well-attended debate as this <e> <s> at least i have the pleasure of knowing that all the points i wish to emphasise have already been so much better expressed by a great many other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend will recognise that there will be widespread appreciation of the fact that the secretary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> with that assurance from him i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the intention of the amendment <e> <s> as the minister will know museums are now being strongly encouraged to ensure that as much as possible of their collections is on view to the public <e> <s> with that in mind they are being encouraged to make loans of parts of their collections <e> <s> some of those loans may well find their way to houses owned by institutions or even by private individuals which are open to the public <e> <s> some of those weapons therefore may be on display in places other than the actual premises of the museum <e> <s> in so far as they satisfy the requirements of safe custody and guardianship i hope that they meet the requirements of this schedule <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give an assurance on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give any indication of how the figures designed to encourage inward investment compare with the encouragement given to investment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question asked by the noble lord lord mason am i correct in saying that of all the resorts bournemouth is the only one whose entire beach area has been awarded the blue flag of purity <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the horrors which the chinese government are presently inflicting upon the people of tibet is there not some justification for nervousness to put it mildly on the part of the people of hong kong <e> <s> will the minister therefore exercise a degree of flexibility in the matter and assure the house that he and his colleagues will examine it again <e>", "<cs> my lords how much longer must we witness the destruction of this once beautiful and civilised city and the wholesale slaughter of its people <e> <s> does it not seem that the syrians who came to lebanon to protect its independence are now bent upon its elimination <e> <s> while supporting and encouraging the arab league initiative will the british government ensure or press for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal from all lebanese territory of both syrian and israeli forces <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press my noble friend further on the issue <e> <s> is there not now a real threat to the independence of lebanon <e> <s> if there is no sign of an early initiative resulting in action to secure the withdrawal of syrian and israeli forces will the british government press for the matter to be raised as a matter of urgency at the united nations security council <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has informed the house that we my expect a fuller statement shortly <e> <s> can he give the assurance to the house that it will be before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords was not syrias presence in the lebanon originally designed to produce conditions for a political solution <e> <s> however is it not now becoming increasingly clear that the or more syrian troops there are in reality an army of occupation <e> <s> as the syrians seem to justify their actions on the grounds that they need to protect themselves against israeli threats will her majestys government take the opportunity of the presence in london of mr shamir to press for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from lebanon that is both syrian and israeli troops <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the annihilation of lebanon be greatly against western interests <e> <s> ought we not to be seen to be associating ourselves closely with the french government and the government of the united states of america in giving maximum public backing to the efforts of the arab league <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the arab league initiative would be even more welcome if the proposed cease-fire were being strictly enforced <e> <s> are the government aware that syria aided by iranian extremists is bombarding and blockading the ports so as to deprive the people of their route of essential supplies <e> <s> is it not now clear as it surely must be that the position of lebanon is that of a cockpit being used to perpetuate conflicts among countries of the middle east and that the only prospect of a durable solution to restore independence to the lebanon must be through the appointment of an international arbiter under the auspices of either the european community or the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me to have faith <e> <s> how is it possible to have faith in the arab league initiative the principal plank of which was the proposal for a ceasefire when the ceasefire requirement is not being enforced on the syrians <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply can he be more precise as to the objectives of the talks <e> <s> in his reply to the debate in this house on st june my noble friend made a number of references to mobilising the international community and to concerting action closely in the event of a major crisis affecting hong kong after <e> <s> is it the purpose of these talks that the government are now holding to prepare now for the sort of swift effective and sympathetic action that would be necessary in the event of such a crisis overtaking hong kong later in this decade <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend ask the foreign secretary to make clear to the people of hong kong that these international discussions have begun with a view to putting into place certain contingency arrangements <e> <s> if he were to spell that out with complete clarity would that not go a long way to restoring confidence among the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords in keeping the matter under review will my noble friend bear in mind that there is a strong case for making a distinction between the planting of broad-leaved hardwood timber and the planting of coniferous timber <e> <s> is he not aware that the planting of broad-leaved trees may well suffer as a result of the tax proposals <e> <s> is it not therefore most urgent that this matter is reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords listening closely to the statement which my noble friend read to the house it seemed to me that the british government are engaged in discussions with the governments of other countries with a view to mobilising some sort of rescue operation should circumstances ever overtake hong kong which would make such action necessary <e> <s> if that is the correct interpretation then that is tantamount to saying that were such appalling disasters to overtake hong kong the british government would not let down the people of hong kong <e> <s> further if that interpretation is correct has that fact been made as clear as that to the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the answer which my noble friend gave as regards wales can he say what is the governments policy towards encouraging the establishment of broadleaved hardwood plantations <e> <s> if it is the intention that they wish to see the establishment of more native tree plantations in the united kingdom will he discuss the matter with his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to ensure that proper incentives are provided for those forms of plantation which unlike coniferous plantations take several generations to mature <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however is it not the case that the purpose which her majestys government have in mind of trying to establish some kind of selective passport scheme is in order to maintain the stability and economic progress of hong kong <e> <s> in those circumstances will the government ensure that the number in receipt of passports is generous by which i mean at least half a million <e> <s> will he make it clear that the issue of passports is designed to keep people in hong kong and to discourage them from leaving hong kong in order to find their own salvation elsewhere <e> <s> therefore will the government associate the passport scheme with the waiving of resident rights <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that approximately per cent <e> <s> of the boat people now coming to hong kong are very poor peasant farmers fishermen and others from north vietnam who are in search of el dorado and who in no way come within the interpretation of aricle of the united nations universal declaration of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for repeating the statement <e> <s> will he confirm that the foreign affairs committee in another place was unanimous that repatriation was both necessary and urgent <e> <s> should we not in our consideration of this difficult matter keep clear in our minds the fact that the vast majority of these people cannot in any way be designated as refugees from communist tyranny but rather are very poor people who seek better living standards in the capitalist economies of the west <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure your lordships house that the government will not be deterred in any way from doing what is right by hong kong either by the unnecessarily alarmist views being expressed in some quarters by members of another place or by the rather opportunistic position being taken up on the issue by the official opposition spokesmen in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate most warmly the noble lord lord sharp of grimsdyke on his maiden speech <e> <s> like the noble lord lord diamond who has just spoken i found particularly warming the encouraging message which he gave to your lordships house <e> <s> but i think we all recognised that speaking as he does with such knowledge of hong kong and with such authority from his long experience of hong kong and of china the words he spoke here will be faithfully recorded and reported and much spoken about throughout hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords as the british government have had negotiations with the chinese government on the matter can my noble friend tell the house exactly what the chinese government fear about the progress towards democracy in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tanlaw has treated us to a most interesting and original speech <e> <s> i am delighted to be able to follow it and to endorse the noble lords final words <e> <s> it is extremely important that we move forward carefully and cautiously in relation to the progressive democratisation of institutions in hong kong <e> <s> it can so often become the excuse for more heady reactions and for excessive demands which would be counter-productive in the context of hong kong <e>"]
