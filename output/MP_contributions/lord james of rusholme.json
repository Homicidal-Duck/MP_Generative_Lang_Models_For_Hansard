["<cs> as i listen as an ex-headmaster my blood runs a bit cold at all this talk about governing bodies and how they are constituted but then it has been running pretty chilly since i read the taylor report <e> <s> it bears so little relation to the way a school is actually run <e> <s> the idea that governors will pass silly resolutions about an extra language being taught <e> <s> surely the headmaster or headmistress is there to tell them not to be so stupid because they cannot afford it <e> <s> while we are talking about all these complicated arrangements about electing people who then elect other people do let us remember that what goes on in a school and the inspectors reports show it is determined more by the quality of the head teacher than anything else <e> <s> do not let us take this business of governors too seriously or we shall get our emphasis wrong <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i am allowed to say another word but if i am i should like to assure the noble lord lord stewart of fulham that in fact i have had experience as a governor of maintained schools and i was supporting him on this matter <e> <s> he might not have believed it but i was trying to emphasise that we must not go into all these tremendous elaborations <e>", "<cs> i fully agree with the eloquent remarks of the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> the only point where he is wrong is in thinking that that kind of thing has very much to do with the governing body <e> <s> i have indicated this before <e> <s> what really is going to deal with this revolution which some of us know something about being scientists is having properly trained good science teachers and other teachers in our schools <e> <s> the members of governing bodies do not really nor should they have much to do with cybernetics or the technological revolution <e> <s> they meet about once every three months or whatever the period is but they do not and should not have much to do with the curriculum because they do not know much about it <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a real point there <e> <s> i never noticed it because i was in manchester that great industrial city and i had some industrialists round about the place all the time <e> <s> many of my best boys went into industry where they still are <e> <s> i think that this reluctance to go into industry is slightly overdone but that is another story and has nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> i believe that most schools are fairly conscious of the need to get a few industrialists on their governing bodies partly because they are usually fairly rich and contribute to the appeal fund <e> <s> that is my experience of schools but it is probably a jaundiced one <e> <s> honestly i have not really noticed this point but i appreciate the motive behind the question namely that we must encourage more and more of our best chaps to go into industry at one level or the other <e>", "<cs> i would not say that my attitude was patronising it was friendly warm <e>", "<cs> i had the happiest relations with my governing body <e> <s> i believe that raising the status of governors making them governors instead of managers is absolutely admirable and i am sure that they are giving the greatest help to schools <e> <s> what i do think is patronising is to explain that such a body should contain first people who are interested in education secondly people who live in the neighbourhood and thirdly something else <e> <s> that is patronising because anyone who is not half-witted would realise that straight away <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness thinks that putting on a governing body one person who knows something about industry will bring about the change suggested i am afraid that she deludes herself <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to say how jolly good but why put it in legislation because it is so obvious <e>", "<cs> i have had a certain amount of experience of dealing with institutions where there are students of all ages <e> <s> one of the most fascinating ironies of this debate has been to hear lord stewart lauding the th-century prefectorial system as a form of governing body <e> <s> i go far to the left of lord stewart as regards education <e> <s> i have always regarded the prefectorial system because the young always tend to be rather cruel to each other as one of the greater mistakes of the great th-century educators and one whose influence i have tried to mitigate in my own professional career <e> <s> but still he has got a point <e> <s> the only thing is that it has got nothing to do with the functions of the governing body <e> <s> it sounds fun but it has nothing to do with being a governing body <e>", "<cs> on a technical matter may i ask a question of the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> he says do away with the selective system one of those smashing emotive phrases that we all know from these debates <e> <s> could he say how he is going to ensure that a child gets the right sort of education that it needs without some kind of selection <e> <s> just tell me in simple words <e>", "<cs> if the exam results require a good deal of interpretation as i entirely agree they do do not like raw exam results or league tables of schools it is no less true that the <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is really saying that it is the same system as the direct grant schools used to run in which they chose their own pupils and chose them with considerable success as i believe the record shows <e> <s> do not think that there is any difficulty about an approved school choosing its entry <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for clarification while he is on that <e> <s> if he is so much opposed to spending extra amounts of money supposing they are extra on individual gifted pupils why in his time did he support large grants for the education of children gifted in music and ballet <e>", "<cs> may i take up one or two points made by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> he produced an argument which is so attractive what we must do is to spend any money we have on raising the standards of the maintained sector bringing all comprehensive schools up to the standards of the best comprehensive school <e> <s> i tried to deal with that particular fallacy in my second reading speech <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord heard it but i will repeat the argument because it is a very simple one <e> <s> you cannot do it because there are not enough teachers <e> <s> there are not enough able teachers in a number of subjects who are prepared to teach <e> <s> therefore it is mathematically impossible to do it <e> <s> this point was brought out very well by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> it is the same thing <e> <s> the important thing though is the words suppose the school has no chemistry teacher <e> <s> alas <e> <s> she is only too right in supposing such a thing <e> <s> there are schools which if they advertised for a chemistry teacher tomorrow would get no applications or one application from someone who has a degree in something else or no degree <e> <s> there are schools where you cannot teach chemistry properly <e> <s> what does that mean <e> <s> suppose you have a child in that school who wants to qualify for medicine suppose you have a child in that school like me who misguidedly perhaps found his fulfilment in learning chemistry what does he do <e> <s> here we are back at this misguided attitude of forgetting individuals and thinking of institutions <e> <s> that of course is inevitable in a debate like this <e> <s> that was what the noble lord lord shinwell was getting at <e> <s> he said you do not talk about education you take about institutions <e> <s> so you doit is inevitable but behind all our talk of governing bodies and so on do let us remember the actual kid in the school who wants to learn chemistry and cannot <e> <s> it is no use saying you must raise the standard of that school he is there <e> <s> if you had all the money in the world to give you could not get a chemistry mathematics or physics master <e>", "<cs> they are not available <e> <s> that is the simple truth about the staffing position <e>", "<cs> you see the point is this where you have a thing in short supply and you have able children who want to learn a subject surely what you have to do is to take the children to the teacher and not talk about raising the standards of schools because it is eyewashyou cannot do it <e> <s> that is really what tried to say and i will try to bring your lordships back to the question i asked on second reading <e> <s> it is a perfectly simple one and it is to ask noble lords who do not like this what do you propose to do with bill jones tom smith and rebecca something <e> <s> there they are sitting there wanting to learn mathematics and no one is there to teach them <e> <s> what do you propose to do <e>", "<cs> with respect <e>", "<cs> no i do not think it is <e> <s> let me deal with the point made by the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> he talked of my concern for a handful of able boys as being below the standard of debate <e> <s> i do not think that a certain compassion for any disadvantaged group of people and these people are disadvantaged is below the level of any debate <e>", "<cs> let me turn to what was said by lord mishcon which was not necessarily true <e> <s> there are within the state system a number of schools comprehensive schools and surviving grammar schools that can offer an education as good as any independent school and a staff just as good <e> <s> there would be more such schools if it had not been for the abolition of the direct grant system <e> <s> that was a course of action which i believe many of my friends on the opposition benches will live to regret if they are not regretting it already <e> <s> academically some of the best schools in england were within the state system namely direct grant schools <e> <s> they have now been driven into independence <e> <s> they are the independent schools that we shall use <e>", "<cs> yes indeed but if they are to be integrated within the state system one would need to spend a great deal of money on staffing ratios and so on <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord seriously believe that when we were recruiting for direct grant schools we chose nice little yes-men <e>", "<cs> in the intervals between being concerned with a direct grant school i have been chairman <e>", "<cs> i simply want to say that i think we should reject this <e> <s> the idea of putting a statutory duty on local authorities <e>", "<cs> it is taking it off <e> <s> our hearts have been much wrung tonight about rural communities <e> <s> i live in one <e> <s> the idea of continuing to make it a statutory duty to have a full-blown nursery school in our villages up wensleydale is most unrealistic <e> <s> in fact we have a jolly good little local play group and that is the sort of thing we want to build on <e> <s> i certainly hope that the noble baroness gets ahead with her support for play groups <e> <s> but to go on with this charade of statutory nursery schools is i am sure a mistake <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself with the remarks of the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> even this debate short as it is has shown how complicated is this <e>"]
