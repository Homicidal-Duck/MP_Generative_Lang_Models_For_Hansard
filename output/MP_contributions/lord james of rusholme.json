["<cs> i am intervening very briefly if i may <e> <s> i am in no danger of repeating my second reading speech because i did not have the chance to make one <e> <s> i did not know that the second reading was taking place until too late to catch the train otherwise i would have made a speech <e> <s> nor have i had a chance to read it because in fact it is not available <e>", "<cs> i know but it does not get to wensleydale <e> <s> i know pretty well what lord alexander said and had i made a second reading speech i would have said something similar something i have said in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> with respect this has nothing to do with the expenditure cuts <e> <s> as an ex-member of the national association of head teachers my withers are still unwrung as regards anything it might say about this bill <e> <s> as regards expenditure cuts those we are not discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i was naturally gratified to hear the noble baroness who has just sat down speak warmly about a speech that i made so long a time ago <e> <s> i am rather sorry that she remembers it because she is about to hear virtually the same speech again for i am going to direct my attention entirely to one section of this bill a bill which on the whole i support <e> <s> that section is of course the one which deals with the provision of assisted places <e> <s> there are one or two other points about which i am rather less happy at the moment <e> <s> obviously like so many people who know rural areas i am not really happy about the transport provisions but i hope and i rather expect that my misgivings in that direction will be removed as our discussions continue <e>", "<cs> my lords it was an interesting experiment and i think some of them are very good but for the kind of boy i was speaking about they may come a bit late and of course staffing some of the sixth-form colleges is not all that easy <e> <s> however i certainly welcome them as experiments and i shall look at them and their future with great interest <e> <s> i do not think they are the answer because these extremely clever people have to be picked up a little earlier than that <e> <s> also there are all sorts of social pressures on them at an early age which i do not think the sixth-form college gets round but it is an interesting question <e>", "<cs> my lords i did mention a girls school in the list of schools that i gave godolphin and latymer <e> <s> it is so difficult to include both sexes boys includes girls for most purposes <e>", "<cs> i would accept that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the noble lord back to his question <e> <s> he has talked about making educational opportunity dependent on place of birth <e> <s> is not that what he has suggested as regards the able child because he is putting responsibility entirely on the local authority <e> <s> have i understood the noble lord correctly <e>", "<cs> as i listen as an ex-headmaster my blood runs a bit cold at all this talk about governing bodies and how they are constituted but then it has been running pretty chilly since i read the taylor report <e> <s> it bears so little relation to the way a school is actually run <e> <s> the idea that governors will pass silly resolutions about an extra language being taught <e> <s> surely the headmaster or headmistress is there to tell them not to be so stupid because they cannot afford it <e> <s> while we are talking about all these complicated arrangements about electing people who then elect other people do let us remember that what goes on in a school and the inspectors reports show it is determined more by the quality of the head teacher than anything else <e> <s> do not let us take this business of governors too seriously or we shall get our emphasis wrong <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i am allowed to say another word but if i am i should like to assure the noble lord lord stewart of fulham that in fact i have had experience as a governor of maintained schools and i was supporting him on this matter <e> <s> he might not have believed it but i was trying to emphasise that we must not go into all these tremendous elaborations <e>", "<cs> i fully agree with the eloquent remarks of the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> the only point where he is wrong is in thinking that that kind of thing has very much to do with the governing body <e> <s> i have indicated this before <e> <s> what really is going to deal with this revolution which some of us know something about being scientists is having properly trained good science teachers and other teachers in our schools <e> <s> the members of governing bodies do not really nor should they have much to do with cybernetics or the technological revolution <e> <s> they meet about once every three months or whatever the period is but they do not and should not have much to do with the curriculum because they do not know much about it <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a real point there <e> <s> i never noticed it because i was in manchester that great industrial city and i had some industrialists round about the place all the time <e> <s> many of my best boys went into industry where they still are <e> <s> i think that this reluctance to go into industry is slightly overdone but that is another story and has nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> i believe that most schools are fairly conscious of the need to get a few industrialists on their governing bodies partly because they are usually fairly rich and contribute to the appeal fund <e> <s> that is my experience of schools but it is probably a jaundiced one <e> <s> honestly i have not really noticed this point but i appreciate the motive behind the question namely that we must encourage more and more of our best chaps to go into industry at one level or the other <e>", "<cs> i would not say that my attitude was patronising it was friendly warm <e>", "<cs> i had the happiest relations with my governing body <e> <s> i believe that raising the status of governors making them governors instead of managers is absolutely admirable and i am sure that they are giving the greatest help to schools <e> <s> what i do think is patronising is to explain that such a body should contain first people who are interested in education secondly people who live in the neighbourhood and thirdly something else <e> <s> that is patronising because anyone who is not half-witted would realise that straight away <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness thinks that putting on a governing body one person who knows something about industry will bring about the change suggested i am afraid that she deludes herself <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to say how jolly good but why put it in legislation because it is so obvious <e>", "<cs> i have had a certain amount of experience of dealing with institutions where there are students of all ages <e> <s> one of the most fascinating ironies of this debate has been to hear lord stewart lauding the th-century prefectorial system as a form of governing body <e> <s> i go far to the left of lord stewart as regards education <e> <s> i have always regarded the prefectorial system because the young always tend to be rather cruel to each other as one of the greater mistakes of the great th-century educators and one whose influence i have tried to mitigate in my own professional career <e> <s> but still he has got a point <e> <s> the only thing is that it has got nothing to do with the functions of the governing body <e> <s> it sounds fun but it has nothing to do with being a governing body <e>", "<cs> on a technical matter may i ask a question of the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> he says do away with the selective system one of those smashing emotive phrases that we all know from these debates <e> <s> could he say how he is going to ensure that a child gets the right sort of education that it needs without some kind of selection <e> <s> just tell me in simple words <e>", "<cs> if the exam results require a good deal of interpretation as i entirely agree they do do not like raw exam results or league tables of schools it is no less true that the <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is really saying that it is the same system as the direct grant schools used to run in which they chose their own pupils and chose them with considerable success as i believe the record shows <e> <s> do not think that there is any difficulty about an approved school choosing its entry <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for clarification while he is on that <e> <s> if he is so much opposed to spending extra amounts of money supposing they are extra on individual gifted pupils why in his time did he support large grants for the education of children gifted in music and ballet <e>", "<cs> may i take up one or two points made by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> he produced an argument which is so attractive what we must do is to spend any money we have on raising the standards of the maintained sector bringing all comprehensive schools up to the standards of the best comprehensive school <e> <s> i tried to deal with that particular fallacy in my second reading speech <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord heard it but i will repeat the argument because it is a very simple one <e> <s> you cannot do it because there are not enough teachers <e> <s> there are not enough able teachers in a number of subjects who are prepared to teach <e> <s> therefore it is mathematically impossible to do it <e> <s> this point was brought out very well by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> it is the same thing <e> <s> the important thing though is the words suppose the school has no chemistry teacher <e> <s> alas <e> <s> she is only too right in supposing such a thing <e> <s> there are schools which if they advertised for a chemistry teacher tomorrow would get no applications or one application from someone who has a degree in something else or no degree <e> <s> there are schools where you cannot teach chemistry properly <e> <s> what does that mean <e> <s> suppose you have a child in that school who wants to qualify for medicine suppose you have a child in that school like me who misguidedly perhaps found his fulfilment in learning chemistry what does he do <e> <s> here we are back at this misguided attitude of forgetting individuals and thinking of institutions <e> <s> that of course is inevitable in a debate like this <e> <s> that was what the noble lord lord shinwell was getting at <e> <s> he said you do not talk about education you take about institutions <e> <s> so you doit is inevitable but behind all our talk of governing bodies and so on do let us remember the actual kid in the school who wants to learn chemistry and cannot <e> <s> it is no use saying you must raise the standard of that school he is there <e> <s> if you had all the money in the world to give you could not get a chemistry mathematics or physics master <e>", "<cs> they are not available <e> <s> that is the simple truth about the staffing position <e>", "<cs> you see the point is this where you have a thing in short supply and you have able children who want to learn a subject surely what you have to do is to take the children to the teacher and not talk about raising the standards of schools because it is eyewashyou cannot do it <e> <s> that is really what tried to say and i will try to bring your lordships back to the question i asked on second reading <e> <s> it is a perfectly simple one and it is to ask noble lords who do not like this what do you propose to do with bill jones tom smith and rebecca something <e> <s> there they are sitting there wanting to learn mathematics and no one is there to teach them <e> <s> what do you propose to do <e>", "<cs> with respect <e>", "<cs> no i do not think it is <e> <s> let me deal with the point made by the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> he talked of my concern for a handful of able boys as being below the standard of debate <e> <s> i do not think that a certain compassion for any disadvantaged group of people and these people are disadvantaged is below the level of any debate <e>", "<cs> let me turn to what was said by lord mishcon which was not necessarily true <e> <s> there are within the state system a number of schools comprehensive schools and surviving grammar schools that can offer an education as good as any independent school and a staff just as good <e> <s> there would be more such schools if it had not been for the abolition of the direct grant system <e> <s> that was a course of action which i believe many of my friends on the opposition benches will live to regret if they are not regretting it already <e> <s> academically some of the best schools in england were within the state system namely direct grant schools <e> <s> they have now been driven into independence <e> <s> they are the independent schools that we shall use <e>", "<cs> yes indeed but if they are to be integrated within the state system one would need to spend a great deal of money on staffing ratios and so on <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord seriously believe that when we were recruiting for direct grant schools we chose nice little yes-men <e>", "<cs> in the intervals between being concerned with a direct grant school i have been chairman <e>", "<cs> i simply want to say that i think we should reject this <e> <s> the idea of putting a statutory duty on local authorities <e>", "<cs> it is taking it off <e> <s> our hearts have been much wrung tonight about rural communities <e> <s> i live in one <e> <s> the idea of continuing to make it a statutory duty to have a full-blown nursery school in our villages up wensleydale is most unrealistic <e> <s> in fact we have a jolly good little local play group and that is the sort of thing we want to build on <e> <s> i certainly hope that the noble baroness gets ahead with her support for play groups <e> <s> but to go on with this charade of statutory nursery schools is i am sure a mistake <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself with the remarks of the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> even this debate short as it is has shown how complicated is this <e>", "<cs> my lords as a schoolmaster who has tried to tackle this subject in his time it seems to me that we are trying to deal with a most difficult subject in far too short a time <e> <s> this is a report stage debate <e> <s> here we are talking about things that we ought really to have thought about a great deal more at an earlier stage at least some of us ought to have thought about it earlier <e> <s> there are documents which we have not read <e> <s> both the home office and the dhss have produced documents on this subject and i am not sure that all of us have read them <e> <s> i cannot but believe perhaps this may be an improper suggestion to make that this is the kind of thing we ought to have a debate about or a short debate about so that we can think about it instead of hurrying it into a report stage at this time of night when we are really talking about the nuts and bolts of a new bill <e> <s> it is too important for that <e> <s> i would just put that thought into your lordships minds <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when the noble lord lord underhill comes to read the report of the national childrens bureau he will find that the research concerned finished in or i am not quite sure which while the direct grant schools were still in operation and before the comprehensive schools had really got under way and when their second year sixth forms were virtually grammar school sixth forms <e> <s> the figures he is quoting or misquoting i would not know will when they are published need a great deal of interpretation and examination in a fairly expert way <e>", "<cs> my lords i come from an area even more rural still than that of the noble baroness because i am just up the road <e> <s> there are in fact in the north-east two schools which were direct grant schools one barnard castle and the other pocklington and both of them have boarding houses <e> <s> boarding in my view probably rightly is specifically excluded but i think that can be got round because when the direct grant schools were abolished they all had quite successful appeals so that they could continue to carry on their specific historic task of helping poor boys <e> <s> if this scheme goes through and they are accepted they will not need all the money for that purpose and i imagine that some of those schools the ones i have anything to do with certainly would use some of that money to assist boys from very rural areas like that of the noble baroness and my own to go there as at any rate weekly boarders <e> <s> after all under the old direct grant system the fees to day boys were graded on an incomes scale but the boarding fees were not <e> <s> so we should really be going back to something like that except that the state would not be providing the boarding fee <e> <s> i think we can get over this but of course any limitation such as miles must be probing because it would be silly <e> <s> a number of york parents in fact send their children to pocklington by chartered bus every day <e> <s> i think that is slightly more than miles so that will not do <e> <s> at any rate i think these difficulties of geography can be got over <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as noble lords know i am per cent <e> <s> behind this scheme but if i am per cent <e> <s> behind it it must apply to all gifted children <e> <s> living where i do i know well that the really gifted child in wensleydale could not get the kind of education it needs it simply could not in mathematics science greek or whatever <e> <s> the only way it could do so would be by weekly boarding somewhere <e> <s> as i indicated in my few remarks on the last amendment it may be that the receiving schools may have some funds to help out <e> <s> where they have not it seems to me that the door must be left open if this scheme is to be made a reality for help towards boarding for the child who is fortunate or unfortunate enough to live in a very sparsely populated area <e> <s> i would support what lord alexander has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said so much about this subject at various hours of the day and night that i am reluctant to say any more <e> <s> indeed i did not think that it would really be necessary because i thought that after reflection and when seeing what in fact was actually proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord hunt as someone who often walks on limestone pavements <e> <s> i do not think that any care of them can be exaggerated both on the grounds of habitat and beauty because they add immeasurably to a landscape if you know where to find them <e> <s> they are unusual <e> <s> they are vulnerable <e> <s> they are productive of all kinds of beauty from small ferns to elements in the landscape and no trouble can be too great to protect them <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me particular pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord swann on his maiden speech because he is not only a very old friend but as he said i once had the privilege and immense difficulty of trying to teach him <e> <s> he is a man who covers an unusually wide field of interest and i am sure we can rely on hearing him on a number of occasions on a wide variety of topics <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> i could not agree more my lords <e> <s> what i referred to was not home cooking but advanced hostess cooking which is not the kind of home cooking that i am used to in my own home <e> <s> that is a small point however <e> <s> such classes as i have just mentioned may be very desirable but whether they can really be called part of adult education is doubtful <e> <s> but what is at any rate certain is that at times of financial stringency the people who themselves participate should pay the full economic cost <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a bad thing to be somewhat impartial <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble earl cannot distinguish impartiality from confusion <e> <s> it does not surprise me but i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not got it right but never mind his argument will be exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords in actual fact i began by saying that there was one area where i made a real exception as regards my feelings about the justification for the cuts and that was in the field of the universities where i felt that the universities had to go very slowly and very carefully because it was impossible because of the problems of redundancy for the universities to make the economies that were suggested in the timescale proposed but that is too technical to go into at this time of night <e> <s> that is what i actually said <e> <s> i have not got my text because it has been taken away but the noble lord will be able to read it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is because i was trying to explain it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> from the point of view of the outsider who is not an expert on this i must confess that what the minister has said seems to be very unsatisfactory for two reasons <e> <s> he gave us a list of important things which have got to be done for the prison service which is absolutely right but some of us believe that these particular people ought to go to the top of the queue for two reasons first because as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has said the whole business of remand in custody is a very suspect business indeed and secondly and much more importantly because these young people are at the very age when if we send them into the environment of an adult prison we shall breed lifelong prisoners <e> <s> for those two reasons particularly the second i feel that this must be an absolute priority over all the other desirable things which the minister mentioned <e> <s> if the minister has been told that it takes longer to build a fairly secure remand centre than it does to build a hospital i suggest that it is time he consulted another architect <e>", "<cs> no the marines have got their hands fairly full at the moment <e> <s> what i was doing was telling the noble lord to consult other architects than the ones who told him that it takes longer to build a remand centre than it does to build a hospital because it cannot be true <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say two sentences in support of this amendment based on my experience of an insitution which has precisely the arrangement of members of the staff being on the governing body that is to say a university <e> <s> heaven knows that they are not perfect but very few of the great dangers which have been raised arise in the case of universities <e> <s> on the whole one does not have staff ganging up against the vice-chancellor one does not get problems about muggins is on it and muggins isnt and what a shame and buggins will push his department <e> <s> it does not work like that in the real world not in a decent institution <e> <s> it may sometimes happen in a very bad institution but in a decent institution it does not work like that <e>"]
