["<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lords lord kings norton and lord tanlaw for their introductory remarks <e> <s> i had thought to open by saving that natural gas seemed a very appropriate subject for a maiden speech but i think that that perhaps would be to treat it with undue levity <e> <s> the benefits of natural gas now reach into a vast number of homes and commercial enterprises throughout this country <e> <s> if we are going to continue to enjoy those benefits beyond the year we must take a number of important decisions in the relatively near future <e> <s> i must declare an interest in this subject in that outside this house i am a director of a small gas and exploration company <e>", "<cs> my lords as a relative newcomer to sub-committee f i too should like to pay tribute to the way in which the noble lord lord kings norton moulded together a plethora of often conflicting information into an excellent report with hard-hitting conclusions <e> <s> i too must declare an interest in this subject <e> <s> perhaps i have some conflict of interest here in that outside your lordships house i earn my living by producing and selling oil in a falling market and i am here today to try to counsel you to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord kirkhill for bringing forward this subject for debate <e> <s> i must however confess that i am something of a cynic in this matter <e> <s> positive policies tend to get set in concrete and tend to be based on perceptions and forecasts that can prove very wrong <e> <s> in when i was an undergraduate at oxford i met a very senior geologist with the national coal board <e> <s> a little gas had i think been discovered in the southern north sea but this individual told me that there was absolutely no chance of oil ever being discovered under the north sea <e> <s> the little geology that i had been taught led me to think that he might just be wrong <e> <s> if our energy policy had been based on that perception it may be the case that some of his input would have gone into such a policy we would perhaps look a little silly today when we are self-sufficient in oil production <e>", "<cs> my lords i came along tonight to listen to this debate but as somebody who works in the oil exploration industry especially one exploring on-shore in the united kingdom i am afraid that i was unable to resist the temptation to rise to my feet <e> <s> your lordships might think mine was a dubious qualification for speaking in this debate but perhaps i can add a couple of better ones <e> <s> the first is that i myself live in a fairly attractive area of hampshire which is under licence to a company which has been mentioned already carless exploration and the second is that i went to school within what the noble lord lord teviot called the good golf shot of ditchling beacon <e> <s> so perhaps i have a little knowledge of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> touching on another point made by the noble lord perhaps it would be desirable that the oil industry should explore given a situation where it had almost no right to exploit only a right in the sense of a lease from the government relating to the oil rights but with no reasonable expectation of planning permission unless it can show a very good case <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the way in which the noble lord lord kearton introduced the coal report and thank my noble friend lord lauderdale for giving us the chance to broaden the debate <e> <s> without this there would be little else to do but to reiterate the conclusions of the report which are eminently self-obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for bringing this interesting document to the attention of this house <e> <s> as usual before i continue i must declare an interest in this subject <e> <s> while i have no connection with the company which has applied to drill at dunsfold i am attached to a company which is involved in precisely the same kind of business <e> <s> i live in hampshire where there is a lot of this sort of activity but i have to say to your lordships that most of my companys activities are in scotland although shortly to move south <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord onslow for that <e> <s> nevertheless it is an airfield <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that <e> <s> until at least one more well is drilled no one has any idea of how big this field will be and whether ultimately it will be an economic field <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather shamefacedly have to admit and it does not say much for my investigative powers that i spent three years at oxford as a student in a science subject and frequently passed the gates of culham without ever finding out what went on there i mean culham not oxford <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the remarks by the noble lord lord kearton in congratulating the noble lord lord butterworth <e> <s> on a truly excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it served the dual purpose both of edifying the house and of cutting my remarks somewhat shorter since i agreed with a lot of what he said although i do not know that i agree on quite how quickly the electronic office will be with us <e> <s> my noble friend lord kings norton has most lucidly and comprehensively described to us this afternoon the background aims practice benefits and shortcomings of the esprit programme <e> <s> i may say that any shortcomings that were not merely touched on by the noble lord lord kings norton have been pounced on boots and all by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to detain noble lords from their dinners or from bbc itv and channel and especially from repeats of i love lucy bonanza hopalong cassidy racing from saratoga in and other delights no doubt reaching us by satellite television at the moment <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> it is always gratifying when we have these ec debates that a number of noble lords from outside the select committee and especially the subcommittee take part <e> <s> there have been many this evening <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the minister for his robust bolstering of the committees conclusions <e> <s> i am sure that they will drive the wedge of my noble friend lord de la warr back to brussels <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that i am somewhere near the back of the field in what is a rerun of the london marathon and so i shall be brief <e> <s> i also share the fear expressed by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne of canine cannibalism so i have very little compunction in being against the amendment <e> <s> i might have been tempted to be in favour if the breakdown between the duties had been slightly different from the way they were phrased with tariff consumers for one commissioner contract consumers for another and gas purchases and energy efficiency for another <e> <s> i would have thought that the industry breaks down into consumers the purveyor and reticulator of gas namely the british gas corporation and the suppliers <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord diamond would seriously consider that the possession of a salary similar to that of the present chairman of british gas alone would be sufficient to allow that man to negotiate on equal terms with the present chairman <e>", "<cs> i too must declare an interest in the subject as the noble lard lord williams of elvel has done <e> <s> i am associated with a company which is also an independent or a putative independent producer of gas <e> <s> i believe that very shortly in this chamber we shall be debating the financial services bill <e> <s> we shall hear a lot in that bill about chinese walls and dual capacity <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything in this bill which imposes a chinese wall between british gas as a gas producer and british gas as a gas <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer is that i said it is extremely easy to detect by technical means but we cannot feel it see it or smell it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would permit me to correct that impression <e> <s> i said that if there is a politically or technically caused pause in the nuclear power programme i hope that that pause may be used to sort out the problem of reactor choice <e> <s> but i did not suggest that i would wish to encourage the pause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that after nearly six hours and speakers we can truly say that we have taken note of the committees report <e> <s> i should love to pick up certain points from the speeches of other noble lords but at this late hour i think i should content myself with thanking each noble lord who has taken part in the debate <e> <s> i thank all noble lords for the praise which they have lavished upon the report <e> <s> as in all these matters some of that praise in large part is due to people outside this house and i shall convey it there <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that sub-committee b of the ec select committee has recently been looking into the whole subject of the draft directive including quotas and that its report will probably be published within the next few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that robust but not totally definitive reply but would she agree that there is at least some similarity of function between a mosquitos proboscis and a shared hypodermic syringe <e> <s> does the minister consider that this might in some small part account for the considerable spread of this disease in densely populated tropical parts of africa <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to follow a maiden speaker but it is a very considerable privilege to follow the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford today <e> <s> in my youth he was partly responsible for my education <e> <s> as a young boy at harrow i was rather more of an outdoor persuasion than of a bookish nature <e> <s> so a good deal of my first impressions of politics and international affairs came from the panorama programme which began at around that time <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord was very much one of its creators along with the late and much loved richard dimbleby <e> <s> perhaps the fact that his recent career has involved him in being chairman of the totalisator board allowed him to canter through a very inspiring and competent maiden speech today <e> <s> as he said he has had a little practice in this house which is somewhat unusual <e>", "<cs> one biblical allusion that the right reverend prelate might have made in relation to the third world debt problem is that to a certain extent it is a matter of the economic sins of the fathers being visited upon the sons <e> <s> in my opinion much of the third world debt problem results from the discouragement by governments of fixed equity investment by the private sector such that many of those governments have progressively had to rely on borrowings to create new investments to finance projects in their countries and have not in effect created the climate to foster or bring in either domestic or foreign management <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there is a slight danger in reading too much into hospital waiting lists <e> <s> when there was no such thing as a hip replacement operation there were no waiting lists for hip replacement operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it is inevitable when one speaks twelfth in a debate of this nature that most of the ground will have been fairly well trodden over <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord lauderdale trod on most of my lawn in his opening remarks and asked most of the questions i should like to have asked the government perhaps in a slightly more forceful way than i would have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord lord beloff for introducing this interesting topic <e> <s> i add my congratulations to those of other noble lords to the noble viscount lord weir on an excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i am sad that he is not present to hear my welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships have already heard i have in company with two noble baronesses lady young and lady ewart-biggs just had the privilege of visiting hong kong which is what i can only describe as the most vibrant and successful modern city state in the world <e> <s> i find the analogy of the noble lord lord tanlaw particularly apt <e> <s> indeed i only returned from hong kong yesterday and i should like to echo the words of thanks expressed by my noble friend lady young to the hong kong government for all the facilities which they provided to us and for the opportunity to talk to people of all shades of opinion <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make an observation <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord lloyd is talking about the desirability of including advice in the bill <e> <s> surely the purpose of the bill is to enshrine an act and not advice as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in the thanks to the noble lord lord wyatt for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject today <e>", "<cs> i had the great privilege of serving with the noble earl lord halsbury on sub-committee f or b as it now is for a number of years <e> <s> i developed a great regard for his knowledge wit and wisdom <e> <s> perhaps i may coin a phrase in saying that he is slightly barking up the wrong pylon today <e> <s> essentially his proposal is to create three companies <e> <s> instead of big g and little g we shall have nuclear g and two little fossil gs <e> <s> a short while ago he spoke about the fact that nuclear power within big g as presently planned will be cross-subsidised by coal <e> <s> under his proposal i find this slightly worrying because a rule of business is always diversification <e> <s> i would not wish to be running a one-technology company one that made its product by only one method when there were others available <e>", "<cs> my lords being it would appear almost a sole voice in rising to oppose the amendment i do not in any way question the desirability of chp as a concept <e> <s> it is extremely elegant but it is seldom economical <e> <s> i lived in pimlico very close to a post-war housing estate called churchill gardens which had one of the first chp schemes in this country <e> <s> i understand that it was not the ultimate closure of battersea power station that brought the chp scheme to an end but something which happened rather earlier <e> <s> i do not know what it was but it is symptomatic of the problem that chp is seldom economic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was under the impression obviously wrongly that the chp scheme closed before the power station <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor reminded us this afternoon we shall be spending a certain amount of time this session discussing the broadcasting bill <e> <s> at the outset of my remarks i must quickly admit an interest in that i am chairman of an applicant company for a cable television franchise <e> <s> a short while ago i also had the privilege to chair the sub-committee of your lordships ec select committee which looked into proposals on television without frontiers and into european telecommunications policy in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill so ably introduced by my noble friend covers the future of broadcasting <e> <s> it is a little surprising that as yet there has been virtually no discussion of the cable industry <e> <s> i wish to redress that balance but in doing so i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am a director of a cable franchise holding company <e> <s> i believe that only my noble friend lord stockton has so far mentioned the cable authority <e> <s> i should like to say that i have nothing but praise for the hard work of the staff and members of that body whose existence will come to an end with the passing of the bill <e> <s> however i do not entirely agree with some of its methods <e>"]
