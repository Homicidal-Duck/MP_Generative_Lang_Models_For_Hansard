["<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that it is the greek orthodox church which is involved and that the greek orthodox church cannot so agree without a resolution of the pan-orthodox holy synod and that that holy synod has not met since the russian revolution because if the russians call a meeting the greeks do not go and if the greeks call a meeting the russians do not go <e> <s> do the government think it is right that whether the ordinary british family should have their spring bank holiday in march or april ought to depend on that kind of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords my only object in being here this evening is to thank the noble lord lord wigoder for introducing this bill and moving its second reading <e> <s> as a result of recent events it is obvious that this is a relatively small part of our law which wants reconsideration and wants it fairly urgently <e> <s> his speed in moving the bill is to be greatly commended for it gives us an early opportunity of

country on the whole by trying to tackle this on an early occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord hale <e> <s> i shall be short <e> <s> we are in an unusual situation this evening because usually of course we are concerned with differences of view between the major political parties <e> <s> this is a subject in which the division of opinion has usually been between the executive on one side and parliament the press and others on the other <e> <s> it is a difficult field because we must obviously nave an official secrets act <e> <s> the general difficulties have been felt <e> <s> i cannot of course claim to speak with the experience of my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i can only remember one section case perhaps illustrating the reason why for so long now it has been virtually a dead letter <e> <s> this was a prosecution of a loyal conservative public school conscientious civil servant who was in the ministry of information a ministry that existed not to conceal anything but all the time to give out information <e> <s> she had been given with other members of the staff policy documents showing what british government policy was in relation to various european countries and if anybody asked her what the government policy was towards such and such a country she could then tell them <e> <s> she could quote from the document but she was not supposed to give anybody a copy of the document <e> <s> she was particularly anxious to persuade a yugoslav friend that our policy as to yugoslavia was right and she actually gave him a copy of the document which of course she should not have done <e> <s> she was prosecuted under section and on the first count of the indictment she was not only dismissed the service but given the maximum punishment of two years in prison <e> <s> i thought that was an absurd example of prosecution and an absurd sentence <e> <s> the court of appeal upheld it but it is not surprising when one gets that sort of sentence and that sort of case that the legislation is virtually a dead letter <e>", "<cs> this happily has always been treated as a non-party political <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask why the word governments in the amendment on the marshalled list is in the plural <e> <s> strictly i think that my remarks apply to the next amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise as a supporter of the bill <e> <s> i have no intention of voting against any amendment which the noble lord lord wigoder may propose and still less of putting down any amendment myself <e> <s> i want to make one or two observations in case they may be of assistance to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task must be to thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether he is aware from the first of the examples of this that i gave him that the innocence of the woman who was convicted of theft and sentenced to two years imprisonment transpired only because the barrister who appeared for her happened to be in the same chambers as the barrister who later <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the real difficulty perhaps is not the fact that outside the metropolis the secretary of state has no power to direct the police as to what they are to do in such circumstances <e> <s> in view of that difficulty would not the secretary of state at least consider remitting this problem to the royal commission on criminal procedure within whose wide terms of reference the subject clearly falls <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task and indeed pleasure must be to congratulate my noble friend lord strauss on his maiden speech <e> <s> it is a great asset that in all parts of the house we have members with very great detailed experience in particular fields and i think that my noble friend was wise to wait until he had a subject for his maiden speech on which he is an acknowledged authority <e> <s> i remember well supporting the appointment of the joint committee on the theatres of which he was the distinguished chairman which produced an admirable report and resulted in a very sensible state of affairs in the theatre <e> <s> he has been the father of the other place <e> <s> i hope that he may live long enough to be the father of this place also and that we shall hear from him again both soon and often <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but human nature being what it is every <e>", "<cs> i do not know my lords <e> <s> i have not tried that <e> <s> but those are my experiences from those two cases <e> <s> finally because i have spoken for quite long enough already coming back to the last point may i put a question to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> he may remember that in a debate which we had in this house in he proposed a solution that is to say he answered the question if not williams what <e> <s> his panacea was this a censorship authority responsible for the whole range of artistic literary and dramatic expression <e> <s> i should like to ask him respectfully whether this will be a quango or not <e> <s> it would have to contain an enormous staff the whole of english literature ail the paintings everything on the stage <e> <s> every film in a cinema <e> <s> does it not raise an ethical question <e> <s> if we really believe that out of any ordinary collection of people a certain proportion would be corrupted by reading one obscene book are we really ethically justified in paying people to read nothing but obscenities month after month and year after year <e> <s> i suppose they could be heavily insured but is money a sufficient compensation <e> <s> there it is my lords this is an interesting <e> <s> report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble lord is a convert at least on that point <e> <s> personally i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the hour i rise but briefly to support the second reading of this bill and to thank the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale not only for having introduced its contents to us but for reminding us of its history <e> <s> it is manifest i think that in general the bill has the support of the house and i have no personal criticisms to raise <e> <s> i am a little concerned about the future <e> <s> my one regret tonight is that the late lady summerskill who all her life was such a splendid fighter against the many hardships from which women have suffered did not live quite long enough to see the second reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh must be pleased i am sure by the immense interest in the house to which the subject he has proposed has given rise <e> <s> it has given us additionally the pleasure of hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord murton of lindisfarne who if i may say so made an exemplary maiden speech and we shall look forward to hearing from him soon and often <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not tonight propose to address your lordships on any question of morals <e> <s> i myself am not a racialist i do not believe in discrimination on grounds of race or sex and at my age i do not think i am justified in taking up much of your lordships time except on questions of law <e> <s> the first thing i want to say is that in my opinion a number of these rules are contrary to the terms of the european convention on human rights <e> <s> i do not propose to take up time with arguing that case because it has been argued very fully <e> <s> i have re-read the case put forward by the noble and learned lord lord scarman in the discussion that we had on th december <e> <s> i have read the oral evidence that he gave the home affairs committee of another place and which is now published in their report and the written and oral evidence of mr anthony lester and professor jacobs and others in another place <e>

that he agrees with what i have so far said <e> <s> since which is a long time ago we have had only three lord chancellors <e> <s> it would be interesting to know whether all three held exactly the same view <e> <s> i do not wish this to be regarded as any criticism of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for not being here <e> <s> i quite understand that this is not lord chancellors business that it is home office business <e> <s> i am only saying that if his colleagues had asked him to answer some of these arguments then i am sure that he would have been happy to do so and naturally it would have been interesting to know tonight whether all three lord chancellors are in complete agreement that some at least of these rules contravene the convention <e> <s> we have the great advantage that we are going to hear the views of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson <e> <s> whether he will be speaking for the government as such i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say since he asked me that i doubt whether what i said about the rules was strictly accurate <e> <s> the position as i understand it is this that if this house disapproves of the rules tonight they remain in force <e> <s> the home secretary should then within days produce amended rules for approval or disapproval <e> <s> but until then these rules would remain in force <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for the amendment has already been so fully made by the members of all three political parties that i do not propose to add to it <e> <s> may i reply to what has just been said <e> <s> the bar having no senior partners and no employers and standing on their own feet have always been regulated by the laws of supply and demand <e> <s> there have always been times when there are too many barristers too many solicitors and times when there have been too few <e> <s> we are legislating for the future <e> <s> i should have thought we ought to have regard to the general position and i rise in particular because i should not like anybody to be under any misapprehension that i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having been chancellor of the open university for five years and also a student i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> these discretionary grants by local authorities have really not proved to be satisfactory <e> <s> may i take two students one a teacher and the other an ordinary housewife <e> <s> i can fairly take them because our biggest group of students are teachers and our second biggest group are ordinary housewives <e> <s> so far as the teacher is concerned he is the only student who stands to gain financially by getting a degree from the open university <e> <s> he is normally a teacher who apart from his teachers training certificate has not got a university degree himself but if he gets a degree then this will qualify him for additional remuneration <e> <s> so he stands to gain by it <e>", "<cs> my lords on thursday evening we were discussing the immigration rules when the noble lord lord belstead said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee on what was one of the best maiden speeches that i have ever heard <e> <s> we shall all want to hear him again soon and often <e> <s> may i first say on the debate something which has been said before and apparently there is still doubt about it <e> <s> it is that the campaign for world disarmament is not for unilateral disarmament <e> <s> it is squarely based on the decision of the general assembly <e> <s> it is for agreed and verifiable disarmament in other words it is for dtente salt ii and salt iii and so forth <e> <s> no doubt it will be supported by unilateralists as they are entitled to do but it is not for unilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord refers to equality will he make it plain what he is talking about <e> <s> is he talking about warheads or what <e> <s> is there not a large united states superiority in the number of warheads about per cent <e> <s> more <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unfortunately precluded by another engagement from attending the committee stage of the bill when this amendment was discussed before <e> <s> as president of help the aged i have some knowledge of the conditions of the old people about whom we are talking <e> <s> i have of course read the whole of the debate on the committee stage of the bill and i suppose that its most striking and unusual feature was that there were actually more supporters for the amendment speaking from the government side of the committee than from the opposition side of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this has always been a very troublesome subject and i am indebted to a publication of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply <e> <s> with reference to the statement made by the government on rd april in this house as reported at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully accept everything that the noble and learned lord has said may i again ask whether that means that the government are now withdrawing their previous statement that we had been convicted of torture <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important report <e> <s> is there really not some responsibility on the government to make copies available to members of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords while in a sense perhaps biased as president of help the aged i would like to support this amendment <e> <s> i will not detain your lordships since the arguments have already been fully advanced <e> <s> it has always seemed to me that although sufficient account has been taken of the money that would be saved if this amendment were accepted in the various fields described by the noble baroness lady faithfull in the end all it means is that a fairly small number of people who are too poor to obtain tax relief will be enabled to die in their own homes <e> <s> one has to take into account in reverse the various aspects which the noble baroness lady faithfull has described <e> <s> i hope very much that the government may be able to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the house would allow me to add a few words to the tributes which have so rightly been paid to the late noble and learned viscount lord dilhorne <e> <s> we were at magdalen college oxford and we were called to the bar within two years of one another by the inner temple and for years we lunched together every day at the same table in the hall of that inn <e> <s> we differed on political matters <e> <s> i was not much concerned with that but he was obviously destined for political life to which i did not aspire <e> <s> but the conversation at the table was certainly inspiring and many who sat at that table have since achieved eminence in various ways <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord belstead has treated somewhat cavalierly the objections which have been made by the noble lord lord goodman <e> <s> for hundreds of years we have had a law of defamation which very properly has been changed from time to time to meet objections or changing circumstances <e> <s> it applies to all literature art the drama and so on <e> <s> we have never yet thought it right to extend this <e>", "<cs> my lords my sole object in speaking is the hope that i may persuade the government on third reading to withdraw from the bill any reference to dead people or proceedings on behalf of dead people <e> <s> my first difficulty has been to find out from where all this about dead people or actions on behalf of their relatives comes <e> <s> what as i understand it we are supposed to be doing is taking the annan report a massive report of a committee which sat for nearly three years and then seeing which of the recommendations the government think should be translated into legislation <e> <s> i was convinced that i must somehow or other have missed all the references in the annan report to proceedings on behalf of relatives of dead people <e> <s> i have now satisfied myself long though the report is that there is nothing whatever in it to suggest anything of the kind <e> <s> whether for the first time the relatives or others connected with dead people should have a right of complaint is not discussed in any way in the annan report <e>", "<cs> i too am grateful to the minister my lords <e> <s> this amendment at least sets some time limit instead of the words previously in the clause of great uncertainty and will therefore place a time limit on complaints of this kind and for that i am grateful <e> <s> i should naturally have been happier if the noble lord had felt able to limit the extraordinary variety of people who may want to complain on behalf of a dead man even though the dead man may have said when he was alive that he did not care two hoots about the programme did not propose to take any action about it at all and thought on balance that it had probably done him good rather than harm <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down to speak in time for it to be on the list of speakers but i have given notice since and i understand those concerned have been advised <e> <s> my interest in this question arises because i think and i am not alone i believe that we ought to be apprehensive in the next months regarding an increase and perhaps an alarming increase in public disorder <e> <s> if so two things are very important first <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us have been here before several times <e> <s> this is i think the fifth time and it may be that there is nothing more to be said particularly by those who support the second reading of this bill and in view of the speech which has just been made by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> but there are one or two additional points that if i may i should like to make <e> <s> first there are cne or two new elements <e> <s> the first new element is the very recent decision of the government to continue the optional clause for another five years <e> <s> that means that for the next five years at least our citizens if this bill is not passed will be unable if there is a clear breach of the convention to have the point settled by their own judges as the citizens of most other large european countries can do <e> <s> i say at least five years because i apprehend that even at the end of five years if the government were to decide to resile from the convention altogether this would not affect cases already in the pipeline although of course in that event we should no longer be bound to carry out the ultimate decision of the strasbourg court <e> <s> this means that for about years we are going to be deprived for no good reason that i can see of the opportunity of having these cases decided in the first instance by our own judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be surprised if some judges did not take a different view because my experience of the judiciary which goes back a long time is that there is practically no subject on which the judges are ever unanimous <e> <s> but broadly speaking the average judge sees no difficulty in it <e> <s> it would be a great saving of expense and time to our own citizens <e> <s> now we have about years to look forward to anyhow <e> <s> i should have thought that even as a matter of seeing what works and what does not work if we passed this bill we can always pass another bill later it would give us an opportunity at least in the next five years and possibly thereafter to see how it works out <e> <s> i have never been able to see any practical difficulty about it <e> <s> i hope that before long we shall pass it into law <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself speaking from this exalted position by request simply to sum up for the opposition <e> <s> that does not of course mean that this is a party political question <e> <s> it should <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i rise to say anything on a subject on which i have not spoken before <e> <s> in any case i shall be brief speaking only for myself <e> <s> i must first declare any prejudices <e> <s> one i have is certainly a prejudice in favour of people being allowed to do what they want to do for themselves <e> <s> locke and hobbes and other moral philosophers have discussed this at great length and it has never seemed to me to be a question one could answer in black and white it must of course depend on the circumstances of the case <e>", "<cs> drafting of course is always susceptible to argument <e> <s> the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the question whether clause should stand part of the bill and i do so of course only for the purpose of asking the government to take some observations into account before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> subsection is that which gives the courts a power to order the postponement of the report of proceedings and that of course is entirely in accordance with the recommendation of the phillimore committee <e>", "<cs> this has been a most interesting discussion <e> <s> those members of the committee who are not lawyers may have had experience already of the fact that lawyers however distinguished do not always agree <e> <s> that has been the case in this discussion <e> <s> it has been a most interesting one <e> <s> i have been persuaded by the arguments of the noble and learned lords the lord chancellor and lord scarman that i ought not to press this amendment to a division <e> <s> my basic reason for raising the point was that here was an express recommendation of the phillimore committee <e> <s> it had not been carried into a bill <e> <s> there was undoubtedly a body of legal thinking which felt that unless this recommendation of the phillimore committee was carried into the bill there was at least a grave danger that we should find ourselves again in breach of the european convention <e> <s> the future alone will show whether that is right or not <e> <s> my feeling had been that if there was a doubt about it it seemed sensible to accept this recommendation of the phillimore committee <e> <s> but because of the arguments put forward by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i do not propose to press this amendment to a division and i ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> it had been my intention to ask the committee to divide on the amendment but as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said that he will reconsider the question i do not propose to do so now <e> <s> however i want to make one or two brief observations <e> <s> first i can see no practical difficulty about having a provision in the bill that these committees and tribunals to whom this shall apply are to be contained in a schedule which can be altered by statutory instrument <e> <s> secondly i feel bound to repeat what i said at the start as to the origin of this particular clause which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has not really explained <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words in case the noble and learned lord would like to help us on the point <e> <s> one matter that has troubled the public <e>", "<cs> i have never felt too competent on the law of scotland and i do not propose to express any opinion about it <e> <s> so far as sutcliffe is concerned this is of course a case which i believe at the moment is <e>", "<cs> we have several things to think over <e> <s> i thought in sutcliffe that the real trouble was the police <e> <s> if the police call a press conference i doubt whether we shall ever get a state of affairs in which the newspapers accept that it is quite all right for the police to prejudice a mans trial as much as they like but the newspapers must not say what the police told them <e> <s> but i shall certainly review that again in the light of what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the situation in el salvador will her majestys government not at least consider putting the matter on the agenda of the united nations human rights commission <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course i can understand <e> <s> the sutcliffe case itself did not happen because the law as to when strict liability should start was at an earlier place rather than later <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the lateness of the hour i shall be extremely short <e> <s> of course no member of this house would be expected to vote for this bill if it is against his religious convictions <e> <s> nobody would expect that <e> <s> i am not an authority on contemporary religion <e> <s> rightly or wrongly i had understood from the right reverend prelate the bishop of london that there was no moral or religious objection <e> <s> indeed when we discussed the case of berry and ward i think it was the same right reverend prelate who was almost enthusiastic about the bill going through in which case it is not a question of opening doors <e> <s> after all it is about years since the deceased wifes sister provision died <e> <s> it is a bit late to start talking about opening doors <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him first whether he accepts the facts stated in the opening of the report namely that during the past years more than reports by royal commissions or other committees appointed by the government and some reports by select committees of the house of commons have <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to comment on the statement in paragraph <e> <s> after referring to four particular groups of reports they say <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support the second reading of this bill <e> <s> for about the first seven years of the life of the law commission

now some to i believe which have not been so implemented because they have not been put before parliament <e> <s> this has not i know been due in any way to the fault of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who has always been a very good friend of the law commission or of his predecessor <e> <s> it has been due partly to difficulties of parliamentary time this government like labour governments too always try to crowd too much legislation into one session <e> <s> it has been partly also due i think to the fact that there are some government departments which do not now act as they were wont to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset warmly to congratulate the noble viscount lord bledisloe on his maiden speech <e> <s> he was short clear and to the point and we all look forward to hearing him again soon and often <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether the governments white paper did not indicate that administrative arrangements had been made to prevent information collected by one government department personal information on a computer being transferred to a different department for a different purpose <e> <s> have the govenment departed from these arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the person entitled to know in what cases the personal information he gives to a government department will be used for other purposes by a different government department <e>", "<cs> i do not often trouble your lordships in these days <e> <s> we are discussing two things telephone tapping and a proposed piece of law reform and i have had some experience of both <e> <s> i shall be interested to know whether

partly at the request of christian action to observe the opening of the treason trial in johannesburg <e> <s> the first thing that leading counsel for the defence said was whatever you do do not use the telephone because it is tapped by the police <e>", "<cs> with respect i should have thought that my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones made an unanswerable case for this amendment <e> <s> we have heard what the noble earl has said but i should like to raise two points in particular <e> <s> the noble earl has laid great stress on the diplock report and i am sure that there is no member of your lordships house who has more complete confidence in that noble and learned lord than i have <e> <s> however when we were discussing telephone communications i did ask the noble earl if he would be good enough to tell me whether i was right in thinking first that not all our own security services came within the terms of reference of the diplock report secondly that so far as telephone tapping was concerned the diplock report did not cover because it was outside its terms of reference telephone tapping by government communications headquarters thirdly that the diplock reports terms of reference did not include telephone tapping by american security forces in england <e> <s> the noble earl was good enough to say he would write to me with the answers <e> <s> i have since had a letter from the noble earl but it did not answer any of my questions <e> <s> it is some little time since i raised these questions so could the noble earl now tell me the answers to them and could he also say which agencies are authorised to open and read letters or read without opening as i understand one can do now <e> <s> do they include for example agencies which are security services serving foreign governments <e>", "<cs> i do of course accept the noble earls explanation <e> <s> i have not had his answer but i daresay that it is waiting for me upstairs <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord blease expressed the view of the opposition and while not disagreeing with anything he said i speak for myself <e> <s> in these days of gloom i should like to refer to four hopeful factors i think in the northern ireland situation <e> <s> the first factor is the success with which terrorism has been met <e> <s> the secretary of state said on nd july last week at col <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am dealing at the moment with northern ireland and it has not had the same effect here as it has had in northern ireland <e> <s> in northern ireland the children are brought up in separate schools with entirely different views of irish history and of the problems which ought to be common problems to the people of the country <e> <s> the reasons why we did not say anything about this were two-fold first because it would have been outside our terms of reference which were to inquire into the working of the emergency powers act and secondly because i thought rightly or wrongly that there was no question of integrated schools because the catholic church and doctor paisley would never for a moment agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt they would get on perfectly well together if only they could meet and i thought that in the sunday opinion poll the most striking answer to any question was this q do you think that protestant and catholic children should go to the same school <e> <s> a yes protestants per cent <e> <s> yes catholics per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged that is the next thing i was going to say <e> <s> i wanted to ask the noble lord lord

understand that there are areas in which there would be difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that it would have some effect when one is dealing with the future of northern ireland and

are nothing but catholic children or nothing but protestant children <e> <s> integrated schools would be possible in many areas and i believe it would be a big step forward if the government would take this on board and see what can be done so that young protestants can talk to their opposite numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add something on the same point <e> <s> the amendment which was before the other place and which was moved by the honourable member for mansfied mr con-cannon who had himself been minister of state in the northern ireland office called for a wide-ranging inquiry into the workings of the northern ireland emergency provisions act <e> <s> this was not only supported of course by the opposition that is to say the labour party including the right honourable member for cardiff south-east mr callaghan but also by the liberal party and i think by one or two <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to take it that the report is not to be published and if not why not <e>", "<cs> this seems to me to be the most important of the amendments before the committee <e> <s> in any ideal system of justice any man or woman who comes before a criminal court maybe innocent maybe guilty should be treated in the same way <e> <s> in practice this is an impossible standard to achieve simply because judges and magistrates are human beings and there are bound to be

bill i hope that your lordships house may forgive me if i congratulate most warmly the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on this splendid administration of justice bill <e> <s> it is the usual way of trying to keep the law up to date <e> <s> it is always very varied in its contents <e> <s> i believe that i had such a bill in most years but i never attempted one so ambitious as this <e> <s> its size is enormous and must have involved an enormous amount of work both for the noble and learned lord and for many members of his staff <e> <s> i warmly congratulate him on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i ventured to say in earlier stages of this bill that this amendment was one that needed careful consideration <e> <s> in answer to what has been said by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway i wonder if he appreciates that this is a form of social welfare and that it is the only form of social walfare regarding which there is no appeal against refusal of the grant <e> <s> the basic facts are unchanged <e> <s> it cannot be right that you are eight times less likely to get legal aid in highgate than you are in hampstead <e> <s> the noble and learned lord suggested that some degree of variation might be due to the fact that different courts had different classes of criminals before them <e> <s> that undoubtedly is so but it cannot account for cases of that kind <e> <s> the same is true of reading and slough and what about the remarkable case of waltham forest where in march of last year the refusal rate on applications for legal aid was per cent <e> <s> and by september it was per cent <e> <s> these courts need guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether having <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in his letter to me of th november the noble lord lord belstead forecast regulations providing for trial if practicable by a jury of five persons and no appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt there are long-term implications in this subject which very much deserve to be considered questions of cause and effect and so on <e> <s> the main point that i wish to make is that we are now in a state of crisis in the prisons in which anything may happen at almost any time <e> <s> at wormwood scrubs prisoners were injured and prison officers and this sort of thing may happen at any time where you have some prisoners in cells built for one occupying them with two or three others with <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anyone who has considered the history of the bill would disagree with me when i say that it is a very much better bill than the bill that was first introduced <e> <s> if that is so credit is i think due in two quarters first to the all-party parliamentary penal affairs group for all the work that it did and secondly to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not really very difficult to contend that we satisfied our obligations under this convenant of the united nations which we have ratified to provide compensation according to law by making <e>", "<cs> does this mean that there are no criteria by which the prison medical officer certifies whether something is fit for occupation or not <e> <s> i have often wondered about the question raised by the noble lord lord avebury but i understand from what the noble lord lord elton was saying and he is always so helpful that there are no criteria laid down at all <e> <s> it seems that the medical officer takes a look and then says yes or no <e> <s> is that right that there are no criteria at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> is it impossible for the noble lord to give us any dates <e> <s> if this can be done for -yearolds why is it impossible to do it for -year-olds <e> <s> the noble lord intimated for some time in correspondence with the noble baroness lady faithfull and others that the day was approaching when accommodation would be available <e> <s> now he gives no date at all <e> <s> he sets no limit to it <e> <s> we have to remember what the conditions in our prisons with their overpopulation are like for remand prisoners <e> <s> it is possible to take the view that preferably no remand prisoners should be made to endure the conditions which exist in our prisons but we could at least start with those aged and <e>", "<cs> i venture to say a word on this amendment because first while i have attended all the hearings at committee stage i think i have spoken only once and that for about two minutes on one amendment and secondly because this is the last amendment which proposes something effective to reduce the size of the prison population <e> <s> we have had the wormwood scrubs riot and we know the numbers of prisoners and officers injured we have had riots on prison roofs and we have had cell fires <e> <s> we may have a long hot summer and i am sorry to have to say this but i do not think it unlikely that before that summer is out if the present size of our prison population in relation to resources is maintained some will be burned to death in the prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for having given us the opportunity to discuss this report or part of it tonight <e> <s> as your lordships know i have always felt that we treat very poorly those who serve on royal commissions and departmental committees <e> <s> they receive no pay and the work takes up an enormous amount of their time <e> <s> for the chairman of course it must become a full-time job for about four years <e> <s> it always seems to me to be extremely discourteous if when as here they have spent four years on a task like this and produced this very full report it is not discussed in parliament <e> <s> fortunately i hope they will never know that we are discussing it with only one member on the government side of the house sitting behind the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the third reading of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been a member of your lordships house for years and for nearly six years as lord chancellor and i am well aware of the customs of the house <e> <s> ordinarily in many cases if one has a general point to raise on a bill it is more convenient to take it on the motion that the bill do now pass or if it relates to clauses which are being amended to take it on the amendments <e> <s> but any member of your lordships house is entitled to oppose the third reading of any bill and the ground on which i am doing so is that it will save a good deal of your lordships time <e> <s> it is a general point <e> <s> if i were prevented from taking it now i should take it on every single amendment which is on the marshalled list <e> <s> the reason why i am taking it on third reading is to save the time of the house <e> <s> it will save a lot of the time of the house if we dispose of this point now rather than take it on every single amendment <e> <s> it is quite a simple point <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the <e>", "<cs> then my lords i shall continue <e> <s> the point is quite a simple one and it is this <e> <s> i do not think that we ought to give a third reading to this bill until the government have told us what their intentions are with regard to bringing its various provisions into force <e> <s> at the time when i wrote to the noble lord lord elton there was only one relevant clause clause which provided <e>", "<cs> but my lords the present position is that the general clause leaves it to the home office to decide whether or not any particular section shall be brought into force <e> <s> it is a common clause <e> <s> it is of course very proper where there is some preliminary act which has to be done <e> <s> if one is altering the procedure of the courts the rules of court have to be made <e> <s> that cannot be done in a moment <e> <s> they have to be passed by the rule committee which is not a creature of the lord chancellor <e> <s> obviously such a section cannot be brought into force until the rules of court have been made <e> <s> there may be some cases of that in this bill <e> <s> but there are a great many cases where many of us have found it quite impossible to think of any reason why they are not being brought into force <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord elton whether there is some reason why the courts should go on doing something which we all agree is undesirable once the act has received the royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord elton will agree that since i was thoroughly squashed by the usual channels i have been remarkably silent <e> <s> clause with which we are dealing at the moment is the clause which provides that soliciting by women for the purposes of prostitution shall no longer be a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i venture to go a little further than that because when i asked a question as to when clause was to come into force i was given at once the date <e> <s> this suggested to me that somewhere in the home office there is a list of the dates on which it is proposed that the different clauses should come into force including possibly a list of clauses which the home office proposes never to put into force <e> <s> whether or not that is so i do not know <e> <s> the subject is clearly one of public interest but is there any reason why this should not be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he would be prepared to receive and discuss these matters with a deputation from justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to deal with two matters and i shall be very brief <e> <s> first i am very glad to see the noble and learned lord lord templeman and i should like to congratulate him upon his maiden speech <e> <s> noble lords do not need me to tell them what advantage it will be to have the advice of the noble and learned lord lord templeman in the future because they have heard his maiden speech and appreciate that already <e> <s> i hope very much that he will give us his advice whenever he is free from his judicial duties and is able to do so <e>", "<cs> i have not taken up much of the time of the committee so far <e> <s> i wondered whether the noble lord lord elton would consider a question to which i have not been able to discover the answer <e> <s> this is a hypothetical question or as i see the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in his place perhaps i should say it is an hypothetical question <e> <s> suppose one day it was discovered that in the deep recesses of the home office there was a large computer containing a great deal of data with personal information on it about numerous people who together were called immigrants <e> <s> perhaps it is not so frightfully hypothetical a question after all <e> <s> it is clear from the clause that the person who holds that is under an obligation to register as a computer user <e> <s> my simple question which i think nobody has asked and which has certainly not yet been answered is whether that person would be mr whitelaw the home office the secretary of state or mr smith the civil servant told by the secretary of state to take charge of that computer or would it be somebody else whom i have not been able to think of <e>", "<cs> the first thing which i think is perfectly clear is that both the data protection committee and the government thought that data users and data subjects ought to be able to obtain the advice of the registrar and that it should be his duty so to advise them <e> <s> the second thing which is perfectly clear is that clause deals with something entirely different <e> <s> it is not dealing with advice for the benefit of data users and data subjects it is dealing with the dissemination of information to the public <e> <s> i would respectfully suggest that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is in an entirely different position <e> <s> he is one of the most eminent ministers in any government this is a new statutory creation <e> <s> if there <e>", "<cs> the discussion has at least resulted in one thing becoming clear and that is that the government have not resiled from their position taken in the white paper that one of the things the registrar ought to do is to investigate complaints <e> <s> here again is a case in which we all want the same thing <e> <s> the only difference between us is whether it is better to put it into the bill or not <e>", "<cs> there was a time when i was quite familiar with the council on tribunals and their work <e> <s> i accept everything which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said and particularly that there has been a sort of general rule that the lord chancellor and not the minister should make the rules where the minister might be interested in the result of the proceedings <e> <s> i agree there has been no settled plan <e> <s> as a matter of personal opinion i have always felt it was wrong that the rule should be made by a government department and not by the lord chancellor who has appointed the chairman and often the deputy chairman <e> <s> that as i say is a matter of opinion but what i would like to ask is this can the government tell me of any single case like this case for a tribunal where the man who is most likely to be in trouble before the tribunal is the minister <e> <s> i know of no such case <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought that change might come about when it came to the question of making the rule <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a question here to which we simply cannot get an answer <e> <s> we tried to do so in the committee stage we did not succeed then and we have not done so now <e> <s> it is a question the answer to which the government must know <e> <s> it is a fairly simple question <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> allowing for the fact that in this field there has been a great variety of practice as to whether the regulations for a tribunal should be made by the lord chancellor or by the minister is there anywhere in our history a case in which there has ever been a tribunal before which the minister may be a party and yet it is to be the minister who has everything to do with the tribunal <e> <s> is there any possible precedent for this <e>", "<cs> my lords we are deeply grateful to the government for the consideration they have given to amendments moved in committee <e> <s> we are naturally a little sorry that they have not applied the same arguments to the question whether in the bill there is any power for the registrar to investigate complaints <e> <s> perhaps they would be good enough to look at that before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> meanwhile we are very grateful for the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i am not clear from what he said whether or not he is taking the view that the question who is the registered data user in relation to a government computer <e> <s> is a matter for the construction of the court <e> <s> secondly what happens if there is a difference of opinion between the minister and the home office in the practical working of the act <e> <s> are the home office entitled to say to the minister no minister this really is for us <e> <s> it is not for you <e> <s> if they cannot say that what does it mean by saying that it is the home office and not the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> shall consider most carefully what has been said and if necessary return to it at third reading <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i shall not pursue the matter here <e> <s> i am not objecting at all to the unique course which has been taken in all the circumstances of this case in making a government department a person within the meaning of the bill <e> <s> the only question i raised was as to its effect on ministerial responsibility <e> <s> in effect we are at one about it <e> <s> the government are saying that this does not affect the doctrine of ministerial responsibility <e> <s> all i am asking is can we not say so in one sentence in the bill <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> if it has to be determined by a court one day it would be of great assistance to the court would it not <e> <s> to know that in some circumstances this unique act will not affect ministerial responsibility <e> <s> that is what i want that is what the government want <e> <s> all i am asking is whether it can be put in one sentence to say so <e> <s> i can only hope that when the bill goes to another place the government will reconsider this question <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in what i regard as perhaps the most important amendment on the marshalled list would the noble and learned lord bear in mind that nearly all the information to which the law commission is referring is information in the possession of the courts <e> <s> they drew attention to the fact that we do not even know what is the average amount of maintenance order made <e> <s> we do not know how much is in fact paid <e> <s> i suppose in relation to the courts only the noble and learned lord and the home secretary for the home office in the civil and criminal courts can order them to produce that information <e> <s> this is the basic information and this recommendation concerning it was made over two years ago <e> <s> here we are today not knowing the facts with many mens organisations saying one thing and womens organisations saying the opposite <e> <s> we do not know simply because although this recommendation was made two years ago the government took no steps on it at the time and that is the reason why today we are in the position we are in <e>"]
