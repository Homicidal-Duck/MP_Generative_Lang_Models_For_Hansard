["<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk once told me that in all the matters which she and i have discussed and debated across the floor of your lordships house she has not agreed with me on any one issue except perhaps on the matter of planning which she has just mentioned <e> <s> i am so glad i should like to deal with planning shortly that i agree with everything that she has said this evening <e> <s> i join the noble lord lord walston in saying that the public in general and the agricultural industry in particular should be grateful that the royal commission has turned its attention to the facts and to the fancies about pollution by farmers and indeed to pollution by other agencies affecting farmers <e> <s> this its seventh report should be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very late and what i have to say will be brief <e> <s> it is on a narrow point and it <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has clauses and seven schedules for the better ordering of affairs in kent and i wish very briefly to draw attention to only two clauses <e> <s> it will be seen from the order paper that in the event of this bill being read a second time i am to move an instruction to the select committee on the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord the chairman of committees has suggested it may be convenient to the house if i speak now on clauses and and then formally move the instruction on the second of those clauses when the time comes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the instruction as printed on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the pressure of time and in view of the assurances my noble friend has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of a very busy session we are <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord the leader of the opposition i do not believe that the government should look again <e> <s> i will explain why not <e> <s> it has not been said yet and it ought to be said that the minister of agriculture should be given more credit than noble lords seem to be willing to give him that at a time when the nation is in a tight corner economically he is able to achieve for farmers the kind of level for grant aid for capital improvements which are proposed by these orders even though the rates are lower than those which the agricultural industry have received in the past <e> <s> according to the last figures that i have seen the amount to be received by farmers for capital projects this year is no less than million <e> <s> i do not suppose that in money terms the amount for will be very much less <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i understand <e> <s> i am sure that those assurances will be forthcoming <e> <s> when they are i will not oppose these orders and i recommend noble lords who have the interests of our farming industry at heart to vote with me for the government <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find myself in sympathy with what my noble friend lord morris is trying to achieve by this amendment <e> <s> i am sure it was never the governments intention that local authorities should be required to disclose to any person who may demand the information detailed prices which are normally considered to be confidential as between contractor and client <e> <s> it seems to me quite wrong and a departure from normal practice that the words <e>", "<cs> it is very seldom indeed that i do not agree with my noble friend lord sandford but this is one of those rare occasions <e> <s> i am glad to say that the gulf between us is not a very wide one because for a vice-president of the district councils association to differ from his president must be very near to insubordination <e> <s> but differ i do with him about this amendment and i shall try briefly to explain why it should not be accepted by the committee and why that <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord mishcon but i wonder if it would not be more convenient to have this debate on the question that the clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what my noble friend lord bellwin has said <e> <s> i appreciate what he said about this governments intentions with which i am happy <e> <s> the fact remains that the power remains in the bill <e> <s> it is a widely-drawn clause and what might happen at some future date i hate to think <e> <s> however in view of what he has said i should like to look carefully and read what he has had to say in <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friend lord morris may i first say that i am wholly in sympathy with and i applaud the efforts being made by this government to control public expenditure and i supported my own government all last week in getting their crucial financial provisions through <e> <s> as i said during the second reading debate on this bill any proposal that aims as this one does to recover million of public expenditure must be looked at most carefully <e> <s> however i have to say that the more i look at this clause the less happy i feel about it and i share many of the misgivings voiced earlier and much more skilfully than i shall do by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> further to what the noble lord lord cledwyn has said the report by the advisory council for agriculture and horticulture the stain report for short made the recommendation that the present call-in procedure be strengthened to require the doe at maff request to call in any case where there is an unresolved agricultural objection to a planning proposal <e> <s> this was welcomed on all sides of the house when we debated it about months ago <e> <s> if i remember rightly the recommendation was accepted by the last government but so far this government have not reacted to it <e> <s> this amendment touched on the same point but is more limited in scope <e> <s> it is confined to maff objections in the case of the adoption of a local plan and so far as it goes i support it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for what my noble friends lord bellwin and viscount colville of culross have said <e> <s> i do not see why if the department of the environment goes to the trouble of listing a building it should not go to the trouble of finding out to whom it belongs <e>", "<cs> i really do not see why they should not be informed simply by publication <e> <s> i am a little disappointed but i will look at what has been said and will withdraw the amendment now with a view possibly to coming back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> acceptance by the government of this amendment will do a great deal to help restore the balance between the limit on land drainage expenditure and the penny rate product which was in danger of being upset <e>", "<cs> it seems to be splitting hairs to say that a man who goes out a year or two before he is pushed out is going voluntarily so i am glad that my <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have special reasons for expressing my pleasure in welcoming the debut of the noble earl lord halifax and in congratulating him on a first-rate speech <e> <s> as a small boy in yorkshire i held his grandfather in what amounted to veneration <e> <s> there was this great man ex-viceroy of india and foreign secretary about to carry out the vital task of ambassador in wartime washington who had the marvellous gift of talking to humble people with the same courtesy and on the same intellectual level as if he was speaking to his colleagues on the affairs of state <e> <s> he was just as happy discussing the behaviour of mussolini as the probable line of a fox <e> <s> in that connection i do not think that he would have appreciated the hedgeless countryside advocated by the noble lord lord walston <e>", "<cs> in supporting what my noble friend lord stanley of alderley has just said as regards penalties i must admit that from time to time i become consumed with fury and exasperation at the sight of young sycamores and beeches stripped of their bark and killed by grey squirrels <e> <s> when i make plans to replant these areas of hard woods that i thought i had got nicely established after and very often <e>", "<cs> i have made the point i do not intend to raise it again on clause <e>", "<cs> i share the concern of many noble lords that existing site protection may not be effective in preserving the dwindling number of places that provide habitats for wildlife species <e> <s> their concern is based on much knowledge and expertise especially that of my noble friend lord craigton and also on the amount of damage that is already reported to have taken place in declared sites <e> <s> that some damage has been done is not in dispute <e> <s> reluctantly i have to support the noble viscount lord thurso in saying that a contributory cause has in many cases been the failure of the nature conservancy council to provide information as to the nature of the conservation interest in many sites <e> <s> therefore i welcome the first of my noble friends series of amendments for what it will do to rectify that situation <e>", "<cs> i shall not pre-empt what my noble friend lord avon is going to say but the noble lord lord melchett really has not read clause <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble baroness lady david that there was nothing sinister about my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was simply to get better drafting which has now been achieved <e> <s> i am grateful to the government <e>", "<cs> i was not going to speak at any length to amendment no <e> <s> simply to say that the point raised by that amendment and amendments nos <e> <s> and would all be met by the governments amendment because it is a redrafting which would take them all into account <e>", "<cs> it must go in the face of all that is being said at present about the sentencing of criminals to create another offence carrying imprisonment having regard to the nature of the offence mentioned in the clause <e> <s> i think both sides of the committee are not saying that those who wilfully seek to destroy our heritage should not be hit hard <e> <s> they should be but i feel sure that a tine is more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my amendment deals specifically with orders under clause which is the slightly narrower point <e> <s> i am satisfied with the assurance that my noble friend has given that such restrictions are automatically land charges <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am enthusiastic about the protection of limestone pavements which i think is precisely what clause is all about <e> <s> i thought limestone pavements were small in extent belonging to a special area i think the noble lord lord winstanley said that and they are indeed sssis anyway <e>", "<cs> but in any case they will be protected by clause <e> <s> both the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord winstanley and that tabled by the noble lord lord inglewood refer to land in the countryside consisting substantially of limestone composed of lime near the surface of the ground <e> <s> well that applies to half of england <e> <s> one only has to think of the pennines the uplands of the derbyshire district the cotswolds the chilterns the downs north and south the yorkshire wolds and the lincolnshire wolds and you have most of england <e> <s> it is carrying matters a little far <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with what the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley is trying to do and i would not for a moment want to defend farmers who are wrecking limestone pavements in the way he suggested <e> <s> however i wonder whether there is a loophole because if the local planning authority found that a farmer was abusing paragraph of class vi of the general development order the simple remedy would surely to be put on an article direction <e>", "<cs> in the light of what my noble friend lord sandys has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest sympathy with these amendments which have been moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> the country landowners association has recently established a charitable trust with the principal object of encouraging and helping landowners to provide facilities for the mentally and physically handicapped to enjoy sport and recreation especially in the countryside <e> <s> these amendments are parallel with the aims of the clas charitable trust <e> <s> if these or similar amendments are made to the bill assuming that the trust is a success which it is anticipated that it will be co-operation between the nature conservancy council the countryside commission and the trust can be assured <e>", "<cs> i think i understand that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> but i really am not convinced <e> <s> why should not the secretary of state who has a function under every clause of part i have a section duty laid upon him for that part as it is he who exercises his function under the rest of the bill <e> <s> if it is to be argued that it is no part of the duty of the ncc to think about rural needs then i would perhaps ask him to look again at section which i did not quote in full which then laid the duty on what was then called the natural environment research council and which is now the ncc <e> <s> i think they too should have this duty <e> <s> i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a compelling speech condemning the government proposal and recommending what he calls the all-party one <e> <s> i should like to deal first with the uncontroversial part <e> <s> having deplored both at second reading and in committee the lack of any statutory duty on the ncc to inform the occupier or owner about the sssi on his land i need hardly say that i welcome the first two subsections of amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> that is especially so since the amendment lays a notification duty on the ncc not just for any new sites but for all existing ones as well <e> <s> we have repeatedly been given alarming statistics about damage to biological as distinct from geological sites and we have been told of the destruction of four key sites <e> <s> about half the damage is due to action by such bodies as internal drainage boards and i think we are told that the other half is due to damage by farming and forestry operations <e> <s> in the light of ncc past practice this is not very surprising <e>", "<cs> surely they can my lords <e> <s> i am looking on them as alternatives <e> <s> of course they could both be in the bill if the house so decided <e> <s> lord craigtons amendment does not take two factors sufficiently into account <e> <s> the first is the lively and growing awareness among farmers of public interest in the countryside <e> <s> this has been and will continue to be fostered by their own organisations as i have said in committee the national farmers union and the cla <e> <s> the countryside commission have also done a great deal of work <e> <s> this will continue to be fostered by the farming and wildlife advisory groups <e> <s> the other factor is the undoubted fact that one gets much better results from willing farmers than from coerced farmers <e> <s> i have had a long and happy experience of working with fellow farmers <e> <s> i know very well that while they can be led a long way one cannot push them one inch <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a restriction on land imposed by a clause order which depreciates the value of that land compensation should be paid accordingly <e> <s> this is a modest proposal <e> <s> in most examples of legislation where compensation for capital depreciation is made that compensation is payable when the restriction is made <e> <s> what my noble friend is suggesting is that compensation should not be payable then but later when there is a disposal <e> <s> i can think of two examples from the town and country planning act <e> <s> if an article direction is made which prevents a farmer from developing and if the value of his farm is thereby depreciated he can claim under the provisions of section of that act <e> <s> under section of that act if a farmer applies and is refused planning permission for say an agricultural building he can claim for consequent loss of capital value of his home <e> <s> he might have tried to get maximum potential out of say a hill farm by creating a dairy unit and his application for planning consent having been refused for the necessary cowsheds the value of that holding is pegged as a hill grazing farm under that section he can be compensated <e>", "<cs> the trouble my lords is that it is not the existing legislation that is at fault but its enforcement and in my view the existing legislation is adequate <e> <s> i am a farmer i have had sheep worried and i have been desperately worried about it but the amendment is too complicated and i do not agree with my noble friend lord stanley that legislation should be passed simply to bring something to the attention of the public <e> <s> if every time we wanted to bring something to the notice of the public we legislated about it we should be legislating eternally even more than we are at present <e>", "<cs> i understand very well why the actual wording of this amendment is not acceptable <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said by way of clarification of this paragraph <e> <s> i shall study carefully the assurances that he has given which will i think give grounds for confidence where it is much needed <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords months ago we debated at length part ii of the wildlife and countryside bill and this is not the time to repeat the arguments <e> <s> i am glad that this is the view of noble lords today <e> <s> broadly speaking however as my noble friend lord stanley has just reminded us owners and farmers agreed with the government that cooperation rather than coercion would be more effective in achieving good conservation <e> <s> after the enactment of the bill the cla was acutely aware that responsiblity for conservation lies as it always has done squarely on the shoulders of owners and occupiers <e> <s> it has therefore addressed itself in the past year to informing its members and reminding them of their continuing responsibilities <e> <s> my organisation was privileged to serve on the informal working party on this code of guidance and i am grateful to my noble friend lord avon for his kind remarks about this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has been kind enough to refer to the motion that i was intending to move next week and it is clear that we shared the idea that an agriculture debate would be timely <e> <s> therefore i welcome his motion today because it gives me the opportunity to say some of the things that i would have said next week <e> <s> i was heartened by the firm note struck by my noble friend lord ferrers and i hope to follow him in the same key when i say that the salient point i wish to make is that whatever the impact of modern farming methods and whatever the financial pressures the future of the land and the rural communities of the united kingdom depend upon the prosperity or otherwise of british agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i could support their policy without having thought very carefully about how it could be financed <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate as an opportunity to look at the long-term needs of the agricultural industry <e> <s> as the minister of agriculture recently said not enough attention is given to the long-term as opposed to short-term problems by the eec council of ministers <e> <s> i want to congratulate the committee on their report but i shall also have to be critical about some of their conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour and at this stage of the bill just about everything that could have been said about the measure and about land tenure in general has been said <e> <s> i shall therefore confine myself to picking up some of the criticisms that have been made <e> <s> i take first the point of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i did move that amendment about term tenancies <e> <s> as he knows very well agreement within the industry on that point was not possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about arbitrators arbitrating between a landlord and a sitting tenant <e> <s> in that event the bill says that he must disregard what in verbal shorthand we call the key money element which is appearing in offers because offers are included in that clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> my information is that they were very much in favour of the proposals <e> <s> another point that is crucial and one that has been raised several times tonight is will the bill if it is enacted create more tenancies <e> <s> during my presidency of the cla it was made clear to me that we had members who wanted to let their farms and who would do so given reasonable encouragement <e>", "<cs> during the debate on second reading i expressed the hope that if the critics of the bill were unhappy about the rent formula which is in the bill they would produce a better one <e> <s> today we are to consider what amounts to no fewer than three new formulae and many minor amendments to the one that is in the bill <e> <s> the first that we are being asked to look at concerns the two amendments to which my noble friend lord kinnoull has spoken <e> <s> although i do not think that the amendments of my noble friend and others are acceptable exactly as they stand i believe <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is right that the earning capacity if it is to be affected at all should be taken into consideration where conservation measures are in force but one of the decisions of the national farmers union and the country landowners association was to insert the words take into account all relevant factors which i believe is absolutely right <e> <s> i believe it to be a strong part of this part of the bill <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord stanley of alderley that surely this is one of the relevant factors but there must be a limit to the number of particular factors which are going to be spelled out the four main factors are spelled out otherwise one would go on for ever <e>", "<cs> would not the noble viscount agree that the scottish formula includes the word scarcity <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe is right to take out the bottom half of paragraph <e>", "<cs> we had a most interesting and expert speech on the second reading from the noble viscount and now we have this interesting new <e>", "<cs> i wondered what noble lords opposite would say in regard to the question whether this clause should stand part <e> <s> as one would have expected the noble lord lord bishopston spoke very moderately and with enormous experience again as one would expect <e> <s> he has asked the government to modify clause <e> <s> clause is crucial and i really do not think it could stand a great deal of modification <e> <s> i have kept quite quiet during the more than two hours we have been discussing clause but perhaps i might say a word <e> <s> despite the disbelief of noble lords opposite and despite their graphs the fact is that the act did have a profoundly adverse effect on the landlord-tenant system <e> <s> my noble friend lord stodart is quite right in saying so <e>", "<cs> the commercial unit test has indeed caused serious problems and conflicting decisions of the alts <e> <s> these amendments would deal with a number of unanswered questions <e> <s> as we have been reminded the policy of the act is to exclude close relatives from obtaining a succession tenancy where they have the advantage of a viable unit elsewhere <e> <s> by getting away from the difficult problems caused by having to decide whether an applicant is the occupier of a commercial unit and whether he is occupying it as a licensee only these amendments make the law clearer <e> <s> they also fulfil the policy of the act better by providing a livelihood test rather than an occupation test <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about subsection a is that it seems on the face of it to be enlarging the number of potential eligible successors to a holding on the death of a tenant <e> <s> yet as we know the broad intention of the act was to make ineligible for succession an applicant who is already the occupier of a viable holding <e> <s> if a unit is not to be judged a commercial one until it is capable of producing a net annual income of an amount not less than the average annual earnings earnings not wages of two full-time workers then there must surely fall outside the category of commercial units so defined a number of holdings that most people would consider perfectly viable <e>", "<cs> i was very interested to hear the remarks of the noble lord lord northfield and from what he said it is very clear why there is no unanimity in the industry at the moment <e> <s> i was absolutely delighted when i saw this amendment because i could understand it in a flash <e> <s> i did not have to spend half an hour on it as i have had to do with other amendments <e> <s> having said that i must tell my noble friend lord onslow that if he wants to provide for short term tenancies this is not the way to do it <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend distinguish between the public interest and the interest of the cla and the nfu <e>", "<cs> i share the noble lords disapproval of full repairing leases and i believe that i am supported in this by the vast majority of private landlords <e> <s> i am not quite clear about the tax point which the noble lord was making but i should like to make another tax point very briefly <e> <s> private landlords are under a taxation difficulty because if a private landlord can recover vat on his repairs expenditure he will be far more willing to do repairs <e> <s> landlords cannot recover vat but tenants can <e> <s> therefore landlords are more inclined to arrange with tenants that they should do their repairs <e> <s> but that is by the way <e>", "<cs> i could not agree more with the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> as my noble friend lord caithness has said this is a brand new amendment and i can only give a very hurried judgment and a very rapid reaction which is that it would not be welcomed by the industry at all <e> <s> certainly under the amendment the landlord could purchase a tenancy but landowners can do that now anyway if they want to buy out a tenant and the tenant agrees that can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is time that there was voiced some support for my noble friend lord belstead and for the government amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lord belstead has reminded us in recognition of the very long debate in committee he then undertook to consider some of the improvements that were proposed to see whether they could be incorporated in the bill without destroying the sense of the original formula that had been threshed out over such a long time and with such care by the cla and the nfu and despite what is frequently said to the contrary with valuable help from the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i say that i have found him a little difficult to follow <e> <s> i could not make out whether he was saying that because clause was complicated it should be abolished or whether he genuinely wants to put the clock back by saying we must keep succession provisions that came with the act for the benefit of the industry which is the only thing that can be inferred from this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i am being obtuse and if i am i know that my noble friend lord caithness will tell me so <e> <s> my memory of what he said at committee stage is not what it should be but how does he distinguish between bad management and bad husbandry <e> <s> the two would seem to be very close and the distinction between them must be very narrow <e> <s> if under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords for the first time this evening i find myself entirely in agreement with the noble lord lord john-mackie about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i never did believe that one should push someone out just because he was but the nearer i get to that age the more strongly i feel about it <e> <s> i do not think one should <e> <s> it is logical to suggest that if people are to be pushed out because they are there should <e>", "<cs> my lords i very well understand what noble lords opposite are trying to achieve by this amendment but i have some sympathy with them though in his jaundiced view of this bill and in the matter of the achievement of my noble friend lord belstead i am in total disagreement with the noble lord lord john-mackie <e>", "<cs> the reason which until now the government have given for presenting to private operators new and as the noble lord lord howard has said quite exceptional rights over land is that they want to simplify and speed up the procedures for obtaining telecommunications services <e> <s> that is an intention that we would all applaud but and i agree with the noble lord lord howard the method proposed in the bill is heavy-handed and i am rather surprised that the present government should be advocating it <e> <s> i therefore support the noble lord lord howard in what he is seeking to achieve by his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this amendment will be acceptable to the house but before that is determined and before we leave clause i may i say that clause of the bill as originally drafted received a good deal of criticism <e> <s> the noble lord lord thornycroft has forcefully reminded us of that <e> <s> we have spent very nearly an hour discussing clause on third reading <e> <s> since the clause was discussed at great length in committee on nd november last the government have amply fulfilled their promise to search for a revision of the rent formula which could have a greater measure of agreement <e> <s> again i can only congratulate the noble lord lord belstead and his department upon achieving what i believe to be the desired result after thorough consultation <e> <s> it is never easy indeed it is probably impossible to make everybody happy <e> <s> as i said at second reading it is exceedingly difficult to find a really good rent formula because what is needed is a rent formula which is acceptable to all sides landlords tenants arbitrators land agents institutional clients and the government <e> <s> i believe that with the amendments which have been made to this clause by the house as a result of those consultations we have now got a formula in which all concerned can have confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not plan to speak but the noble lord lord john-mackie has just paid me some compliments for which i thank him <e> <s> however i am not sure that i am too happy about them because i must say to your lordships that i do not accept in any way whatever that i have been trying during the passage of the bill in your lordships house to undermine the common view that was reached by our industry as a whole as to how to rescue the landlord/tenant system and the recommendations that were made by the industry to government <e> <s> if i have done anything during the passage of this bill i have endeavoured to increase their effectiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is impingeing on the governments response to the debate in committee which followed the amendment of the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe so perhaps it will be better if i reserve what i have to say until we come to amendment no <e> <s> ba <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has just reminded us in committee the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe drew your lordships attention to the shortcomings of the schedule code which governs the acquisition by licensed operators of rights over land <e> <s> as my noble friend has also just reminded us in doing so the noble lord lord howard received strong support from all sides of the committee <e> <s> he withdrew his amendments on a promise by my noble friend lord glenarthur that the government would try to improve the code in order so far as possible to meet our objections <e> <s> this long series of amendments is the result <e>", "<cs> my lords because the happening on the north yorkshire moors to which my noble friend lord onslow referred was in my part of the world i am unable to resist the temptation to begin my speech by referring to it <e> <s> the story makes good copy <e> <s> i was amused to see it in kenneth roses column in the <e>", "<cs> my lords earning capacity is expressed in these amendments as being related to the productive capacity of the holding and it is particularly defined in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as we have just been reminded the question of earning capacity was discussed in the house at the report stage and the view was then taken that it was not necessary to include it in the bill <e> <s> however i can see that there might be cases when the full productive capacity of a farm might not be capable of being realised through for example the operation of some quota mechanism <e> <s> there might be a farm with a good potato-growing potential but where the tenant could not obtain a basic acreage allotment from the potato marketing board and in that case the earning capacity might not match the productive capacity of the farm <e> <s> therefore my own view is that this amendment is acceptable <e>", "<cs> before we finish may i from this side of the house add my comments to those of the noble lord lord northfield who a few minutes ago expressed gratitude for the drafting work done in respect of clause and its related schedule <e> <s> the agricultural industry as a whole should be grateful to the noble lord to his department and to the draftsmen for the immense amount of work that has gone into the drafting of the whole of the bill and the very many amendments <e> <s> it is enough to ask for certain things to be put into a bill but it is quite another issue to express those matters properly in legal form <e> <s> the great length and the complexity of these amendments are sufficient witness <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many noble lords wishing to speak so i too will confine myself to the red report <e> <s> may i first join other noble lords in paying tribute to the select committee on agriculture and the environment on producing a balanced report which is a constructive one in that it makes a series of recommendations for amending the european commissions draft regulation which it was their task to examine <e> <s> secondly i was grateful to the noble baroness lady white for what she kindly said about the cla <e> <s> having finished my presidential term last october i can claim no personal credit for the initiative that they are now undertaking but certainly while i was in the saddle we were working on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i share the worry expressed by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran about the fact that the provisions dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting from the bill itself when i said that the main purpose of the bill is to repeal the provisions of the two acts <e> <s> the bill contains six clauses to deal with that and two to deal with the other matter <e> <s> as we have heard the fund was set up under the mineral workings act to finance the restoration of worked land and to make grants for drainage and other works necessary to bring the land back into agricultural and forestry use <e> <s> contributions to the fund were made jointly by the landowners the treasury and the mineral operators <e> <s> technically the restoration of land that had been stripped of its soil and then worked for iron ore presented owners with all sorts of problems some of which as i think the noble baroness lady birk said may not be fully overcome by the proposed cut-off date <e> <s> nevertheless it is my understanding that the owners while accepting that the purposes of the fund to which they have contributed over the years have broadly been fulfilled have been anxious to ensure that the government were fully aware of the inherently unstable nature of restored land <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord craigavon in moving this amendment has justified it by reference to its intended effect on the urban scene <e> <s> i must say that i have a good deal of sympathy with what he said but i propose to follow the noble lord lord mackie of benshie by dealing with its possible effect on agriculture and i am afraid that in that context i am not in sympathy with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were in committee i explained at some length why i was worried about bringing into this bill the question of compensation where article directions might be made affecting development in the countryside and i should say in parenthesis that i am glad therefore that amendment no <e> <s> has been drafted so as to refer to directions made solely in the urban context <e> <s> but the amendment of my noble friend lord sandford to take it at its face value refers to possible directions in an agricultural context albeit within the boundaries of a national park <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken to this amendment so far because in contrast to some of my noble friends i accept that the basis of this bill is that compensation should be paid only when the landowner has begun to incur expenditure on the basis of the development order permission before it is taken away <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> what i do not accept as a reason for resisting the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd is that landowners are likely to submit claims for compensation for schemes that they have no intention whatever of carrying out <e> <s> i do not accept that as a good reason for resisting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord moran for giving way <e> <s> would he acknowledge that during the war east yorkshire to which he referred was used as a training area by no less than five armoured divisions <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned hedges but under those circumstances is it not remarkable that there are any hedges left at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the initiative which led to the promotion of this bill in another place especially for what it seeks to achieve by clause <e> <s> i confess that i find clause extremely difficult to interpret but the fact that it has been drafted at the behest of the doe is proof that the government are fully aware of the need to give better protection to sites of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my memory of when more than four years ago we were debating the principal act is that we debated section and the schedule that went with it at considerable length <e> <s> your lordships thoroughly approved of section and thoroughly approved of the composition of the schedule because within it were a number of birds that were all to a greater or lesser degree engaged in the struggle for survival and the section gave them that extra little help in their struggle <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some experience in strategic planning affecting metropolitan areas and districts in that for about years i was a member of one of the economic planning councils set up by the labour government in i think <e> <s> we had planning functions and duties very similar to those that are being set up for london by the government <e> <s> we had to advise government on a strategic plan for the region that we covered and we had to advise the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord belstead has told the house that the government do not wish to spend money on investment aid that might encourage more and more production <e> <s> that seems highly sensible <e> <s> our own government alas have been able to do very little about ec support prices which have led to surplus production but in their efforts to reduce public expenditure they did economise and are economising on grant aid for investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the privilege of sitting on the committee of the noble lord lord plowden having myself a direct interest in farming <e> <s> it is getting late so i should like to make my brief contribution to this debate by concentrating on the cereals section of the report where the problem is summed up in three short sentences on which i should like to base my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what the noble lord lord gallacher and my noble friends have said tonight about the matter in appendix of the report i would like briefly to intervene in order to reinforce their view of its importance <e> <s> they have referred to the chain of events leading up to a decision at the council of ministers to ban the use of the three natural hormones in meat production <e> <s> we have heard how that decision stemmed from an october vote in the european parliament <e> <s> the select committee as the noble lord lord gallacher has told us wisely in my view agreed to make no recommendation on what in mid-december was a new turn of events without full scientific evidence for the reasons which the noble lord lord gallacher set out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord radnor has referred to the price mechanism and has made it his first choice as a tool for the reform of the cap and the select committee has consistently recommended that the build-up of farm surpluses would best be controlled through the price mechanism <e> <s> we say this again in each of the three reports that we are debating tonight <e> <s> in the report on cereals we reiterate the advantages of a restrictive price policy and they were identified in last years report on the reform of the cap <e> <s> they are set out in paragraph and i will not repeat them <e>", "<cs> my lords had we been discussing this bill as it was after its committee stage in another place it would have had my unqualified support but as my noble friend lord belstead reminded us in his clear introduction the new clause and its -page schedule of unbelievable complexity were inserted into the bill at report stage <e> <s> it could not be examined in committee but was debated one evening on the final day of its passage through the commons on th april <e>", "<cs> my lords the need to increase the powers of the police to control assemblies which make use of land in ways which constitute risks of public disorder is a long-standing one and i listened with <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what was said and particularly to what was said by my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> it is quite clear that we are agreed all of us about the principle of compensation <e> <s> where the committee is in disagreement is as to what shall be the <e>", "<cs> i understand that you cannot pay large sums for quota divorced from land <e> <s> it you are buying land with a quota on it i take it that you pay the market value for that land having regard to the size of the quota on it <e> <s> i think it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> i think that it is not just the above average tenant who is going to get compensation <e> <s> if my noble friend will assure me that he will look at the matter again and come back at a later stage i will withdraw the amendment but if there is a real difficulty between us i am afraid i must ask the committee to decide <e>", "<cs> i can understand that from my noble friend in the nfu <e> <s> we must get right the matter of the milk quota and i do not think we can do that by tinkering with what is in the bill <e> <s> my way is the better way to do it <e>", "<cs> when speaking to the last amendment my noble friend lord stodart said that he thought that he had understood the gist of what my noble friend lord stanley was trying to do with it <e> <s> i think i understand very well the gist of what he is trying to do <e> <s> he must have had his tongue in his cheek when he spoke <e> <s> the key part of my noble friends amendment is to be found in paragraph <e> <s> let us be reminded that the basic fact is that the lower the standard quota the higher the compensation that has to be paid to the outgoing tenant by the landlord and finally by the incomer <e>", "<cs> that is a different point <e> <s> i am surprised that my noble friend lord stanley should put forward this amendment <e> <s> let us not forget that there are two tenants affected by compensation <e> <s> there is the outgoer and the incomer <e> <s> the greater the compensation to the outgoer the more the incomer will have to pay to get into the tenancy <e> <s> if the nuf favours the amendment i should have thought it would do well to think of those members who are likely to be incomers <e> <s> this amendment should be opposed <e>", "<cs> i think that had my amendment been approved by the committee schedule would have fallen <e> <s> clearly as the committee did not agree to my amendment schedule must remain part of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly add my support from a slightly different angle <e> <s> it seems to me that the thinking behind the amendment is very much in line with the efforts which the european commission is making to devise schemes to encourage the diversification of agriculture in the community away from the production of commodities now in surplus <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gallacher will know very well they have made draft proposals to give effect to a package of socio-structural measures to re-orientate agricultural production in conjunction with the cap price fixing <e> <s> one proposal is to modify the marketing and processing grant regulation / to encourage alternative production by providing enhanced assistance and allowing individual projects not falling within existing investment programmes to be aided <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is getting a great deal of encouragement <e> <s> as i read <e>", "<cs> my lords it obviously depends to whom in the tenant farmers association you speak <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it they would be against any arbitrary apportionment because it would be wrong in nearly every case <e> <s> it would take no account of the reality of the contribution of the parties <e> <s> if a milk quota must be carved up the method prescribed by the government though hideously complicated provides for more flexibility in the assessment of compensation than does an arbitrary apportionment such as lurks in subsection l <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord de la warr pointed out both at second reading and again today one would think that a milk quota where it remains firmly attached to the land is a restriction on production and in itself a thing of no value <e> <s> but the fact is that milk quotas are being traded <e> <s> there are devices by which this is being done <e> <s> they have acquired a value and we have heard this several times this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important that proper account should be taken of the fixed equipment when considering the average number of hectares which could be expected to have been used for the feeding of dairy cows <e> <s> i believe that this amendment would improve schedule and i support it <e> <s> but that support is slightly qualified by my saying that perhaps i would have preferred to have seen these words placed in paragraph on page <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment takes away the ministers duty to prescribe the amount of milk to be taken as the average yield per hectare <e> <s> it seeks to prescribe in statute in how much the average yield per hectare should be for evermore <e> <s> that seems to be the basic objection to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stanley has referred to some real problems <e> <s> i welcome the fact that he has moved these amendments because my noble friend on the front bench said at second reading that the government would look into the question of whether any change was required in the law on trespass <e> <s> these amendments will surely give him an opportunity to give a clear indication of the governments thinking either now or at a later stage <e> <s> therefore i welcome these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord belstead has reminded us he gave an undertaking to the noble earl lord peel that if tenants have not notified their landlords they will not have their application for inclusion in an esa accepted <e> <s> at report stage my noble friend said he was prepared to consider whether the government might write that requirement into the bill <e> <s> that is what has been done <e> <s> clause is thereby much improved <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that noble lords will be too disappointed if this amendment provides them with the last occasion on which they can discuss compensation for milk quotas this session and indeed perhaps beyond this session <e> <s> i thought the house had decided after many different methods had been proposed debated and rejected that the governments way of calculating the amount of compensation payable to a retiring tenant for his milk quota was the best way or at any rate the least unsatisfactory way <e> <s> that is the method set out in schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford talked about the conflict and alienation that took place in the south-west as a result of the invasion as if it were the fault of the police <e> <s> he can have no conception of the conflict and alienation caused by that mass trespass <e> <s> the argument which is being used by the noble lord lord mishcon and to some extent by the noble lord lord gifford relates to whether the courts and the court procedure are adequate to deal with mass trespass <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a strong reason for supporting the noble lord lord gallacher tonight because as a member of the select committee on the european communities i had the pleasure of serving on the sub-committee which produced this report under the chairmanship of the noble lord <e> <s> i should also like to say how delighted i am that the noble duke the duke of somerset will be speaking on this matter <e> <s> he has recently joined the sub-committee of the noble lord lord gallacher which now has the advantage of his practical knowledge of land management <e> <s> we look forward to listening to his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first join the noble lord lord gallacher in saying how much i look forward to hearing the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> he is a very successful farmer and i know that what he has to say tonight and on future occasions will receive your lordships close attention <e> <s> his knowledge and experience will be of much value to proceedings in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be said that it is not very easy to form a judgment on the latest proposals of the european commission to curb community expenditure while negotiations are still proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords as a taxpayer i understand the chancellors case for taking forestry out of the income tax system <e> <s> as a timber grower i believe that the case has been so well put by other noble lords that i can merely echo them in saying to the government that if they wish to keep the private sector viable let alone expanding at the rate envisaged in their statements of last year they should not remove one form of subsidy without very careful consideration as to what to put in its place <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord mason of barnsley and endorse his statement that what we are asking for is a confirmation of the pattern of taxation affecting the breeding and rearing of horses that up to last year was accepted and agreed by successive governments for nearly half a century <e> <s> we are asking the government to put sense into a situation where at present there is no sense <e> <s> this implies no criticism indeed i would not dare so to criticize of the decision in the <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the noble lord lord mason will say <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord lord rippon <e> <s> i am glad that the government are willing to look at the matter it is excellent <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness referred to the fact that there is no intention of asking for the exclusion from rating of such establishments as training stables riding schools and so on <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mason has said we are very much concerned with the agricultural side of the horsebreeding enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords it was agreed when the rating of buildings used for keeping and breeding horses was discussed in committee that this was a complicated question <e> <s> as we have just been reminded the decision in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly reassured by my noble friends statement that a revaluation could not be backdated more than months except in certain circumstances <e> <s> in view of that explanation and his technical criticism of the amendment i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever else it was the commissions set-aside scheme agreed by the european council last february was never intended to be a major instrument for reform of the cap and hence its relatively small community budget provision <e> <s> at best the commission estimated that community cereal production might be reduced by million tonnes which would just about balance the annual increase in corn yields attributable to improved production techniques <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gallacher has given such a lucid account of our report that i wish merely to expand on the first of our conclusions set out on page <e> <s> it is the one on which my noble friend lord stanley of alderley has concentrated <e> <s> i find myself in close accord with him in what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords when we reported on the farm price proposals in april last year we summarised the difficulties involved in reducing the expense of the common agricultural policy arising out of surplus production by saying <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate i believe that all the arguments on the main issues have been heard <e> <s> i shall confine what i have to say to one or two conservation points <e> <s> i am prompted to do that by having served for the past three years on the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i dare say that it will not be totally unexpected if i refer to parts of the bill that worry farmers <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the basic issue which is raised by the two amendments is the element of treasury control if any which should remain over the regulation of the water industry <e> <s> as he has also explained the question <e>", "<cs> as an owner of a private supply which is piped from springs emerging not from my noble friends fens but from the yorkshire chalk i know something of the benefits of such a system <e> <s> i also know something of the problems <e> <s> i agree wholeheartedly with the duty which clause lays upon the local authority to supervise the adequacy and the quality of private water supplies <e> <s> i further agree that there should be remedial powers <e> <s> however as my noble friend explained subsection enables the local authority to charge the cost of remedying a faulty supply not only to the owner of the premises but also the owner or occupier of the land where the source is situated <e>", "<cs> i join with the noble lord and the noble baroness who have just spoken in expressing anxiety regarding clause a <e> <s> i agree that it would not be right for a water undertaker to use this clause to vary its charges by making in the words of the bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stanley has raised some extremely interesting and technical questions in moving his amendment <e> <s> it might be appropriate now if i speak to the governments amendments that is amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e>", "<cs> i do not see why individual owners and occupiers who are going to be affected by an order should not be told <e> <s> i see no practical reason why they should not be written to <e> <s> if that nature conservancy council can do it where nature reserves and ssis are concerned it could be done in this case <e> <s> the name and address of every occupier of a holding is known <e> <s> as my noble friend has said those people whose livelihoods may be severely affected ought to be told if only as a matter of administrative good manners <e>", "<cs> on second reading i referred to the particular concern of the nature conservancy council about which the noble lord lord moran has just reminded us <e> <s> the situation is that there are numerous stretches of river in various parts of the country where the flow is considerably less than is needed to maintain a healthy river with a reasonable fish population <e> <s> i prefer this amendment to amendment no <e> <s> and also to that in the name of the noble lord lord moran amendment no <e> <s> a because i do not believe that it is necessary to review all licences but only those in special areas where there are flow problems <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady blatch referred to compensation <e> <s> as i understand it section of the water resources act provides that where a licence is revoked or varied the licence <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the great trouble which my noble friend the minister has taken in his reply <e> <s> however i am disappointed <e> <s> the precautions i recommended are of a very modest nature and do no more than provide the most elementary safeguards against arbitrary land acquisition by commercial companies <e> <s> i must confess i am slightly surprised that my noble friend has resisted them <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful for my noble friends very full reply <e> <s> i am sorry that this should take up the committees time but as my noble friend has said it is a very important point and it is not my fault that this is happening at quarter to three in the morning <e>", "<cs> i believe that the water companies would find it a great deal easier to get their work done under the suggestions that i made <e> <s> however i shall study very carefully what my noble friend said and i shall perhaps return to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving that undertaking <e> <s> it would be an advantage and helpful if a direction were to be supplemented by a circular giving more details to local authorities <e> <s> my noble friend has also said that he will consult the relevant interests about the direction and i hope about a circular as well <e> <s> that being so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue is very simple namely whether the water companies should remain the only public utilities with compulsory powers to enter land or premises through which pipes are to run <e> <s> there is nothing new in saying that they should not and this amendment says that they should not except in emergencies or in special circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to focus briefly on a special problem which was highlighted in a debate in another place on th june when an amendment to this bill was proposed at the report stage <e> <s> the amendment sought to alleviate the acute shortage of low-cost housing in rural areas <e> <s> it is beyond dispute that it is becoming increasingly difficult for wage earners living and working in such areas to find a house that they can afford <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords who have spoken have been most kind in the reception which they have given this report <e> <s> if it has merit then it is in great part due to the extremely able and conscientious work of our clerk and to the invaluable help of our specialist adviser professor syers <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister and several other noble lords referred to irradiation which is a food processing technique at present not allowed in this country except in special cases where a sterile diet is required in hospitals <e> <s> i understand from what the minister said that it is the governments intention to bring forward regulations allowing food irradiation as soon as this bill is agreed by parliament <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount reminded us the irradiation of foodstuffs is a subject that has come under close scrutiny by your lordships select committee on the european communities <e> <s> sub-committee d which i have the great privilege of chairing has carried out an inquiry into two european commission draft directives which are aimed at harmonising the conditions under which food might in future be irradiated in the community <e> <s> as we heard during the second reading debate it is in line with these proposals that the government intend to legalise food irradiation in this country and to bring in regulations under this clause for regulating the process <e> <s> the select committees report was published last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> several of them have suggested that there remains an element of uncertainty about the effects of irradiation <e> <s> that may be so but perhaps your lordships should consider what is certain <e> <s> what is certain is that outbreaks of food poisoning are multiplying yearly <e> <s> modern mass-produced food can be very unsafe <e> <s> as we say in our report up to per cent <e> <s> of uncooked untreated chicken carcases contain salmonella or listeria or both <e> <s> that is certain <e> <s> recently a number of people in holland died after eating untreated prawns <e> <s> that is certain <e> <s> those are the kind of certainties that must be considered when making a judgment about whether a very thoroughly researched process should be adopted in aid of food safety and the judgment that the select committee came to is summarised in paragraph <e> <s> i am sorry that some noble lords are unhappy with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak to the motion that this house takes note of the report of the european communities committee on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> at this stage i should merely like to say how grateful i am for the way in which our report <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other speakers in congratulating my noble friend lord stanley on bringing the matter to the attention of your lordships <e> <s> the chief problem facing tenant farmers is that there is little land available for rent <e> <s> as the noble lord lord john-mackie reminded us the tenanted sector is becoming smaller <e> <s> in the proportion of tenanted land by area was per cent <e> <s> but it is now only per cent <e> <s> therefore during the past years efforts have been made to support the landlord and tenant system <e> <s> however it is my view that the efforts have been unsuccessful because successive governments believed that that support could be given by legislative control <e>", "<cs> my lords the first time i spoke in your lordships house was during the second reading of the local government bill in <e> <s> i was probably out of order in being strongly critical of the proposal to abolish the east riding of yorkshire and to create a new county of humberside astride the humber <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i should point out that i said that that concept was totally out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank those noble lords and noble baronesses who have spoken in the debate and i am grateful to them for their general acceptance of the recommendations in the report <e> <s> if the report has merit then as i have said when moving debates on similar reports in the past it is due in great part to the assiduity of members of sub-committee d in obtaining relevant information from our excellent witnesses it is due to the many individuals and bodies who tendered written evidence and it is due as i said earlier to the skill and hard work of our clerk his specialist assistant and our specialist adviser <e>"]
