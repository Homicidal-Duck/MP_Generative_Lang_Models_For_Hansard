["<cs> i wish to associate myself with what the noble lord lord hale said at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> i am not sure whether i detected rightly a movement or a stirring by the government front bench towards the amendment of the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> i being a real tyro in your lordships house as the noble lord lord hale characterised himself modestly but wrongly will certainly not make a long speech <e>", "<cs> yes of course i am aware of that and i said so <e> <s> i took part in the division when the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts was in the noble lords place <e>", "<cs> i thought that it was wrong then and i think that this government are wrong now <e> <s> i have a curious personal reason for being interested in this whole matter <e> <s> my great great uncle sir arthur gordon who was a colonial governor in the th century from the full vigour of his thirties until he retired years later was in trinidad mauritius fiji new zealand the western pacific territories and ceylon <e> <s> to use the stuffy language of years ago he sought to adopt as his guiding principle that superior persons should not impose their will on inferior persons <e> <s> it seems to me that that principle is not being observed <e> <s> after sir arthur gordon retired secured a peerage and came to your lordships house as the first lord stanmore he seemed to forget about those principles because he was then one of the very few people who knew even where ocean island was <e> <s> i dare say that he advised the knowledgeable gentleman who found that the island was very rich in phosphate <e> <s> furthermore it is no good saying that he did not have a personal interest in it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble baroness quite understood what i said <e> <s> the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts insisted on rejecting the amendment in the last parliament when we had a labour government <e> <s> the labour party believes in social democracy <e> <s> the conservative party looks as though it does the same it believes in individual freedom <e> <s> that is what i meant <e>", "<cs> my lords is not relocation which is a pretty horrible word in itself this year absolutely out of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he would be prepared to bequeath his caskets to the national trust for scotland and to stipulate that they should be put on view at haddo house <e>", "<cs> my lords is their not a fundamental mistake here <e> <s> the noble baroness and others who have exchanged question and answer with her seem to connote blindness with partial deafness <e> <s> surely if one can have an aid to hearing on the telephone the radio and the television this means that one is partially deaf <e> <s> is not the equivalent of the treatment given out to the blind the treatment that might be given to those who are totally deaf <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as somebody who worked on the staff of the bbc for years that is to say one year for every language service if the proposed cuts are carried through <e> <s> i did not work in the external broadcasting services but i was very closely associated with them and i know a great deal about their operations and how they carry them through <e> <s> i started in the monitoring service and worked in the central secretariat the domestic radio talks and documentary departments and always there was a continual traffic to and fro between these different units <e> <s> i think it is fair to observe that sensible people managers programme staff administrators the organisers of schedules and the operational staff in the studios know jolly well whether they are getting more resources year by year in the way of capital improvements or less <e> <s> there is no doubt at all as both the noble lord lord crowther-hunt and the noble lord lord hill of luton pointed out with much greater force than i can that the danger of the cuts and the delays in capital resources being employed are very damaging to the morale of the staff and this is not the way to get quality of programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be the case if what the noble lord has just said is true that the marbles should go back to turkey and not to greece at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it would be fair to throw into the balance of all the figures that are being produced the extent of the real increase in farmers income since the present government came to office <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give a practical answer to a question without saying that this is not a matter for the government but a matter for british rail <e> <s> in the circumstances of the dismissal of the driver workforce which is a possibility and their subsequent re-engagement can the noble lord say how this will affect the pension rights of those men and subsequent redundancy agreements should that occur <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this is a very important point in terms of modern labour relations and an unembittered workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question for information <e> <s> i am not trying to get at anybody <e> <s> is any part of local government expenditure on the proper maintenance and repair of rural roads and back streets in urban areas subject to grant or is that expenditure entirely a charge on the local rates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise a point of information with the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> i entirely agree with his amendment and with what the noble baroness lady birk has said but there seems to be an interchangeability between the phrases knowledge of and experience in <e> <s> the amendment refers to knowledge of <e> <s> i know a lot about local government <e> <s> i have done for years <e> <s> for journalistic and practical reasons when i was on the staff of the cpre before the war and this has persisted ever since but i have never had experience of working in local government <e> <s> which does the amendment mean <e> <s> does it wish to be more definite <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> if one of these persons with other qualifications has experience in or knowledge of local government up to the level i have how is anyone to test that <e> <s> i shall be satisfied if i can have a reply to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with both noble earls and speak from the point of view of somebody who may want the services of this body <e> <s> i happen to be a trustee owner only of a ruinous castle in scotland of some notoriety <e> <s> it has not status at all <e> <s> under the present system i look down the list of different bodies and do not know which one is the right one to go to <e> <s> under this proposed new arrangement i would <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ask the noble lord lord jenkins of putney whether his fear that the population of this country might need to be evacuated could be averted if the soviet union were offered bases for their nuclear weapons in this country as well as the americans and our own <e>", "<cs> my lords on a slightly different point about this whole matter is it not ignominious to the legitimate local weekly press that such organs should be called newspapers universally when they are in fact giveaway sheets <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware that in my own area they have already killed off the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how much of the amount of grant paid was for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we hear too much these days about the price of art and not quite enough about the value of it <e> <s> it may seem that the price is merely factual whereas the value is controversial and that would land me in a spot <e> <s> but in fact it is the prices that are eccentric capricious and sometimes idiotic going up and down like a yo-yo as they follow the dictates of ephemeral fashion <e> <s> the value of art on the other hand is to do with the eternal verities <e> <s> a human being is an aesthetic creature before he is an ethical one <e> <s> the singer robert tear said to me recently <e> <s> art and artistic utterance is an imperative of the human condition <e> <s> he added a note of caution that of course artists need money but that sponsorship could be both liberator and gaoler <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had a lifelong enthusiasm for the railways although not being quite such a buff as the noble viscount lord buckmaster <e> <s> nevertheless i started with toy trains in the nursery and worked up through scale models <e> <s> i would spend long vigils photographing those thumping great steam locomotives travelling at speed <e> <s> years later steam was replaced by diesel on the great western line as i choose still to call it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> most of the people who are affected by parking regulations are those in the service industries electricians plumbers and so on <e> <s> they can obtain permission from police districts but often they have to answer emergency calls from outside those districts <e> <s> how are they to avoid fines and clamping which at the moment beset them in order to carry out their emergency calls properly and efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords we have talked a great deal about money for the arts <e> <s> i shall talk entirely about museums and galleries <e> <s> these should be kept in the manner to which they should be accustomed <e> <s> however this requires vision and prescience as well as money <e>"]
