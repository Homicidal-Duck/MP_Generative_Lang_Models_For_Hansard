noble friend lord craigton said the greater horseshoe bat will then be exterminated in england <e> <s> if the bats are there already surely a new owner when he buys that property must take on board

extremely cumbersome and takes a long time to get its way through and work itself out <e> <s> it appears that this machinery is enshrined in the transport act <e> <s> if that is the case and if the machinery is as inefficient as it is said to be can my noble friend look into the possibility of reforming the act to make sure that it is an encumbrance no longer <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend this one question <e> <s> i do not think anybody could be more moving than the noble lord lord mishcon on the subject of a deprived -year-old from an inner city background from an inarticulate one-parent family who is being deprived or not having proper legal representation <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne said that it was a question of money <e> <s> he said quite openly and honestly that he did not quite know how many people had applied for legal aid in this context <e> <s> i just wonder how much would be involved <e> <s> i do not think it could involve all that much compared to the legal aid budget <e> <s> surely as the noble lord lord mishcon has said there are people who could happily be deprived of legal aid rather than those of whom we are all thinking in this case <e>", "<cs> children change so much between the ages of and which is the span of time about which vie are talking that it would seem to me to be only natural justice that this review should be mandatory <e> <s> for the sake of argument let us assume that people say they always no it there is nothing that concentrates the mind more than being told you have to do it once a year rather than saying yes we ought to do it but we do not have the time <e> <s> i know that one is talking of the extreme case but the thought of a child of being sent away under a care order for some minor criminal offence and not coming out until he is is a very much longer time in custody than is normally handed out to anyone but the most serious adult criminals <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e> <s> i should like to put this to your lordships in spite of the glances of the chief whip <e> <s> let us assume for the sake of argument that some money could actually be saved by a judicial review in other words children would be released from care orders <e> <s> has that sort of sum been done against the resource argument <e> <s> of course i agree that we have got to be very careful with resources but the point is that if a child of can stay inside for eight years for nicking an apple that is an indictment of a civilised country <e> <s> of course that is something which will not happen very frequently but it has only to happen once and we should then all hang our heads in shame <e>", "<cs> the suspended sentence has on occasion added to the increase in the number of people in prison <e> <s> i strongly suspect and i think we are all talking from a hunch here because the evidence points both ways that with a partially suspended sentence it is possible that a man or woman who goes to prison for a very short time will really know that he does not want to go back <e> <s> whereas with a totally suspended sentence he may not quite have the conception of what it is like may commit another misdemeanour and then have to serve the sentence which has been suspended and the sentence which is then passed on him <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to support the amendment because it seems that there are two factors which we ought to bear in mind <e> <s> first in a slight form this provision already exists in northern iceland <e> <s> i presume that what is good for the northern irish is good enough for the english <e> <s> sometimes we have doubts on this <e>", "<cs> i accept that it is a half sentence in northern ireland but we are in fact <e>", "<cs> there has been a lot of criticism in the newspapers that lifers get out after nine years and i believe that the average time before the release of life sentence prisoners is nine years <e> <s> if that is the case this seems an unnecessary amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend lord elton when he does the resource implication and it is important to consider that presumably if or people are let out earlier this will in food alone cost the prison service less <e> <s> could what you are saving on the one hand not be pushed over to the probation service on the other hand which would have a more healthy effect <e> <s> what people say about overcrowding is in the prisons is obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether my noble friend saw in <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one small point which i should like to suggest to your lordships <e> <s> at first i thought what a good idea to have a curfew <e> <s> how sensible <e> <s> but one has listened very carefully to the arguments and one is persuaded that the points which are against it such as unenforceability probably make it unacceptable <e> <s> i should like to suggest that this will introduce a certain amount of class feeling into punishment in that a child from a middle-class home or a well-off home will be more likely to have a curfew order put on it and the parents will have a greater ability to look after the child than one from a less well-off or less privileged home <e> <s> if two children are going out to commit some yobbery and one of them comes from a bad or a poor home and gets a more serious sentence than a child who comes from a better class of home then there will be an air of injustice and privilege which will do the law and respect for the law no good at all <e> <s> instinctively i thought what a good idea <e> <s> but on listening to the arguments i am not at all sure it is a good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise for a moment to support my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> he has surely acknowledged that there was something which we were all very worried about at committee stage <e> <s> i remember drawing a slightly exaggerated possibility of what could happen to a -year old locked up for ever <e> <s> if my noble friend has said as he has said that he recognises that we are probably or possibly call it what you will in breach of the european convention on human rights and has promised that he will bring in legislation as early as possible and i would suggest that it would be appropriate legislation to be brought into this house first because there will be nothing controversial in it we should give him all the support we can to let him produce that legislation and resist this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give an undertaking that the government realise that it is quite intolerable for it to be legal to go in this way and sit on the end of the bed of anybody at all in this kingdom and not to commit an offence <e> <s> this appears to be what has happened somebody has gone and sat on the end of the sovereigns bed and has not been prosecuted <e> <s> i find that a quite extraordinary state of affairs <e> <s> it is an extraordinary state of the law that anybody can go and sit on someone elses bed at seven oclock in the morning without being invited to go there i hasten to add and i find this an intolerable state of affairs <e> <s> would my noble friend please make sure that we look at this matter very urgently and very rapidly in order to make sure that it comes within the criminal law as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one small thing <e> <s> obviously i support this amendment <e> <s> i have my name to it <e> <s> my noble friend lord fortescue says that it will put an extra strain on the probation service <e> <s> even if there is an extra strain on them the probation service have said they like the idea <e> <s> the lack of strain or the release of strain on the prison service will outweigh any extra strain that might be put on the probation service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords from the bottom of my heart may i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that a certain amount of worry had been expressed to me that the army would have to make a great deal of extra effort to keep some of these wounded soldiers from the falkland islands with the colours that they were worried about their future and that his answer has given us a very large amount of hope and satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the benefits of joining the eec was the multinational approach to the deprived social regions of the member states of which the western isles are a perfect example <e> <s> therefore i hope it is not too presumptuous for a lowland englishman to congratulate the scottish office on per cent <e> <s> of their achievement <e> <s> but of course there are <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that <e>

enough money to the ncc to allow them to offer management agreements that is exactly what we said would happen and we are now being proved right even earlier than we thought would be the case <e> <s> there is nothing more smugly satisfying than to he able to say i told you so <e> <s> it is also quite probably the most irritating thing for the people to whom you are saving it <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend give way on that point very briefly <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt him <e> <s> is he satisfied that the ncc has enough money to make objections under section of the wildlife and countryside act so that if objections are upheld it can enter into a worthwhile management agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend notice the possibly freudian slip of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney when he said that the soviet peace committee was an organ of the soviet government <e> <s> does it not debase the value of the world disarmament campaign if it gets into bed with such odd fellows who seem to be part of the same government which went into afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend says that it is difficult to find out who is legally responsible for discounting tickets does this not make the permit totally valueless <e> <s> either there is someone who can answer for the conditions of the licence or there is not <e> <s> for the government to say that they cannot find someone responsible is very odd <e>", "<cs> my lords it may appear impertinent of me to congratulate the noble lord lord gormley but i hope that he will excuse that impertinence <e> <s> we have just heard a speech from a great englishman which exemplarised the best part of the trade union tradition which at its highest has given a great deal to a great people <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not hypocritical for members on the other side of your lordships house to complain that small investors get a bonanza when they make a profit on amersham and then to complain that they have been diddled because they have not got enough from the profit on the sale of britoil <e> <s> is it not the case that her majestys government have placed britoil on the market at <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that by increasing benefits by per cent <e> <s> and trying to hold wages to per cent <e> <s> the government have in fact radically increased the dangers of the poverty and unemployment traps <e> <s> is he aware that there is a solution which is to raise the tax thresholds and the starting point of tax by higher than that amount <e> <s> that will obviate the poverty trap and unemployment trap effects which he has unintentionally initiated by this per cent rise in benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a great pleasure to listen to the noble lord lord cledwyn

manufacturing trade deficit since the industrial revolution <e> <s> we did not hear him wax quite so lyrical over the fact that we had exported grain for the first time since the battle of the nile

programme been put down and then the independent broadcasting authority had instructed mr pilger to have produced an anti-bomb programme the question of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney would

tax negative and therefore abolishes the poverty trap <e> <s> furthermore does my noble friend remember that in the election manifesto it was conservative policy to introduce a tax credit scheme <e>",

always been renowned for its sensitivity in planning roads some of the roads and bridges that have been planned have been quite unpleasant <e> <s> what is now being proposed is sensitive and civilised <e> <s> it is therefore right and proper that those of us who sometimes complain about insensitivity in such matters should congratulate the department on producing something which as i say is sensitive and civilised <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not extremely difficult for world interest rates to come down <e> <s> the american economy has i think a budget deficit of billion dollars a year with fairly low inflation and very high interest rates <e> <s> in those circumstances is it not true that the american economy is not going to come out of recession and consequently the economies of the rest of the western world will not come out of recession either <e> <s> is this not something that worries my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to create an offence of trespass on residential premises in england and wales and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill he now read a first time <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend clear up one or two points on agricultural representation on water boards <e> <s> as the committee knows i am a farmer and so i must declare an interest here <e> <s> it seems sensible for the minister of agriculture to have this power to appoint <e> <s> does he agree that it is possible to argue that if one minister of the crown has power to appoint certain people to the board because of sectional interests that will open the floodgates to everybody else <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend just go a little further on the reason why maff are having this privilege <e> <s> surely there are larger users of water than the ministry of agriculture the chemical and steel industries for example use much more water and kielder was built not for agricultural use but for industrial use in the newcastle area <e> <s> but water authorities have statutory duties to people other than the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> i may say i am delighted about this representation but i would just ask why it is that the ministry of agriculture is the only one other than the possibility of public representatives and that is a different matter the question of accountability to have this privilege <e>", "<cs> on the previous amendment we had a lucid and powerful argument put forward on special hypothecated places for special interests <e> <s> i think most people in your lordships house agreed that it was a good thing that the ministry of agriculture should have those two members on the water authority <e> <s> for the special interests of one industry to be represented by statutory right and not peoples local representatives seems to me to be getting matters slightly upside down <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin objected that the amendment was too narrow because a local authority could nominate only two people which would tie the hands of the secretary of state to nominating those two who might be in his view totally unsuitable <e> <s> but it is perfectly possible to redraft the amendment in such a way that local authorities will nominate six people and the minister will choose two four or whatever the number is <e> <s> that is an argument of the civil service who have decided that they do not want to move they want to get on with their own thing and they do not want any interference from the peoples representatives <e> <s> it is dangerous not to have people accountable to their elected representatives <e> <s> i suppose that that comes well from a hereditary peer but we learned our lesson in <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister replies i would just like to ask since he was so emphatic when he spoke earlier on the necessity for having local authority members on these new executive boards and was so impassioned about this <e> <s> why is it that he cannot write this into the bill in some way <e> <s> that is the question we are all asking <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment and the reasoning which has made me think that for once i am totally right is a speech of my noble friend lord nugent earlier on when i asked him why it was necessary to have a member of the agricultural lobby upon the water authority management boards <e> <s> he gave a perfect reason for the secretary of state appointing people with conservation interests to do their statutory duty <e>", "<cs> as one of the movers may i say of the amendment that if the noble lord were to say one like abraham and sodom and gomorrah i would certainly accept one just man as opposed to two which is the ideal <e>", "<cs> it is a catastrophic situation that the government have in effect thanks to lord melchetts probing withdrawn the undertaking given in the wildlife and countryside bill <e> <s> the other thing that my noble friend lord bellwin said is this <e> <s> if you have a conservationist

agricultural world in spite of what the <e>", "<cs> from this side of the committee may i say how nice it is for those of us who have had nothing much good to say about the bill to see ones own side showing intelligence sensitivity wisdom and all the things that one normally comes to associate with a conservative government <e>", "<cs> one of the besetting sins in this countrys administrations and it does not matter who is in power seems historically to have been an obsession with secrecy <e> <s> it is infinitely better to make people open and outwardly acceptable to the public and accountable to the public than to allow inward cabals to arrive at decisions which cannot be queried or questioned during the formation of policy process <e> <s> this is why one would like the press

accept that some of our forebears existed from morning to night on scotch whisky but they were in a very small minority <e> <s> there is no competition for water whatsoever and therefore the analogy of a private company is totally false <e>", "<cs> i should like to rise to support what the noble lord lord melchett said not because i think that my noble friend is incorrect in saying that there is consultation between water authorities but land use in this country is extremely critical and we are not very good at it <e> <s> since the war we have created quite a lot of unusable land by bad planning we have created quite a lot of derelict land <e> <s> at the moment farmers are criticised for over-producing that is actually for doing what the taxpayer and parliament have asked them to do

adequate to achieve the objectives <e> <s> i think the reason why this amendment was put down is that that has actually proved not to be the case because we have an imbalance of water supply in some parts of the country <e> <s> the question of rutland has been proven <e> <s> if you knock feet off i do not quite know how many acres it is a monumental amount of water <e> <s> i suspect that nobody

drought <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent went around producing water out of the air in the year of the drought <e> <s> i just wonder if this legislation has achieved its objective <e>", "<cs> i want to support the amendment to which i have put my name which i suppose is not so surprising <e> <s> i wish to say two things about it <e> <s> first this country is totally obsessed with secrecy in government and it does not really seem to matter whether it is noble lords opposite who are advising the queen or my noble friends on this side in their advice to her majesty <e> <s> it seems that we have this <e>", "<cs> the whole point of the amendment is that the nature conservancy council do not intend to get hold of the information by the back door and put it on the front page of the <e>", "<cs> i promised your lordships another session on this wretched thing but i shall try to be as brief as i can because we want to get on and we have been minutes on this amendment <e> <s> the <e>",

the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord melchett and those of us who feel that there is a much stronger case to be made for much more careful scrutiny of land drainage schemes are <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> if we could all look at the consultative paper when it comes out it would seem to me that after the next election when presumably my noble friend will be sitting in exactly the same place this will be a very suitable bill which could start in your lordships house <e> <s> there seems to be a certain amount of knowledge on the subject of land drainage <e> <s> i think it would be seriously and constructively criticised by members on both sides <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord melchett for putting down the amendment in both our names and for a very useful debate <e> <s> i personally am satisfied with my noble friends undertaking on the question of the interdepartmental report the fact that it will read what has been said and will produce a consultative white paper and if legislation is needed it will flow from that consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time

saying that the man who is going to be on the board or one of the men should have knowledge of which is a great difference <e> <s> the amendment means that his experience should entail rather than that he should be a mouthpiece of <e> <s> my noble friend also said that the boards will take into account these very important points <e>", "<cs> i have one small point to make in reply to what my noble friend lady faithfull said <e> <s> if a charitable housing association gives accommodation to an unmarried mother who then proceeds to marry and her husband does well why on earth should the charitable association subsidise her husband <e> <s> i have a second point to make which is in reply to the noble lord lord sandford who said that this is an orchestrated campaign <e> <s> i received only one letter on this subject which was from the chairman of one of the big clearing banks whose family have run a small housing association in the village where they live for old people in that

lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords after years of the existence of your lordships house or is it <e> <s> i am not quite sure is it not time that this particular point was clarified <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that i would agree i hope he is aware that i would agree but if not is he so aware that votes are not going to have a catastrophic influence upon the outcome of a parliamentary election <e> <s> furthermore is it not verging on the irresponsible to take it upon oneself to produce a new piece of constitutional law

reverend prelate the bishop of derby promising that bishops and their successors will not vote in general elections <e> <s> that is not legally binding <e> <s> furthermore would it not be advisable

seen the disastrous result especially during the time of the previous government of i believe the callaghan administration trying to subsidise mortgage rates directly <e> <s> did not that have a distorting effect on the market <e> <s> furthermore surely this question arises because the americans have such an enormous budget deficit and are having to borrow so much and are forcing interest rates up all over the world <e> <s> does the minister agree that the sooner we get those down the more likely we are to have sustained and profitable growth <e>", "<cs> my lords how pleasant it is to agree with the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich <e> <s> he must be very right when he speaks of the importance of youth training the importance of small businesses and the importance of

the united states we would probably not have won world war i certainly not world war ii and would almost certainly have been involved in and probably lost world war iii <e> <s> we should also always remember marshall aid ideals which lie behind american society <e> <s> i personally have many american relations both by marriage and by blood so your lordships will see that the criticisms of the united states that i am going to make and the strong support that i intend to give to the action taken by her majestys government are based not on anti-americanism but on a perceived view of what is in this countrys interests and i would venture to suggest the united states interests as well <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult to follow a speech such as that which we have just heard <e> <s> apart from one minor note-losing incident which is something that we all dread it was one of the must lucid and clear expositions of a complicated rent situation that i have ever heard <e> <s>

also of the act <e> <s> if as noble lords have said one then piles on the fiscal inequalities one gets i suggest a decline which is practically irreversible <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say why the conservative party has changed its mind on this issue when it actually moved amendments and supported amendments to that effect with the agriculture miscellaneous provisions bill <e>",

profit we should make on a piece of land <e> <s> they will show what should be the gross margin given a certain amount of equipment <e>", "<cs> may i put this point <e> <s> let us assume for the sake of argument that a farmer as described by the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield bids for say a acre farm which is next door to his own and comes up for rent and that he bids a very high tender price

exactly the same why should that farm not pay the same rent as the other farm <e> <s> it seems extraordinary that for an identical farm a rent should be paid to the same landlord which is totally different <e>", "<cs> why should he not pay the price for that mans greed <e> <s> the person who does pay the price is not the next door neighbour but the landlord who has two assets <e> <s> or let us

can suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that if it was ever contemplated that any of these weapons were to be used there would be a situation of such crisis in europe that the prime minister of

taken without really serious consultation <e> <s> if they were ever taken in effect the whole system of deterrence would have failed and the object of deterrence is to stop any of these wretched

one goes much too far <e> <s> i tend to agree with the noble lord lord walston that it will produce a situation where you can only have a tenancy if you agree to go to the court and ask for this

gymnastics or skating on a line like one of those produced by torvill and dean on the ice rinks of nottingham and belgrade <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment probably for reasons which the noble lord lord prys-davies will not accept <e> <s> i happen to think that if we are to increase the tenanted sector of the agricultural community there must be a small element not a large element of fixed-term tenancies and this is a small step in that direction <e> <s> i would have a small guess that the noble lord lord prys-davies will not support fixed-term tenancies in the case of private landlords but he will happily support them for county council landlords <e> <s> that seems to me to be slightly illogical thinking <e> <s> if we are to have fixed-term tenancies

matter who the landlord is or what size the holding is <e> <s> having said that i support the principle of short-term tenancies and will pray it in aid when we come to my amendment no <e> <s> when i

amendment is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i had had it intimated to me that that was the line that my noble friend was going to take and i am not over-surprised by it <e> <s> i am disappointed simply

amendment the naming of a successor <e> <s> in other words it would be son x or son y if that successor did not want to take up farming then the tenancy automatically became a lifetime tenancy <e>",

down the road <e> <s> let us consider what would have happened if when the labour party was in power the conservatives had divided on five amendments on a bill of this size <e> <s> we would have been accused of gross irresponsibility <e> <s> i suspect that that is the case this afternoon on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords verbal self-discipline is i feel essential this evening if we are to make

it i believe that it realised <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave my noble friend warning of this may i ask him to say something about compensation <e> <s> the other point he has just mentioned seems very important <e> <s> if there is a reasonable prospect of a management agreement directions will not be imposed but if somebody starts mucking about and asking for silly sums they will be imposed <e> <s> this is a major shift of policy and from my point of view it is welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords we had in the last sentence of the speech made by my noble friend lord teviot a perfect example of the quandary we all face <e> <s> he complained justifiably about the state of the a which i too drive down <e> <s> the answer would be to straighten it widen it and make it into a dual carriageway

viscount on this point <e> <s> that airfield is not like other airfields <e> <s> in fact it is extremely sensitively done and is surrounded by trees <e> <s> in itself it is a very nice piece of countryside <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> it is not like london airport or gatwick <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to do so <e> <s> i have just returned from the falkland islands <e> <s> there is not the slightest shadow of doubt that the sinking of the belgrano was operationally necessary and it saved several hundreds if not thousands of british lives <e> <s> that is why it was done <e> <s> the arguments afterwards about what course it was on seem to me to be totally immaterial <e> <s> the noble lord opposite seems totally impervious to the effect that it had on british lives <e> <s> that was the important thing and no other issue mattered <e>", "<cs> my lords first one must obviously congratulate two excellent maiden speakers <e> <s> their speeches were a pleasure to listen to <e> <s> great thought and intelligence have gone into their construction <e> <s> what a magic place your lordships house is <e> <s> if i had been looking for a place to find somebody who had fought for the chinese communists in certainly i would have come straight to your lordships house and lo and behold there he is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the royal engineers say that they can repair that road up to decent levels within three and a half months <e> <s> that is the received view of the commanding officer of the royal engineer regiment in the falkland islands at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important that europe plays a much greater part in this area because after all it is europes dew pond it is her back garden between israel and the middle east <e> <s> the american president received per cent <e> <s> of the jewish vote at the last election as opposed to the per cent <e> <s> or whatever it was for mr mondale <e> <s> therefore europe is in a position to pressurise an american president who is now less beholden to the zionist vote than ever before and perhaps there is hope for some sort of progress under those circumstances for both palestinian rights and peace in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an interest to declare in that i am president of the open spaces society and probably by the time i have finished saying what i am going to say they will give me the sack <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not think that the noble lord was as silly as that but sometimes he has been known to give the impression that he has said that <e> <s> the other point i should like to make and i say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has not understood what i wanted him to say <e> <s> what i wanted him to say was that there was no question of the government changing the right of people to petition in the circumstances in which they are petitioning now <e> <s> that was the question i asked not whether they would use it as in the case of sir peter mills in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all we must certainly thank my noble friend lord buxton for introducing this question <e> <s> i should like to say just one thing to my noble friend lord montgomery <e> <s> he said that we have to resolve our difficulties with argentina <e> <s> i would slightly suggest that the argentines might try to resolve their difficulties with us <e> <s> that would be quite a help <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend and noble kinsman lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> it would seem to me that we have a precedent here <e> <s> if the minister says all your pigs have to be slaughtered for whatever that disease is called or for foot and mouth you then get compensation <e> <s> but if your crops have to be destroyed or you are not allowed to sell them which to all intents and purposes is the same thing as the result of some action by somebody else to whom the minister then in turn says you cant do it it is the polluter who has to pay in the end <e> <s> but surely the taxpayer at the beginning should make sure that the man does not lose out <e>", "<cs> arising out of what the noble lord has said it seems to me that it is always possible that you could have a negligent polluter who is not covered by insurance <e> <s> speaking from personal experience i know of a friend of mine whose fish ponds were totally ruined by a local authority and he had to settle at a much earlier stage than he wished to because he was simply strapped for cash <e> <s> even though he was suing those people the insurance company were holding up on the payment which is a common form of reaction from insurance companies <e> <s> i hope that that could be borne in mind as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have in front of me a telex on fifra the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act of the united states <e> <s> on the question of information on tests and toxicity they are extremely forthright <e> <s> i suspect having read this that they are equally forthright on similar sorts of tests for toxicity for dumping at sea and if they do not have a special act on it they will certainly have the freedom of information act <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend whether there are any precedents as regards this matter <e> <s> there must be regulations which ministers draw up as regards human drugs veterinary drugs fuels or whatever <e> <s> there must be oceans and tonnes of regulations on these types of subject which are covered by acts of parliament <e> <s> what do other acts of parliament say <e> <s> do they or do they not give ministers parameters according to which they should issue regulations <e> <s> i must admit that if they do not do so i suspect that they ought to <e> <s> i tend to agree with the noble lord lord melchett on this matter <e> <s> it is a bit vague just to say go forth and govern new south wales <e> <s> you ought to be told vaguely how you should do it <e>", "<cs> i think it worth mentioning that i have had briefs from the cla which states that it <e>", "<cs> i think that it was stanley baldwin who said trust the people <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord belstead has given pretty strong and concrete undertakings that these regulations will be drawn up as expeditiously as possible <e> <s> on that point i personally am prepared not to get into an argument on the may or shall case even though i think that possibly intellectually my noble friend lady nicol may be right and even the noble eco-freak lord melchett is possibly right as well <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because i know that there is considerable concern about pesticide and fungicide use in third world countries <e> <s> i equally know that if they had been more efficiently used in ethiopia then probably ethiopia would not be in the situation that it is at the moment <e> <s> i know that point was brought out by certain noble lords at second reading <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend gets up may i add one point that follows upon what the noble lord lord john-mackie says <e> <s> it is the reverse of his point <e> <s> if products get the stamp of approval and prior informed consent they will be more saleable and more satisfactory to people than if there were no proper regulations made <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend answer this point absolutely clearly <e> <s> there has been a lot of obfuscation <e> <s> if we agree to the treaty imposing prior informed consent does this bill now give him the power to make regulations to say you o chemical company you o merchant will not sell abroad to this country without its prior informed consent <e> <s> if that is the case that is all right <e> <s> if it is not the case i would hope that the bill will be toughened up to make sure that that does happen <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise and join in this argument yet again <e> <s> but really all one wants is the answer yes or no to a very simple question <e> <s> if prior informed consent comes from an international treaty do the government have the power in the bill to say you cannot export that product without prior informed consent and if you do you go to chokey for six months or whatever penalty they care to give <e> <s> that is the question that one wants answered <e>", "<cs> that is what parliament is for <e>", "<cs> may i speak one final time and say to my noble friend lord belstead that under pressure he said very gallantly that he is going to go away and look at it <e> <s> i think that this particular rabbit has been worried to death several times <e> <s> we may not have had a totally satisfactory answer but we now have from the minister the promise that he will go away and look at it hard <e> <s> but we would put him on notice that we shall worry him to death a bit more if he does not come back with something more satisfactory at report <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the idea behind this amendment but we must enter the <e>", "<cs> may i say one thing on this <e> <s> the notes on clauses talk about the methods of application <e> <s> my noble friend has given an undertaking that there is going to be maximum consultation and that the regulations are certainly going to start churning out of the government printing press some time next year <e> <s> now under those circumstances i would have thought really that he has covered the point about machinery and these are detailed minutiae which should come with the discussions on the draft regulations themselves <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell me what an acaricide is <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> aerial spraying is one of those things that annoy the public more than anything else <e> <s> there is also the problem of drift which is infinitely more difficult to control certainly when flying fixed-wing aircraft <e> <s> i am not saying that it should be banned i am just saying that there should be powers to say where it should not happen <e> <s> i do not think anyone would reasonably want spraying to be banned over large areas of forest or large areas of bracken on the hillsides of scotland if that is necessary <e> <s> however as no one on the front bench is listening i shall sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that answer which was full of clarity <e> <s> can my noble and learned friend tell me whether attempting to blow up her majestys government is high treason or could be charged as high treason <e> <s> if so does capital punishment still apply <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there are two sides of this coin <e> <s> unless we have proper machinery either it will put on too little of the dose or put on too much <e> <s> if you put on too much there is bound to be economic cost to the farmer which he will learn the second time round and there will also be environmental harm <e> <s> it would seem that the follow-on is that you cannot avoid licensing machinery if you licence the stuff as well or give it some form of certificate of approval <e> <s> this must be the right way to proceed <e> <s> i should have thought that it was selling things under false pretences if there was not some form of approval <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord <e> <s> i declare an interest <e> <s> i carry out a considerable amount of spraying of chemicals into water for clearing a fishing lake <e> <s> it is infinitely easier to be careless and irresponsible in spraying on to water than it is over land <e> <s> i have had the experience recently of being sold a chemical and being told verbally by the ministry of agriculture and the company concerned that it was free and available for use and then being told by the thames water authority that under no circumstances was ito use it even though it had been cleared for use in the united states of america <e> <s> it is important that the regulations in this case should be extremely strict and clear <e>", "<cs> there is a lovely idea which i have suddenly seen presented by this amendment <e> <s> this foul noxious stuff produced in a tin distillery in the back streets of bolton is exported to some obscure third world country which says no we dont want it although it is allowed to be exported <e> <s> but then if the minister has the power to ban imports of stuff it cannot come back in again <e> <s> so where pray does it go <e>", "<cs> i think there is just a little in what the noble lord lord melchett says <e> <s> i am awfully pleased that we have now had an eco-rambler joining with the eco-freaks that is a great advantage <e> <s> would it not be possible to think along the lines of making sure that spraying is not done near footpaths on sundays and not done in the middle of the day <e> <s> there obviously is some cause for concern <e> <s> we as farmers must show some consideration for others <e> <s> i can hear in the background my noble friend lord stanley saying no no no which is an unfortunate attitude for the farmers to take because it gives us a bad name which i do not want <e> <s> that is my view <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness withdraws her amendment i wonder whether i may proffer what i hope will be some constructive suggestions to my noble friend <e> <s> i took the trouble to write to the german agricultural attach who has sent me a resum of some of the german regulations <e> <s> since they have had this marvellous <e>", "<cs> we should be warned when talking about this amendment which incidentally i <e>", "<cs> my attention has been drawn to a paper given to the all-party conservation committee and signed by my noble friend lord craigton sir peter hardy and sir john farr <e> <s> it would probably have been better if my noble friend had produced this information but as i am on my feet i shall do so <e> <s> it says that in maff produced a leaflet entitled <e>", "<cs> while the minister is thinking of the answer to that question his answer on volatility has not with respect been quite as hopeful as some of us on this side of the committee had anticipated <e> <s> it seems to me that it is dangerous not to get a proper level regarding volatility <e> <s> if that is the case it seems to me perfectly simple for the minister to say yes this will be considered in greater detail than it has been shown to be considered over the past year or two <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that that is a different excuse from the one given for his absence by his noble friend lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> i know that aerial spraying is one of the things which causes an enormous amount of concern among the public and rightly that concern has been shown in your lordships committee both last thursday and today <e> <s> one is inundated with paper over this bill but there is one piece of briefing which i know has been given to my noble friend which seems to me apposite on this <e>", "<cs> may i come back to take up one small point that the noble lord lord melchett made <e> <s> i was not advocating that this was definitely the truth <e> <s> but if we are to have a system of licensing of pilots they must work quite hard at it and not just be part-time aerial sprayers <e> <s> i am not necessarily saying it is essential that what they are saying is true but there is sufficient force in their argument for it to be taken account of <e> <s> that is what i am saying <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend on this <e> <s> we had a very long debate on it on thursday <e> <s> my noble friend was quite categorical that he was going to tighten up the regulations very much <e> <s> those of us who take a pretty suspicious view of aerial spraying and i certainly include myself among those were very pleased to hear what he said because he seemed to be going at least per cent <e> <s> of the way to meet the worries and concerns some of us feel over agricultural spraying and as somebody who has been quite critical on occasions it might be just reasonable to say that i am actually on his side <e>", "<cs> i think it is just worth commenting that this particular amendment or something very like it would be supported by the british agrochemicals association and also by the cla who i think actually drafted it if the truth be known and so they support it <e> <s> few if any of the products currently marketed actually do not work in spite of what the friends of the earth say but it would seem a good idea and i beg leave to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend give some indication of the time span in which he considers that the task could be accomplished <e> <s> that is the first part of my question <e> <s> the second part is how many of the chemicals he mentioned will actually fall off the end and be replaced by new chemicals <e> <s> i realise that is a difficult question to answer <e>", "<cs> it is obviously joke time on the front bench <e> <s> the germans have regulations on the maximum amount of stuff that can be put on the ground <e> <s> i think that certainly that should be brought into the regulations <e> <s> i think it should be there unless there is a reason why it should not be there <e> <s> that might be a good way of doing it <e> <s> secondly if we are going to go towards a community-wide system of regulations which i think we all agree we should the more we concur with our neighbours the better <e>", "<cs> it is worth pointing out that tractor drivers do not have to have a licence to drive a tractor except when on the highway <e> <s> i think there is an age limit on children not being allowed on tractors but in fact one does not have to have a licence to drive perhaps a caterpillar tractor towing a six-wheel six furrow plough accross leicestershire when one may just fall asleep at a hedgerow and just trundle trundle on as happened to an acquaintance of mine <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that not only the amendment but the clause itself has something rather odd about it <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support what my noble friend earl peel and what the noble lord lord melchett have said on this matter <e> <s> it is essential that there is some form of register which is open to the public and tells us test data toxicological data etc <e> <s> it might be worthwhile to read to the committee what the american act says <e> <s> i have given my noble friend a copy of this <e> <s> it is absolutely right <e> <s> i have obtained it through the help of the united states agricultural attach <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i am slightly disappointed by <e>", "<cs> my lords if a tenant gives up a part of his tenancy does he therefore give up all his milk quota or can he attach that milk quota to only a very small portion of the land concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the subject of this question not so wide and so varied that it would be much more suitable for a debate than for it to be discussed at question time when one is trying to extract information from her majestys government <e> <s> it is a much more suitable subject for a hour debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the united nations has made it a condition of decolonisation that it should be the consent of the people concerned who are governed by a metropolitan power <e> <s> furthermore is my noble friend aware that three months ago when i went to the falkland islands it was quite impossible to find but one falkland islander who wanted the question of sovereignty discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords there are one or two points which deserve further airing on this particular amendment <e> <s> first if the polluter cannot be traced it is impossible to sue him <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord lord walston seems to be excellently valid because there is then nobody to sue <e> <s> let us take the example of a chemical or pesticide fall-out across the border from southern ireland to northern ireland <e> <s> if mr ohiggins from one side of the border pollutes mr ohigginss crops on the other side of the border and a british order is made to stop or for destruction of his crops then i think it is going to be difficult to sue the man on the other side of the border <e> <s> i am using this as a starting point <e> <s> it is even perhaps possible that one could have trans-channel pollution <e> <s> i am not myself totally convinced of that but i think that it is possible <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend could apply his mind to that and give us an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i was temperamentally tempted to support the brothers mackie on this but i think that my noble friend has gone an enormously long way to reassure us <e> <s> but he has brought up the subject of regulations and i think what i should like to ask him is this will it be possible for your lordships house to have a good look at the regulations before they are published <e> <s> however good they are as they are subject to the affirmative procedure we can either accept them all or chuck them out <e> <s> we cannot look at them in order to amend and discuss them <e> <s> i think that it is extremely important that your lordships house should have a chance to discuss them before they are in concrete form in other words we should have a chance to discuss them before they set <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in a certain difficulty here because amendments are going to come which will create what in effect could be called double legislation in other words which will put into this bill and emphasise in this bill powers that the minister already has <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord john-mackie is suggesting that that particular form of double legislation should happen concerning aerial spraying <e> <s> it then follows that if you have double legislation for one aspect you are over-emphasising or making sure that ministers will carry it out <e> <s> if at the same time you have a lack of double legislation for another it could be assumed that people will not take it quite so seriously in spite of totally honourable and absolutely correct undertakings by my noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord john-mackie is really saying that my noble friend should be a social democrat <e> <s> i was always brought up to take the view that it was the conservatives who had no principles and that they just did things because they happened to be right <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has shown this to be absolutely how we should do it <e> <s> one really must say i thank you very much indeed for showing flexibility in mind and intelligence perfectly normal standard conservative habits but it is nice to recognise them occasionally <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not like opposing the noble baroness lady nicol on this particular amendment because she has been very wise in many of the contributions she has made to the debate on this bill <e> <s> but it seems to me that there are two points to be considered <e> <s> first if one inserts the words public interest here the assumption is that all the other regulations can be made solely for the purpose of enriching the minister by him taking bribes from chemical companies or some such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this particular amendment has a large number of holes in it <e> <s> first the gentleman who is to do the spraying may not spray more than half a hectare without a certificate of competence <e> <s> half a hectare when <e> <s> between lunch and dinner <e> <s> before breakfast <e> <s> does he have to leave a gap <e> <s> under what circumstances may he spray half a hectare <e> <s> that seems to me unreliable <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the noble lords who moved at committee stage an amendment to include the words or export i can do nothing but totally welcome the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that we have now got the balance absolutely right <e> <s> all these third world countries said with perfect justification that they did not want to be governed from whitehall and that they would rather go their own way <e> <s> it is therefore totally inappropriate for us to say you shall not have this from us because we do not think it is good for you <e> <s> it is exactly the same as us saying to the nigerians it is wrong for you to execute an armed robber or postpone his execution for hours because you want to use the polo pitch for another game of polo which is what they did the other day <e> <s> it is not our business <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to put to your lordships that if one uses wood and wire netting one can make a trap to catch peregrines <e> <s> that does not mean we should not use wood or wire netting <e> <s> i could be wrong but it seems to me that if someone in the nature conservancy council says please do not do it the minister is then obliged not to do it and must ban the chemical concerned <e> <s> i believe that that would be very unwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord melchett in this amendment <e> <s> i think it seems a very sensible thing to do <e> <s> i should say this to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> when he considers producing regulations along these lines if there are long and complicated restrictions on the use of the chemical it might be difficult to get in a half page or quarter page advertisement for that chemical in a farmers magazine the whole of a detailed list of what the actual restrictions are <e> <s> it might be difficult to have a very detailed and complicated list of restrictions <e> <s> however i think there is certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness does that i should like to say that i myself have been totally convinced by the ministers argument <e> <s> this bill has been the subject of much to-ing and fro-ing and a lot of cross-party support one way and another <e> <s> the minister has listened with great care to arguments from all sides of the house and we have managed to deal with this bill with intelligence and with no divisions <e> <s> i hope that we can avoid divisions because i would venture to suggest to the noble baroness for whom i have great admiration that she will lose a division <e> <s> i would equally venture to suggest that a division will hold up the proceedings in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question on the subject <e> <s> let us assume that a man has a raspberry crop which has to be picked within a very short space of time as your lordships are well aware <e> <s> let us then assume for the sake of argument that there is a perfectly justifiable pollutant scare the government make an order and that pollutant scare then turns out to be unjustified yet nobody has acted in any way negligently or improperly but totally for the public good and without negligence or regard to what he was doing <e> <s> under those circumstances and i totally admit that this is only a very small segment of what could happen i should not have thought that the farmer has even a case against the government <e> <s> i think that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i challenge my noble friend the minister on one matter <e> <s> for the minister to suggest that the government led by my right honourable friend would shrink from doing something that was necessary for public safety because of the potential cost involved strikes me as not the best defence produced against an argument by ministers in this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i might actually fall out with my noble friend lord radnor on this <e> <s> i should like to quote to your lordships two reasons why that is the case <e> <s> first the wording of the amendment really is extraordinary vague and i think any lawyer would have a fit if he saw it in a statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i have enormous sympathy as the noble baroness lady nicol will be aware for the thinking behind the amendment <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us a little clarification on this <e> <s> he said in his first answer that the government made no forecasts of the size of the fleet after <e> <s> he then went on to say that he was going to do a study on defence numbers up to <e> <s> how are the two statements reconcilable <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that several of us here have the impression that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby thinks that the belgrano was on a pleasure cruise <e> <s> how can he possibly withdraw the tanks from south africa which are probably used as taxis for poor farmers around the kruger national park <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask whether any element of chemical warfare was built into the recent exercises which were carried out concerning defence against notional nuclear attacks <e> <s> surely it would not be wise to assume that chemical warfare would not be used and that only nuclear warfare would be used <e> <s> should we not amalgamate the amount of civil defence that is required to apply to both categories of warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords we congratulate the government <e> <s> if they have found the cheapest and best aircraft for the royal air force that must be right <e> <s> is it not slightly unattractive to sneer at other countries just because they are like brazil <e> <s> it is like saying all wogs begin at calais and they should not build aeroplanes <e> <s> if the brazilians can build a very good aircraft for the royal air force which does not impinge on our defence capability or our political <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure for me but seldom do i have an opportunity to be the first to recommend to your lordships a maiden speech of such quality <e> <s> this i sincerely do and with confidence for my felicitations are merited <e> <s> the feelings of the noble lord lord grenfell are obvious and his authority is great <e> <s> surprisingly i also agree with the noble lord lord hatch that out of a prosperous agriculture will come a surplus to develop for the third world its own industry and higher standard of living <e> <s> but i do not underestimate the value of cash crops because it seems to me better for the egyptians for instance on their very rich nilotic soil to sell vegetables and high-value crops and to import low-value wheat which is cheaper and more extensively grown <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the israeli action in killing women and children has fanaticised the shiah moslems of southern lebanon in a way that until the israeli invasion was not actually thought possible <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that the israeli behaviour far from protecting their own security as suggested by the noble lord lord shinwell has in fact damaged that security by the paranoid and ruthless reaction to perfectly innocent civilians in somebody elses territory <e> <s> furthermore can my noble friend possibly imagine what would happen if we behaved in dundalk like the israelis behave in lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord murray of epping forest does us a disservice and the disservice he does us is in arriving so late in this chamber <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that it would have been better if we could have had his words of wisdom and speeches of the quality he has made today over the last years because this in my humble opinion is where the head of the tuc should be <e> <s> he should be in this chamber so that he can give his advice and consent to the government of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is an enormous difference between the cost of employing somebody and the cost of what that person receives <e> <s> at certain low wage levels the cost of what that person receives in real take-home pay can go down with an increase in his monetary wage <e> <s> this has a disastrous effect first on the inflationary costs of the company and secondly on labour relations <e> <s> is my noble friend not aware that it is vitally important that the review of tax and social security which is being undertaken at the moment by the government should be expedited and should be as thorough as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be the most original speech in the best possible sense that we have heard about the falkland islands <e> <s> when the suez crisis was on lady eden complained that she felt that the suez canal was running through her drawing room <e> <s> i have a feeling that the noble lord lord trefgarne is going to have a feeling that fish are swimming about his <e> <s> i am not going to be original in my speech like the noble lord lord energlyn but i am going to hammer home the point about fish and the falkland islands

instruments of hindenberg of napoleon and also i believe of hitler <e> <s> referenda are easily fixed the boundaries are easily moved and they undermine the sovereignty of parliament <e> <s> referenda were introduced into this countrys political being by the erstwhile second viscount stansgate who thought that he could persuade the british people and the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx to stay out of the common market because that is what he wanted and he thought that he would pray in aid the advice of the british people but they said nay <e> <s> that is a very bad precedent for the use of

lord has shut up <e>", "<cs> several sentences after the noble lord lord hatch said he would give way i shall now answer that one point about why it was decided to abolish the metropolitan authorities

glc when they came to power <e> <s> there was a putsch and mr livingstone was put into place <e> <s> they then proceeded to issue money as if it were printed by somebody else <e> <s> they behaved in a manner of nearly criminal irresponsibility with other peoples money <e> <s> that is why it was decided to abolish them <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be very grateful to the noble lord for introducing this debate <e> <s> my only regret is that it was not either in official opposition time perhaps to allow more people to put down their names to speak or even better in official government time but

be a clash between the headage payment system and the grants for heather regeneration <e> <s> how is that clash going to be sorted out <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend saying that as regards this particular wood which straddles the border of buckinghamshire and whatever the successor borough is its management would be divided in half <e> <s> if that is the case it is thoroughly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> not surprisingly i should like to support this amendment at the very least though preferably i would support a government amendment along the same lines later on at report stage <e> <s> i think that an ecology unit which is costing with a staff of eight dealing with the whole of london must be infinitely preferable to ecology units <e> <s> that is on the basis of the belief that only half the boroughs will establish such units <e> <s> thus such a system would be much more expensive and would cover only half of london <e>", "<cs> they will get something second rate and expensive <e> <s> that cannot be right <e> <s> i should like to refer to circular / of the department of the environment and the sentence mentioned by my noble friend <e> <s> this states <e>", "<cs> as somebody who has his name to this amendment i was very encouraged by the noises which came from my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> what i should very much like to do is to underline if i can what the noble baroness lady nicol has just been saying on the importance of not losing expertise <e> <s> the very small ecology unit of the glc has done some very special work at very low cost indeed <e> <s> if we allow it to be dissipated or provide that it should become the duty of each borough to provide something for itself each borough itself will provide something at a quarter of the cost if it can and in regard to the boroughs it will end up at eight times the cost and about a quarter as effective as keeping in being the things which already exist <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to comment on something the noble lord lord birkett said <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a difference between people who are there to advise on ecology and conservation which is quintessentially non-money making and cannot under any circumstances go to the private sector whereas it would be perfectly reasonable to employ outside private landscape architects <e> <s> repton and capability brown did not work for the glc <e> <s> one of them worked for my forebear <e>", "<cs> lord camel or lord campbell <e>", "<cs> i should like to underline some things that were said by the noble lord lord melchett

character to anything and it has neither the benefit of the town nor the benefit of the countryside <e> <s> unless we are very careful that particular form of urban fringe can spread <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i am sorry is this a private fight or can anyone join in <e> <s> i really think that for once i should refer my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to the noble lord

metropolitan counties <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but there is something i do not quite understand <e> <s> if we have a policy for the countryside all the way round the metropolitan areas we do not want to go back to the situation before the war when middlesex county council went full steam ahead and developed all of middlesex and consequently it vanished <e> <s> surrey county county decided not to develop <e> <s> i am talking of two contiguous counties here <e> <s> consequently the surrey county council bit goes much further into london and the old middlesex county council is much further out of london <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give an undertaking that these inquiries will not be confined to football clubs <e> <s> after all there are old rugby league clubs old racecourse stands and large numbers of other sports which attract very large numbers of spectators <e> <s> the inquiries should not be confined to football just because this really ghastly tragedy happened at a football stadium and nowhere else <e>", "<cs> i think that it might be worth while underlining yet again what my noble friend lord home of the hirsel has said <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk is one of the most intelligent members of your lordships committee <e> <s> she knows as well as i do what her plan has been in this regard <e> <s> first she tried to persuade noble

melchett said this bill is narrow <e> <s> i think we honestly want to get on with discussing the merits of the bill rather than the general damage which admittedly has been done and most people now

animals in captivity or agricultural animals and does not cover what i believe are technically described as <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will give way for one moment <e> <s> if there is a specific duty as to one thing the absence of that duty as to something else is presumably intentional and therefore shows that there is no duty on the ministry of agriculture to further conservation <e> <s> however much they say they are going to do it it is the absence of duty which is highlighted by the specific duty imposed in respect of some other point <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend elucidate this point <e> <s> if the american budgetary move is successful the world price of grain is due to fall quite dramatically <e> <s> what kind of strain will that place on the ec budget <e> <s> secondly has any progress been made with the introduction of the proper marketability with the free marketing of milk quotas <e> <s> i suggest that that could be one of the most advantageous developments for both milk producers and the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> i have been trying not to say this <e> <s> i think this chamber and this parliament is about to make the most ghastly error <e> <s> to paraphrase this bill is exactly the same as the line that gives the mother of the kray twins the decision whether reggie should go to ford open prison or to the high security

son is next week and he may need flogging but that is a different question altogether <e> <s> will teachers under this bill still be able to flog adults <e> <s> it seems a rather odd way to behave

the nature conservancy council should not give a licence to kill the eagle <e> <s> these eagles are very rare birds <e> <s> there is i believe a way round the problem and that is to increase the ewe stock and take large advantage of the hill compensatory livestock allowance <e> <s> there will then be lots of lambs the eagles will be happy and prosper and the noble lord lord burton will not have to shoot his eagles <e>", "<cs> i have one minor point to make concerning payment for the damage which golden eagles may or may not do <e> <s> it seems to me that compensation could be the most marvellous excuse for a rip-off <e> <s> people would find dead lambs and with an innocent look on their face say that it has all been caused by golden eagles <e> <s> they would be trooping into the ministry of agriculture hoping for cheques <e> <s> one must be very careful about giving compensation to farmers for losses which may or may not be genuine <e> <s> we all know how good the compensation is and that the temptation to apply for or accept compensation is very strong <e>", "<cs> i think that we went into the question of appeal at fairly considerable length in <e> <s> i think that i support what my noble friend lord gibson-watt says and the idea behind what my noble friend lord burton says though i could perhaps explain to him why he should not shoot eagles but that is another question altogether <e> <s> if an element of appeal were brought in it would mean that the ncc would have to have more money and more staff and we know how difficult that would be <e> <s> but perhaps that would be a good thing <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> everybody is always asking for money and for staff and the treasury is always saying no they cannot have them <e> <s> if there is an

departmental response to the operation and effectiveness of part ii of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> that is government policy <e> <s> therefore it seems to me very sensible that it should now take legislative form <e>", "<cs> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way for a moment <e> <s> on salcey forest i have been advised as late as

amendment that stands in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i make no apologies for raising this matter yet again so shortly after it was last raised because we have seen nothing but articles and television programmes underlining the depredation of the fisheries regimes in the south atlantic around both south georgia and the falkland islands <e> <s> can my noble friend tell us first with whom and how often they are discussing this question <e> <s> secondly what happens when inevitably nothing happens and the fish stocks are exhausted <e> <s> thirdly can my noble friend comment on the reported fact that the squid have left the falkland islands fisheries six weeks early and could this be due to extra squid-jigging <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friends department continues the multilateral negotiations will it be possible to emphasise to the negotiators the fact that your lordships house and another place feel very strongly indeed that something should be done to protect both the economies and the ecology of the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend answers perhaps i may apologise for not having been here earlier <e> <s> secondly i thank my noble friend for putting down this amendment because a lot of it has to do with the ecology unit of the glc and its equivalent in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> having seen him with my noble friend lord chelwood on this particular issue i should just like to thank him for going a very long way to meeting the concern that my noble friend lord chelwood and i had on the future of that particular unit <e> <s> it seems to me that they have listened they have been intelligent and they have taken cognisance of serious objections made by i hope intelligent if unpunctual people <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend for so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady phillips is actually inaccurate about people not co-operating in their own redundancy <e> <s> i should just point out to her that when india became independent the whole of the india office co-operated in its own redundancy because the indian civil service was abolished <e> <s> abolishing the indian empire was rather more difficult than abolishing the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that one of the most helpful things that the government can do for small businesses is to raise the vat threshold considerably <e> <s> will he please suggest to his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer that he makes serious approaches to the common market so that we can raise that burden from a large number of small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords absurd is the word used by my noble friend lord beloff when talking about the judgment of the european court <e> <s> i believe that it is possible to suggest that the judgment was absurd <e> <s> however i would suggest to my noble friend the minister and i say this with the sincerest admiration because i admire her very much indeed that the governments proposal as to whether mummy lets you pay your parking fine or whether mummy lets you be sent to prison because you are reginald kray or whether mummy has a choice in what your punishment shall be when someone else does not have that choice is a cause for major injustice <e> <s> i do not honestly care whether or not capital punishment is carried out <e> <s> i have no particularly strong views on it <e> <s> however i hold very strong views that justice should be for everybody and not for one section or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that the parent of one child who allows hamsters to escape or throws paint pots around is to have his child thrashed but that the parent of another child is going to say my child must not be thrashed if he lets hamsters escape or throws paint pots around <e> <s> if that is the case the position is even more ridiculous than i originally thought it was <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the german apprentice wage is much lower as a percentage of the skilled mans wage than is the case in the united kingdom and that consequently the germans have a higher percentage of entry to apprenticeships than we do <e> <s> does he not agree that that therefore shows why the german economy is better than ours <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his opposition to the clause standing part of the bill perhaps i may say that surely nobody has understood this clause

that he can and we all have to believe it <e> <s> but it is pure and utter gobbledegook <e> <s> if it is such gobbledegook as this would it not be so much better for him to say yes it is gobbledegook

<e> <s> surely it would be better to take the clause away accept the noble lords opposition to it and rewrite it <e> <s> then we can all go away happy <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend help me a little on this point <e> <s> is it not true that if the number of people who died as a result of the bradford incident had been eating at a private restaurant the manager would have been inside for a very long time <e> <s> furthermore does this not lead to the view that there is a need for the reduction of crown privilege in hospitals so that people who are really careless and sloppy with their hygiene may be prosecuted and prosecuted as they would be if they were in ordinary outside employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend and my right honourable friend on their very courageous initiative even if it was something of a gamble <e> <s> it is surely now clear beyond any peradventure that unless there is justice done to the displaced palestinians in the middle east the

tynemouth neville trotter who it appears is a practitioner on behalf of the bankruptcy and insolvency people <e> <s> his view i speak with his knowledge and consent and from notes provided by him is that part of the problem is that the government have been very sensible and have listened a great deal to what people have said <e> <s> this explains why there are so many amendments <e> <s> if therefore we can take this concession just a little further and introduce the bill again in the next session when it will go through extremely quickly we shall obviate the necessity for an amending bill that is bound to come up if we do not get it right and rush through amendments of our own and commons amendments today <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true to say that the situation in south africa is far too complicated just to squeak for sanctions <e> <s> the boers have been there in south africa a lot longer than the black men have <e> <s> i think that they collided at the battle of blood river in <e> <s> that is when the zulus and the boers collided <e> <s> the cape province was settled by the boers long before the black man got there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords history

down in the streets of milton keynes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extraordinarily pleasant to offer congratulations on three such excellent maiden speeches <e> <s> it is extremely lucky that the noble

declare an interest and more to the point if instead of referring to what might happen in sheffield the noble lord referred to what actually happened in glasgow <e>", "<cs> as opposed to what might happen in enfield or sheffield would it not be better to say what actually happened in glasgow as it is much more to the point of this discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he can please help us a little more as regards the special procedure of hybridity and select committees <e> <s> as i understand it if you are a member of a select committee and i have sat on a committee on a hybrid private bill you sit acting as a jury the various people present their case to you in one way or another and you decide on the merits of the case <e> <s> with the okehampton by-pass joint select committee the government thought one thing was going to happen but another thing happened <e> <s> that is not unusual in this world <e> <s> does that not mean that it is quite possible that there will be the most frightful foul-up in the select committee procedure <e> <s> what happens if the various members of the select committee say we agree with petitioner x <e> <s> that in the effect ruins the plan put forward by the concessionaires who have been selected <e> <s> i realise it is a highly technical question but i think there is considerable importance and merit in finding out what the answer will be and what the government will do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to ask yet another question but i should like to go back to what my noble friend said when he stated that parliament will make the decision on what the select committee says <e> <s> does this mean in effect that if the committee says that it agrees with petitioner a public policy is <e>", "<cs> while we are discussing this clause perhaps we may bear in mind one extremely important fact <e> <s> the catch of atlantic salmon has fallen from tonnes about years ago to odd tonnes now <e> <s> that is a pretty catastrophic fall considering that the catch at the turn of the century was much larger <e> <s> surely therefore we should regard the necessity of creating river boards in scotland for the small rivers almost solely under those criteria <e> <s> salmon is such a vitally important part not only of the glories of nature but also of the economy of scotland and to a lesser extent of the tourism in some of the more underprivileged parts of england and wales <e> <s> we should look at the whole of this bill under those lights <e>", "<cs> does this not also come under the new clause put in later by the noble lord lord gray on permitted fishing <e> <s> secondly should it not be extended to english waters as well as scottish waters <e> <s> as your lordships may or may not have noticed i have a similar and probably much clearer but i am sure legally less correct amendment on the same point later in the bill <e> <s> there should be a method of catching fish which is allowed and no other method rather than a method which is disallowed <e> <s> that would be a fairer way of doing it <e> <s> i should have hoped that the amendment of the noble viscount lord thurso could be brought in to the later amendment to be moved by the noble lord lord gray <e>", "<cs> i believe the law on fish farming is to put it mildly fairly obscure <e> <s> it seems to me extremely important

authorities or district fishery boards or the river boards themselves <e> <s> surely they know at their level where something should go <e> <s> the fact that regulations as to whether a net should be

decision-making power <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can give a little more help to my noble friend lord gray of contin on the point raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> it seems that these regulations are going to be indescribably detailed about one pool here and one pool there or one coracle doing this or one rod doing that <e> <s> it seems to me that this is so detailed it should not

necessary and it can be shown to be necessary to introduce regulations of this sort on english salmon waters they will do so or is he just saying we are looking at the drought review and i do not have to address myself to the problem raised by my noble friend lord trenchard of the fish in the tamar <e>", "<cs> if that is the only objection to the amendment of my noble friend the duke of atholl it

american crayfish into english waters which has absolutely slaughtered the english and european crayfish <e> <s> so i hope that there is the maximum amount of support for the noble viscount lord thurso <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount replies to my noble friend i wonder whether my noble friend can answer my point about no boards <e> <s> to take the case of the american crayfish appalling

great many assertions that there is poaching and vast quantities of illegally caught fish but no <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support the amendment <e> <s> all of us i hope bear in mind the worldwide fall in the amount of atlantic salmon caught <e> <s> this is such a valuable crop not only <e>", "<cs> i have my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not asking people not to do anything we are telling them that they may do something if they want to <e> <s> that is the difference <e> <s> we are not asking the noble baroness lady ryder not to go to church we are not asking any muslim not to go to the mosque we are not asking any jew not to go to the synagogue we are not asking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say only three things <e> <s> first the noble lord lord mishcon mocked our modern society <e> <s> i would rather my children were born now in the era of tolerance and listening to other peoples points of view than in when i was born i am not quite sure when the noble lord lord mishcon was born but it was a little earlier than that <e> <s> it is a better society that we live in now than it has ever been before <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> secondly what this amendment is saying is that it is the last chance for the bossy-boots to get their oar in if that is not a terrible mixture of metaphors <e> <s> what we are asking the government to do those of us who agree with it is to allow people to do what they want <e> <s> it is not for nanny state to say do this do that <e> <s> we are mature and civilised human beings <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seems to me to have one major flaw <e> <s> the flaw is how do you define an angler <e> <s> are you going to have a series of weighted votes <e> <s> is somebody who just takes one day rod on the dee going to have a vote the same as someone who owns a stretch and fishes it all his life <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a question <e> <s> is he saying that the clause as drafted by the government will not work as the government want it to but that if the amendments of my noble friend lord trenchard are attached to it it will work as the government want it to <e> <s> that is the part which in all honesty i do not follow <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble and learned friend be prepared to answer at third reading the questions which have been put on the floor of the house <e> <s> that seems to me to be the important part <e> <s> i believe that he has been unable to be here today because he has an extremely important legal case in scotland and one readily understands that <e> <s> i think it would be very important if my noble friend on the front bench were to give an undertaking that he would actually be here at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add only a few short sentences <e> <s> those of us who have doubts about the governments position are basically saying that there has been very high quality legal criticism of the wording in the bill <e> <s> those doubts must be laid at rest <e> <s> i hope that somebody with a great legal mind will come to answer the doubts that there are and which have been expressed by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> if it were not for the fact that the noble and learned lord lord denning was making such points then it would perhaps be much easier to accept the govenments views as stated <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me essential as we are not going to get another salmon bill i hope in my lifetime that we have a national salmon policy <e> <s> this means that we have to count the number of salmon that can be taken reasonably cropped for the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> in this cropping what we must not do is take the nets away from the north-east coast drift netters and immediately allow my noble friend lord lansdowne to catch lots more <e> <s> that would not under any circumstances be fair or equitable <e> <s> i am absolutely convinced that my noble friend lord lansdowne would not want that anyway <e> <s> if we can find out the total number of fish that can satisfactorily be taken from the sea so that we can conserve and if possible increase the stock a little then the quotas can go up and there will be lots for everybody providing that nobody is too greedy and that is asking a lot of human nature <e> <s> if we look after the salmon conserve it make the right reports and the right scientific judgments then i would suggest that there will be room for the traditional north-east fishermen for the marquess of lansdownes nets for the day fisherman on the dee and for everybody else <e> <s> but we have to be ruthless about not overcropping the stock <e> <s> that is the whole point and this amendment brings that out with great clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the government being perfectly reasonable in making a simple statement to make clearer what the exact figure is <e> <s> people are quicker to claim benefit than they are to say that they do not want it <e> <s> it is easier to discover people claiming benefit than those who say no we do not want it <e> <s> therefore the figures become more accurate and it is accurate figures that we want in spite of false excitement by certain members of the peerage on the opposite side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that we as a generation are much better drivers than our fathers and our grandfathers <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the number of people killed on the roads in the s was more than are killed now <e> <s> we should keep this matter well in proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords i really wish the government well on this bill <e> <s> it is the most sensible bill we have had for a very long time <e> <s> the government are not saying you will open on sundays and they are not saying that one must do something immoral <e> <s> the government are saying we are not going to boss you about any more <e>", "<cs> perhaps my lords it would have been better if they had <e> <s> they might have been kept from eternal damnation in the life hereafter by doing that rather than by regulating the retail trade <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he can answer this point <e> <s> if really hard evidence were to come up in say months time that this was absolutely necessary do the government have powers to act without amending this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as a total layman who does not understand very much law i think i have been totally persuaded by my noble and learned friend on the front bench and the matter has been further elucidated for me by my noble and indeed very learned friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> the idea seems to me extraordinarily dangerous that this house from its position of privilege and from its wide experience of owning and fishing salmon rivers should pass a law which if it is amended as both my noble friend lord colville and my noble and learned friend on the front bench say by lord dennings clause is so draconian that it becomes practically a matter of merely looking at one of lord lansdownes fishes being sufficient to get you sent straight to australia <e> <s> i think this is wrong frankly <e> <s> it is miles too strong <e> <s> it will look like very heavy sectional class interest and that is something we should not in any circumstances tolerate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that this country provides a higher percentage of jobs than any other country in the european community outside denmark <e> <s> is it not equally true that if we can sustain even a modest per cent <e> <s> growth in gdp we shall eventually start getting people back to work <e> <s> is it not the case also that everybody on these benches is concerned every bit as much as those on the benches opposite about idle people and about people having nothing to do <e> <s> the devil makes work for idle hands and it is in nobodys interests that that should happen <e> <s> the governments policies of growth should be supported and tax cuts that promote growth should equally be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this about the most incompetent piece of bungling by somebody for a very long time <e> <s> a woman who is charged with the most serious possible crimes is now loose and god knows where she is <e> <s> somebody has made the most frightful error and i sincerely hope that that somebody or those same people will never go on to earn their index-linked pension <e> <s> i sincerely hope that they will be sacked if they do not resign forthwith because we shall not be making irish jokes we shall be making dpp jokes <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the american president is elected by total universal suffrage and elected on a democratic system <e> <s> is it not also true that colonel gaddafi came to power on the guns of some obscure squadron of tanks around siwa oasis <e> <s> is it not equally true that our american friends are within the law in doing what they did <e> <s> were we not right to support them <e>", "<cs> i should like to remind your lordships committee of one dictum on this that the jesuits always used to say give me a child until he is six and he will never leave the fold <e>", "<cs> my mathematics have always been bad <e> <s> what is one year between friends <e> <s> at that age children are very susceptible <e>", "<cs> i am sure that what sir peter tapsell said was very important but it has nothing to do with the teaching by school teachers of party politics to five year-olds <e> <s> the noble lord may be totally right about what sir peter tapsell said but he is surely straying by a very circuitous route away from the subject <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to put a hypothetical question to him <e> <s> i do not know whether he saw the article by bernard levin the other day which was showing how entryism by the militant tendency in the north-west of england was to control the governors and the headmaster <e> <s> let us assume for the sake of argument that they acquire that control and then appoint somebody like the school teacher who said at the conference of the national union of teachers that the secretary of state was to education what aids was to rock hudson <e> <s> that cannot be other than deeply offensive <e> <s> if somebody like that is the sort of person those entryists want to appoint as headmaster how under the present legislation are we to stop that man running a curriculum which introduces hard nasty politics whether of the right or the left i do not know which into the curriculum <e> <s> how are we to stop that without legislation <e>", "<cs> i thought for one moment that my noble friend lord renton was about to say that moses could not have drafted the ten commandments without the assistance of a lawyer <e> <s> but one thing i should like to take up from what the noble lord lord parry has said is that the teaching profession was held in much higher esteem to years ago than it is now <e> <s> i also suspect in fact i know it to be true that the spending power of teachers is now per cent <e> <s> of what it was in while that of agricultural workers is per cent <e> <s> there has been a fall in the status of teachers <e> <s> if one has a fall in the status of teachers one allows worms in the form of mr doherty to enter into the woodwork <e> <s> there is a quote which is not quite the same as that which the noble viscount lord mersey gave <e> <s> it is along the lines that evil only prospers if good men do nothing about it <e> <s> i am not sure who said it and i have not had time to check it <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> i am worried that the good men are in danger of doing nothing over this because that minority worm can do very serious damage <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one brief comment in reply <e> <s> there is an objection to that suggestion <e> <s> if you say you shall teach how good democracy is you will end up by saying you shall teach french or you will end up like the french minister of education who looked at his watch and said all form b are now learning about ravaillac <e> <s> that is the beginning of the slope and that is why that route is not possible <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment may i ask my noble friend on the front bench one question <e> <s> does he admit that there is a problem or not <e> <s> if there is a problem what is he going to do about it <e> <s> if there is not a problem we are all wasting our time <e>", "<cs> is not the noble lord lord beloff suggesting that if the teachers or a group of teachers get it badly wrong in the docherty worm syndrome what we are asking is that the local authority should have the duty to make sure they do not <e> <s> so the two sides of the coin are not divorced they are very closely interwoven <e> <s> that is an appalling mixture of metaphors i quite concede but they are inter-dependent one upon the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> there are one or two things which need saying <e> <s> first oil has fallen in value from dollars a barrel to dollars a barrel or thereabouts <e> <s> this has immediately released onto the international market vast amounts of surplus diving capacity <e> <s> the north sea oil companies are cutting back on the use of their diving facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a danger about too much consulting <e> <s> the salvage world is an extremely cut-throat one <e> <s> if you do too much of that kind of thing you side-track the competition with the research that somebody else is doing and you can give away commercial secrets <e> <s> there is a difficulty about that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to my noble friend that he consults with the ulster unionist members of parliament and the bench of bishops with a view to extending the shops act to scotland because then perhaps the whole country will be in a uniform state of chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords i was tempted to muse the other day that if my fathers tank squadron had not been first into tripoli it might still be being ruled by general graziani <e> <s> that might be a good thing <e> <s> it would almost certainly be better if the noble lord lord renton was still dispensing justice as he did in the town hall in tripoli in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that we have the highest percentage of employed people per head of population in this country than in any other part of europe <e> <s> also will he give some estimate of the effect of the black economy on unemployment figures in the more prosperous southern and eastern parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the russians have several more nuclear reactors of the same type <e> <s> unless we know more details and have more information we shall be continually frightened by the precedent of actual damage as opposed to the fear of potential damage which has happened on the other side of the atlantic <e> <s> it is essential for us to ask the russians for the maximum amount of information and at the same time tell the russians that we will do anything we can to help them out of a position dictated by pride <e> <s> we need to help the russians as much as we possibly can to stop such a ghastly incident happening again <e> <s> with publicity and with open government this becomes more possible <e> <s> that is what happens in america but it does not happen in russia <e>", "<cs> or another chernobyl my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press my noble friend on the point made by my noble friend lord chelwood <e> <s> if we are to reduce the supply of wheat and barley and encourage extensive rather than intensive farming methods this must reduce the amount of money that is to come out of the common agricultural policy funds <e> <s> does my noble friend not agree that that money should be further used to top up national moneys and to create yet more methods of extensive farming and environmentally important methods of farming <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is very odd for your lordships house and for members opposite to say in effect that we cannot trust the house of the people or the house of commons to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just as odd for all sides of the house to do it as only one side of the house but it is odder from that side than from this <e> <s> it does seem rather odd <e> <s> surely we have had a commitment from my noble friend that this will be seriously looked at in another place and if amendments to it are necessary they will be brought forward <e> <s> i sincerely hope that your lordships will support my noble friend if it does come to a division <e> <s> i think it is very odd for the labour party to promote divisions because they do not trust the commons to look at legislation <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt my noble friend but he has not quite taken on board how seriously some of us especially those in the diving community regard the difficulty of separating british firms from foreign firms <e> <s> i think we would all rather that a british firm went and dived with a general licence on to hms trinidad for instance which sank in international waters somewhere in the antarctic but i believe is within the range of modern diving equipment which as my noble friend knows <e>", "<cs> we cannot stop haphazard access by foreign firms <e> <s> what happens is that we prosecute the hartlepool docker for working for the foreign firm that is doing it <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly withdraw my amendment to the amendment that the noble lord moved <e> <s> i think that my noble friend understands clearly that i find a certain amount of nonsense going on in this bill and i shall be happy to come back at report stage if it is not sorted out <e>", "<cs> arising from my noble friends reply will he please inform the committee whether the foreign office will consult people over designation in international waters over ownership and with whom they will consult <e>", "<cs> if that is the case what happens if a farmer unearths the remains of a designated aircraft not having known where it had crashed <e> <s> i am sure that that particular farmer or ordinary builder should have the protection of accidental unearthing which the highways authority have <e>", "<cs> my lords when answering an earlier question my noble friend said that there would be a further review of the forecast of traffic flow on the m <e> <s> in view of the total inaccuracy of forecasts of traffic flow on the m where will that get us <e> <s> furthermore i assume that my noble friend is saying that it is possible that traffic volume on the m will decrease and that therefore there will be no need for a helicopter service <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that i live halfway between gatwick and heathrow three miles south of the m and that at certain times it is actually impossible to get onto the m <e> <s> it is intolerable and therefore we should seriously think again about a helicopter route <e>", "<cs> i can feel rather sorry for my noble friend because on the marshalled list he can see all the old hounds which harass him on agricultural matters when bills of this sort come before parliament <e> <s> their names always keep appearing the onslows the melchetts the buxtons <e> <s> we could go on for ever really and even the noble baroness lady nicol need not look quite so smug sitting on the opposition benches <e>", "<cs> i have an amendment with the noble lord lord buxton concerning charges <e> <s> would it be convenient to the committee if we left the matter until then rather than to do it now <e>", "<cs> i suspect that in rising i shall perhaps add more confusion to the debate rather than anything else <e> <s> throughout the whole bill and i go back to the core of the bill it seems that the ministry has had a major strategic change of policy which is to look at the countryside as a whole rather than just as a food-producing unit <e> <s> i welcome that totally completely utterly and wholeheartedly because i believe that it is a great and gallant step forward <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first clause refers to the promotion of the enjoyment of the countryside by the public and surely adas should be used to support that <e> <s> secondly it is infinitely better that people should have access and it is after all everybodys countryside <e> <s> even though i own some land i am quite happy for people to enjoy my little bit <e> <s> but i should like other people who live in the crowded south-east of england where i live to enjoy it responsibly and to keep to public footpaths <e> <s> i want to get advice because there is room for all people to enjoy the land <e> <s> as amended i am sure the noble lord lord houghton will appreciate this i think the provision means that as fox hunting folk we can ask for advice on covers and how to make hunt ditches <e> <s> i am sure beyond peradventure that the noble lord lord houghton would love that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> when my noble friend first spoke i was totally satisfied with his answer <e> <s> but now he says that adas should not have a statutory duty because it overlaps with the countryside commission and that would be a bad idea <e> <s> he then says but actually it does have one anyway in clause but i do not want to discuss it yet <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i am in a terrible muddle as to what he actually means <e>", "<cs> i could not tell an organically-grown swede from a non-organically grown swede if they were dished up on my plate but that is another matter <e> <s> some people however like the idea of an organically-grown swede or whatever <e> <s> organic farming is as my noble friend lord radnor said extremely difficult to define and there is a problem <e> <s> if adas gives advice on organic farming is that conservation farming or is it increased-profit farming <e> <s> it produces yet another muddle as regards the adas charge <e>", "<cs> i must support my noble friend lord buxton and the noble lord lord john-mackie to the greatest of my power <e> <s> i cannot conceive of an exercise that is going to cause more muddle than trying to separate conservation charges animal welfare charges and profit charges <e> <s> i asked my noble friend on an earlier amendment whether organic farming was conservation or profit making and answer came there none <e> <s> if an adas officer was to advise that the use of spray x meant that while ones yield of weeds might be slightly higher there would be more partridges and there would still more or less be the same yield of wheat is that conservation or agricultural advice <e> <s> it is impossible to separate <e>", "<cs> i especially underline that point because the noble lord the minister has just said to my noble friend lord peel that dividing lines are difficult to arrive at <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment and it seems to me that what we are asking the minister to do not by statute but by a code or guideline is to put some flesh onto the bones of clause <e> <s> clause as i said before is very much to be welcomed <e> <s> i shall not repeat my earlier criticisms of the charges for adas but those views do not in any way detract from my generally keen suport for much in the bill <e> <s> this amendment would be a help to everybody private people and also possibly adas who is involved in the care of the countryside <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will agree to this amendment or something very similar which would produce the same effect <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend finally withdraws the amendment perhaps i may offer what i hope is a constructive idea that the model should be a kind of advisory circular issued by the department of education or by the department of the environment on planning matters <e> <s> what we should like the ministry to do is to produce an advisory circular which does not need to be extremely detailed which beefs up clause a little bit <e> <s> if that were done then all the advisers or whoever it may be will know in what intellectual and physical climate they are being asked to work <e> <s> that is really what we want <e> <s> whether or not the wording is correct i am certainly not qualified to judge but that is the kind of circular that my noble friend and i should like to see <e>", "<cs> is it not also true that the landlord could sell the quota over the tenants head <e> <s> quotas are worth a lot of money <e> <s> they could be sold just like that and the tenant would be landed with a great many cows a milking parlour and no quota <e>", "<cs> i have listened to most of the discussion <e> <s> it reminds me of the irishman who when asked the way to so-and-so said i would not be starting from here <e> <s> it also reminds me of schleswig-holstein and palmerstons remark i think that only three people understood it and one was in switzerland <e> <s> would it not be better instead of these highly complicated arrangements to have a system of totally negotiable quotas bought and sold on the open market <e> <s> if then the european community wanted to allow an increase in milk production it would sell some extra quotas <e> <s> if it wanted to reduce milk production it would buy in extra quotas <e> <s> as an investment one would be able to buy a quota not having to be a farmer and lease that quota at p a litre or whatever the price is to someone who is farming <e> <s> that seems miles more sensible and might even be community-wide <e> <s> but the complications the clonmels and the schleswig-holsteins mentioned during this debate have not been understood by most of us <e> <s> i have certainly not done so <e> <s> there must be simpler ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i am an ex-household cavalry officer <e> <s> i admittedly years ago never saw a black face in the life guards i never saw one in the royal horse guards and i never saw one in any of the five regiments of foot guards <e> <s> i suppose it is slightly difficult to have a sikh wearing a turban when he should be wearing a german silver helmet on parade <e> <s> that presents uniform problems which cannot be overcome <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> if we do not have something like this amendment then we shall be like somebody building an aeroplane letting it fly and leaving out the pilot <e> <s> i also have some slight hankerings after imperialism and on this occasion it seems that i am a ministry of agriculture imperialist <e> <s> i want them to be the department that has most to do with looking after the countryside and having a countryside policy <e> <s> if they can show that they can run esas well and if some of their excellent staff can have their minds changed from maximising food production to looking after the countryside at the same time they are the best people to do it <e> <s> that is why i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend continues perhaps i may take him up a little more on this reporting business <e> <s> it is important that there should be some form of discussion document from the ministry as to how it sees the esas continuing <e> <s> perhaps it does not have to be a detailed annual report every time but there should be something <e> <s> if my noble friend could see some way of producing some information for us i am sure that most of us would appreciate it <e>", "<cs> i support my friend my political and real noble friend on this matter <e> <s> once we have had the assertion from him that he will put on the face of the bill that there is going to be proper supervision of these esas it follows as night follows day that there will be some human being a sir humphrey or humphreyette in the ministry of agriculture responsible for them <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is possible to support this amendment more strongly <e> <s> to think that there could be an environmentally sensitive area and then without any by your leave or with your leave you can plonk down barracks of grant-aided conifer trees which are only profitable because of the tax allowances seems to me to make it totally impossible to run an environmentally sensitive area unless forestry is included and included right up to the hilt <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but am i following what the minister is saying <e> <s> is he actually saying that it would be illegal under the treaty of rome for us to accept the amendment of the noble lord lord moran or something very like it <e> <s> if that is the case i am almost prepared to say <e> <s> to hell with the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> we have become slightly sidetracked by the european community and i may be partly responsible <e> <s> it seems to me totally impossible to have an esa policy and yet somebody can plonk or acres of conifers in the middle of it without ruining both the environment and its sensitivity <e> <s> if that is the case it is almost pointless having esas <e> <s> i urge my noble friend to try to find a way round the dilemma <e> <s> it strikes me as a major flaw in what is otherwise an excellent scheme <e>", "<cs> what is worrying large numbers of people on both sides of the committee is this uneven effect as my noble friend says of the fairly large visual destruction <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness used a mellifluous phrase the other day about helicopters large chunks of these forests are what are known as visually intrusive <e> <s> we are worried about these and something ought to be done about them <e> <s> it has been pointed out from the jobs point of view that the planting of forest does not create a lot of jobs because the people who have to look after the trees then displace either grouse keepers or sheep keepers <e> <s> it possibly can be argued that those activities in the countryside produce more long-term jobs but not only that for people are then employed in the tourist industry <e> <s> people do not want to go to look at a large chunk of dark green trees blotting out the whole of a strath <e> <s> but they do want to see a varied and sensitive highland landscape <e>", "<cs> as one of the people who with ineffable smugness forecast this was going to happen i rise to oppose lord melchetts amendment though not because i do not think that he was right to quote some of the gould report which most of the others of us have not seen <e> <s> i think with respect to him he did go on for a little too long but it was an absolutely foreseeable game that was going to be played <e> <s> my only regret is i say this in all honesty that i have not got an sssi because if i had i would be ripping them off with the best without any shadow of doubt at all <e> <s> as clive said when accused of bribery gentlemen i stand astonished at my own moderation <e> <s> i really think that the landowning community can be congratulated on being astonished at its own moderation <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the most sensible thing is first completely to oppose what the noble lord lord melchett is doing and secondly to suggest to my noble friend that it would be much more appropriate for somebody to ask an unstarred question on the whole subject of the gould report <e> <s> then we can talk about it <e> <s> it is not going to go away we must talk about it <e> <s> it is better to face up to things <e> <s> it seems to me that it is being used much too narrowly on this amendment and is therefore not completely appropriate <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer those two points straightaway <e> <s> i am advised that there is buried somewhere in the new clause a right of appeal <e> <s> secondly i have always found rather hollow the argument in favour of compensation for not ruining something <e> <s> if one has a grade i listed building one cannot pull it down and put up a chocolate factory <e> <s> one cannot then apply for planning permission to pull down ones grade i listed building and put up a chocolate factory and when one is refused permission say can i please have some money for not making money out of chocolate <e> <s> that was tried under the planning act <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that boodles applied to pull down their club and put up a new building and got for it in compensation under the silkin act <e> <s> whites were to slow and did not get it <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the idea is being pursued in national parks <e> <s> i am sad that it is not being pursued outside national parks <e> <s> i have a feeling that eventually we shall have some provision like this because it would take away the element of the trough about which we have talked before <e> <s> it is something which would imply positive land management rather than negative encouragement with big bribes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord answers again and to stop him having to speak three times on report stage presumably i am right in assuming that when my noble friend gives an undertaking from the government front bench that certain things are going to happen he is speaking for the government <e> <s> he is not speaking as the noble lord lord melchett implied solely in his own personal capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are in danger of being a little ungracious to my noble friend <e> <s> to expect governments to write clear legislation is surely asking for the moon <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie has written an amendment which to most of us makes complete sense <e> <s> the letter which my noble friend lord belstead has sent to my noble friend lord buxton several of us have had a copy basically says that that is exactly what he is going to do but he has to write it in gobbledegook <e> <s> for heavens sake let us accept the gobbledegook and know that we can never get anything better <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend on the front bench help me on the question of quotas <e> <s> under either this scheme or the government schedule quotas would be bought and sold on the open market <e> <s> it is no use pretending that this is not happening it was reported in the press the other day that quotas are being sold at p a litre in cumberland and they

invented the impartial civil service <e> <s> the fact that people can produce examples of either conservative or labour members of parliament who have been local authority officers does not in any way remove the temptation and the possibility of corruption <e> <s> i use the term corruption in its th century sense <e> <s> one cannot have people subject to outside discipline <e> <s> michael heseltine ceased to be a member of the welsh guards half-way through his national service because he wanted to be a member of parliament <e> <s> he was told that he could not serve in the army and be a member of parliament or even stand for election to parliament <e> <s> that was his choice and i believe a perfectly reasonable one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cobbold has touched on the whole basis of the difficulties of the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> on these rather scruffy bits of paper which i call my notes i have something to say to which i shall return later <e> <s> the noble lord also spoke about inflation the bundesbank the japanese bank and the federal reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords they like being in number downing street <e> <s> they like being in office <e> <s> they like the red boxes <e> <s> so the temptation to bribe the electorate is totally completely and utterly irresistible <e> <s> i make no party political point <e> <s> they have all done it <e> <s> i can see my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter grinning in happy reminiscence of it <e> <s> the corollary of this is that we should have an independent privatised bank of england with a mandate or a royal charter requiring it to control the money supply <e> <s> in that way the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord callaghan or the future countess of finchley will not be entitled to fiddle with the money supply to try to get themselves back into office <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the point i was coming to <e> <s> to encourage an independent central bank with a duty to control the money supply would be extremely useful <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend or his advisers read the excellent article in <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord a very simple question <e> <s> does the power in this bill enable him to amend the bill by order because if that is the case there is hardly any point in going on with the discussion <e>", "<cs> if my noble and learned friend did not put that on the face of the bill presumably he could add it by order afterwards <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend a short question <e> <s> i believe i am not the only layman who is slightly concerned about the size of libel damages and a general oddity it appears about the outcome of libel and slander actions <e> <s> when my noble and learned friend has thought this over and considered what he is going to do will he then do it just by his order-making powers under this bill or will we need a new defamation bill <e>", "<cs> could my noble and learned friend enlighten another non-lawyer on the question raised by the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> it appears that the courts income is more than the courts expenditure which as mr micawber said is a very happy state of affairs <e> <s> if that is so how much of the courts income comes from the treasury and another pocket through legal aid therefore obviously threatening or affecting public expenditure and how much of it comes out of litigants real pockets and consequently does not come out of public expenditure <e> <s> if the latter fears the burden it should be possible to provide more judges at no public expenditure cost <e> <s> or have i got it totally wrong <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws this amendment i should like to say that as a layman it seems to me deeply unsatisfactory that we should be passing acts of parliament when three highly intelligent articulate and well-trained lawyers are arguing over the meaning of one clause <e> <s> that seems unsatisfactory to an ordinary citizen <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble and learned lord lord ackner or my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is right <e> <s> however it seems to me deeply unsatisfactory that they cannot agree about the meaning of this point <e> <s> we should not be passing legislation in that way <e> <s> it should be plain to everybody <e> <s> if two law lords are arguing about the meaning it cannot be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble and learned friend what happens if as a result of the consequences of this bill something is done that is not better and is shown not to be better <e> <s> does it then automatically collapse because it is not better <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the whole of this argument and i have been rather struck by the fact that the solicitor members of the chamber tended to behave slightly like my grandmother who when she was proposed to by my grandfather said marriage is a question of give and take <e> <s> you give and i take <e> <s> it seems to me that the solicitor members of the chamber were saying that the members of the bar must have one rule but if they are members of the solicitors profession and become solicitors advocates they must act by different rules <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord lord mishcon said that is the impression that i as a layman obtained <e> <s> i must say that i listened intently and with care to the debate <e> <s> the cab rank rule seems to me so fundamentally sound and good that it would be wrong if there were not exactly the same rules for solicitors who advocated as advocates as those that apply for any other kind of advocate especially the bar advocates <e> <s> if we depart from that principle we shall produce two classes of advocates one of which can pick and choose and one of which cannot <e> <s> that cannot be right for either justice or equity <e>", "<cs> in this debate i have listened to lawyers who were educated in the s the s and the s <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord alexander of weedon just tipped into the s so he tells me <e> <s> i therefore ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor what if anything is wrong with the present legal education system if it produces advocates of the quality that we have heard in all the debates on the bill <e> <s> if there is nothing wrong with it why should we change it <e> <s> i am in some ways a reasonably conservative sort of chap and that seems to me to be a sound conservative doctrine <e> <s> if there is nothing wrong with something we should not muck it about <e> <s> however one has the impression that there is an urge to tinker muck about and fiddle <e> <s> i have not yet been shown that there is any need to change the legal education system <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend said that there should be a lay majority on the committee <e> <s> can he tell us why <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has still not explained to me or the committee what is wrong with the present legal education system <e> <s> please will he do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend takes notice of the lord justice will he take more notice of the lords of appeal on the courts bill <e> <s> it might be interesting to see the difference in attitude on the advice given <e>", "<cs> as a member of the public who is not a silver tongued advocate even though he might wish to be i give my noble friend on the front bench the views as expressed by a surrey or guildford solicitor to whom i go with regard to my small private affairs of business <e>

because i am certain that he would do a seriously good job <e> <s> but that is neither hither nor yon <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on the the world at one today mr joe haines who was in the office of the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx for most of the time went on record just to say that these rumours about stirring up trouble against political figures and ministers were a load of rubbish <e> <s> he also said that the noble lord lord wilson had made inquiries of the cia about this matter and that they also came up with the view that it was a load of rubbish <e> <s> he did i admit accept that it was possible that one or two of them might have had and i quote a glass <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that with the difficulty of selling large amounts of property certainly in the south-east estate agents books are now very full of property to rent <e> <s> there is now no longer a shortage of property to rent in the south-east of england <e> <s> it may be at the wrong price but there is no shortage of property to rent <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not worth bearing in mind when speaking about sanctions that zambian airlines now advertise that it is the only airline that flies direct from new york to south africa this in spite of president kaunda urging for an increase in sanctions <e> <s> is it not true that the indians import vast quantities of diamonds from south africa through companies in mauritius <e> <s> is there not an immense amount of hypocrisy and humbug involved in the entire sanctions issue <e> <s> is it not the case that in order to produce a much more free and liberal government the south african government will need the help of everyone black and white <e>", "<cs> am i alone in thinking yuk at the idea of trade in gametes and embryos <e> <s> it is repellent and i am not sure that it should be allowed at all under any regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that london water is considerably cheaper and cleaner than perrier water <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is great scope for savings on this issue <e> <s> in the county in which i live there is a private school and a state school <e> <s> the private school had its sports hall burnt down and the state school had its refectory burnt down <e> <s> both acts were committed by the same arsonist <e> <s> the private school has now been completely repaired but because of bureaucratic delay the bulldozers have not even started to move into the state school to

there were those of us who had an inkling two years ago that the poll tax was not the best tax to charge <e> <s> is he further aware that the convolution of his answers has led me to the conclusion that in no way will it last as long as rates which were founded by king james i of blessed memory and that there is no way in which the community charge will last years <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who thinks that <e>", "<cs> my lords the joy of watching a labour peer lecturing the tory front bench on the virtues of adam smith and accusing them of failing in their duty passes all understanding <e>

<s> therefore it is with genuine pleasure that i saw the subject which the noble lord had put down as an unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords when more and more schools become self-governing under the governments education reform act it will presumably mean that fewer and fewer people will need to be employed in local education authorities <e> <s> will not some of those people be retrained and reallocated as bursars and adminstrators who will run schools more efficiently and cost-effectively than overgrown bureaucracies in local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor wants lay members on his advisory committee perhaps it might be mildly appropriate if a lay member of your lordships house for want of a better expression stuck his oar into the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down perhaps i may make a suggestion which will solve his dilemma of whether it should be a circuit judge or a presiding judge <e> <s> can he not simply allow himself the choice in the bill of appointing one or the other <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has suggested that the government are trustworthy on the per cent <e> <s> figure a point with which i totally agree <e> <s> the noble baroness lady blackstone does not agree with loans so she will not want to increase the figure beyond per cent <e> <s> therefore i see no reason for putting anything extra into the bill <e> <s> in both ways per cent <e> <s> will stay <e>", "<cs> as one who quite frequently speaks against his own front bench perhaps i may say that on this occasion i happen to agree with it <e> <s> if i had an undertaking from my noble friend i would be totally happy <e> <s> if i were the noble baroness lady blackstone i would remember <e>", "<cs> my lords the row over the poll tax was predictable is predictable and has turned out to be even worse than those of us who predicted it said it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords can

not a dont know on this bill <e> <s> i know perfectly well that i shall support my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i do so on the ground that i believe the bill is racist <e> <s> it specifies only one type of bestial crime which can be retroactively tried <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that there is a great discrepancy here <e> <s> it is false to attribute costs per pupil because in some areas more money is spent on administration than on teaching <e> <s> there have been cases recently where teachers have been asked to leave while administrators have been recruited <e> <s> that cannot be good for education <e>", "<cs> my lords i live next door to a house in which the late marquess of crewe lived <e> <s> in he led the liberal party in defence of lloyd georges budget which imposed a national insurance scheme upon the people of this country <e> <s> the argument advanced by lord crewe was that we did not have the right to alter national

"<cs> my lords i know that the noble baroness is not and i was not accusing her of being so <e> <s> however it is interesting to note that suddenly the liberal party is going back on the pre- act relating to the lords mucking about with national insurance contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the bundesbank advised chancellor kohl against giving a one-for-one

pressures on the deutschmark because of the reunification of germany <e> <s> will that not place extra pressures on our interest rates if we join the erm which would not arise if we did not join the erm <e>", "<cs> i apologise for arriving slightly late in the debate on this clause but it seems to me that there is a wealth of difference between controlling civil aviation and controlling pollution <e> <s> pollution is a much wider issue and a much less easily defined subject than civil aviation <e> <s> it would seem to me that pollution is much more political than civil aviation so the parallel is not exactly right <e>", "<cs> there is something that i should like to say arising from what my noble friend lord campell said <e> <s> to treat litter pollution or the environment differently in scotland or in wales from in england is to go down the wrong path <e> <s> a dirty blue plastic bag in the tweed is just as nasty as in the river wey <e> <s> litter on the streets of edinburgh is just

<e> <s> i am not sure <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord mcintosh is reaching for a dictionary <e> <s> that is probably helpful <e> <s> i should be hesitant to allow into the bill anything which related pollution to aesthetics <e> <s> a french friend of ours had a daughter who was complaining about her nanny <e> <s> when she was asked why she did not like her nanny her reply was <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that large sums of english taxpayers money have been spent on regional aid for projects such as ravenscraig and the linwood truck plant at various times in the past all of which have ended in failure and gone against the market and all of which have been wasted <e> <s> does he agree that an awful lot of the regional aid goes to japanese machine tool manufacturers has no effect whatsoever on jobs and is a distortion of subsidy <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i add to that point now <e> <s> of course i will not press the amendment to a division <e> <s> it seems to me that this is an intelligent way to approach nature conservancy and countryside matters for the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> as my noble friend lady carnegy has

minister has to say after which i can withdraw the amendment <e> <s> that will enable noble lords to move on to the next issue <e>", "<cs> we have had minutes of full and frank debate i believe that is the expression used in such circumstances <e> <s> i totally support the aims of the government but i am not to tally convinced that a slightly larger body with greater downward management

course between scylla and charybdis <e> <s> i go along with the noble lord lord marsh <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say in defence of my noble friends on the front bench that i remember my noble friend lord denham making the same speech as that made by the noble lord lord cledwyn at a time when some of his friends were on the treasury bench <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear has always made it because she has always been on the liberal benches <e> <s> it is a complaint made by all oppositions at all times <e> <s> governments put on po-faces and say that they are terribly sorry they

great-grandson will hear the same story <e> <s> there is nothing new about it so let us not get upheaved let us allow the government to get their business through <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with considerable diffidence that i refer to the question asked by the noble lord lord leatherland <e> <s> he asked how the disease was transmitted <e> <s> my noble friend omitted to say anything about

nations have over-valued currencies and that when cheap corn is dumped upon them their own agricultural systems are subsequently ruined <e> <s> russia imports something like million dollars worth of grain a year and yet only years ago odessa was the great grain exporting port of the world <e> <s> unless we take all these facts into account and do something about the position there will be quite horrendous trade distortions leading to an impoverishment of world trade <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak in support of my noble friend <e> <s> members of the committee opposite say that people must have quality forced down their throats <e> <s> surely people are capable of knowing the difference between what is quality and what is not <e> <s> to say otherwise is to patronise the vast majority of
