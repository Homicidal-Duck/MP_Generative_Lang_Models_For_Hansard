["<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friends for their kind remarks <e> <s> it is not very easy for me to follow the noble baroness who knows so much and so very personally about this subject <e> <s> my own qualifications for addressing your lordships are tenuous in the extreme <e> <s> as a child i suffered an impairment and i also suffered then and still suffer a disability <e> <s> many years ago when i was a little boy i went to a junior school and suddenly started to stutter and my stutter became progressively worse <e> <s> luckily for me my parents worked out what was wrong which was that i a very much left-handed boy was being forced and i stress the word forced to write with my right hand <e> <s> as this was a fee-paying school my parents insisted that i be allowed to write with my left hand and my stutter slowly diminished and finally disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that my name was not included in the list of speakers i ask your lordships to put that down to my inexperience <e> <s> i am in an invidious position possibly because the noble viscount lord st davids has been helpful to me on friday i was so ignorant about this subject that all i knew was vaguely what the matter was about <e> <s> since the week-end i have learned much more and i am afraid i am going to take issue with the noble viscount on several points <e>", "<cs> i think that the right reverend prelate was quite correct when he was talking about the cutting up of the cake and getting per cent <e> <s> but i fear somehow that he has missed the point <e> <s> the point which the noble baroness was making was that we have one group of special people who are disabled <e> <s> if you look at the other subjects mentioned you have got mathematics and you have got environmental education <e> <s> the point that has been missed is that a disabled person integrated into a normal school can still study mathematics can still study the environment but your mathematical person will not necessarily be disabled <e> <s> so cutting up the cake does not really matter so long as we get one group of people who can study all the other things you want <e> <s> the only thing that we are saying is that these people are disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i must admit that i am not exactly surprised that there have been so few prosecutions although i am appalled <e> <s> if i may i should like to quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon <e> <s> is the noble minister aware that the department of transport on th december issued a circular in which referring to the orange badge scheme they stated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask whether she is aware that there would appear to be now an active black market in orange badges which were supplied to people who have since died and instead of the badges being returned to the authority which they should be the badges are being sold on the open market to active people <e>", "<cs> i oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill because word for word it is contained in paragraph and of schedule to the social security act <e>", "<cs> if i may refer back to what the noble baroness has said i should like to point out that in the hospital to which i was referring all the patients are in separate rooms and so far as i know there are not any big wards although there may be some <e> <s> but the person who has these screaming fits is in a private room <e> <s> if these rooms were well soundproofed it would be all right but they are not soundproofed and the girls screams can be heard throughout the hospital <e> <s> but i too would welcome comment by the noble minister <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady lane-fox suggested that if these houses which have been specially adapted for the disabled were sold to anyone the money would go back to the local housing authority and could therefore be spent on producing more housing for the disabled <e> <s> i have a nasty feeling that this would not be the case far from it in fact <e> <s> i feel that it i were working for a local housing authority and we all know that money is very scarce these days i would be disinclined to spend my taxpayers or ratepayers money on adapting houses for the disabled if i knew that in a few short years that house could be sold off and bought by someone who was not disabled <e> <s> i therefore support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord tordoff i do not believe that the bill goes far enough <e> <s> however i welcome the bill because at least it is a step in the right direction and goes some way towards keeping cowboys off the roads <e> <s> to my mind the worst thing about cowboys a point that has been mentioned already is that because they are not trained and because they are not experts they pass on to the people they are pretending to teach to drive the bad habits they have picked up and have been using for years <e> <s> one of the worst habits one sees it every <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e> <s> the commission may have to look at important business and with a small commission of only four or six members there need only be illness pressure of business or holidays and the odds would be against there being a sufficient number to carry out the business <e> <s> that is all that i wanted to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his answer but is he aware that there are many hospitals and homes with long-term patients who are denied the right to receive incoming telephone calls <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that anybody has made the point that if you can find a telephone directory it will be a to d when you require it to be s to z and if the telephone directory you require is there the chances are that the page you want has been torn out <e> <s> i was in oxford street a short time ago and could not find a single telephone box which contained even one telephone directory <e> <s> if the telephone service can supply all the directories which would fill up a rather large room i see no reason why people should not pay for this service <e> <s> however since that is impossible i agree with the noble lord that this service should be made free of charge <e> <s> i trust that your lordships will have noticed that i am the first person who has not taken the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone to task for being the only person in your lordships house who has not found the telephone directory service to be fast efficient and courteous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> will he not agree that it is ironic that of the volume car maufacturers in this country there is only one which is british owned and that is british leyland

people who cannot read be in that group <e> <s> thirdly may i ask whether foreigners who cannot read english will also be included in the group <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be following the noble earl and should like to thank him for his calm and reasoned speech <e> <s> i will if i may say one thing first and that is that last november in another place i saw this compilation of video nasties produced by the police <e> <s> i know the noble baroness lady masham was there too and i should like to thank the noble baroness lady macleod for asking lord houghton of sowerby that very important question as to whether he had ever seen a video nasty <e> <s> those of us who saw these things were sickened <e> <s> those of us who saw them may be passionately for this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too <e> <s> have pleasure in supporting this amendment <e> <s> i must admit that i do not have the corrected wording as regards both amendment no <e> <s> and this amendment <e> <s> however i know that the noble baroness lady masham was not happy with the wording <e> <s> i do not know the new wording but if it clarifies the position then i am perfectly happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i have one message to the noble lord from the noble baroness lady masham who apologises that she could not be here <e> <s> she had to go abroad with her family <e> <s> she has asked me to say she supports this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by declaring a pecuniary interest because when i retire i shall be in receipt of a minuscule pension from british railways having worked on the southern region for seven years <e> <s> i believe that at todays rate that pension will buy me approximately one pint of beer a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is impossible at the moment but i am reliably informed that with the use of electronic pick-ups the position of every bus could be monitored in a central control so that one could see where buses are being delayed <e> <s> the centre <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i go quite so far as the noble lord lord renton but personally i am worried about the british board of film censors <e> <s> one of the video nasties that the police showed to us was part of a film that had been passed for public showing by the british board of film censors <e> <s> it may have been all right as a film in the cinema <e> <s> when you translate a cinema film to a video and when a nasty part of the film can be played time and time again that is another matter <e> <s> what worries me is that a well-meaning man who was very much an expert could pass a certain film with a certain category for viewing in the cinema and then turn round put on the other hat for the video and say i have passed it to be seen at the age of in the cinema <e> <s> i shall therefore do the same for the video <e> <s> whoever is responsible for the classification of videos must appreciate the wide range of things that can be done with a modern video which cannot be done in the cinema <e>", "<cs> i do not have an nbc tie unfortunately but i support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> as has been said how can there be an integrated transport system in greater london when there is one chunk of it which the government do not even accept should be consulted <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for what he has said and in view of this i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i will if i may start off on a slightly different tack <e> <s> on monday last week in your lordships chamber it was said in so many words that it is not easy to forget the disabled we do not get a chance to <e> <s> that is true but it is wrong in implying that the disabled have made their point and enough is enough <e> <s> what was said was true because since i have been attending your lordships chamber regularly that is since last october we have had two bills on disablement we have had the telecommunications bill the housing and building control bill and the rates bill all with a high content about the disabled <e> <s> at present we have the london regional transport bill going through committee <e> <s> again today we have the health and social security bill on which <e> <s> incidentally i shall be restricting myself to clause i <e> <s> yes it has not been easy to forget the disabled in this house but the reason is very simple <e> <s> in bill after bill the government have neglected to pay attention to the specific needs and requirements of the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to brief <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble earl lord avon for explaining his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may interest the house to know that we have recently started in barnet a dial-a-ride service <e> <s> we have been promised a grant by the glc to cover the adaptation of two vehicles the appointment of two full-time drivers and co-ordinator <e>", "<cs> my lords i support fully what my noble friend lord tordoff has said but i should like to add one suggestion <e> <s> the new organisation has to discuss matters with various bodies including british rail <e> <s> does not the minister feel that there is a chance that lrt will discount the importance of the national bus company because the government have persistently refused to include them <e> <s> i feel also that the general public may well say the national bus company and all its subsidiaries cannot be very much because the government have not included them in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew that if we waited long enough there was bound to be in this bill something that we liked and could recommend <e> <s> there has been much in this bill that has been awful but in our opinion this is an excellent amendment and we are all for it <e> <s> the noble lord the minister mentioned a figure of million as being the sum being fiddled or stolen from london transport <e> <s> personally i believe the figure is very much higher than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to season tickets and thinking specifically of the underground <e>", "<cs> my lords i had a season ticket for a short time and i certainly did not have a photograph on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for what he said <e> <s> i accept his clarification although i think he will admit that when one read the bill it looked like restrospective legislation <e> <s> i accept that it is probably not <e> <s> i should like to read carefully what the minister said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord campbell of croy told us a short time ago of his per cent <e> <s> disability allowance arising from the war <e> <s> as we all know the noble lord may be slightly unsteady on his pins but he can certainly walk unaided through the division lobbies <e> <s> he has good eyesight and he speaks clearly <e> <s> as he has said he has an per cent <e> <s> disability <e>", "<cs> i was not going against what the noble lord said <e> <s> the letter i have states that even under the new scheme this woman will not be able to claim <e>

of a case it must know what it is saying <e>", "<cs> if i heard him correctly the noble lord the minister said that the logical cut-off age was but that they had made it because as most people left school at the age of there would still be four years <e>", "<cs> i personally am against intimate body searches for various reasons but i am far far more against anyone and anything to do with drugs <e> <s> therefore i have pleasure in supporting the noble baroness lady masham of ilton in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i supported the noble baroness and said at that time

and <e> <s> ferdinand de lesseps built the suez canal but i had my canal rebuilt by mr elton a surgeon <e> <s> i am sorry to say that there is no way i would allow a non-medical person to search me

studies this white paper the more one studies the expert reasoned and logical arguments against some of its main conclusions and proposals <e> <s> in fact in todays debate with the exception of the noble lord lord mottistone as one listens to what your lordships have been saying there is only one conclusion that can be drawn that all the government are doing in this white paper is pursuing their doctrinaire and blinkered policy of privatisation which in this white paper is masquerading as deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel rather guilty having heard what my noble friend lord ezra said about noble lords doing their homework and certainly hearing that the noble lord lord carmichael had studied the papers and so on <e> <s> i have to admit that the only briefing i have had is one i received from british rail which was sent to me because i am an ex-employee <e> <s> my experience over a period of years is on monday mornings after the general managers conference at waterloo

lord henderson of brompton for the setting up of a disability council <e> <s> i do not mind whether it is to be called a disability council or a handicap council <e> <s> when talking about the disabled i include the blind and i also believe that old age is in itself a disability <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> it seems strange that while we have national institutions to look after the interests of children animals the arts and sport we do not have a council to look after the interests of those who apart from animals are the least able to look after themselves and therefore require our help <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for this interjection but i did not expect to be present for the debate <e> <s> luckily the meeting which i had expected to attend was cancelled <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady macleod on introducing this bill <e> <s> before the noble lord lord mishcon spoke i had written down that i thought that

the hours and hours that we spent discussing this bill and i thought oh no not again <e>", "<cs> my lords the main argument of the noble lord lord beloff against my noble friend lord tordoffs amendment was that it would not work because people have different requirements <e> <s> it seems to me that it is impossible to think of any consumer group where everyone has exactly the same idea <e>

thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> in view of the number of beds being closed will the minister agree that it would be more sensible to cut down on the number of pen-pushers and paper-shufflers rather than cutting down on the number of nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare an interest in that i am the chairman of a public relations and marketing company that has as one of its clients ravenhead glass which sells two out of every three glasses supplied to the licensing trade <e> <s> before my noble friend lord falkland spoke i was quite sure that i would be

its clients one of the largest container companies in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to congratulate the noble lord lord nugent of guildford upon initiating this bill <e> <s> i also wish to congratulate the noble lord lord cobbold on his maiden speech <e> <s> i must be honest however i would not exactly have said that he was uncontroversial <e> <s> but he did bring up some very interesting points <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls famous forbear is claimed to have said in so many words when putting a telescope to his blind eye i see no signal <e> <s> i know that is not

other day i went to my local licensed gun dealer and handed in my rifle and ammunition i had no reason to have it <e> <s> as the noble earl lord nelson said there are people holding firearms today who have no earthly reason to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak against the amendment <e> <s> i have always supported the needs of the disabled <e> <s> if one permits the use of a self-loading rifle with a magazine that will hold only four rounds will not a larger magazine that can carry eight or rounds be available <e> <s> if that were the case this would not he a very good amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the noble and learned lord and also what was said by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> certain noble lords have put forward the view that boys from public school on their hols going to private estates for shooting is a fine thing <e> <s> however one must also consider the year-old boys where there is no private estate <e> <s> it would be wrong to allow them to use guns <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate the minister <e> <s> it is my personal view that those amendments that were good were accepted and those that were not failed <e>", "<cs> my lords these orders are normally non-contentious and minor and go through on the nod <e> <s> that cannot be said of this order <e> <s> the noble lords lord tordoff and lord underhill have said it all <e> <s> i shall not waste your lordships time by repeating what they said <e> <s> however i shall take up the case mentioned by the noble lord lord underhill of the

satisfactory answer as to what is a reasonable person <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> i suggest that an unreasonable distance is such distance as a reasonable person would consider unreasonable <e>", "<cs> this is a sensible amendment <e> <s> if it misses anything it is in the words used by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> i also wondered why amendments nos <e> <s> and were not grouped together because to do so appears to be logical <e> <s> as the noble lord lord lucas has said if you are going to teach someone to drive for payment you must be qualified <e> <s> however under this bill if you are going to teach someone the rudiments of riding a motorcycle for payment then you need have no qualifications at all <e> <s> in a car the driving instructor sits beside the driver whereas it is a very brave man who would sit on the back of a motorcycle to teach someone to ride it <e> <s> therefore presumably that tuitition wil be done not on the bike but by standing alongside or running after it <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that a qualification is needed to prove that instructors are capable of such teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest namely that in three or four years time i shall be in receipt of a small pension from british rail <e> <s> i spent seven years of my life as the assistant public relations officer at waterloo <e> <s> at least the first two or three words spoken by the noble lord lord sefton of garston this afternoon pleased me <e> <s> he said that he thought that we were going to do something constructive and all that we have been doing so far is attacking br <e> <s> that is what everyone seems to do <e> <s> i could spend the whole of my seven minutes taking each argument against

largest glass tableware manufacturer in the country <e> <s> by tableware i mean drinking glasses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by declaring an interest in that approximately three years time i shall be in receipt of a small pension from british rail <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord underhill on initiating this debate <e> <s> it brought to mind something which happened a few years ago <e> <s> a noble lord with a slightly critical tone in his voice said that we always seemed to be debating the disabled <e> <s> i replied that the reason for that was very simple we needed to do so <e> <s> the same complaint could well be aimed at us today in that this is by no means the first debate we have had on transport <e> <s> again the answer must be that we need it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be exceptionally brief in order to give time for the noble lord lord tordoff to wind up and for the noble viscount to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a certain amount of sympathy with the noble lord <e> <s> however i would feel happier if the amendment related to any part of any factory machinery <e> <s> i do not agree with subsection b <e> <s> i have knowledge of machinery i believe that we should certainly not accept the second part of the amendment <e> <s> if someone has not been trained in the cleaning of machinery and a person supervising has turned away for just a second the untrained person could do something dangerous <e> <s> to support that argument you have only to see the number of skilled machinists who although they are trained and skilled still experience bad accidents <e> <s> moreover on certain types of machinery a small accident tends not to lead to a small cut it may well lead to the loss of a hand or a limb <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe to speak because not only am i in receipt of a pension from british rail but i worked for seven years on southern region <e> <s> i should however like to thank the noble viscount for his considerate words regarding british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say only a few words because the noble lord lord tordoff has said everything <e> <s> these are sensible regulations and i support them per cent <e> <s> i wish that all private vehicles carried equipment showing the speed at which they were travelling so that it could <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by congratulating the noble lord lord mountevans upon tabling this unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords i read in the papers the other day that according to a recent survey the exchequer loses million a year through people failing to licence their cars <e> <s> my poor mathematics therefore leads me to believe that over million people dodge the tax <e> <s> it would be a great help if instead of going into the exchequer that money went towards helping london <e> <s> eighty per cent <e> <s> of all cars going into london receive some financial help <e> <s> of those at least per cent <e> <s> are company cars <e> <s> i am not against company cars but it seems to me that most of the cars only have one person in them that is the driver <e> <s> i must admit that i myself do not often drive into london <e> <s> i hold the strong belief that people are given company cars as a status symbol <e> <s> that is fine but therefore they use those cars <e> <s> they drive into london park possibly in a company car park and in the evening drive home <e> <s> they never use the car during the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i should start by damning the noble lord lord ezra with faint praise <e> <s> this bill is rather like the curates egg good in parts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i claim to be something of an expert in this matter <e> <s> i wished to put her right in that if she bought a car and saw the needle quivering that would not necessarily mean that it had been clocked <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by saying that i am implacably opposed to clause and the adoption of schedule to the local government miscellaneous provisions act <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes said if i heard her correctly that the average family car travels about miles a year <e> <s> i suggest to her that she has got the figure wrong and that the figure is about half that <e> <s> the noble earl who has just spoken has given the house facts and figures <e> <s> i shall not bore your lordships by repeating them <e> <s> however i shall recount just one or two true stories about black cabs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord nugent of guildford upon putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> it seems to me that it follows on very nicely from the previous debates we have had in your lordships chamber <e> <s> we had a transport debate on th january one on london traffic on th january and the debate on the motor trade consumer protection bill on nd february <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by congratulating the noble lord lord birkett on introducing this short debate <e> <s> though i am in full agreement with a nationwide lottery i diverge from his views as to what should be covered by it <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord will like that and neither will the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester like what i am going to say now <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth said especially as regards parking in central london <e> <s> if i understand correctly what the noble baroness said it was that each borough needed to make its own parking arrangements and she quoted covent garden <e> <s> however there is nothing to prevent different parking arrangements being made for different areas of london <e>

question with me beforehand that i am naturally disappointed <e> <s> is it not strange that airline pilots bus drivers and drivers of heavy goods vehicles are restricted by law as to the number of hours they can work without a rest period but this does not apply to merchant navy officers <e> <s> does he further agree that unless the hours that are being worked at present are substantially reduced there is the potential for a catastrophic accident with massive loss of life and damage to the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by apologising to the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington as i started a coughing attack right behind her while she was making her speech and then had quickly to leave <e> <s> i also apologise to the house for the fact that having left i did not come back until just before i was due to speak <e> <s> there is nothing more off-putting than trying to make a speech on an important subject and hearing someone coughing and spluttering behind <e> <s> luckily my wife was here and she suggested that i take a sip of port unfortunately not vintage port and breathe it in <e> <s> that seems to have done the trick <e> <s> i am not sure how long my voice will hold out but if i make a short speech i am sure that it can only be to the gratification of noble lords <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not having been present at the beginning of the discussion on the amendment <e> <s> unfortunately my wife is in the cambridge military hospital in aldershot <e> <s> i had to visit her and then drive to the chamber from there <e> <s> i wrote to the noble lord lord stanley of alderley to inform him that i would support his amendment <e> <s> however as i was nor present at the beginning of the discussion on the amendment i may inadvertently repeat some of the arguments which have already been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for supplying the background notes which i am sure all noble lords found most useful <e> <s> during the falklands conflict the social democratic party was in the vanguard of those supporting her majestys government <e> <s> i am happy to say that during the present trouble in the gulf we fully support her majestys government <e> <s> i have visited the falklands and various army units <e> <s> there it was said the falklands situation was wonderful because we knew that the prime minister was backing
