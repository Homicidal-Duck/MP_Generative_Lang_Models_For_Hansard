["<cs> my lords my interest in the subject matter of this debate is that i have a legal practice and that i am very much aware at second hand of the many frustrations felt by private landlords and private tenants in flats and converted houses in the inner areas of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord robertson for introducing this important yet simple bill <e> <s> the virtue and importance of the measure seem to lie in the effort it makes to restore parliaments intention to section <e>", "<cs> my lords i also shall be talking about clause of the bill <e> <s> i wish that i could say to my noble friend be of good cheer relief is at hand <e> <s> although i come in to bat at no <e> <s> i also have a few reservations about clause and my noble friend will have to wait for succour from another quarter <e> <s> i have no connection of any type with any housing association charitable or otherwise <e> <s> i merely see in the haphazard spreading of the right to buy to more tenants yet another instance of state interference in the affairs of what is the private housing sector <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what my noble friend has said and i must obviously apologise if the wording of my amendment has not made the type of change in the law that i was trying to achieve as clear as i would have liked <e> <s> i appear to have left the impression with my noble friend that this is a rival clause to the amnesty provided by the government in clause of the bill <e> <s> i have not wished to produce an amendment which would absolve housing <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest another reason why my noble and learned friend might take away the words reasonable grounds and think again about them <e> <s> it seems to me that reasonable grounds are what an occupier of land might have to show if he was defending some form of action against an entrant but not what an entrant should have to show an occupier <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in sympathy with my noble friends bill because it contains a number of the radical changes which i myself would have wished to see enacted by the party which i support when it returned to power four years ago <e> <s> then would have been the time to liberate the private landlord and his tenant to allow time to demonstrate again that responsible contractual freedom can be made to work <e> <s> nevertheless now may not be too late <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment seeks to say that in certain circumstances a tenant farmer should pay more than the market rent <e> <s> that seems to me so far against the whole feeling of the bill that i do not think that this is a harmless amendment and in my view it is one that should be resisted <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i think the layman who is looking at the clause is going to ask why the circumstances should be exceptional <e> <s> if there are circumstances which render it inequitable why should those circumstances be exceptional <e> <s> i understand exception as meaning very much out of the ordinary <e> <s> i have in mind the case we have heard of many times before the young girl who marries a rich man and walks off and takes a share of his fortune <e> <s> i do not think that in a laymans use of the word that would be called an exceptional case it is a fairly ordinary one <e> <s> if an ordinary case is inequitable there is no need for the word exceptional <e>", "<cs> my noble friend was very quick to chide the noble baroness lady nicol for apparently changing sides since her party introduced the leasehold reform act but my noble friend will not have forgotten the hostility with which his party greeted the leasehold reform act then first on the ground of the confiscatory nature of the compensation which was to be paid by an enfranchising tenant and secondly if i remember correctly where it affected such bodies as charities <e> <s> at a later stage i shall be speaking to my amendment no <e> <s> in which i seek to exclude the effect of the leasehold reform act altogether from this bill <e> <s> but i should like to say that i shall not find it possible to vote against this amendment if it goes to a division <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend did answer my point <e> <s> he certainly answered points that i had not made and i think he also answered points that i may be making in a speech on a later amendment <e> <s> but so far as i can see his attitude is directed not so much to the question of leasehold enfranchisement as to pushing forward a very strong line in official paternalism <e> <s> however at this stage in todays debate i do not wish to push the matter to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> it is clear that we belong to a broad church and i suspect that we may belong to more or less the same wing of it <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord monson for his contribution and his support of my amendment <e> <s> in view of what my noble friend has said i willingly ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend is able to give similarly illuminating information about pedestrians who are involved in road accidents where death occurs and are found to be inebriated <e>", "<cs> my lords having failed to read the amendment correctly at my first attempt i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it will be for the convenience of the house for me to speak now to amendment no <e> <s> b which stands in my name and which cannot be called if the amendment now before the house is passed <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend passes from that the point which i was making did not concern the acquisition of a freeholding by a lessee who had acquired a long lease <e> <s> i simply pointed out that an extended lease could be acquired and i do not think there is any dispute between any of us that that long lease would be on very favourable terms indeed to the tenant when compared with the price which he would have to pay to buy a freehold under the direct acquisition of the freehold terms <e> <s> i was not concerned with the possibility that the tenant might extend his lease and then try to buy the freehold <e> <s> i agree that there is room for doubt there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble and learned lord and the right reverend prelate in extending a very warm welcome to the maiden speech of my noble friend lord reading <e> <s> i noted how he drew authority from the old testament and from early incidents in the new testament in words which i found moving and personally convincing <e> <s> i hope that we may hear from him again on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords because this is the first time that i have spoken in this chamber about northern ireland matters and because of my family political history in the first quarter of this century affecting northern ireland i would ask your indulgence if for a moment i explain that i speak here purely as an englishman <e> <s> my family connection with northern ireland and ireland i view as having terminated regrettably many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to confine myself almost entirely to a consideration of and comments on part i of the bill which deals with the disciplining by the law society of solicitors who fail to produce good professional work <e> <s> it strikes me that the proposed measures are an uneasy attempt to penalise a solicitor who does bad work by compensating his victim <e> <s> there seems to be a danger here that we shall fall between all sorts of stools and nobody will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for dealing so fully with my little amendment <e> <s> he will not expect me to share his view of the authoritarian manner in which the council of the law society should discipline its members but i said before that i was not going to ask for the formal decision of the committee this afternoon and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will not mind if i extricate myself most gently from his suggestion that on this present debate the noble lord lord hatch has in any way invoked my name in vain <e> <s> i think that i can say that standing at one end of the spectrum as a solicitor and with him at the other end of the spectrum as a consumer although we might disagree as to what should be done if clause did not stand part of the bill we are both in complete agreement that clause as it is at the moment is not likely to benefit either the solicitor or the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this bill <e> <s> i so much agree with what has already been said that i am able to be brief <e> <s> i particularly welcome clause and the equivalent provisions for scotland which deal with the pernicious rash of applications to put whole floors of new flats on top of existing blocks <e> <s> i know many people in blocks in central london who for years have been subjected to the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not their landlords or perhaps the owners of that part of the sky immediately above their roofs were going to succeed in their game of cat and mouse with the local authority and be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for his kind words in explanation of what he said in committee <e> <s> of course i entirely accept what he now tells the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like for a moment to pursue the question of whether these powers are not already in the solicitors act and if not what follows from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is correct to say that we have been going over this ground for the whole of the afternoon and that there is no more to be said on this particular aspect of it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also prepared to offer at least qualified support for the amendment at <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with amendment no <e> <s> which is in the name of the noble lord lord kennet and some of the arguments with which he has presented it <e> <s> his amendment seeks to obviate the need to introduce the mental health aspect as a cover for the trimming operations which some women may require <e> <s> on the other hand i find it very difficult to go much further than this for three reasons <e> <s> the noble lord has already referred to the first the fact that his amendment at present provides that operations required in connection with physical health may be carried out without the assistance of a registered medical practitioner <e> <s> secondly it seems to me that his amendment makes no provision for the case where there may be something substantially wrong with a woman such as a gross physical abnormality which cannot be dealt with by a minor cosmetic operation however widely you interpret those words but is a matter which is causing distress and yet it is not a matter of physical health <e> <s> i believe that that falls through the net provided by the noble lords amendment <e> <s> however the more serious reservation <e>", "<cs> i am with the noble lord on that and i am trying to help him by drawing attention to what he and i would agree is something that ought to be included if it is possible <e> <s> however the third and substantial reason why i cannot support him is his antipathy to the use of the words custom and ritual and i shall return to that <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest that the sort of non-medical factor that the noble lord lord hatch would exclude from the consideration of the doctors is something as simple as abnormality because if someone is becoming depressed from mere abnormality that is surely a non-medical factor <e> <s> is that the sort of factor that he wishes to stand in the way of the operation <e>", "<cs> i should like to tell the noble lord lord hatch that i felt that this amendment was inappropriate when he moved it at committee stage <e> <s> i still feel it inappropriate because in my view it would have the effect of excluding all operations which are otherwise permitted by subsection except those necessary for the physical health of the person on whom the operation was performed <e> <s> the illustration that i gave to your lordships in committee was of physical abnormality <e> <s> the effects of physical abnormality on a person may be to enable someone to say that she requires the operation on mental grounds <e> <s> but if the noble lord lord hatch has his way if he moves this amendment and it is passed i shall still remain of the opinion that operations for abnormality whether they are called for on grounds of mental health or whether they are merely demanded by the person as a matter of choice will be totally ruled out by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend will explain something of the nature of the evidence that satisfies him that the level of fines proposed is sufficient to deal with the commercial agency point <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend said in answer to a point made by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow noble lords in dealing with the problems of shopworkers <e> <s> we shall come to that at a later stage <e> <s> my noble friend lord sandford referred to the cogent speech of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> indeed it was cogent <e> <s> he seemed particularly concerned with every day being a polling day in the local supermarket <e> <s> i do not propose to follow him down the populist line approach there <e> <s> the noble lords lord jacques and lord stallard answered the point that he was making about the propriety or otherwise of the amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will agree that it is perfectly proper notwithstanding the failure to pass the amendment at second reading <e> <s> the noble and learned lord it seemed to me would rather that we had no committee debate at all on the question of sunday opening <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves the point of the per cent <e> <s> who shop on sundays if it is correct that only about per cent <e> <s> of the shops that are open are trading illegally perhaps i am wrong there and per cent <e> <s> of people are shopping on sunday surely that means that per cent <e> <s> are basically satisfied to shop on sundays under the conditions that exist at the moment <e>", "<cs> the point made by the noble baroness lady seear is surely a good one <e> <s> my noble friend is wrong <e> <s> even if the tribunal orders reinstatement and i think it is right that they rarely do there is no compulsion for an employee to be reinstated <e> <s> i am sure the law recognises that where an employer and employee do not get on the only solution is compensation and not reinstatement <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord selkirk started his speech by quoting from the press and in particular from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word which may go beyond the drafting of paragraph <e> <s> this is the question of the employee being <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words to what the noble and learned lord has said about the meaning of the word surrogacy <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is of course correct <e> <s> the meaning which he adduces is that used in the warnock report <e> <s> paragraph of the report states <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could help my noble friend to come to a working relationship with the definition of surrogate mother in the act and in the bill if i suggest to him that he might think of surrogate and mother as both being nouns so that when he is thinking of substitute mother he is thinking of somebody who is at once a substitute and a mother <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble earl that not only shall i be withdrawing the amendment but also that i do not propose to reserve my position to reintroduce the amendment at a later stage <e> <s> i am aware that the amendment presents certain difficulties <e> <s> nonetheless we have had a useful debate <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for his observations especially <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble earl has taken this opportunbity to explain his reasons for introducing this amendment to the act <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said and consider my position at the next stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not accept that having opened this particular can of worms by introducing this bill it is really up to the government to close the can of worms by legislation now <e> <s> or does he think that no bread is better than half a loaf <e>", "<cs> i shall speak only to amendment no <e> <s> which was moved by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> because i find myself basically in sympathy with it i should like to say in answer to what i think was the only point of substance made in relation to the amendment by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway that i cannot for a moment agree that consent by contract is a fiction in these filling-station cases <e> <s> the amendment is designed to underpin the protection offered by the bill to low-paid <e>", "<cs> i have not spoken on these conveyancing matters on this bill before and so i declare my interest in that i am a practising solicitor <e> <s> i can go a stage further than did the noble lord lord hacking and say that i am basically a general practitioner and a conveyancer as such <e> <s> i am not a specialist conveyancer but i am a conveyancer and so i am very much interested in what happens to this clause and the schedule <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising that point <e> <s> i said that there seemed to be no penalties to deal with the peccadilloes of recognised practitioners <e> <s> i think am right in saying that the penalties to which my noble friend has drawn attention are those which apply to people who pretend to be recognised and who are not actually recognised <e>", "<cs> it will come as no surprise to the committee to learn that i also wish to support the group of amendments inspired by the law society and moved by the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> the amendments are designed to deal with the protection of consumers and if they also have the effect of protecting the profession then in this case what protects the profession protects the consumers and vice versa <e> <s> as the noble lord has made clear these amendments especially those from nos <e> <s> to are intended to ensure that conveyancing corporations are subject to just those disciplines and standards which long and sometimes bitter experience has taught the law society are absolutely essential for the protection of solicitors clients embarking on what are the most financially important transactions of their lives <e> <s> i do not propose at this late hour to go into any detail on the terms of the amendments but i should like to instance something which has come to my attention very recently which throws some light on the sort of problems which arise in conveyancing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly support the amendment but in view of the circumstances that the noble lord has outlined i propose with your lordships leave to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> perhaps fairly quickly and when the time comes i shall not be moving it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return for a moment to the committee stage of this debate and particularly to amendments nos <e> <s> and that we are discussing <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to say that the tenants of flats shall get not one more penny discount than the tenants of houses <e> <s> this flies directly against the experience recounted by my noble friend lord elton at second reading that the take-up in regard to flats is microscopic <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate my noble friend on the support which he has received from the noble lord lord dean of beswick and indeed i draw some comfort from that support for the reasoning behind my amendment <e> <s> however i am sorry that my noble friend sees nothing at all in my amendment <e> <s> i am particularly sorry that he felt that a former tenant who was not compelled to repay the discount was in some way getting away with it <e> <s> i think that is a very bad way of looking at the matter <e> <s> however as i said i put down this amendment as a probing amendment and i now beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean of beswick seems to say that because in the north council tenants do not see the same values in houses as people may do in london and the south-east and do not suffer from the same problem the problem in the south-east should not be tackled <e> <s> i do not think that is right <e> <s> my noble friend has indicated that this matter is under consideration and indeed was under consideration at the time when i put down a question for written answer back in may last year <e> <s> i hope that not long after the passage of this bill his department will be able to lay the necessary order <e> <s> this has been a probing amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether when the noble baroness comes to answer the debate she will indicate why she has proposed to put this ground into the second part of the schedule rather than the third part of the schedule thereby ousting any right of the county court to look into the reasonableness of the authoritys application <e>", "<cs> my lords clause arises from an amendment which i moved in committee on th october and which your lordships then accepted as has been stated <e> <s> the amendment does no more in my view i say this advisedly than put right a valuation anomaly arising under the leasehold reform act as a result of amendments made to that act by section of the housing act <e>", "<cs> my lords some time ago i read carefully the debates of your lordships house <e> <s> at this moment i cannot give the noble lord the quote that he would wish <e> <s> however if the situation had been as he described it i think that those debates would have made clear that this particular way round the amendment was apparently being provided in order to afford enhanced compensation <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord colville for the point he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords before i refer to the amendments which we are discussing i should like to ask for your lordships forbearance while i refer to a misunderstanding which may have been current in the house last week and which was manifested in the speech of the noble lord lord elystan-morgan who took the view and expressed it fairly forcefully that what i had called an anomaly or a loophole was parliaments plain intention <e> <s> moreover he sought to persuade your lordships that that was manifest from the judgment of lord justice fox in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i commend the commons amendment no <e> <s> to your lordships this afternoon <e> <s> the amendment which i moved was designed to deal in a fair manner between freeholders and leaseholders affected in correcting a valuation anomaly which arose through careless legislation in <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister and to my honourable friend the minister in another place for seeing my amendment through <e> <s> i should like also to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord ezra for raising points in third reading in this house which enabled us to see that there was a small handful of tenants whose claim to enfranchise on the old terms was better than the rest <e> <s> this amendment gives effect to the claim of these few tenants and i think makes the clause a better clause than when it was first put before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are all extremely grateful to the noble lord lord hylton for giving us the opportunity this evening to discuss this more than interesting report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her brisk but clear gallop through the terms of this bill <e> <s> i am very pleased to welcome this bill to its second reading <e> <s> it follows as my noble friend said the report of the department of the environments committee of inquiry established in february under the chairmanship of mr nugee to look into the problems arising from the management of privately owned blocks of flats <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to give a very firm welcome to the bill and to the concept of an open register making information regarding land ownership available to those who want it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make new provision for imposing statutory duties in connection with covenants in tenancies against assigning underletting charging or parting with the possession of tenancies without consent <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for the support that they have given the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord silkin had four points on which he found ground to query the law commission report and the conclusions which followed from it <e> <s> first he felt that the law commission was too ready to assume that landlords would not be able to sidestep absolute covenants by automatically including in leases prohibitions against assignment <e> <s> my experience leads me to believe that the law commission is right on this point although it is a matter to which we may return at a later stage <e> <s> i believe that the question of the right to assign is so fundamental to most tenants who are taking leases that the normal imbalance and bargaining power between tenants and landlords to which the noble and learned lord referred and with which i agree in this case does not apply <e> <s> i feel sure that landlords would find it extremely difficult in most cases to be able to dispose of their land on terms that the tenant could not assign <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the words of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i do not think that this amendment is the right one <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned the case of the unassisted rich litigant but there are also many cases where the amendment would be of benefit to those who are fully supported by insurance companies <e> <s> this is not the amendment which the noble and learned lord lord silkin moved in committee <e> <s> that amendment excluded the benefit of change from the unassisted plaintiff <e> <s> i think that there is a case for benefiting the unassisted defendant who is successful <e> <s> i hope that when we reach amendments nos <e> <s> and we shall find a solution which is acceptable to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment put forward by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we have established that the balance to which my noble and learned friend referred dates back to and the legal aid act of that year <e> <s> since that time litigation funded by the state has greatly increased as also has the wealth of the nation <e> <s> it is high time that serious thought was given to shifting the balance a little towards the unassisted defendant who stands to suffer gravely from the law as it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very sorry to hear my noble and learned friend refer to the stretching of resources of the land registry <e> <s> my heart bleeds for the chief land registrar in that respect <e> <s> it is plain that anything that this bill provides for if it is enacted will have to be paid for by those who wish to take advantage of the facilities it offers <e> <s> therefore it is not a question of financial resources but manpower resources <e> <s> i understand that the bill will take a couple of years before the necessary arrangements can be brought into effect to bring it into operation <e> <s> i should have hoped that in that time arrangements of a financial nature might have been made for the land registry to enable it in any instance such as this to produce the necessary manpower resources if the public are prepared to pay for the services <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the group of amendments which have been moved by the minister which will have the effect of ensuring that where a ballot is initiated by the governors the local education authority or the trustees shall have a right to point out to the governors the effect of what is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble duke the duke of norfolk who spoke at report i do not support these amendments which were moved for the first time at report <e> <s> they were foreshadowed in speeches made in committee and at that time i made my own position clear <e> <s> this is that i do not feel that catholic parents should be deprived of the opportunities which are open to other parents of children in the voluntary and the county sectors <e> <s> they would be treated as second-class citizens if they were <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome part i of the bill as a belated attempt by the government to breathe some life into the corpse of the private rented housing sector <e> <s> it is desirable that there should be a right to rent both for landlords and tenants <e> <s> that this bill should be before us in the th year of a conservative administration makes me wonder whether one day perhaps by the end of the century we shall be able to look back and say of the bill as once was said of the legend of st denys that it is the first step which is the difficult one <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he has spoken at considerable length on amendments to clauses and of the bill but is he going to say anything about the effect of the first amendment tabled in his name and what it means <e> <s> further does the first amendment add anything to the provisions protecting tenancies in clause which is not already there <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that amendment no <e> <s> is a paving amendment <e> <s> so far as i can see it adds nothing to the bill and is quite superfluous to it <e> <s> moreover the other amendments tabled in the name of the noble lord stand completely independent to the first amendment <e> <s> therefore i do not see how it can be said to be a paving amendment to anything <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord says may be correct <e> <s> however if that is so why should not the amendments to clauses and be taken at their proper place in the bill when those clauses are reached <e>", "<cs> the noble lord possibly misunderstands the point that i was making <e> <s> it is as follows <e> <s> all the tenancies which the first amendment would bring within the scope of the protection from eviction clause are already in that clause <e> <s> therefore the amendment is quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear that i understand entirely the predicament in which the noble lord lord mcintosh finds himself <e> <s> this is a matter of the practice of the committee <e> <s> i understand that he will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i think that that is quite correct <e> <s> the difficulty which faces the committee with a grouping of this kind is that while the debate is held now many members who have participated in the debates may not be present when the amendments are moved <e> <s> in an hour or twos time when the amendments come up members in the committee or voting may have no idea of what arguments were put forward when the amendments were debated <e>", "<cs> surely the noble earl accepts that rachman is in no sense a product of the act <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend one question about ground <e> <s> subsection c says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has opened up a wide ranging possibility for debate <e> <s> he is i believe speaking to amendments in his name to clauses and <e> <s> i suspect he is also inviting us to look at the other two amendments which emanate from the law society <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh referred to a conviction and my noble friend lord trafford talked about the punishment fitting the crime <e> <s> surely we are here dealing with civil proceedings <e> <s> it has occurred to me during the debate that there is something inherently wrong in any tenant having the benefit of what may be colossal damages <e> <s> i cannot help wondering whether my noble friend will consider bringing back this provision as part of a later clause to amend the protection from eviction act because it seems to me that it is a crime rather than a civil matter <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl who is a noted academic will agree with me that there are many cases when academics from other countries take sabbatical leave come to london on holiday and rent a house for six months <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his acceptance of the amendment and indeed for going further than i had anticipated <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has answered the noble lord lord mcintosh very much better than i could <e> <s> however i think it must be said that if a tenant does not have to prove that his landlord intended the consequences of his actions but that the consequences were merely likely it is only right that there should be a fair balance between landlord and tenant and that this should produce the result that the amendments produce <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i was trying to deal with the very point which the noble lord lord mcintosh is making <e> <s> he does not see why the defence should be extended in the way that my amendments propose it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to refer breifly to the arguments put forward by the noble lords lord stoddart and lord hylton <e> <s> they are behind the times by a long way <e> <s> the right-to-buy legislation already gives tenants the right to purchase the leases of flats <e> <s> already it is perfectly possible for a situation to arise in which a block of flats may be occupied by any number of tenants with a rump of tenants still subject to the local authority <e> <s> to say that a body of tenants should not be entitled to opt for a new landlord does not make sense under the present state of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords ballots are extremely confusing and i should be grateful if in reply the noble lord will correct me in my understanding of his amendment <e> <s> i understand it to mean that if per cent <e> <s> of those eligible to be consulted vote and no more and they all vote in favour of the transfer the transfer will not take place <e> <s> have i misunderstood the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to two questions in relation to part iv of the landlord and tenant act and an amendment contained in the package i should like to thank the minister for these useful amendments to the act <e> <s> they deal with a point that i raised in committee and with other points which appeared to be causing problems <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and i do not see synoptically on the general provisions but i am grateful to him for the introduction of schedule <e> <s> i certainly agree that while the opportunity was here i have tried to extend it a little further than perhaps i could reasonably expect your lordships to sympathise with <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he said about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say quite a few words about two matters before us this afternoon namely the sealing of deeds and the abolition of the rule of law known as the rule in <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord peyton i am reluctant brazenly to interrupt or intervene in this long-standing conversation between the noble lord lord peston and my noble friend <e> <s> however surely the question that the noble lord lord peston asked whether there is evidence that these provisions are needed is not apt <e> <s> this clause is surely needed because the previous clause abolished the <e>", "<cs> before i say anything about the amendment i should like to attempt to put the record straight in one respect <e> <s> it seemed to me as i was coming into the chamber that i heard the noble lord lord prys-davies complaining moderately but complaining nonetheless that a third of the members in the chamber were leaving and that this was what northern ireland business had to suffer from <e> <s> as an english member of this place there are two things that i should say <e> <s> first it has always seemed to me normal that about a third of the members in the chamber leave after question time <e> <s> secondly we have been discussing this business for an hour and a quarter and during most of that time it has seemed to me that we have had a reasonable attendance by members from this side of the sea who have been listening attentively <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate my noble and learned friend on having so strongly concentrated in thought the minds of my profession by publishing these green papers <e> <s> although i understand that many professional interests would like to have been consulted before the papers were published and that the consultation papers are framed aggressively and perhaps provocatively nevertheless through the motion of my noble and learned friend we are today being given a unique opportunity for open consultation and it is clear that we have been ready to take advantage of that opportunity <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to what my noble friend lord renton has just said but i propose to support my noble friends amendment this afternoon as a means of giving the other place another chance to look at the problem which was before them a few months ago <e> <s> i agree that the amendments are defective but there will be another chance for them to be put right elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw attention to one or two aspects of the bill which fall outside the areas of local government housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening when i have not taken part in previous debates <e> <s> however having heard what has been said i cannot help wondering whether the subsection should not read that the director shall have regard to the desirability of there being on consumers committees one or more persons who have experience of and have shown capacity in matters relevant to the provision of electricity supply services <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the debate in committee in this chamber a fortnight ago very much as a bystander <e> <s> i felt that the debate in particular that intiated by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale on the like-for-like amendment went on and on <e> <s> it took in all the amendments that had been put on the marshalled list <e> <s> i felt that that debate was singularly unelightening <e>", "<cs> my lords the result was that on that occasion some noble lords argued one way and some the other <e> <s> but all seemed to agree that by so doing they had proved that clause as it now is was a nonsense and should be taken away and consigned to the dustbin <e> <s> to me it was all rather reminiscent in parliamentary terms of the riot scene at the end of the first act of the mastersingers <e> <s> with respect it settled very little <e>", "<cs> my lords he has brought forward the like-for-like amendment and the limit amendment and put them together into one <e> <s> i wish only to talk about the like-for-like amendment <e> <s> it is well known that a number of authorities have said that the like-for-like principle is correct and is justified <e> <s> i understand that the pearson royal commission said that as well <e> <s> so far as i can see this is not in your lordships debates <e>", "<cs> my lords let me put the point simply in this way <e> <s> if a social security benefit is for loss of earnings and it has as we are to <e>", "<cs> my lords it has all along been the case that the whole thing has been taken as one because <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to speak on contributory negligence then but when my noble friend reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making that point <e> <s> the answer i was giving to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway still stands and i shall not repeat it now <e> <s> i hope that if and when this amendment comes to a division your lordships will reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is i believe the fifth time that we in parliament have discussed child benefit this year <e> <s> one thing that the debates have made clear especially the debate in the other place last night is that the question of uprating will not go away <e> <s> it will certainly not go away while the government leave unanswered the question of whether child benefit may be uprated to take account of inflation one day <e> <s> this is the question to which the noble earl lord russell referred and which was put to my right honourable friend the secretary of state by my right honourable and honourable friends in the other place last night <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i can usefully follow the interesting scottish by-paths introduced by my noble friend lord campbell of croy but i have no doubt that they will interest my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> i am delighted to have my amendment correctly identified as amendment no <e> <s> nb <e>", "<cs> i shall have to consider carefully what my noble friend has said on what i find is a very complicated subject <e> <s> there are two points i wish to make <e> <s> the first is if i understood him correctly that he was saying that it might be relevant to consider the amount as regards a tenant entitled to have the rates back from the landlord <e> <s> i do not believe that is correct <e> <s> it seems to me that if the tenant has paid rates to the landlord and the tenant is not liable for the community charge he is still perfectly entitled as against the landlord to have the rates back <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has kindly said that he would answer any points that arise on schedule and the new introductions by the government <e> <s> my questions are directed to ascertaining to what extent if at all the provisions of schedule affect act leases which have well and truly expired and gone into the continuance period before th january <e> <s> can the minister explain the significance of a tenancy which is deemed to be a long tenancy in clause <e> <s> are these tenancies deemed to be long tenancies to be found in the act <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i remain in support of the principle behind this amendment but as in committee i feel disturbed by the actual terms of it <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that subsection of the new clause which the noble lord proposes has disappeared from the marshalled list <e> <s> however if this follows the clause before us in committee that is to provide that it would be an offence for the landlord to collect an amount previously attributable to the rates i should be inclined to continue my reservations as to the actual terms of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not withdraw the amendment in the light of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i have put forward what i think is an improvement to the bill and what would certainly bring it into conformity with the original expressed intentions of the government and relieve a lot of anxiety on the part of many lessees whose leases are going to expire in the period leading up to <e> <s> as i have said i consider that the whole clause should be taken out of the bill and in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is clearly adamant on this point and for the same reason as with the previous amendment i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested in my noble friends digression into the history of the nugee committee report the act and the governments acceptance of the idea of commonhold <e> <s> i do not think that they have very much to do with the issue before the house tonight but in the absence of any support and in view of the lateness of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am considerably reassured by what my noble friend said <e> <s> i should still have thought that the government could give consideration to looking not so far back as the act when they come to deal with this point <e> <s> the precedent in the act is clear and it should be written on to the face of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to my noble friend for his assurance <e> <s> i shall read what he said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend seems to assure the house that there are no loopholes here to be closed <e> <s> i shall obviously have to read what he has said in order to see whether i agree <e> <s> nevertheless if there are loopholes it may be the case that paragraph is in similar terms to the equivalent provisions of the landlord and tenant act <e> <s> but that does not seem to me to be a good reason for not blocking a loophole if one exists <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to clarify something between myself and my noble friend <e> <s> in dealing with mandatory ground he said that on the rare occasions as he put it where the landlord was not a company or a trust and ground might apply that is to say the notice might be given that the resumption of possession was needed for the landlords family the tenant would have to have notice of this <e> <s> the point i have been making is that the tenant would receive the notice after the agreement had been reached to have the extended term or the new tenancy at the end of the long lease <e> <s> so it does not appear to me to be helpful to suggest that the tenant gets this notice when my complaint has been that he gets the notice too late <e>", "<cs> my lords my point is that the landlord can agree with the tenant that at the end of the long lease another tenancy will be created <e> <s> the trouble is that there is a period between the agreement and the creation of the new tenancy in which the landlord can spring upon the tenant the fact that mandatory ground may be applied <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that we shall look at the question again if need be <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in his interesting television interview with mary goldring on sunday my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer affirmed that his first priority was the control of inflation to bear down on and to bring down the rate of inflation <e> <s> i can well understand that noble lords on the front benches opposite may perfer to target their amendment today on the manufacturing base and the trade gap <e> <s> were they to be in power again we should surely be right to fear controls and high spending policies bringing high and growing inflation followed by stop measures <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the fact that i have advanced from being the st speaker in the debate on the green papers to being the th speaker tonight i find myself still as a late speaker able to claim the privilege of saying that i do not intend to say what i otherwise might have said on the rights of litigants to have their solicitors represent them in the high court instead of barristers <e>", "<cs> i rise with great reluctance in the face of such powerful speeches from my noble friend and the noble and learned lords who have spoken to ask whether we are not discussing what is basically a constitutional molehill <e> <s> the committee should be aware that what the lord chancellor is seeking to do is to take power to alter such matters as the jurisdiction of the high court <e> <s> what are the enactments which the noble and learned lords and my noble friends see as being so sacrosanct <e> <s> surely it is only right that my noble and learned friend should if he is to bring into effect the very desirable provisions of the civil justice review have the right to make these alterations without coming back to the committee with primary legislation <e>", "<cs> the law society supports the amendment moved by the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> i must say that i adopt his arguments <e> <s> however the law society goes a little further <e> <s> the recommendation of the civil justice review which was read out by the noble and learned lord continues at the end of the second part to provide that it should also continue to be possible to transfer county court judgments over to the sheriffs provided that they are of a commercial nature <e> <s> that was achieved under section of the county courts act which provided in subsection a that if <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause perhaps i may raise one small drafting point <e> <s> i wish to ask my noble and learned friend whether it is appropriate in new section of the county courts act to refer to what regulations under subsection may provide when subsection does not appear to be a regulation-making subsection <e>", "<cs> is my noble and learned friend saying that if the county court does not have power to make orders of a prescribed kind we are talking about orders not regulations the regulation gives him the right to prescribe the orders which the county court may not make <e>", "<cs> i put my name down as intending to oppose the motion that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> however the amendments of the noble lord lord meston have cut most of the ground from under the clause <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce and the noble lord lord grantchester have completed that task <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to make a few points about the principle <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is much more to say at this stage except that this is a case where my noble and learned friend has identified one particular point where the parties and their representatives can throw the court administration into confusion <e> <s> i think that is the case where some time before the hearing date a settlement is reached and by some extraordinary oversight nobody tells the court <e> <s> during the period it may be a week or a month between the settlement and the hearing date the court could well fully use the two or three weeks which might have been set aside to deal with other litigants <e> <s> in such a case the settlement may well have been in terms that the parties are to bear their own costs so nobody has to come back to the court for an order for costs and it cannot be dealt with by way of costs <e> <s> i should have thought that this was the only case in which such an offence should produce this result <e> <s> i feel that there must be better ways of cracking the nut than with this sledgehammer <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain why i oppose the amendment moved by my noble friend lord alexander <e> <s> in a sense i echo the words of the noble baroness lady phillips which were both simple and profound <e> <s> i tend to agree with my noble and learned friend lord hailsham when he said that he did not necessarily follow the recommendations of the committee chaired by my noble friend lord renton and that in general he disapproved of general objectives clauses <e> <s> i generally approve of general objectives clauses but in my view to insert the words of the amendment would be to make the clause even more general in a way which i do not think would serve the interests of justice <e>", "<cs> i would not wish to withdraw my amendment before asking my noble and learned friend to inform the committee of the precedents <e> <s> i am aware that in paragraph of the white paper the analogy with the building societies scheme is drawn but i am sure that if he takes the matter away and refers carefully to that scheme he will see many points of principle which differentiate between that and what is proposed here <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall have to try to find some of the schemes to which my noble and learned friend referred <e> <s> however i shall return to the matter on report <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we pass finally from the substantive clause dealing with the legal services ombudsman perhaps i may refer the committee to something that my noble and learned friend said on second reading <e> <s> he said that the law society was <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support the amendment of the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> i believe that the experience of all solicitors who practise in the criminal courts as i do not leads firmly to the conclusion that it is absolutely vital that those who make decisions whether or not to oppose bail and those who present the case to the court against bail should be suitably qualified people and not the kind of people envisaged by this clause <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord hacking comes to his decision about the amendment perhaps i may speak briefly to the subsequent amendment <e> <s> it has already been answered by my noble and learned friend and i have <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> i also very much agree with my noble friend lady elles <e> <s> it is absolutely vital that lawyers should talk in a way which everyone can understand <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend said there is nothing in this clause which casts doubt upon that <e>", "<cs> when we are talking about supervision under clause b it does not seem <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment perhaps i may say that i am still worried about the drafting <e> <s> my noble and learned friend has made his intention clear <e> <s> that is why i raised the question earlier this afternoon <e> <s> however some members of the committee will regard paragraph b as relating to supervision and paragraph c as relating to what happens on the ground <e> <s> i and other members of the committee will look very carefully at the drafting and i hope that my noble and learned friend will also consider those points <e>", "<cs> the intervention of the noble and learned lord is most apposite <e> <s> we had to wait a long time for his first intervention and i am glad that the second one has come sooner <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about conflict of interest in support of the thrust of both the amendments <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> if there is to be an initial advice session it should be free <e> <s> the reason is plain <e> <s> the initial advice session will be a promotional one put on by the corporation in order to stitch up the customer <e> <s> it will make it quite clear that in aspects of the deal the conveyancer will close his eyes to the interests of the customer and that the customer must look elsewhere <e> <s> on this basis i am surprised that we feel it necessary to discuss the amendment <e> <s> it is quite obvious that any corporation will make darn certain that the interview with the client in which all this takes place is the first thing that will happen <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to learn that the amendment is accepted in principle by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> therefore in order that he may see the drafting corrected i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having listened to what the noble lords lord mishcon and lord hacking have said i believe that there is one respect in which my noble and learned friend might consider the matter again because it is misleading <e> <s> perhaps he would consider the possibility that clause might read <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what my noble and learned friend has said <e> <s> i wonder whether he feels that at the end of his review he will be in a position to introduce the primary legislation that the provision would require and when it might happen because these occasions do not happen all that often <e> <s> this seems to be one of the times when such a rationalisation could take place <e>", "<cs> some months is quick but it is what comes after that will be of interest to us all ultimately <e> <s> it is clear that my noble and learned friend is fully appraised of the injustice and of the unsatisfactory effect that the provision of judicial pensions has on recruitment to mention just one point <e> <s> in the circumstances at this time of night the best thing that i can do is ask the committee for leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reinforce what the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce said <e> <s> i should certainly have liked to see this clause removed from the bill <e> <s> however i am sorry to say that i feel i have to disagree with the noble lord lord mishcon and the views expressed by the law society as i regard this concession as a crumb <e> <s> but nevertheless a crumb is better than no bread <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his explanation and although i would not agree with it entirely i have said that i do not see myself in the role of canute <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends who supported this amendment <e> <s> i must say that i am in a modest way horrified that my noble and learned friend is not able to see the difference between measures taken against a building society and measures taken against an individual practitioner especially when as i pointed out the individual practitioner has already undergone an investigation by his own professional body which has found him essentially not guilty as charged <e> <s> in the case where the ombudsman has given directions which the practitioner feels that he should not or does not feel obliged to comply with the professional body itself may be considerably embarrassed by the decision of the ombudsman <e>", "<cs> my lords if the law society does not have the powers for which the noble lord lord mishcon asks not only will the public be in danger but the legal profession will be irreparably damaged when it becomes known that there are firms of solicitors to whom the public go which will not give a fair deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is axiomatic that anyone providing conveyancing services should be under a fiduciary duty to the client and that any derogation from his duty however allowed is entirely against the interests of justice <e> <s> it seems to me that whether or not it is the case that an authorised practitioner is under this fiduciary duty it should be spelt out on the face of the bill where we are dealing with authorised praactitioners who in the majority of cases will not represent organisations which have in the past subjected themselves to the kinds of responsibilities which they should and ought to be assuming if they are to provide conveyancing services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend whose amendment is clearly every bit as effective as the one that i moved in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to support lord mishcons amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first it seems to be recognised under section of the supreme court act that what we are talking about is a necessary but in no sense a sufficient condition for appointment to the high court <e> <s> clearly no one in normal circumstances is going to appoint a barrister to the high court who has years call only <e> <s> on that ground alone i should have thought that my noble and learned friend who has again and again expressed his interest in the possibility of all sorts of persons being available whether it is for advocacy or for the bench would see the merit of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords during the passage of the administration of justice act we had in this house a very good opportunity to discuss the various provisions that were before us <e> <s> it appears that if these clauses come up in another place or even at third reading in this house we shall be deprived of such an opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend to noble lords and to noble and learned lords who have supported me <e> <s> i wish to speak about the point first raised by the noble and learned lord lord ackner and answered by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i have always read clause in the way in which my noble and learned friend does <e> <s> as i understand it it is that the ombudsman will not control the matter which goes into the advertisement but only the manner of it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at this point that i do not propose to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> to amendment no <e> <s> until my noble and learned friend moves that amendment <e> <s> certainly amendments nos <e> <s> and go together but they are separate on the grouping list <e> <s> the profusion of double negatives to which my noble friend lord renton referred suggests to me that it would not be convenient to debate my amendment no <e> <s> at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i find my noble and learned friends answer arid <e> <s> the principle that i am trying to establish with the amendment is that the client who is buying or selling a house should be able to consult the solicitor involved with the authorised practitioner whether on an employed or agency basis and receive proper professional advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in the debates taking place at the other end of the chamber but the speech of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale in which he referred to my interests and those of my noble friend lord boardman and the noble lord lord mishcon in questions of conflict of interest prompts me to say that it has never been held that such issues arose where it was a question of the lawyer fixing the fee with his client <e> <s> there obviously cannot be an entire situation where there are mutually compatible interests but certainly questions of conflict of interest do not arise in this respect <e>", "<cs> speaking as a member of the english legal profession perhaps i may tell my noble friend lady carnegy that we in england have had experience for some five years of a breed of people called licensed conveyancers <e> <s> they are not lawyers <e> <s> there are not many of them <e> <s> they convey property <e> <s> i dare say that in many cases they do it quite well <e> <s> but they are not lawyers and are not able to cope with the legal problems that arise in many cases <e> <s> through their inability to cope with the law they have the potentiality of damaging both their own clients and the other parties to conveyances <e> <s> i am sure that that profession does a good job but i should certainly not recommend the northern part of the kingdom to indulge in that kind of operation <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna that the clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> as an english solicitor and in the absence of any scottish solicitors being present in your lordships chamber perhaps i may say a few words without in any way speaking for the scottish law society whose views on this matter i do not know <e>", "<cs> if the scottish law society is happy with the cab rank rule in the form of this amendment i shall leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> i sat down earlier having been the first englishman to speak but i rise again because the debate has widened and extended beyond the question whether this is what the scottish law society accepts or is prepared to accept <e> <s> it has entered upon the merits of the cab rank rule <e> <s> i refer to the debate at the report stage of the english bill when my noble friend lord alexander moved his amendment and secured the approval of your lordships by seven votes <e>", "<cs> i have noted with interest what the noble lord lord peston has said in reply to my noble friend on the question of expense <e> <s> let me deal with the question of expense as a result of my legal experience on the courts and legal services bill <e> <s> there we discussed matters such as level playing fields <e> <s> we felt that if one branch of the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i anticipate that my noble and learned friend will say as was said during the passage of the english bill that these matters are better dealt with by regulation than on the face of the bill <e> <s> if that is so i have taken careful note of the comments of the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar <e> <s> it seems to me that my noble and learned friend should say that any interview envisaged between the conveyancing practitioner and the client or customer should clearly include provision for the conveyancing practitioner to outline potential conflict of interest not just between vendor and purchaser but between the conveyancing practitioner and the client or customer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble and learned lord should once again move this tired old cab rank or cab horse rule in a more grievous form than it was moved in committee on which occasion the committee rejected it resoundingly <e> <s> on that occasion as your lordships will recall i did speculate as to what were the views of the law society of scotland on the amendment then moved <e>", "<cs> i should explain to the committee perhaps with a note of apology that i speak to this amendment on the pensions ombudsman and the subsequent amendments not out of concern for occupational pension schemes or personal pension schemes but because i am concerned at the proliferation of ombudsmen in recent years which seems now to be turning into a flood <e> <s> a number of ombudsmen have been created <e> <s> they have been created in various ways and they have various functions with one seldom resembling another <e> <s> until now they have tended to have in common an interest in the investigation of maladministration <e>", "<cs> i welcome the clarification provided by my noble friends amendments <e> <s> i wish to refer especially to amendment no <e> <s> which gives some clarification as to what should be included in the rules <e> <s> i have two points to make <e> <s> first it seems to me that the rule as regards <e>", "<cs> as i have said i have no intention of pressing the amendment <e> <s> i have only one comment to make on what my noble friend has said which is that it seemed to me that in a sense he conceded the case when he said i hope i understood him correctly that the ombudsman would make determinations which would affect all pension schemes <e> <s> it seems to me that there could be no clearer case for these matters to be decided in the open before a court or a tribunal <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do exactly that <e> <s> however i must tell the house that i find all that my noble friend has said extremely unsatisfactory <e> <s> i say that principally because the objections to the present situation arise not so much because health authorities are failing to comply with the requirements of the act as because the requirements of that act as to when a health authority may go into closed session are so unclear as to make it a matter for a fleet of lawyers to determine whether the circumstances apply and the authority can properly exclude the public <e>", "<cs> my lords before moving the amendment i apologise for not having been in the chamber when my amendment was called <e> <s> it was only when i was passing through the division lobby that i discovered that the report stage of the social security bill was about to finish early <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting debate and i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> noble lords will appreciate that this is not a party political matter it is a matter in which those who are interested in democratic processes take a very great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who is not a former producer manager or lawyer in the media perhaps i may say why i think that the passing of the amendment will not add one jot or tittle to the amount of impartiality on television <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in the past chided the government for their cavalier attitude to child benefit <e> <s> however i now congratulate my noble friend on his statement that the benefit will be increased this year <e> <s> i also offer congratulations on the secretary of states assurance that child benefit is and will remain a strong element in family provision <e> <s> however i wish to comment on the universality of the increase which was not necessarily expected but which is most desirable <e> <s> it is very desirable that child benefit should operate for families of all incomes <e> <s> can my noble friend assure the house that the government are still appraised of the fact that child benefit reflects the fact that al all levels of income the needs of the mothers with children are greater than those without and that adjustments at all levels of income are in order and should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord macaulay <e> <s> it does not seem to me that the provisions of the english solicitors act regarding the findings of the solicitors disciplinary <e>"]
