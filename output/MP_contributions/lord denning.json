bulk of our civil jurisdiction is tried by judge alone to the satisfaction of all concerned <e> <s> here we are concerned with just two or three exceptions a charge of fraud against a party or a charge in respect of libel and slander where there is still a right to trial by jury <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will agree to the addition of four more high court judges <e> <s> i should like to say how much i agree that many cases today take far too long and what is the cause <e> <s> part of it is due to the availability of legal aid <e> <s> it is also due to counsel being far too prolix <e> <s> it is also due to the judges not taking sufficient control and being too polite and letting them go on for ever <e> <s> it is also due to the great mass of paper photography and the

far too long both in the civil courts now and in the criminal courts <e> <s> i do not know the remedy <e> <s> perhaps as lord mancroft said the lord chancellor does <e> <s> at all events we ought to have these extra high court judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i remember the case well a solicitor had been ordered by a circuit judge to pay the costs <e>

committee which is separate from the disciplinary committee one of the things that i shall be stressing when we are dealing with solicitors <e> <s> there will be an investigating committee <e> <s> surely that investigating committee without any difficulty whatsoever ought to be able to inquire into the matters which are in this amendment <e> <s> it can then see whether after its investigations further proceedings ought to be taken by way of disciplinary measures or whether the matter should be abandoned altogether in other words there should not be any limit on the matters to be investigated if it shows that a person is not to be suitable as a conveyancer <e>", "<cs> in a way i think that we ought to rely on the investigating committee <e> <s> if it thinks that there is no

person of repute who can carry it on <e> <s> he is not to carry on the business or resolve it simply for the sake of the debenture holders <e> <s> he must have in mind all the creditors <e> <s> we have had law cases about that <e> <s> in a way therefore the administrative receiver is a very good qualified man to take on the administration of a company and in those circumstances there would be no need to have an administrator appointed by the court <e> <s> i can see that that is the reason underlying what the government have done and i should have thought therefore that the amendment was not necessary <e>", "<cs> the governments view seems to me to be quite right <e> <s> the whole essence of the administrator who is being appointed by the court is that he should manage and run the business and that there should be a stay on all types of proceedings involving the courts by the creditors or anyone else <e> <s> it is very desirable that while that administration is operating it should not be interfered with at all by resolutions made for winding up or for administrative receivers even if they are not going to take part until afterwards <e> <s> it is best for the court to deal with everything after the administration comes to an end when it is discharged <e> <s> then all these people can be dealt with by the court <e> <s> meanwhile there should be no resolution for winding up or for the administrative receiver <e> <s> in other words i suggest that the bill as it stands is quite in order <e>", "<cs> in the time honoured words i entirely agree and have nothing to add <e>", "<cs> it is all very complicated but i am sure that the administrator should be left free to contract and to make himself personally liable <e> <s> after the administration order is made and

have had experience of this kind <e> <s> for example mr justice fraser died soon after the beginning of a case <e> <s> a great deal of money had been expended uselessly through no ones fault <e> <s> in principle as it was neither sides fault the costs thrown away ought to be paid by central government <e> <s> i suppose that what happens at the moment is that it depends on who wins the case and the loser has to pay all the additional expenses <e> <s> there are arguments both ways but i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will consider this amendment because it would seem to be only fair that costs wasted through misfortune and not through the fault of either party should be borne by central government <e>", "<cs> may i just make one or two observations <e> <s> first since legal aid has been here many cases which are of exceptional public importance are already taken to the house of lords <e> <s> points have been decided in that way at great public expense which would never have reached the house of lords before the existence of legal aid <e> <s> equally i should have thought there was a good case for this clause <e> <s> that is in this way <e> <s> from my own experience i remember a case called <e>", "<cs> in support of this amendment may i just draw attention to two cases <e> <s> they arise under the contempt of court act <e> <s> under section of that act the judge at the crown court trying a criminal case can decide and order the newspaper reporters to report nothing of the case for the time being or for some considerable time <e> <s> the people who are affected by that are the newspapers and the reporters and the people who wish to give notice of it <e>", "<cs> i have had this very problem which has come before the court of appeal when two arbitrators are to be appointed and one of the parties does not appoint its own arbitrator and the whole thing might seem to be at an end <e> <s> in that situation what is to be done <e> <s> lord justice mustill is probably the greatest expert on the law of arbitration at the moment especially after his first-rate book upon it <e> <s> i should think that the draft suggestions of the committee under his chairmanship would probably be the best that can be devised <e>", "<cs> i have had long experience of how the law society operates <e> <s> they do it very well and very fairly if i may say so <e> <s> my amendment was put down only because of the benson commission recommendation <e> <s> but judging from the explanation which my noble and learned friend has given they have it in mind and they may implement it if they think it is right <e> <s> i am quite happy with that and i have pleasure in withdrawing the amendmement <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure that it would be a good thing to do <e> <s> when a liquidator or other person is appointed of course he looks at the leases of the property and he has to decide whether it is worth having them at all <e> <s> if the terms are too onerous then he can disclaim <e> <s> on the other hand if he wants to keep on a lease and it is a valuable property there is a clause in the lease which says it can be forfeited but on the other hand he can apply for relief under section of the law of property act or he can pay the rent and the landlord will waive any forfeiture by accepting the rent <e> <s> but in any event a very short application to the court for relief can put the matter on a legally correct basis without i should have thought the necessity of having a clause like this to cover very exceptional circumstances saying that a provision is to be void <e> <s> i would say that existing procedures can deal with the difficulty without the insertion of this new clause <e>", "<cs> the cork committee recommended this one-tenth as a most important part of its proceedings and indeed several pages of the report are given to illustrations of how it would operate <e> <s> furthermore it was regarded as a package deal to be considered in relation to the troublesome question we shall soon have about preferential debts <e> <s> the committee pointed out that of all the grievances it had before it and had been brought before it by letter and otherwise it is the injustices which are inflicted very often by the existence of floating charges on the whole of the companys assets then or in the future that are of most concern <e> <s> judges have from the very earliest times pointed out the injustices of a floating charge <e> <s> the cork committee has done so <e> <s> they have nothing similar on the continent and the committee said that urgent and radical reform was necesary <e>", "<cs> only some of them <e>", "<cs> may i just say one word <e> <s> the cork committee considered all the points <e> <s> i am afraid the government must have been much-influenced by those big bankers because they said this at paragraph of the report of the review committee <e>", "<cs> i did not know what a shadow director meant and i should like it contained in this bill and not have to go back to the companies bill which is not yet an act <e>", "<cs> while the compromise so to speak is agreeable i hope that we shall go the whole length <e> <s> let me first take rates <e> <s> as we know rates are owed to the local authority <e> <s> is there any difference between the rates which are owed by a debtor and the money which he owes for rent and on the other hand the money that he owes for supplies and services <e> <s> clearly rates must share equally with all other creditors of an individual <e> <s> there is no doubt whatever on that and i am glad that no preference is to be sought for them <e> <s> the distinction which is being drawn and was drawn by the cork committee is that there are some taxes such as vat of which the person who gets them is a quasi-trustee and is collecting them for the government <e> <s> i would reject that analogy altogether <e> <s> it is simply a case of debtor and creditor all the way through <e> <s> the man who collects vat is getting money for himself <e> <s> he uses it for himself until he has to pay over something and then he has to pay over a certain amount it may be deducted for input <e> <s> throughput i do not understand all these things to the government <e> <s> i look upon each of these simply as a debtor and creditor relationship <e>", "<cs> i agree with the governments view <e> <s> the bankrupt should deliver all his papers over to the trustee <e> <s> after all he could waive the privilege himself <e> <s> the trustee stands in his shoes <e> <s> for the trustee to be able to do this work it is essential that he should have access to all the documents <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord meston has said this is one of the most important amendments in the bill <e> <s> we get away from the technicalities of insolvency we come to the human side of life and the social justice of life <e> <s> as i have been concerned with the family home ever since i was a judge at first instance when i was concerned with what the lawyers used to call the deserted wifes equity perhaps i may summarise in not too much detail what has happened <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which the cork committee recommended <e> <s> it was a way by which government departments and the crown could in effect get a benefit for themselves and the cork committee said no <e> <s> with all these government departments one government department would get a set off which really was available to another one <e> <s> i suggest that the cork committee are quite right in removing this crown preference in respect of departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the passage in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will support this amendment <e> <s> running through this report of the select committee is the stress they lay on their principle that a charity established in perpetuity should continue to exist in perpetuity <e> <s> just think of the founder of the charity two or three hundred years ago <e> <s> he founded the charity with let us say which would be a substantial sum in those days the income from which was to be used for the relief of the poor year after year <e> <s> now he would not have in mind at all the position today when that not having been invested properly as many charities have not has been reduced to p <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support the amendment not only for the reason that it is unnecessary to have these clauses in the bill but also because it is important that we emphasise in the bill the independence and the impartiality of the attorney-general under our constitution <e> <s> what he does should not be subject to the consent of the treasury or of any government representative whatever <e> <s> the position of the attorney-general has been considered in our courts <e> <s> there was the great case that your lordships will remember when a union was going to stop all the mail to south africa because it objected to apartheid <e> <s> the attorney-general of the day although there was clearly a breach of the law would take no steps to stop <e>", "<cs> my lords wrong according to the house of lords <e> <s> i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have as much affection for the welsh language as anyone <e> <s> i have been on the welsh circuit twice and i did not have to have an interpreter on any case except one and then the witness wanted time to answer the question so we had an interpreter to turn it from welsh into english <e> <s> seriously can we make this provision in regard to prosecutors but not also in regard to judges or magistrates or defending counsel <e> <s> surely as my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson says we can leave it to good administration and the director or the crown prosecutor in arranging these matters will certainly see that in any appropriate case there is a counsel or a solicitor who can speak the welsh language <e> <s> i should have thought that it could have been dealt with administratively without being put expressly in the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment as it now is <e> <s> i said at committee stage that the report had to be a full and proper report and that should be enough <e> <s> but having read the principles i find that they are just as important for the public and the lawyers to know about as are the principles in law cases and decisions <e> <s> in other words those principles should be in the report so that all may know them <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too sympathise with the amendment <e> <s> the local authorities have many duties whether it be to deal with sunday trading or many other matters as regards which it is within their option whether or not to launch a prosecution <e> <s> some of those cases have resulted in points of law which have gone to the house of lords <e> <s> those local authorities may well be deterred from instituting prosecutions which they ought to institute if they are to bear all the burden of costs themselves without any recourse as they have apparently had in the past to central funds <e> <s> therefore i sympathise with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor gave us some little hope that something might be done in this situation because this is what happens under the contempt of court act when a case comes on which may be of great public interest but the reporting of which in the newspapers the judge nevertheless thinks may prejudice the fair trial or the trial of another case because what may come out by way of evidence in a newspaper report may be prejudicial in other circumstances <e> <s> the judge can then say to the reporters <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house may i say that i had not heard of this point about <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with the proposed amendment but i would not go the whole way through it <e> <s> this clause certainly deals not with relatively unimportant cases but with cases of the first importance to the solicitor and to the client <e> <s> let me tell your lordships of the kind of cases of which we had no end <e> <s> they were to do with delay <e> <s> we know that delay in winding up estates has caused a great deal of distress to many innocent beneficiaries <e> <s> however the delay of which i am speaking is the case for instance when an individual is injured in an accident or at his work <e> <s> he goes to a solicitor to bring a claim he gets legal aid the solicitor starts a claim but then delays it <e> <s> we have had dozens and dozens of cases where there has been inexcusable delay and meanwhile witnesses may have died or valuable evidence may have disappeared owing to the delay of the solicitor <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support the amendment <e> <s> in this way the council will have considered the complaint of the client that the solicitor has been negligent incompetent or inefficient and <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i am guilty of misconstructions and the like <e> <s> but the word it at the very end of the section is ambiguous <e> <s> it can refer either to the direction itself or to the failure to comply <e> <s> the interpretation that my noble and learned friend puts on it is failure to comply <e> <s> an equally valid interpretation would be in regard to the direction <e> <s> i proposed the amendment to make the matter clear <e> <s> however in view of what my noble and learned friend has said i shall accept that it refers only to failure to comply <e> <s> if so there is no harm done whatever <e> <s> in this respect judicial review and any other proper proceedings lie if the direction is wrongly given either in matters of natural justice or in interpretation <e> <s> on that basis i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in a way i would support this amendment because it is an indirect way of trying to give an appeal which lord bensons committee recommended <e> <s> it is really saying you should not have this direction given by the council without any appeal it has to be enforced by the tribunal <e> <s> at all events you ought to be able to consider whether or not it is reasonable <e> <s> therefore in a way i support the amendment because it is a way of getting round what <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems have been with us since <e> <s> five years ago in march they were pointed out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that question <e> <s> i agree that it is difficult to have guidelines for judges and it will take years to work out what the guidelines are <e> <s> no my lords leave it to the judges <e> <s> there may be an appeal but you can trust our family division judges <e> <s> do not worry about the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much stronger on the next amendment i think because the legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i keep myself to the first part of my amendment namely that part dealing with unassisted defendants who have been sued by a plaintiff who is legally aided <e> <s> the committee to which my noble and learned friend referred said there was to be no difference in principle between courts of first instance and courts of appeal <e> <s> my noble and learned friend is rejecting that advice <e> <s> he says that there is all the difference in the world <e> <s> the next question of whether a successful defendant against a legally aided plaintiff has to prove severe financial hardship comes down to this <e> <s> justice should require that the plaintiff who is legally aided should pay the cost of the defendant <e> <s> on the other hand it does mean a cost to the legal aid fund and a cost to the exchequer <e> <s> indeed the legal aid advisory committee said it could not make such a recommendation without counting the cost <e> <s> therefore it is a case whether injustice is to continue because the cost of doing justice is too much <e> <s> i do not accept that argument but on the other hand in view of the general discussion on this amendment no <e> <s> i do not press it <e>", "<cs> my lords when i sat as a judge i always sought to do justice and to remedy injustice <e> <s> now that i am retired and in your lordships house i will always seek to do justice and to remedy injustice <e> <s> in these amendments which i have put before the house today i have sought to remedy injustice <e> <s> what is the answer <e> <s> it is too expensive if you please to remedy injustice the injustice must remain as it is <e> <s> i do not agree with it but there it is <e> <s> it is the government against me and i cannot win so i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i recognise the force of what my noble friend lord foot has said referring to all the committees including mr justice faulks committee in favour of legal aid in defamation cases i hope your lordships will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i have had a great deal of experience of defamation cases <e> <s> it is very easy for a plaintiff to say that he has been defamed and once he says that it would be easy for him to get legal aid because the legal aid committee could hardly refuse it because the burden in all these cases is on the defendant <e> <s> the words are presumed to be false and malicious <e> <s> the defendant has to prove that they are true or whatever other defence he may have and that can operate very harshly against defendants <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept it <e> <s> this is a tiny suggestion of altering a principle <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will not accept it at all <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most important occasion <e> <s> the amendment deals with the most important jurisdiction of what we now call judicial review <e> <s> it is a jurisdiction in which the courts restrain and condemn the misuse or abuse of power by any public authority whether it be the executive government a local authority a police commissioner or any lower tribunal <e> <s> we now have the remedy of judicial review <e> <s> it is inherited from our old writs of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will welcome the almost unanimous view on all sides of this house that section should be repealed that it should be replaced by some narrower and clearer definition and that in the long run there should be a considerable increase in the amount of information available to the public <e>", "<cs> i too would oppose the present clause being part of the bill <e> <s> when we had a discussion beforehand there were all the objections which we raised to the automatic disqualification and indeed to the burden of proof as it was originally <e> <s> for that reason i spoke and voted in favour of the present clause <e> <s> but now having seen what has been proposed by my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth in the subsequent sections it seems to me that we can properly leave out clause because it has tried to bring everything together wrongful trading and disqualification of directors all together in one clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add a word in support of the amendment <e> <s> in my young days legal executives were all called managing clerks <e> <s> there was the managing clerk of the litigation department the managing clerk of the conveyancing department and the managing clerk dealing with probate <e> <s> they were first-rate people <e> <s> they had been in the profession all their lives and had much more experience and often much more knowledge than the partner himself <e> <s> at least i had the greatest confidence in them <e> <s> it is right that these managing clerks now legal executives with their experience and they have had to pass their examinations should and could be entrusted to do it in the terms of this amendment at the direction and under the supervision of the partner <e> <s> i support the amendment so as to clear up the position <e> <s> there should be no doubt about the validity of what these managing clerks or legal executives do <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest that this is unnecessary <e> <s> in the court of appeal i have had experience of litigants in person <e> <s> a litigant would come on monday morning and explain his case to us <e> <s> sometimes there would be nothing in it but sometimes there would be something in it and we would feel that we needed help and that he needed help <e> <s> so i would say to the litigant in person have you asked for legal aid <e> <s> he would say no <e> <s> i would then say <e> <s> you had better do so <e> <s> but quite often it happened he would say yes i have applied for it but i have been refused <e> <s> then i would say to him well we have heard enough about your case to realise it would be helpful to us that you should be legally aided <e> <s> will you please now go to the area committee and tell them that the court of appeal have recommended that you should get legal aid <e> <s> so he would go along to the area committee <e> <s> the area committee would take good notice of what the court of appeal had said and grant him his legal aid <e> <s> so in point of practice every deserving case in that way does get legal aid <e> <s> there is no need to go through the procedure stated in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor opened the second reading debate on this bill he said that it was <e>", "<cs> i was unable to be in your lordships house for the second reading of the bill and so perhaps i may be permitted to say a few words now <e> <s> i would sympathise entirely with the views of the noble baroness if the matter were to be dealt with simply by an english court dealing simply with english law <e> <s> but here we have a court that has to deal with international conventions <e> <s> the international convention governs the various considerations <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble and learned friend says that these are technical amendments but i venture to doubt it <e> <s> i am not sure that he is not hoist with his own petard as he was in the last discussions <e> <s> we must remember that we are dealing with an international convention which took months and years to agree <e> <s> all the proponents met at the hague the professors and everyone else <e> <s> i knew them all <e> <s> they hammered out with their drafts and amendments and everything else this final convention which they all signed <e> <s> in the case of many of them once they ratified it it became law <e> <s> in this country it does not become law until we incorporate it in a statute but in many of those countries they are bound by the laws as stated in the convention <e>", "<cs> may i support this amendment on the principle which i have been seeking to enunciate so far <e> <s> when we agree to an international convention and other countries do too when they ratify it it becomes part of their law without having to go through any legislative machinery <e> <s> it is only in this country or perhaps just a few others that it has to be implemented by a statute <e> <s> when we do that in order for it to be binding we should include all of it and implement the convention as a whole not take out bits or say that we will interpret bits in this way or that <e> <s> we ought to implement it as a whole because it is on that condition that the other countries have all agreed they have agreed to the convention on the basis that everyone else has also agreed <e> <s> is it going to be open to us to pick out bits to leave out or to give our own interpretation to this part or that <e> <s> it seems to me wrong as a matter of legislative principle that we should omit for instance one of the clauses in the convention which has been internationally agreed and agreed by everybody <e> <s> therefore i would support the amendment on the basis of supporting the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords while i sympathise very much with the objectives of my noble friend i am afraid i shall not go with him on these amendments <e> <s> we are dealing in this clause with disqualification of directors for being unfit their conduct showing them to be unfit to be directors <e> <s> in clause to which my noble friend referred we are dealing with wrongful trading and the liability personally to make good any of the moneys which may have been wrongfully dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i should like to say that i am not wedded to the code which i suggested <e> <s> that is not provided for in the bill as it stands <e> <s> i should be quite happy with guidelines which were discussed with all responsible people and which would give guidance to the directors of the company and all those dealing with it and indeed to the judges when they come to consider disqualification <e> <s> guidelines would be quite sufficient to deal with the problem and it would be unwise to tie the matter too closely to particular statutory provisions <e> <s> let the question of unfitness be decided by the court with guidelines agreed perhaps by many interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i would oppose this inclusion on the same lines as the last <e> <s> it is obvious that when a judge is considering whether a director of a company was unfit he would consider these very matters which are put in here <e> <s> he would consider whether the company was acting in this way providing services and so forth getting payment and not giving those services <e> <s> it is the very matter which the judge of course will consider <e> <s> there is no need to put it into a statute because it would bear the impression that if the judge has got to be told especially to consider this he may not consider other things <e> <s> i would leave it if need be to the guidelines or whatever it is <e> <s> but i would leave the judge to consider everything relating to whether the director is or is not unfit <e> <s> i do not think that the amendment is necessary and it may be embarrassing <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would introduce a fresh and unexpected principle into our law <e> <s> we have many breaches of confidence <e> <s> what happens under the bill if the secretary of state receives a report and a clerk or someone else in his department leaks it <e> <s> there is nothing in this provision to make them liable <e> <s> we should be coming up against the official secrets act before we knew where we were <e> <s> but apart from that there are things done in confidence every day disclosure to the medical profession disclosure of documents to the legal profession in the course of proceedings and disclosure to bankers but never has a leak been made a criminal offence <e> <s> of course it is an offence against which employers and others can take steps and confidence must be ensured so far as is possible <e> <s> if it is properly communicated it is usually protected by qualified privilege but if it is not there may be a liability for defamation <e> <s> this is a new principle which i do not think we should accept into our law <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> these matters are all well dealt with by rules of court <e> <s> i think they are already sufficiently provided for <e> <s> but if not they can be amplified so as to provide for this <e> <s> but an act of parliament is not the place they are really for rules of court <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not support this amendment <e> <s> we are here dealing with clause as it stands although another amendment is soon to come <e> <s> as clause stands it deals with a new principle in our company law of wrongful trading <e> <s> it is different from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to completely support this amendment <e> <s> the cork committee considered wrongful trading to be the most <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support these amendments <e> <s> they are quite sensible <e> <s> the court ought not to be compelled to have a public examination <e> <s> it ought to have a discretion with the insertion of the word may <e> <s> in addition a person ought to have to reply unless he has a proper ground for refusing to answer <e> <s> i support the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say one word <e> <s> if an application is made to the court the result is that the court can either grant it or refuse it <e> <s> in my experience it is quite unusual to have an application which the court must grant or shall grant <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> the second point is this <e> <s> when there is a public examination the question of what questions should be allowed or what answers accepted is a matter for the person who is holding the public examination <e> <s> there is really no need for any special rules about it <e> <s> i would entirely agree with the court of appeal in i expect the master of the rolls then was viscount hanworth in saying that there would not be an answer that tended to incriminate because one of the very things which the court wants to find out is whether there is anything incriminating being done <e> <s> in a way i would support the amendment in regard to the word shall being made but i would not go so far as to support the other one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that this was unnecessary <e> <s> i believe that a person under public examination would be entitled to have his lawyer there without any provision in the statute about it and able to take such part as the person holding the examination allows <e> <s> it seems to me that this would apply apart from any provision in the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish only for a word of explanation <e> <s> i heard my noble and learned friend lord cameron say at committee stage we are not going to have all these crown preferences and all that sort of thing <e> <s> but now when i look at this i do not understand it <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> may i say a word on this <e> <s> the cork committee when it advocated the abolition of a lot of crown preferences saw that that would be a very valuable increase to banks and other people who held floating charges so that they would get a good deal more money in hand <e> <s> therefore it recommended as a package deal that per cent <e> <s> should be reserved and made available for the unsecured creditors <e> <s> the report referred to and advocated a per cent <e> <s> fund <e> <s> i think that many commercial concerns are in favour of a per cent <e> <s> fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much in sympathy with these proposals <e> <s> i gave illustrations earlier in committee of what often happens <e> <s> a man forms a company so the capital of the company is only but with that company he buys a business he buys a business which may have its stock and its vans and everything like that <e> <s> he does not pay for it with <e> <s> he gets of his own and lends it to the company to enable it to make purchases <e> <s> he then takes a floating charge over all the assets of the company for his or he may take it in his wifes name <e> <s> he trades for years and years and eventually the assets are milked <e> <s> when the company eventually goes into liquidation what happens <e> <s> the floating charge takes all those assets and he has priority over everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> we now know what happens in this country <e> <s> people may be fraudulent or they may be competent in getting hold of other peoples assets <e> <s> they do not stay in this country to face the music <e> <s> they fly abroad to spain of wherever it may be to try to escape the consequences <e> <s> one may find left behind all sorts of files documents and papers whether in the directors office or hidden elsewhere <e> <s> it may well take more than a year to catch up with them <e> <s> there is no reason whatever why the period should not be extended <e> <s> the time should not be limited to months <e> <s> even if it takes three years one should try to catch up with them <e> <s> i certainly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> we all know that communications between a client and his solicitor are privileged that is they are not to be disclosed to a court or to anyone else except by the permission of the client <e> <s> when you are considering a bankruptcy and a trustee in bankruptcy is concerned in investigating the affairs the trustee ought to have possession of all relevant documents <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this group of amendments <e> <s> my noble friend has been much too kind in what he has said about me <e> <s> as your lordships know this bill for the most part is dry abstruse and to most of us quite unintelligible <e> <s> so the attendance of your lordships has been very sparse <e> <s> however in this clause and in the amendments we get to the human side and to the social side which your lordships should as a whole consider most seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say one word <e> <s> i always thought that vat was really in the nature of working capital when it is collected <e> <s> it is not really a collector tax at all <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord lord mottistone and others that if we could do something about vat and not allow that a preference it would be a good thing <e> <s> but still one ought to be very thankful for even small mercies so on the whole one would not object to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i should not be any more helpful about this than i was about the other <e> <s> you have to visualise the position when a company is wound up <e> <s> a liquidator is appointed to inquire into its circumstances to see who the creditors are who are the debtors and furthermore in this particular context to see whether the directors have behaved or misbehaved <e> <s> for this purpose the liquidator has to communicate not only with the directors themselves but with the creditors the accountants and all those concerned in the running of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has invited me to say something i should say that the rules about legal professional privilege will remain intact <e> <s> i do not say that they cover all the matters in the clause but the rules about legal professional privilege will remain

and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the general principle as recommended by the cork committee was <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> even though we have to submit to a <e>", "<cs> my lords in parting with this bill perhaps i may say just a few words <e> <s> insolvency is a disagreeable subject <e> <s> it is a slough of despond not only for those who fall into it but for the lawyers and accountants who have to deal with it and try to pull them out <e> <s> for more than years the law has been in a mess <e> <s> there was that excellent report by sir kenneth cork and i should like to thank the government for the extent to which they have implemented that report <e> <s> many of the reports most important proposals are implemented in this bill and i am sure that they will do a great deal of good for the future and make it easier i hope for the lawyers and accountants to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is very proper for your lordships to consider vaccine damage that is only one item and i am afraid a small item in the vast subject of compensation for personal injuries which is before the house today <e> <s> there is no subject about which the judges the lawyers and the insurance companies are more concerned <e> <s> it represents per cent <e> <s> or more of the litigation and far more cases are settled quite apart from all the individuals hundreds of thousands of them who suffer personal injuries all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the general public is concerned perhaps the most important provision regarding ballots was in the trade union act last year part ii secret ballots before industrial action <e> <s> let us consider what that entails in law <e> <s> before the national union of railwaymen can call a one-day <e>", "<cs> my lords we may now revert to our bill not a little bill concerning the interception of communications <e> <s> i should first like to thank the government for introducing this measure and to thank the noble viscount the lord president of the council for the clarity with which he expounded it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that i agree entirely with what the commons have done <e> <s> it fills in a gap which otherwise would have been left in our legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords this little bill is an important constitutional bill <e> <s> let me tell your lordships how it arises <e> <s> there was a lady mrs pocock who lived near petersfield in hampshire <e> <s> she wanted to leave her house for a time and to let it furnished but she wanted to be sure of being able to get it back when she wanted it for herself or for any of <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships perhaps i may say that there is a judgment of the court of appeal against mrs pocock and in favour of the tenant <e> <s> i do not know unless it is specifically done by this house or by the bill that that judgment can be reversed just like that <e> <s> therefore although i have some hesitation mrs pocock would have to do it by fresh proceedings or something or as i should like it to happen by agreement whereby she could get possession now reverse the order for costs and get costs <e> <s> but i am not sure that that ought not to be done specifically by this house legislatively or by an intermediate appeal to the house of lords <e> <s> i expect it will all go through by agreement because if the house of lords did hear the appeal they would of course apply the present act and reverse the decision <e> <s> i only hope that in some way or other mrs pocock will get the decision of the court of appeal reversed and get the order for costs in her favour and not have to pay costs but the act does not do it expressly <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment whether it is a duty to be good or a duty to co-operate in the implementation of the bill or the act as it may be <e> <s> i agree that it is an entirely new duty so far as the law is concerned <e> <s> on the other hand there is machinery in the courts for judicial review <e> <s> now the courts can command a local authority or any of these bodies to do their duty <e> <s> they can command the authorities to co-operate and if they refuse the court can enforce their order or set aside anything that the bodies have done <e> <s> it is a valuable new provision and it will enable the courts to deal with any misconduct by the successor authorities <e> <s> it is a very important provision which will protect the staff in the new situation <e>", "<cs> i share the distaste of my noble friend lord hooson for delegated legislation and delegated powers <e> <s> on the other hand there are cases when it is necessary <e> <s> i well remember lord chief justice hewarts book <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just a few words about the european convention on human rights <e> <s> i have often regretted that we ratified that convention <e> <s> the european courts rulings are not binding on our courts at all <e> <s> the only effect to be given to them in law arises only if we in parliament give effect to them and make them part of our laws <e> <s> but we have ratified that convention and as a matter of treaty obligations we ought to do what we can to implement it <e> <s> to that extent i would agree with the objectives of the government in promoting this bill <e> <s> their objectives may be good but the methods i fear are bad <e>", "<cs> if a pupil is a little recalcitrant and i just tap him then there it is <e> <s> i was a schoolmaster years ago <e> <s> today one only has to say youre not <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment for this reason <e> <s> accepting what we have just decided there are a number of children who will be exempt from corporal punishment <e> <s> what is the result of that <e> <s> corporal punishment in the eyes of the law can be an assault for which at the moment the child or its parents can sue for damages in the courts <e> <s> that will be an action which the parent or the child can bring in the courts <e> <s> once he is beaten in school he can sue for damages <e> <s> hitherto the answer of the masters has been over the years this has been the ordinary practice of schoolmasters and people in the course of their profession <e> <s> that is not to be the answer where the parent or child sues and then there is no justification because of exemption <e> <s> this exemption ought to be <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said for reasons that include averting means that there might be all sorts of other reasons in a personal danger and personal danger might be only one of the minor instances <e> <s> i should have thought that for clarity it would be better to include the amendment because the phrase reasons that include averting may include all reasons other than averting personal danger <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask for an explanation of this subsection <e> <s> i have read it through two or three times and i have been trying to imagine a case to which it applies <e> <s> i should like to ask the government what is the case to which it applies <e> <s> for instance there are the words <e>", "<cs> i think that i understand from that explanation that a teacher who goes beyond the bounds or whatever it may be is not to be liable for any criminal offence <e> <s> he is not to be taken to the criminal courts for an assault or anything like that and the only question here is one of civil action <e> <s> if so i would hope that this subsection does not involve the committing of any criminal offence because assault is a criminal offence too <e>", "<cs> first i wish to thank my noble friend the lord president for this amendment and i should like to point out how important it is <e> <s> this bill comes about because of a ruling of the european court of human rights as to how far telephone tapping should be regulated by law <e> <s> the bill puts that into effect <e> <s> one of the most important provisions is that there is not to be telephone tapping at all except under a warrant of the secretary of state <e> <s> that is one angle and it fulfils the ruling of the european court <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say one word <e> <s> i had not heard all those arguments before <e> <s> they are very good if i may say so but it does mean that the person at one or other end of the telephone can say to the clerk in the exchange tap this conversation will you <e> <s> it may be quite right but in a way i should be quite glad if a little further thought could be given to this question <e>", "<cs> i am quite satisfied <e> <s> if someone in a proper position in telecommunications authorises it i am quite content and would not press the matter further <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has flattered me by quoting what i said about subversion <e> <s> subversion is not the word we have to consider <e> <s> we have to consider here the interests of national security <e> <s> those words are put into this bill because they are the very words in the european convention on human rights which we are seeking to implement by this bill <e> <s> the very words in article are <e>", "<cs> it is too long <e>", "<cs> may i say that i have every sympathy with this amendment because the provision is very vague indeed and really is not telling the secretary of state much as to what he can do <e> <s> but in my view i am afraid that it comes within the principle that i sought to state in the debate on the last amendment <e> <s> these are wide words they are not legal words and we must trust the secretary of state to act in the interests of our security and our economic well-being in the right circumstances and not to abuse it <e> <s> it is not a matter for lawyers it is a matter for the supreme authority of the secretary of state who ought to take into consideration all the pros and cons of it <e> <s> although i sympathise very much with the amendment for myself i think it would be much better to leave the general discretion of a political nature to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i would oppose this amendment too <e> <s> really the essential words in this statute are <e>", "<cs> it all depends <e>", "<cs> i should like for once to support my noble friend and to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> when the amendment was moved i thought that it was unanswerable but having heard what the noble viscount said i came to the conclusion that the government are right because it depends on the jurisdiction of the tribunal <e> <s> that is given in clause <e> <s> a person who believes that communications have been intercepted improperly and so forth may apply <e> <s> there is no jurisdiction in the tribunal to deal with anything other than the validity of the warrant <e> <s> at all events it seems to me that it cannot deal with the various safeguards after copies have been taken <e> <s> therefore although it is a nice point i go with the government <e>", "<cs> i made my remarks off the cuff so the noble lord may answer as he pleases <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord and i agree <e>", "<cs> i quite agree with the amendment in this way <e> <s> the tribunal cannot exercise any jurisdiction for judicial review <e> <s> the position is that the high court under our new procedure can correct any misdoings of any inferior tribunal or other body even the secretary of state if they go wrong in any way <e>", "<cs> it is all a question of drafting i think we would agree <e> <s> as to the objective that i think my noble friend wants to achieve we want the tribunal to be able to quash modify or whatever the decision of the secretary of state <e> <s> in doing that it can consider whether or not it is reasonable or whether it is in accord with natural justice in other words all the ordinary principles which the high court applies <e> <s> it is only a matter of wording to see whether we have it right <e> <s> it may be that the present wording does it <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> of course the origin of this sort of thing is when the police get information from an informer who does not wish to give evidence in the court about <e>", "<cs> may i just say that having listened to all that the lord president of the council has said i am quite persuaded that it would be wrong to entrust the judge with a discretion <e> <s> it is much better for him to have a firm rule whereby evidence of this kind is excluded because of the danger of the criminal the terrorist or whoever it may be getting to know the sources of information the way the interception works or matters of that kind <e> <s> it is the same as in the case of the informer which i mentioned <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships committee will not accept this amendment <e> <s> the real purpose behind this particular power is that the secretary of state should be able to issue a warrant where it is necessary for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime <e> <s> nothing is more important in the present day than that we should be able to prevent or detect serious crime <e> <s> one of the ways of doing it is by tapping beforehand the telephones of criminals or whoever it may be <e>", "<cs> i think that on the whole it is as well to have all lawyers on the tribunal <e> <s> we have considered what they will have to deal with <e> <s> they will have to consider matters which would be determinable on judicial review if it were the high court <e> <s> that is essentially a lawyers task <e> <s> i can see the good sense of having perhaps one or two laymen if need be but on the whole i would not interfere with the governments proposals that they should all be lawyers <e>", "<cs> the important words here are <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady vickers for introducing this bill in this house <e> <s> i should also like to express the gratitude which we ought to express to the criminal law revision committee for its report <e> <s> the chairman was lord justice lawton one of the most knowledgeable experienced and chief exponents of the criminal law in our time <e> <s> he was supported by lord justice waller who is almost equally experienced and has such good sense <e> <s> it was a very strong committee <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> clause has been dropped <e> <s> omitting clause i should have thought that the clauses to increase punishment are well to be desired <e>", "<cs> my lords i too warmly support the bill <e> <s> but it does not go very far <e> <s> all that it does is to increase the possibility of imprisonment from years to life <e> <s> and as the noble earl lord attlee has mentioned life often does not mean life <e> <s> it means years years or whatever it may be <e> <s> nevertheless i welcome the bill <e> <s> it is a major step to deter i hope the major drug traffickers <e> <s> that is the point that we must deal with <e> <s> this is an evil and vicious trade carried on often from overseas by people who make large sums of money out of it <e> <s> it is ruining many of our youngsters and causing infinite distress to their parents <e> <s> the people we must get at are the great drug traffickers <e> <s> often they are not drug addicts themselves but they are making money out of it they are making millions of pounds sums of astronomical proportions <e>", "<cs> my lords in my experience it is just as well to listen to both sides of the argument before coming to a decision <e> <s> when i first listened to the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord mottistone i thought it was a good idea <e> <s> these trading authorities deal with weights and measures with the purity of substances and so on <e> <s> they cover a wide field <e> <s> surely they should be brought together not in little district councils but as suggested here with the fire and defence authorities <e> <s> having heard the arguments from the other side which one ought always to do i came round completely in favour of what my noble friend lord elton said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept this amendment <e> <s> the proposal is to set up a new authority altogether a new corporation to be called the london conservation and heritage authority <e> <s> what functions is it to carry out <e> <s> it is to carry out for instance existing functions under the town and country planning act or the ancient monuments act <e> <s> let those functions be carried out by the existing authorities by the boroughs themselves or whatever it may be <e> <s> they can perfectly well be carried out by them and we should not have a new authority established to take over the position <e> <s> i would oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a point of principle here <e> <s> when an ordinary individual suffers damage by a wrongdoer it may be that he is run down by a motor car or it may be that he cannot get possession of his own premises in those circumstances he can sue in the civil courts for damages against the wrongdoer <e> <s> but if that wrongdoer claims and is protected by diplomatic immunity then under the vienna convention the innocent person has lost his right of action altogether as a result of executive action by the crown in affirming the vienna convention <e> <s> is it not a principle of our law that when a right of action or right of property is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask that the jurisdiction of the european commission and the european court of human rights be looked at once again <e> <s> the european convention on human rights is no part of our law <e> <s> it has not been passed by parliament and it is not in any statute <e> <s> it is contained <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the jurisdiction of the european commission and the european court of human rights is limited <e> <s> is he aware that it does not have unlimited jurisdiction over our laws and our people <e> <s> is he aware also that the european commission is proposing to suggest that some of the sentences of the court of appeal in england are invalid <e>", "<cs> i also oppose this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that to introduce years would be something new in our law <e> <s> surely the right way to condemn these heinous crimes there is a whole list of them now of murder and the like is let the sentence be for life <e> <s> that is the most impressive sentence that can be given <e> <s> i would therefore ask your lordships committee not to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say just a word or two on this <e> <s> i should have thought that the penalty of any amount would cover the total of the ill-gotten gains <e> <s> however there is a point here <e> <s> do not wait until the sentence of the court is given because by that time the accused person will have taken all the proceeds away and put them in a numbered account in switzerland or somewhere else where they cannot be reached <e> <s> therefore let us stop them earlier and have the procedure in our courts where immediately the <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been most interesting on both sides <e> <s> if i may say so the very eloquent words of my noble friend lord mishcon were quite convincing to me <e> <s> this bill is to prevent kerb crawling <e> <s> what is kerb crawling but the harassment of innocent decent ladies in the street by men who come alongside them in a car importuning them <e> <s> it does not matter whether or not it is done for money it is the importuning of innocent women who are walking along the street or waiting at the bus stop that is the kerb crawling <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a troublesome situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have got into a difficult position <e> <s> when the bill started it did not have persistence in it <e> <s> now it has persistence in and we have to deal with it <e> <s> as persistence is now in and we failed on the point about the phrase the purpose of prostitution it seems to me that this new clause in amendment no <e> <s> is the best compromise that we can reach <e> <s> it seems to me that in the new clause subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes <e> <s> in view of the modifications already in the bill i think the answer is yes because in this case i should rely on the police officer <e> <s> it is also the one way to cure this evil <e> <s> thus i think we ought to have it in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have supported me <e> <s> i do not wish to imperil the passage of this bill through either house and therefore i propose not to press my amendment today <e> <s> speaking not as a legislator but as an ex-judge extra judicially it is my opinion that in our law at the moment all these surrogacy agreements are void and unenforceable whether for payment or not <e> <s> that is extra-judicial <e> <s> it is not legislative <e> <s> that may wait for a later decision <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the questions which have been asked <e> <s> clearly my noble friend has suffered nothing from not having noticed earlier he has dealt with this very effectively that the simple object of this clause is to do away with competition between the carrying mother and the commissioning mother <e> <s> in law the carrying mother who has carried the baby for nine months once she gives birth to the child should in law be the mother of the child <e> <s> but the next step is easy <e> <s> if this surrogacy agreement is to be implemented let it be done by adoption when the courts can see whether or not it is a proper case for the commissioning mother to bring up the child and for it to be adopted <e> <s> that is the right way to deal with it and for the law always to say that the carrying mother is the mother subject to her power to institute adoption proceedings later <e>", "<cs> we are back to where we were on the other amendment <e> <s> a lot of people would support the amendment <e> <s> i want to make the law clear at the moment <e> <s> that is why i limited it to the surrogacy <e> <s> i still hold and i would still express my opinion in law you can disregard it if you like that the carrying mother is in

report which in many respects is still a very good one <e> <s> i can well see the point which has been raised about protecting professional men and in the circumstances i shall not press this amendment either <e> <s> the point has been raised and it is for wiser heads than mine to settle it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i am quite persuaded by the arguments i have heard <e> <s> i am only too pleased not to press this point and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a government bill <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i only hope that passing the amendment will not imperil the bills getting through both houses in time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept the amendment <e> <s> it is necessary to remind your lordships what is the role of the secretary of state when he issues a warrant <e> <s> it is a wide almost political role very often in which he has to make a decision not on a legal matter but on whether it is necessary in certain circumstances to issue a warrant of that kind <e> <s> we should leave him to make the right and necessary decision <e> <s> if one pleases let him have guidelines but do not put into statute that he must or must not take this or that into account <e> <s> there is then always the danger of some lawyer or someone else afterwards before the tribunal saying oh this warrant is bad <e> <s> it is invalid because he did not take this into account and the statute said that he ought to take it into account <e> <s> we should widely entrust him to do what in his judgment is necessary and leave him to follow the guidelines which are proper and which have been set out in the white paper but do not let us interfere with his judgment by laying down positive rules as to the extent to which he can go <e> <s> leave it to his judgment <e> <s> do not put words such as this into the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard my noble friend lord mishcon i was at first persuaded in favour of his amendment but having heard my noble friend lord whitelaw i was persuaded the other way <e> <s> that is because matters of whether or not the safeguards have been complied with are not really appropriate for the tribunal but they are appropriate for the commissioner to inquire into <e> <s> i refer to subsections and of clause <e> <s> inquiring into whether there has been a breach of the safeguards involves an inquiry as to whether or not they have been adequate <e> <s> so on the whole i would be against the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it may look as though it is a question of words but if it is i say that i would prefer amendment no <e> <s> the principles applicable by a court put forward on behalf of the government <e> <s> i do so for this reason <e> <s> the principles on judicial review are reasonably well settled now <e> <s> for instance the court can interfere with the decision of the secretary of state if he is not acting in accordance with natural justice it can interfere if he has misdirected himself on a point of law it can also interfere if the decision or his warrant was utterly unreasonable <e> <s> those are the principles applicable to judicial review <e> <s> they have been well settled by the courts over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the suggestion but i also have sympathy with the views expressed by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> is this to extend not only to the security services but to the army the navy and the ministry of defence when one civil servant or one member of the services complains against a fellow <e> <s> surely the proper course and i hope that it is done throughout the services is to complain right up to the secretary of state the minister or whoever it may be <e> <s> it would be an entirely new departure to have an ombudsman so to speak in that regard <e> <s> i doubt whether it should be introduced just in this one sphere <e> <s> if it is to be done it should be done throughout the services <e> <s> i am afraid that in those circumstances i do not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i agree entirely that the jurisdiction of the high court should never be excluded even by parliament itself and ousted altogether <e> <s> the jurisdiction of the high court to control secretaries of state or anyone such as that should be maintained <e> <s> in this particular case if an application were made to the high court to review the decision of the secretary of state it would certainly get nowhere <e> <s> that is not only for the reason that they could not get in any evidence but also because reading through the statute it is plain that the object of parliament is that if there is to be any investigation whatsoever as to whether or not the act has been complied with it has to go before the tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has quoted me quite correctly <e> <s> that was the view that i certainly expressed in this house <e> <s> but we lost on it <e> <s> i have to accept the ruling of this house that the words for the purpose of prostitution must be in the bill and therefore they are retained in the bill <e> <s> in retaining them this house is affirming the view of the criminal law revision committee <e> <s> the very point that the noble lord lord mishcon and myself put was that we wanted it to be an offence to accost a woman from a motor-car for sexual purposes so as to cause her annoyance <e> <s> that is what we wanted <e> <s> that is one of the possibilities that the criminal law revision committee considered on page <e> <s> it is one of the positions that it considered and rejected <e> <s> it came down in favour of an offence being committed if a man were to accost a woman from a motor-car for the purpose of prostitution <e> <s> those are the very words <e> <s> those words are now in the bill <e> <s> what it is not intended to cover is the man who parks his vehicle and leaves for a walk and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read paragraph very carefully and i hope that i have not misread it <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords it obviously means the people who would be affected by the nuisance and they must be in the neighbourhood they would not be affected otherwise <e> <s> it really seems to be a matter of surplusage to talk about the immediate neighbourhood <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment and may i also go on to tell your lordships of the decisions of the european court which have given rise to it <e> <s> it is said that the government and they i think most reluctantly feel they are obliged to adhere to the decisions of that court <e> <s> let me tell your lordships what those decisions were <e> <s> the particular case which gave rise to this dialogue took place in <e> <s> it involved a boy

rule that they were not to take that short cut <e> <s> cosans and others disobeyed <e> <s> they were reported to the headmaster for a caning but when they got to the spot they objected to it so that he did not cane them <e> <s> instead cosans was suspended for a little time from going to school <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of myself and others thank the noble viscount the lord president of the council and indeed the government for this most important bill <e> <s> before it came to your lordships house the law was in a vacuum <e> <s> there were reports lord birketts report lord radcliffes report and lord diplocks report and two white papers which did not govern the law at all on this important matter of telephone tapping <e> <s> it was just at the discretion of the secretary of state or whoever it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the third reading of this bill <e> <s> it was at the committee stage that i put down a number of amendments designed to strengthen the bill

wholeheartedly <e> <s> if i understand its object it is that we should keep the present position regarding our taxi drivers and not undermine it by unlicensed competition <e> <s> to my mind the real trouble behind all this is that the whole clause is incomprehensible and one cannot understand the amendment without knowing the clause <e> <s> i should like the amendment to be withdrawn and for us to have a full discussion on the next amendment which the noble lord lord renton is to move to quash the whole clause <e>", "<cs> when we discussed the earlier amendment in the name of the noble earl i asked what is the effect of this amendment <e> <s> as we listened to the reply on behalf of the government i asked what is the effect of this clause <e> <s> this clause is virtually unintelligible

baroness aware that the head of a mission can always waive the benefit of diplomatic immunity on behalf of the agents of the mission <e> <s> in these circumstances would it not be reasonable to ask

judiciary at that time <e> <s> the top salaries review body recommended substantial increases which i am glad to say the government of that day implemented <e> <s> the judges were reasonably satisfied and that was added to when the tax benefits were given early in this government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say this <e> <s> at the moment when an amendment of this kind is made it is not done by the stationery office or anyone of that kind it has to be done by the law publishers butterworths and the like and we have to wait till we get <e>", "<cs> my lords may i speak to this group of amendments as to the substance of them <e> <s> the form comes later <e> <s> they are deplorable in their drafting but that comes in the next stage <e> <s> on this substance of the matter we had that case from liverpool in my court in and it is the only case there is on this section of the town police clauses act of <e> <s> that act of stated that the commissioners shall licence such number of hackney carriages that is taxicabs as they think fit <e> <s> so all the corporation or the commissioners could do was to fix the number <e> <s> in the liverpool corporation had fixed as the number of taxis of liverpool and then if you please they proposed to increase that number to the next year and the next <e> <s> but the corporation had promised the liverpool taxi operators that they would be consulted before there was an increase <e> <s> it did not consult them and in the court of appeal we held that its increase was bad because it had not consulted the taxi operators first <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word on this drafting <e> <s> this town police clauses act is not an ordinary statute as we know it <e> <s> it is simply a series of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind your lordships that at the committee stage it was the noble earl lord onslow i think who said that this was all gobbledegook <e> <s> it certainly is so to any layman or to any member of your lordships house reading it in the ordinary way and i would also add to the lawyers even to the law lords <e> <s> in order to understand this clause i have read the report and the reasoning of the legal draftsman and i find myself in complete agreement with my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word about this <e> <s> in framing this clause the draftsman has used the technique of going back to the act which does not apply to any modern clauses <e> <s> you have to look at that act first and amend it <e> <s> you have to look at the act which is again incorporated to see what extent it is amended <e> <s> you have to look at several other acts before you can get down to this at all <e> <s> the noble lord says it ought all to be combined in one big code because it is not feasible to rewrite the odd section what is required is a clean sweep <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say just one thing <e> <s> even if we accept the principle so called of the amendment is seems to me quite hopeless <e> <s> as i read it the only order that can be made comes under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word in favour of this amendment <e> <s> it is to lawyers and to the courts a most important matter in regard to new legislation which is just coming in favouring competition and prohibiting those who would prevent competition <e> <s> it occurs in the treaty of rome in the common market legislation articles and and it occurs in our own competition act <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i was a little hasty <e> <s> before your lordships consider these pages of amendments from the commons i should like to make one or two general observations <e> <s> first when the bill came before this house on second reading my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor stated that the provisions were relatively small helpful and non-controversial <e> <s> in its progress through the house the contrary has been shown they are relatively large unhelpful and highly controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a strange amendment <e> <s> when we last had the bill before us the law society were to be investigator prosecutor and judge as to inadequate professional services <e> <s> some of us tried to sever the investigative procedure from the disciplinary and judicial procedure but without success <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord renton has apologised its is equally for me to do so if i have not done my homework <e> <s> i had only a short time and i did not have time to go through the entire thing <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say one word and to thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for getting through a relatively large number of helpful provisions in this bill <e> <s> although i have made one or two errors and although i have not done my homework the lord chancellor as always has been able to correct me and put me right <e> <s> i thank him for it and i wish the act well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word on this bill <e> <s> first as to its importance the last act dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word about this <e> <s> in a way this is a small matter of keeping up with inflation so far as the limits of legal aid are concerned <e> <s> but i wish to throw out a thought <e> <s> in this country law is now available for the rich it is available for the poor but it is not available for the middle classes and the limits of legal aid ought to be extended to make it available to people of the middle class <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will wholeheartedly support the agreement <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the prime minister and mr garret fitzgerald on this achievement <e> <s> i would put aside past history <e> <s> i would put aside the preparation of the agreement and how it was presented <e> <s> i would look straight at the agreement itself and see what it comes to <e> <s> i would draw attention particularly to the administration of justice in both north and south <e> <s> on that matter there should be no disagreement between one government and another <e> <s> there should be no disagreement between majority and minority parties <e> <s> there should be wholehearted support for the administration of justice by the great mass of the people <e>", "<cs> my lord most of your lordships have enlightened this house with their own expertise and knowledge <e> <s> i think i am the first to speak who has had actual experience of deciding cases under the shops act <e> <s> that act has been held up in your lordships house to scorn and abuse <e> <s> let me tell your lordships that on the times that i have had to consider it i have found it to be exceedingly well drafted for the conditions as they were at that time in <e> <s> there was a departmental committee presided over by sir ernest gowers who is one of the wisest and ablest men i have ever met he wrote that excellent pamphlet <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the right of peremptory challenge serves any useful purpose today and is it not high time that we considered abolishing it altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept either of these amendments <e> <s> it reminds me of the time when one was in the courts of law if you have no defence on the merits take a technical point take a pleading point <e> <s> that seems to me what is sought to be done by these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords so did i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i bring your lordships

bill <e> <s> i see no difference whatever between parents-in-law and children-in-law on the one hand and stepparents and step-children on the other <e> <s> the majority report would let them all in <e> <s> let it be so <e> <s> i would not let parents-in-law in any more than the bishops but first let me take this qualification of under years of age and not being a child of the family <e> <s> that is quite unworkable and i shall take my own instance just to tell your lordships what happened to me and my wife <e> <s> we were widow and widower i was and my wife was <e> <s> we had step-children on

i say that i have been in favour of family courts ever since and that this is a very appropriate matter to come before such a court when it is established <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been my lot over the years to consider this proposal many times <e> <s> i have been present at many of the debates on it in this house i have written upon it and i have heard cases in the courts in which people have raised this convention on human rights <e> <s> i am afraid i do not think these clauses ought to be incorporated into our law as part of our law <e> <s> they are framed in the words of a treaty vague and indefinite and if they are brought before the courts of law those courts and i am afraid the european court of strasbourg decide not by the words as we do in our courts but by the policy which they think underlies them <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussion this evening raises ethical moral and legal questions of the first importance euthanasia and mercy killing <e> <s> may i deal with the legal side <e>", "<cs> my lords not when i was a young man <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will welcome the statement made by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor because it

<e>", "<cs> this technicality ought to be overcome <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon has put forward a good proposal as has my noble and learned friend lord simon <e> <s> we must in some way overcome this technicality and discuss the merits of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my drafting may have been at fault <e> <s> i did not mean to mix this up with planning applications or with planning law <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord colville said we have all known a lot of those and do not wish to be mixed up in them <e> <s> i really wanted to make it clear that the consent of the local authority should be an operative factor in deciding whether or not to give permission <e> <s> as has well been expressed the local authority is best placed to know what is happening in our countryside and especially in representing the residents whether or not there should be sunday trading <e>", "<cs> there is one lawyer the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale who has spoken vigorously against the amendment <e> <s> as another lawyer i should like to say that i support it entirely and emphatically for all the reasons which have been given so well on both sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this so-called church has been severely criticised by the judges and particularly by a judge in the family division <e> <s> is he also aware that this and other religious cults do great harm to our society particularly in regard to the relationships between parents and child <e> <s> is it not high time that all of them were deprived of charitable status <e> <s> how is the attorney-generals action proceeding in regard to that very point in connection with one of these cults <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is not merely the parties concerned or the charity commissioners <e> <s> the attorney-general and the government are concerned in this matter and they ought to take it up <e>", "<cs> yesterday i withdrew my first amendment in the expectation that this amendment would be put before the committee <e> <s> i ask your lordships to support the principle of it <e> <s> in a way it has been endorsed in very many respects <e> <s> the principle is this <e> <s> there should not be unrestricted trading on sundays in our towns cities or counties <e> <s> there should be some brake and restraint on it <e> <s> that control should be in the hands of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> i too have read this report <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble and learned friend lord roskill and his colleagues on a most excellent report <e> <s> i should like to endorse every word of it and support every single recommendation despite what my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord wigoder have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for introducing this subject which is important constitutionally and legislatively <e> <s> i gather that this was at the suggestion of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton whom we all regard so highly in this field <e> <s> however i should just like to say a word on my experience in dealing with codes of practice <e> <s> the first one which comes to mind is the first in date the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add just a few remarks <e> <s> it is nearly years since i first sat on the judicial committee of the privy council hearing appeals from australia and as i have also visited australia and know all their judges and their colleagues first i should like to associate myself with all that my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce has said <e>", "<cs> i have added my name to this amendment because it seems to me to be the nearest approach we can get to a reasonable compromise <e> <s> your lordships house and others are divided on this controversy <e> <s> is sunday trading to be free for all or are there to be restrictions so as to keep the character of our sunday if we can <e> <s> this compromise comes the nearest to a sensible arrangement <e>", "<cs> may i say just one word in support of the amendment <e> <s> to understand it you have to go back to section of the act <e> <s> this is what it says <e>", "<cs> i have been rather embarrassed in all the discussions on this clause because in answer to the suggested amendments what is really being said is wait for the wages councils bill <e> <s> i do not have the first notion of what it is or what is proposed <e> <s> i doubt whether it is proper in considering our clauses to say well we may have something to deal with all this in a wages bill which may be brought before the house later <e>", "<cs> i take a different view <e> <s> i hope this amendment will be carried by your lordships committee <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton has given you a good illustration if you please of a man who goes regularly to church on sunday morning and sunday evening <e> <s> if he is employed before the commencement of the act and is afterwards required to do sunday work and he says i cant i want to go to the choir he has a remedy for unfair dismissal if he is dismissed on that account <e> <s> but then as my noble friend says take his son years old <e> <s> three weeks after the act is passed he does just the same he is employed by that employer and when he wants to go off to the choir the employer says oh no youve got to do your sunday work <e> <s> that young man has no remedy at all according to this clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add just one point <e> <s> at the last session we had on this bill i understood that in view of our criticisms of the obscure schedule and its unintelligibility and complexity my noble friend the minister indicated that he would ask the parliamentary draftsman to redraft it at least so as to make it intelligible <e> <s> in the future stages and even today are we going to discuss the schedule in its present form when we know it is going in all probability to take a different shape in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords this report deals with a matter of great constitutional importance <e> <s> i should like first to express our gratitude as your lordships will to my noble and learned friend lord templeman not only for his conduct his chairmanship of the committee you can see how he examined those witnesses and got them to deal with the points but also for the report which covers so many important fields <e> <s> it points out not that perhaps things are going wrong at the moment but that there are dangers difficulties and defects lying ahead which must be taken into account by the government and their departments <e>", "<cs> as a lawyer i should like to see the law of england scotland and wales uniform on this matter <e> <s> if licensing with penalties for unlawful dealing and the like is desirable for scotland then the same should apply in england and wales <e> <s> the problem is the same <e> <s> the rivers and estuaries are the same in all respects that matter <e> <s> the poachers take masses of salmon and bring them to glasgow or london <e> <s> the problem is the same therefore the law should be the same for dealing with it <e> <s> the only question that arises is whether we should follow the system already proposed in clause already passed or pursue the ingenious suggestion of the noble viscount lord trenchard that we should adopt the game laws for england <e> <s> it seems to me that this proposal would work very well <e> <s> it works with the game laws <e> <s> you need a <e>", "<cs> clauses and introduce new offences into the law of england and scotland <e> <s> may i say that i am glad to see that they are there in exactly the same terms <e> <s> as i said a little while ago it is very desirable that the law of scotland and that of england should be uniform in these matters especially when you are creating new offences <e> <s> these clauses are of special importance in view of the discussion we have had about licensing and the uncertainties of its scope and the like <e> <s> if these clauses were properly drafted so as to put the burden on the person who is in possession of the illegally-caught salmon they would do a great deal to remedy the whole position <e> <s> but at the moment as i read them they do not put the burden on the person who has the illegally-caught salmon <e>", "<cs> i really spoke on both clauses and which are in precisely the same words <e> <s> it is wrong to suggest that the law of scotland and the law of england should be different in interpreting the selfsame words <e> <s> therefore i suggest that i was right in dealing with them together <e> <s> we are dealing with the interpretation of a few english words not scottish words in both clauses <e> <s> i can understand the background of the scottish law that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate mentioned <e> <s> on the other hand the clause does not make mention of reasonable grounds for suspecting <e> <s> one has to prove that the person in possession has acted unlawfully <e> <s> that is where the burden of proof lies and that is the burden of my argument <e> <s> i can understand the point made by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but it does not convince me <e> <s> still we shall return to clause later <e>", "<cs> i would support the suggestion that we have simple words which everyone can understand and the burden of proof clearly expressed as my noble friend lord trenchard has said <e> <s> but in view of the discussions which we are to have before long it would be helpful to consider the wording of this clause to make sure that we have the burden of proof properly placed upon the defence <e> <s> however that can be dealt with i hope in the discussions which we are due to have on the earlier part of the clause <e>", "<cs> i quite agree <e> <s> i am ready to wait for the amendments proposed by the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> i certainly will <e> <s> i want to get on with the merits of the argument <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships leave to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i await with interest what the noble baroness lady seear is going to do on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> in this case i support the amendment <e> <s> i always regretted mr justice lateys committee decision when it reduced the age of majority from to <e> <s> for centuries the age has been and it was a sensible rule <e> <s> at people are more susceptible <e> <s> they are not nearly so aware of

marry her stepfather the age of is the proper age to consider <e> <s> it is the age that the majority report itself considered <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say just a word in support of the amendment <e> <s> the illustration given by the noble baroness was quite clear <e> <s> let us suppose you have this stepfather who is aged shall we say and the stepdaughter who is <e> <s> there is no possible sexual ribaldry or anything for years and the girl is at school and so forth for of her first years <e> <s> then afterwards there may be a death or divorce or whatever <e> <s> why should not the two be free to marry then whereas the original clause said that while she was under and a child of the family they could never marry <e> <s> i would support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken about this <e> <s> i suggested earlier and i suggest here that there is no difference in principle <e> <s> once you let the step relationship go into marriage you have the in-law relationship too <e> <s> indeed the position is far more serious in a step-relationship because then you have father and mother with their joint stepchildren in one family and you are allowing after divorce marriage between members of that self-same family the stepfather with the step-daughter <e> <s> that is a far greater breach of the loyalty or the integrity of the family than the next step the in-law relationship <e> <s> there you have two families separate ones <e> <s> you have the father-in-law with his wife and you have the son who marries the daughter-in-law and sets up his own family <e> <s> then whatever the cause both parties divorce <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord mottistone i may not be able to stay to the end of this debate but i want to say a few words in support of the general objectives of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord chalfont has dramatically described the evils which are present in our society and in particular in some councillors in some councils <e> <s> like my noble friend lord mottistone i have been concerned only with the lowest level of local authorities parish councils <e> <s> i was the president of their national association <e> <s> i always told them that they must be completely independent of party politics otherwise i could never be their president <e> <s> i exhorted them all when they were elected that they should stand as independents and not for any political party <e> <s> as they grew bigger i was distressed to find that gradually electors could only know the candidates by their party label <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that throughout our local administration party politics have come to stay <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard today the sort of arguments i have heard dozens of times in the courts of law <e> <s> they say if you do not like your opponents argument and cannot deal with it in any other way pour scorn upon it <e> <s> it is like the partner who had to leave a case to his colleague <e> <s> he put a note for him on the brief reading no case abuse the other sides attorney <e>", "<cs> my lords in the earlier discussion i said that i congratulated my noble and learned friend lord roskill and his colleagues on the report and that i agreed with every word of it <e> <s> having reread the report and having heard the most informative discussion in your lordships house i still agree with every word of it and hope that it will be put into force <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate my noble and learned friend his exposition and his experience are of great value to

to say that as you had to work on sunday you will have a day off instead <e> <s> surely those are sensible provisions to continue not only for the under s but for those above <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said enough <e> <s> i find the governments arguments quite unconvincing <e> <s> i move my amendment and hope that most noble lords will support it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add one word <e>

there is any difference of opinion between the lord advocate and myself as to what we intend the clause to effect <e> <s> i agree with the clause as interpreted by the lord advocate but i think it might be stretched against us <e> <s> as i understand them these amendments have been tabled simply to make the matter clear so that magistrates in lower courts are not confused <e> <s> however i shall not waste the time of the house any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my gratification for england <e> <s> wales and scotland have been well represented the english will be the people affected and it is a very good thing that we should have this <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i am on home ground now we have got to england and to a clause which has to apply in england <e> <s> let me tell you the difference at the moment in the bill between scotland and england <e> <s> i may tell you that in my experience the scottish lawyers are very good they stick to principle and theory but the english are far more practical <e> <s> that is why i hope that this clause as we want it to be will be of practical use all the way round <e> <s> it is much more extensive than the scottish one which we were discussing because that related simply to a person who was in possession of salmon <e> <s> here we are dealing with the real question not only of the person in possession but of the person who receives the salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with the leave of the house <e> <s> i am sure that in view of what has been said by the noble lord lord belstead we are all agreed upon the objectives <e> <s> the only difference between us is as to the wording <e> <s> surely we can get that wording right after a few discussions <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will reject the amendment and will support the bill as it stands <e> <s> we are here dealing with party political propaganda and how far a local authority can indulge in it <e> <s> the question raised in this discussion is how is the judge to deal with the matter <e> <s> is he to go by the design or the intention of the man who publishes it <e> <s> the man may say i didnt intend it to be party political propaganda <e> <s> or is he to go by the effect on the ordinary population on the people <e> <s> in other words is it to be subjective according to the man who writes it or is it going to be objective according to the people who read it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word in support of this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the clause as it stands in the bill is likely to produce much difficulty of interpretation <e> <s> it is very necessary to have everything in this bill clear for the judges to decide <e> <s> if i may say so the first obscurity occurs in the words political party <e> <s> the courts will have to define and say what is a political party <e> <s> of course there is no difficulty about those who are represented in this chamber or in another place or those who are represented on local authorities or the candidates themselves or those who represent political parties <e> <s> but then if one goes beyond the parties in this chamber and in the other place what does one do with all the many other organisations which may come into question <e> <s> what will one do with the national front <e> <s> what does one do with the communist party <e> <s> what will one do with the militant tendency <e> <s> i can mention hundreds of examples such as the national council for civil liberties <e> <s> there are all kinds of them <e> <s> are they political parties or not <e>", "<cs> may i just say one word <e> <s> i have heard the argument of my noble friend lord elton and there is a great deal in what he says <e> <s> if we had in clause <e>", "<cs> i think that the local authorities may well be able to do their positive duty under the race relations act namely to promote good relations and so forth and still obey the negative duty that they must

be to include the amendment <e> <s> but i should like it to be considered to get the matter quite clear on what should be done perhaps by some other amendment later <e>", "<cs> it seems to me plain that under clause all that the local authority will have to do is to have regard to whether the persons are identified with a political party <e> <s> it can take into account whether the point is made

me that all the illustrations which the noble baroness has given are reasonably incidental to its activities <e> <s> it might be undesirable to extend its powers to make it equivalent to a local authority under two sections of the act which are widely drawn and which need a good deal of interpretation <e>", "<cs> i am not sufficiently familiar with the legislation i am afraid to answer that question <e> <s> i would hope that it is out of its own resources or anything that it can legitimately acquire <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that we leave the bill as it stands and do not accept the amendment <e> <s> section which is in wide terms can give powers to provide information as to local government matters affecting the area <e> <s> there is an unreported case which dealt with that <e>

amendment ought not to be pressed in any way <e> <s> it is far too restrictive of the powers of the local authorities and as has been suggested it would be much better for the government to reconsider the whole matter and get it on a proper footing <e>", "<cs> for many years i was president of the national association of parish councils <e> <s> i heartily support the amendment <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment may i plead for clarity in regard to the bill itself <e> <s> i have found the greatest difficulty in understanding it on page subsection <e> <s> i first had to go to sections and of the act and then i had to read the widdicombe report where i found on page <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises the whole question of the status of codes of practice in our law <e> <s> we had a discussion about this matter a few weeks ago <e> <s> at that time the opinion was expressed in this chamber by the noble viscount lord colville of culross that if parliament is going to produce codes of practice then it must at the same time apply its mind to stating in what terms is to be the effect of a code when it is prepared <e> <s> in other words when parliament approves a code of practice it should at the same time state what the codes legal effect is to be if and when that code goes before the courts of law <e>", "<cs> i oppose the suggestion that clause stand part for three reasons <e> <s> first the clause as it originally stood has been emasculated by amendments already made by your lordships <e> <s> the first amendment confines the guidance to local authorities in order to determine expenditure on <e>", "<cs> if it has no legal effect then i think that we should have a clause in to say this clause is to have no legal effect <e> <s> otherwise people will misuse it <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will not accept this amendment because i suggest it is unworkable <e> <s> the voluntary body or organisation with which i have been most closely connected is the national marriage guidance council whose fundings were mainly from the local authority <e> <s> they came in a lump sum such as but there was no segregation into publicity or other purposes <e> <s> no doubt some of their funds were used for proper publicity supporting the institution of marriage <e> <s> one could not say that they had received money for publicity but for their general purposes <e> <s> it seems to me that one could not work this provision in relation to the innumerable bodies which receive money from local authorities because publicity is not separately itemised <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will not press it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my support for the amendment <e> <s> i am personally grateful that the right reverend prelate is no longer opposing it <e> <s> i always thought that the pass was sold so to speak when step-parent was allowed to marry stepchild <e> <s> i gave illustrations earlier on <e> <s> it seems to me that that situation is much more likely to lead to sexual rivalry than the in-law one <e> <s> at all events once the pass is sold and step-parent can marry stepchild after divorce or decease it seems to me that with in-laws equally the parent-in-law ought to be able to marry the daughter-in-law of course after the necessary divorce or decease <e> <s> this amendment does not go nearly so far as <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the tributes to my noble friend lord glenarthur for the courage and courtesy with which he has conducted this unfortunate bill through the house <e> <s> it has been unfortunate from its very inception its continuance and its passage through the house <e> <s> i say that it has been unfortunate from its inception because it was the recent unfortunate home secretary mr leon brittan who in august appointed a committee to inquire into the position <e> <s> he appointed that committee when there was no clamour at all for change and when the country was going along quite happily as it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for having been given the opportunity first to hear my noble friend lord trenchard and now perhaps to treat you to a little dry law <e> <s> this is a problem of the burden of proof in criminal cases <e> <s> it is a problem i have been used to all my life <e> <s> i wrote an article about it years ago in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the government

have given the background <e> <s> let me just follow up what my noble friend said about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale has put down this motion <e> <s> it seems to me that there is an urgent need today for reform in the law on charities and in its administration <e> <s> the law as it stands at the moment is quite uncertain <e> <s> it started in the days of the first elizabeth when there was no income tax at all <e> <s> it was re-enunciated in by lord macnaghten when income tax was small <e> <s> now in we have huge taxes and the elimination evasion or avoidance of tax is a growth industry <e> <s> that is the situation with which we are faced and the reform of the law is necessary <e>", "<cs> to come back to my point my lords the question of charitable status was considered by the charity commissioners and their view of the law as set out in their letter is that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words <e> <s> the words shall have regard are most uncertain <e> <s> recently in the local government bill we had the words <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word on this <e> <s> i have in my hand the rd legal aid annual report and if i am permitted i shall quote from it in an amendment that i shall move later <e> <s> often it has been of the greatest value <e> <s> i know all the members of the committee <e> <s> they represent a wide spectrum of our life the master of a college and so forth <e> <s> they report in many pages on developments during the year and problems during the year such as the important problem of the charge on the matrimonial home which has been much considered and whether or not the unassisted party should get help from the legal aid fund <e>", "<cs> this provision has given great difficulty in england <e> <s> when a legally-aided person recovers property the cost of all the litigation becomes a charge on the property recovered or preserved <e> <s> we have had great trouble especially between husband and wife often both legally aided when after the litigation is over the legal aid fund has a charge on the matrimonial home and the charge wipes out the whole value of the home <e> <s> we have had great difficulty through the courts in regard to that charge on the matrimonial home <e> <s> there have been disputes about it <e> <s> that is one aspect <e>", "<cs> it all depends on these regulations <e> <s> we have had a tremendous number in england about the matrimonial home <e> <s> we have had great trouble <e> <s> often when both sides are legally aided the only asset is the matrimonial home over which they have been fighting <e> <s> so we have had to make special provisions about the matrimonial home when both sides are legally aided <e> <s> when one side is legally aided i can understand that if large sums are recovered the costs should come out of the sum recovered <e> <s> but that is not always the case when it is only a small sum <e> <s> i hope that the regulations will deal with the matter fairly <e>", "<cs> this is very important because in england there has been great pressure for the legal aid system to be applied to industrial tribunals which have so much litigation <e> <s> it may be desirable but i can see that it would be very expensive for the legal aid funds <e> <s> if it is to be applied to scotland it ought to be applied to england as well <e> <s> that is all that i would say <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept this amendment <e> <s> we have had this problem in england and mr justice faulks in his report suggested that there should be legal aid in defamation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say one word <e> <s> i think you have been lucky in scotland not to have many defamation cases <e> <s> if you once get legal aid you will have swarms of them and you will be sorry for it <e>", "<cs> my lords in this bill we seek to implement the recommendations of the warnock report <e> <s> when the previous bill was before a committee of your lordships i proposed a number of amendments <e> <s> we did not proceed with them because we were so anxious not to delay the passing of the principal bill <e> <s> but now they come before your lordships in the form of this supplemental bill <e> <s> i think that the easiest and best way to explain the position to your lordships is to take a case which actually came before the courts <e> <s> it came before the courts in <e> <s> it was not reported in any law report until and then only in the family law reports not available in this house <e> <s> but it gives an illustration of exactly what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that your lordships do not accept this amendment much as we sympathise with the objectives of it <e> <s> the widdicombe report made it quite clear in their one recommendation that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will not accept either of these amendments <e> <s> in a way it is essential that the local authority should be given some guidance as to how they will decide the important question of whether the publicity is designed to affect support for a political party <e> <s> it is a very difficult question for the local authority to decide <e> <s> it is important for them to have guidance upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords when we considered this bill earlier i said that there is nothing in it about enforcement <e> <s> how are you to do it <e> <s> this amendment suggests quite a good way <e> <s> the really recalcitrant councillors who determine to indulge in political propaganda with the ratepayers money are liable to repay it jointly and severally <e> <s> i agree that the wording of it is very uncertain and doubtful at the beginning but it has a very good precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest perhaps that this could be considered before third reading <e> <s> why not let whoever is aggrieved go straight to the court and not have to go through the district auditor <e> <s> by a simple provision that could be done in this statute and it would be a good thing to do it in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not leave out subsection because sections and are terribly complicated and <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that these amendments will be accepted <e> <s> it is important that the law on this point should be clarified because the widdicombe report shows how uncertain and ambiguous it is <e> <s> section which we considered on previous amendments i hope is all right on the information and publicity matters <e> <s> but section has given rise to much controversy <e> <s> the widdicombe report thought it should not apply to publicity or authorised publicity but it recognised that some local authorities thought that it did and on the advice of leading counsel the money was being expended <e> <s> in those circumstances the widdicombe report thought the matter must be clarified <e> <s> an important passage in that report at page states <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that accepting this amendment would cause a great deal of confusion <e> <s> the amendment we have just agreed to no <e> <s> will cover all the grounds on which the local authorities can spend money on publicity <e> <s> once we have done that and got the various amendments in it seems to me impossible to reconcile this fresh amendment in addition to those we have already passed <e> <s> it would introduce a good deal of confusion and therefore i hope that it will not be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that i have put the amendment a little wide <e> <s> my original draft was that the local authorities should give the funds and the voluntary body <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this bill and also thank the noble and learned lord lord scarman and his committee for a well-reasoned and convincing report <e> <s> as i have been concerned in many of the law cases that were under consideration perhaps i may be permitted to explain to your lordships that the primary object of this bill as i understand it is to deal with latent defects in buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble baronesses and noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> i am sure that they will be most useful to mr widdicombe and his committee when they have to consider this matter <e> <s> i should just like to round this off <e>", "<cs> by quoting what widdicombe stated at the conclusion of the interim report <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that with scotland the minister had finished <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i intervened too soon <e> <s> i was about to refer to a very important passage in the widdicombe report at paragraph <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the local authorities and the voluntary associations were very apprehensive about the bill and whether it would curb their publicity and their information services <e> <s> i always thought they were unduly apprehensive but as the bill is now coming before your lordships amended i do not think they need be afeared at all <e> <s> this bill will really condemn only the evil practices <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first address myself to the wider motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my enthusiastic support for this bill so ably introduced by my noble friend lord dean of beswick <e> <s> this is a very useful bill <e> <s> your lordships like me will often when driving along a road be furious when smoke or fire from stubble or straw-burning comes across the road and obscures the view <e> <s> i have a field or two and i am equally careful to tell my man when he is lighting a fire to take care that the wind is in the right direction and the smoke does not go across the road <e> <s> those are the simple dangers that we know <e>", "<cs> i hope that members of the committee will not accept this amendment which is contained simply in the definitition clause <e> <s> i have looked for the place where the word infringes comes into the body of the bill and it comes into clause <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the amendment that is proposed by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> however i am afraid it would wreck the bill if it were carried <e> <s> it goes completely against the principle which i gather was supported at second reading that the convention on fundamental rights and freedoms shall have the force of law in the united kingdom <e> <s> that is what all the supporters of human rights have said from the beginning let us have something in our law to make human rights have the force of law <e> <s> that is the fundamental object of this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments <e> <s> first it must be remembered that when the government extended the time and allowed a petition to the european court of human rights it was not part of our law <e> <s> what we are doing by this bill is to make it part of our law and any violation could be enforced in our own courts <e> <s> the government have no power to take away our liberty or our sovereignty <e> <s> it is the power of treaty which commits us to that <e> <s> that is what they have done <e> <s> but they did it at a time when there was no remedy in the english courts for many of the violations and when it was not part of our law <e>", "<cs> i still press my amendment <e>", "<cs> i too have heard all that has been said <e> <s> i think that the minister has given a sufficient answer <e> <s> if i may say so i think that what my noble friend lord wigoder has said is the complete answer <e> <s> if the judge of the high court thinks it is necessary or desirable in the interests of justice to hear the defendant he will certainly arrange accordingly <e> <s> that is the answer which my noble friend lord wigoder suggested <e> <s> i think it is a sufficient answer and for myself i would not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was careful to say that this is voluntary disclosure <e> <s> a later amendment may concern compulsory disclosure <e> <s> we may come on later to the question of compulsory disclosure <e>", "<cs> i accept it at once <e>", "<cs> let me say that i would accept that too <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank everyone who has contributed to the discussion <e> <s> it seems to me to have been most valuable <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for saying that the government will consider the matter carefully <e> <s> it needs consideration and careful drafting if all the points are to be dealt with <e> <s> offhand i am not sure that suspects is not right <e> <s> equally however we have to bring in all those other chaps <e> <s> without a clause such as this all this money will get away <e> <s> the drug traffickers are clever enough to pass it through the banks and money changers and switch it abroad <e> <s> one will never get hold of it without the co-operation of the banks and such like in voluntarily letting us know <e> <s> in that way the chief officer of police will be able to make his inquiries very discreetly if you please without of course disclosing his source or anything of that kind <e> <s> by this means one would hope to prevent drug trafficking money going abroad <e>", "<cs> i thank everybody very much <e> <s> i quite appreciate the point of my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> i hoped that those matters whether a person had to apply to a high court judge and get an order from him whether we could deal with such matters as the banks whether it should be some or all and as to the amount and so forth could be dealt with in a scheme <e> <s> in other words it was deliberately vague so as to allow all the details to be worked out later and the objections considered <e> <s> it will very much need the co-operation of the banks <e> <s> but equally having said that i thank the minister for the consideration given by the home office to this very problem <e> <s> it is evidently being looked into very carefully at the moment <e>

like to strengthen it a little <e> <s> i would not leave it at believing that it was to be adapted and so on or having reason to believe or suspecting <e> <s> it will be hard to prove the belief <e>

away with it <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we have nothing like this in respect of criminal legal aid in england <e> <s> we go by the report of mr justice widgery that is lord widgery which was against any classification <e> <s> in respect of superior courts the report said <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> quite often it is important for a man to have legal aid before he is called upon to plead <e> <s> i cannot say anything about scotland but again i go back to the widgery report <e> <s> it would be impracticable to require applicants for legal aid to plead before their applications are considered and so forth <e> <s> at all events we should not have it in england and i do not see why you should have it in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much i welcome this amendment <e> <s> twenty-one is a much more sensible age as i have always thought than <e> <s> to bring this matter into line and to get the bill through would be of the first value <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord meston for introducing the bill and for carrying it through and i should also like to thank everyone

supposed marriage will be completely void <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will not accept the amendment <e> <s> we have had these cases of builders putting up houses on a rubbish heap not providing proper foundations and the like and after many years a house begins to sink and to crack <e> <s> when does the cause of action accrue <e> <s> as i have understood the common law in negligence there are three elements the duty of care the breach of it and the ensuing damage <e> <s> the damage is the gist of the action and the common law has always said that the cause of action accrues when the damage occurs <e> <s> that is fundamental <e> <s> my noble friends amendment would date it back to the original breach of duty <e> <s> that cannot be right <e> <s> the controversy that has arisen because of the bill is that very often a man whose house has been built on rubbish or on insecure foundations does not know anything about it and cannot discover anything about it for years <e> <s> the common law said that in those circumstances time does not run against him until he knows of it or he could with reasonable diligence discover it <e> <s> that is the common law <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has said that he will think about it again and i hope he will <e> <s> he said for instance that my bit about financial loss is surplusage <e> <s> it is much better to have in a little surplusage and get it clear than to have arguments afterwards in the courts as to whether it includes it or not <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> we are dealing with latent damage to property for instance after bad foundations have been put in <e> <s> the weakness and the cracks may not appear for years or years and the law until now has said that time does not run against a plaintiff if he did not know of the damage and could not have discovered it with reasonable diligence <e> <s> that is quite intelligible and fair to the plaintiff <e> <s> but now the committee says and i can understand why it is said that that will not protect the defendant sufficiently from stale claims so it has introduced a long stop <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment very firmly <e> <s> it goes back to what i said at the beginning on my first amendment when you have an action for negligence it is a duty of care <e> <s> it can be put as common law it can be put as a breach of a statutory duty and if you please it can be put in any other way which is available <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> the committee was quite clear in paragraph that the provisions under section of the act fraud concealment and mistake should still apply <e> <s> in other words the period of limitation should not bar an individual in circumstances where it is due to fraud deliberate concealment or mistake by the defendant <e> <s> it has occurred in many cases <e> <s> it is a valuable provision and as the committee said <e>", "<cs> i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> in my view the clause as it stands is good enough <e> <s> the amendment of my noble and learned friend lord simon would have been a useful addition but it is not necessary <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i understand surrogacy <e> <s> it is not only when the ovum of another woman is placed into the mothers womb <e> <s> it also applies in the case which i put of a mans semen being placed there <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> may i say that this adds nothing <e> <s> we have the definition of surrogate mother in the act which has already been passed <e> <s> we do not want to use another word which some courts may say was different <e> <s> the bill states born in pursuance of a surrogacy arrangement <e> <s> to know what a surrogacy arrangement is one has to go back to the act which is already in being <e> <s> in a surrogacy arrangement a person would be a surrogate mother so one has to have the definition of surrogate mother as already <e>", "<cs> so far as i understand it when the surrogate mother is the woman with her own egg and she produces the child she is undoubtedly the mother for all purposes <e> <s> the point which my noble friend raises relates to a situation where another woman provides the ovum and the medical man injects that ovum into what i call the mothers body <e> <s> the sperm of a man is joined to it and then that woman carries the baby the implantation and everything like that through the whole nine months to its birth <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i hope we shall retain provisions which render commercial surrogacy illegal <e> <s> the warnock committee considered this matter very closely <e> <s> the report at paragraph on page says and i think i had better read the whole of the paragraph <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it deals with such matters as writing memoirs which is a form of payment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment for the reasons which my noble friend lord swinfen has given <e> <s> when large sums of money pass to the surrogacy organisations it is important that criminal law should be strong enough to fix a proper penalty and if need be imprisonment <e> <s> as to the other suggestion about the attorney-general the courts are very chary about interfering by way of injunction to enforce a criminal law when penalties are already provided by this statute <e> <s> it is not at all right to rely on the attorney-general and the procedure of an injunction which does not appear in the statute <e> <s> the primary way of dealing with these is the criminal law by fine or imprisonment <e> <s> therefore i support entirely what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have no support <e> <s> i shall withdraw my amendment but my argument will be jolly good later on <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little in it between these two amendments but on the whole i would hope that your lordships would accept that just spoken to by my noble friend lord lloyd of hampstead amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on the whole it is just preferable <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with sadness and dismay to the speech made by the noble lord lord paget in which he condemned the system of justice in this country and in particular the lord chief justice of england <e> <s> i regard it as an abuse of

machinery is to report the matter to the home office and to the home secretary so that they can consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support this amendment <e> <s> i gather that the question of

asked myself what an independent free-standing company is <e> <s> i have no idea <e> <s> if the matter came before a judge i am sure that he would say what is an independent free-standing company <e>

discussion <e> <s> perhaps as i have had some experience of the crown proceedings act and knew the situation before i may tell your lordships what the position was <e> <s> before there was a maxim in the law which said the crown can do no wrong <e> <s> as a result if a government lorry careered down a street and knocked down a bystander that bystander could not sue the crown or the government department in tort for damages <e>", "<cs> i should not think we need a statute on this <e> <s> cannot we leave it to the commanding officer <e>", "<cs> i think that most of us will have much sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> there is no reason in principle for distinguishing between military law and our ordinary criminal law <e> <s> we all know that capital punishment has been abolished for even the most heinous crimes such as putting a bomb on an aeroplane and killing or more people kidnapping and the like <e> <s> many of us would feel that there ought to be capital punishment but it

detrimental <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the evil influences of those cults of which i personally have massive evidence from letters by distressed parents is it not extremely urgent for the government to do something especially in view of the intimation that we have had that the final decision of the courts in regard to the charitable status of the moonies will not be decided for some years yet <e> <s> is it not a possibility that we might require them all to be registered like any professional or trade association and then if it is shown that they are involved in practices that

said that it could be enforced in our courts by the civil sanction of an order of mandamus <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> may i say a word in favour of this amendment

both sides and the government gave their undertaking to bring in a clause at this stage <e> <s> they have done it rather late but on the other hand i should have thought that it is possible for all of us to discuss it quite profitably even now because the principle has been discussed and let it go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add one word <e> <s> it seems to me that the word modified is quite correct here <e> <s> modified does not mean complete change it means suitable variation whereas the word interpreted means no variation at all <e> <s> therefore in a way it is much better to give that little bit of the governing bodys voice to make suitable variations not changes in the policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just a few words <e> <s> the institution of marriage

said in the court of appeal that i entirely agree and there is nothing i can usefully add <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome all parts of the bill <e> <s> the first part relates to the truck acts and it

"<cs> we have codes a b c and d according to the amount involved and so on <e> <s> no it is good that the rule committee should regulate matters of that kind <e>", "<cs> i would not support this

if you take out that work you take out a great deal of a dockyards work <e> <s> so i believe that this amendment goes much too far <e>", "<cs> the trading fund is only one of several options your lordships have to consider and i hope you will bear with me if i tell you something of the other options because your lordships will have to decide which option should be accepted <e> <s> may i say that the bill gives no clue whatever to the options <e> <s> as i said on second reading it is very obscure <e> <s> none of your lordships reading the bill or i venture to think reading any of the amendments could understand in the least what the options are which your lordships have to consider <e> <s> the bill is concerned with only one thing the compulsory transfer of the workforce against their will to a new organisation <e> <s> all its provisions apply to the compulsory transfer of the workforce to a new organisation <e>", "<cs> this is an important point <e> <s> it proceeds on the basis of the fourth option that i mentioned that there should be one company which should have the assets have the use of the assets and also employ the workforce <e> <s> i do not mind for the moment whether or not the company is government-owned <e> <s> the important point of principle is that there should be workers shares because then the workers would be much more likely to co-operate in the transfer <e> <s> it will give them a stake in the company and an incentive for which to work <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say how much i welcome what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> in a way workers shares depend as the noble lord lord trefgarne says on there being one company <e> <s> if one company is to take the licence and make profits the <e>", "<cs> i think that it deals with retirement ages but i do not have the report with me <e> <s> i have studied it very carefully <e> <s> from my point of view the important matter is that the european directive takes precedence

quoted takes precedence even over the regulations or whatever the government include <e> <s> i therefore say that on the european directive the only matter that can be transferred is the whole undertaking and one part of it cannot be transferred without the other <e> <s> it is very much a legal argument <e>", "<cs> i quite agree that if we had the one-company structure all would be well and good <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i am very gratified by what the minister has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that a one-company structure is the only permissible one in law and if that takes place i think that the transfer of undertakings can be operated accordingly <e> <s> i am not sure about the wording of the amendment as it stands at the moment because it may need variation <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment because of the undertaking which the minister has given <e>", "<cs> from my point of view this is really a probing amendment because of the anxiety to know what the licence will be for <e> <s> at the moment the government propose that it should be seven years determinable in appropriate circumstances <e> <s> is that too short a time to enable the contractor to come in and see whether the experiment has worked <e> <s> on the other hand will years be too long <e> <s> after all this is rather experimental <e> <s> we want to see whether or not the experiment will be successful <e> <s> apparently the government have opted for seven years <e> <s> if the government have convincing reasons for seven years all well and good <e> <s> however this is a difficult problem <e> <s> the government must keep control <e> <s> the licence mist be determinable the government have to see how it works <e> <s> whether it should be years seven years or even less than seven years is almost a matter of judgment <e> <s> i should like to suggest years but i should like to know why the government think that a period of seven years is best <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord the minister has said it seems quite right to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the reasons in favour of seven years are <e>", "<cs> this amendment is admirably designed but i am afraid that it is unnecessary <e> <s> i have examined the contract goodness knows how many pages there are <e> <s> there are three or four pages to protect these intellectual property rights both existing property rights and future ones <e> <s> i cannot say that i have studied every detail but it seems to me that the contract protects the government the authority and <e>", "<cs> this aspect too is covered by the contract <e> <s> there are several pages it is a very long document but summarised it comes to this <e> <s> the contractor will be required to complete all existing apprenticeships that are running on vesting day <e> <s> the contractor will also be required to sustain apprentice training to levels and standards that will retain a viable dockyard workforce here and provide the ministry with a supply of engineers and technicians <e> <s> it takes several pages of the contract to say that but it probably covers the position <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just a few words <e> <s> this provision is very desirable in practice but i doubt whether it is necessary to write it into a statute because under the provisions of the transfer of undertaking regulations the collective agreements are continued after the transfer and if they are continued subject to any negotiation it follows that in order to be varied at all there must be consultation and machinery for consultation <e> <s> it is a desirable provision but i doubt whether it is necessary to put it in the statute <e>", "<cs> in view of our previous discussion we are i hope in future to deal with one company and not two <e> <s> in those circumstances although i do not object to the principle underlying the amendment it will have to be varied <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> may i suggest a way out <e> <s> why not at the moment withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> and and let appropriate new amendments be put in when we are considering the new set-up <e>", "<cs> very well i shall not object

am sorry in a way that my name appears on the amendment now that i have read it carefully <e> <s> look at the last words <e> <s> the amendment contemplates the experiment of forming a company and conferring upon that company powers for five years <e> <s> but that cannot be done until the secretary of state has made an order <e> <s> therefore the opening words providing that he shall not make an order unless certain conditions are satisfied do not apply in relation to the closing words <e> <s> i am afraid that the experiment is already provided for in what we have heard <e> <s> let there be the licence by the company for the seven years <e> <s> that is the experiment <e> <s> i am afraid therefore that although my name is attached to the amendment i cannot support it <e>", "<cs> my name is attached to the next amendment which is on the same lines <e> <s> this is an important amendment because noble lords can see what will happen <e> <s> the government have to decide which option they will take <e> <s> in particular i hope that they will decide on the one-company option taking a licence for seven years with the workforce affected accordingly <e>", "<cs> yes i am afraid that i too understood that <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i readily acknowledge that there has been full and good consultation up to this point <e> <s> i am equally glad of the assurance that this will continue <e> <s> good consultation on all material matters which are developing should continue right up to the moment when the order is made so far as is necessary <e> <s> so while i withdraw the amendment i am glad of the assurance which the noble lord the minister has given <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> in the circumstances i will not press the amendment any further <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept this amendment <e> <s> on the previous occasion when we talked about the freestanding company i complained that the term was unintelligible to me at all events <e> <s> it is quite clear that this amendment is trying to prevent a commercial company from obtaining any loan from a company in the same group <e> <s> it seems to me that commercially that is quite unacceptable <e> <s> the whole object of this amendment is to try to prevent the development of stansted and i hope that your lordships will not accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word about this <e> <s> i do not agree with the criminal bar association <e> <s> i think we shall have a great problem if this amendment is accepted both in regard to this and <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i will <e> <s> i should like to say only this <e> <s> i preferred the original draft of the governments advisers both in regard to clause and in regard to this one <e> <s> but on the other hand i quite agree that there ought to be consistency <e> <s> clauses and ought to be on the same lines otherwise we shall have the courts arguing about that <e> <s> on the whole i think that in the circumstances it is much better to let the amendment go forward and if there are troubles i think there might be but i hope there will not be i am sure the courts will be able to decide them satisfactorily <e> <s> if i may say so they all lean in favour of the defence a great deal perhaps but on the other hand in those cases i hope they will realise that we want to stop this drug trafficking and all those who assist in it just as much as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in congratulating the noble lord lord glenarthur on introducing the bill in the house and carrying it through <e> <s> it is perhaps revolutionary in our law but it deals with a most intransigent subject <e> <s> the new provisions are as follows <e> <s> there is confiscation <e> <s> after the man is convicted there will be confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking <e> <s> we have not had it before <e> <s> there is the restraint order <e> <s> before the man is convicted or long before that almost as soon as he is charged you can go to the high court and get an order preventing any of the people who hold or may hold the proceeds of the trafficking of drugs dealing with them or getting them away <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was president of birkbeck college for over years may i ask whether the minister is aware or indeed whether the university grants committee is aware of the unique and valuable work that is done by this college <e> <s> it is for students who work by day and study by night and it has produced in its time some of the best graduates not only for teaching in our schools but for our industries and sciences <e> <s> as it is unique

consider any alternative even at the instance of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> my noble and learned friend gave no cheers to this bill <e> <s> on the contrary he found or more misgivings <e> <s>

of these things that they find <e> <s> it would be a very good thing to have the word archaeological added to the others <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> as between these two amendments i should like one or other of them to be accepted but of the two i prefer that proposed by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> let us think for a moment of the problem under the act <e> <s> that applied only to manual workers <e> <s> it did not apply to people working in shops and the like <e> <s> under that act it was permissible for an employer to make deductions from his mens wages so long as he put up a proper notice warning them about it <e> <s> in addition he could deduct from their wages subject to this the men had only one form of complaint they could not go to the civil courts or to a tribunal but had to prosecute the employer before the petty sessions magistrate and had to prove that the deduction was not fair or reasonable <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not support the amendment <e> <s> it is not wise to put rigid rules such as this into the statute itself <e> <s> as i indicated earlier it is really much better for there to be a code of practice or code of guidance so that the matter may be considered as to what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances <e> <s> i hope the tribunal will be sufficiently interested and have wide enough powers to decide what is fair and reasonable <e> <s> i would not hamper it by having through-out this bill rigid rules laid down for it or for the employer to operate on <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i do not support the amendment <e> <s> when speaking about terms of a contract we in the law know perfectly well that they can be express or implied or they can be oral or in writing and we always manage to deal with them

that there should be a guilty mind of the accused and that the prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is open to any parent to go to the courts of law and ask for a judicial review so as to compel the secretary of state and the local authorities to do their duty <e> <s> would it not be a good thing in a way if legal aid were provided for any parent to take action to enforce the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord foot <e> <s> for the reasons that he gave i was unable to be present in committee <e> <s>

omitted <e> <s> as my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just in time to say how much i support this proposal <e> <s> this is a most important new provision recently introduced which enables an order to be made on auditors to break the confidence which they owe to their client <e> <s> confidence is a matter of the first importance in all professions in governments and with everyone <e> <s> it is a very important principle to maintain confidence and should be broken only in the most exceptional circumstances <e> <s> if one knows that there is a fraud going on one can disclose that even breaking ones confidence <e> <s> otherwise confidence must be retained intact <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept the amendment <e> <s> it is sensible to have the provision <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is quite clear that there will be difficulty in applying these notes as to futures <e> <s> in view of that this amendment would enable people to solve the problem without any difficulty <e> <s> so in order to save all sorts of difficulties and arguments in the future it will be a good thing to have this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the committee will support it <e>", "<cs> i share the amazement at the obscurity of this clause <e> <s> it certainly ought to be made better as the note is part of the legislation <e> <s> let it be made clear at any rate <e>", "<cs> it is quite obvious that paragraph is too wide because it does not protect professional men such as auditors solicitors and the like <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is a good amendment <e> <s> there may be questions on the detail of it and so in a way it would perhaps be a good thing to think again a little about it in order to obtain agreement on all sides <e> <s> however certainly the objective of the amendment seems to be very good and therefore i support it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and to take the same point as has my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> this is a necessary amendment because the present words of paragraph are much too wide but it has to be fitted in with the amendment to which we have just agreed <e> <s> there is a good deal of overlap at the moment so perhaps i may suggest that it would be as well not to press the amendment now but to ask the noble lord lord lucas to bring in at report stage a comprehensive clause dealing with this question of professional mens advice <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the principle that underlies the amendment <e> <s> it has been well settled in law for at least years or more that no person should have an interest conflicting with his duty <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> i sympathise a great deal with that view <e> <s> one does not want to hamper business <e>

is desired <e>", "<cs> that is quite right <e> <s> in view of the good arguments of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls i changed my mind <e>", "<cs> may i say how much this is to be welcomed <e> <s>

put into effect yet <e> <s> if these professional bodies are to come <e>", "<cs> i hope that later on it will not be actionable at all that there will be immunity similar to that for sros for professional bodies that is immunity from civil action <e> <s> in case that is not carried at a later stage i would certainly welcome this amendment <e> <s> it should not be actionable except at the suit of the secretary of state <e> <s> in other words i hope that later on it will not be actionable at all <e> <s> meanwhile let this pass through <e>", "<cs> i think that later on when after amendment no <e> <s> we come to deal with the liabilities of recognised professional bodies the real debate can take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not insist on the original amendment <e> <s> i hope that you will accept the amendment put forward by the commons <e> <s> i have had experience of all these appeals up to the appeal tribunal <e> <s> they have even come as far as my court <e> <s> the machinery is far too elaborate too long too costly with too many insurance commissioners and the like <e> <s> it is all very well to have that elaborate structure in the

initial decision <e> <s> these are not cases of very large amounts <e> <s> they are very important to the individual <e>", "<cs> yes i agree they are very important to the individual <e> <s> from the social fund officer the matter can be referred to an inspector <e> <s> there might have been a query under the original pleas put forward that the inspector might not be sufficiently independent <e>

right or duty is amply provided for in common law <e> <s> my learned friend i call him learned in this respect goes back to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for the way he has met the points we raised during the progress of this bill through the house so much so that in a way we are in agreement <e> <s> however i want to make sure that the amendments we made to clause are properly printed <e> <s> if one refers to the amendment to the bill as originally passed amendment no <e> <s> to subsection on page which is important in many respects i do not see it mentioned in the bill <e> <s> however that is a printing matter <e>", "<cs> my lords they apply to transfers of commercial undertakings from one company to another maybe from the gas company to whatever <e> <s> they do not apply to a mere transfer of shares <e> <s> this is a transfer whereby a man has a new employer <e> <s> in those circumstances the regulations certainly apply to all those affected and

procession how many are going to join it <e> <s> surely the words to hold a public procession are quite good enough <e> <s> those holding a public procession may not know how many or whatever the figure will be taking part <e> <s> i should have thought it was unnecessary to put in the numbers <e>", "<cs> may i add a word from this bench <e> <s> it is most difficult to follow any bill when you have no previous notice of it but here not only was there obscurity in the bill itself as it originally stood but how are we to understand amendments which are only received an hour or two before the committee sits to consider them <e> <s> it is impossible to consider them or to make any constructive suggestion about them <e> <s> but i equally understand that this is a most important bill for the city of london and that it is most important that it should get through without undue delay <e> <s> therefore although i support the bill itself i must make that protest meanwhile in the hope that the bill can be better considered on report <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in favour of the amendment <e> <s> we all remember the trouble in about when takeovers were rampant and when just by changing shareholders you could change the directorate and the running of a company <e> <s> the workers had no say in the matter at all <e> <s> the shareholders controlled the companies and changed the directorate and the like <e> <s> it is very important that there should be a panel to control the operation of takeovers <e>", "<cs> my lords even at this late hour i wish to remind your lordships of the important constitutional questions now under discussion <e> <s> first of all i admired greatly the speech of my noble friend baroness young <e> <s> she explained the mischiefs and difficulties encountered in the running of the common market at the moment as well as the differences of opinion the delays and the obstructions of the machinery <e> <s> it should be got rid of i quite agree <e> <s> i agree with all the measures which she was suggesting and all the procedures and the delegations <e> <s> i fully agree with all of them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may propose that the words remain and that we reject the proposed amendment <e> <s> i can illustrate the point by referring to the sometimes long and tedious processions which obstruct the traffic and life of the community <e> <s> a little while ago i hired a cab to take me from lincolns inn to victoria station and allowed minutes for the <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept the amendment <e> <s> there is a short distinction in point of law <e> <s> if the statute speaks about reasonable belief that decision can be challenged by process of judicial review in the law courts <e> <s> the process of judicial review is well established <e> <s> when it only applies to what appears to the individual that is the state of mind of him and cannot in the ordinary way be challenged by the process of judicial review <e>

judical review as to the conditions to be put <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will give careful consideration to this proposed amendment <e> <s> i think it was in or that the very problem and it is a constitutional problem came before the courts <e> <s> the position is that every british subject owes a duty of allegiance to the queen to the crown <e> <s> but corresponding to the subjects duty of allegiance is the crowns duty to protect the public <e> <s> protect it according to law <e> <s> for that purpose the crown must provide a police force and the expense of it all to protect her majestys subjects here and that is done every day <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the arguments of the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> i agree with them and i do not support the amendment any more <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be desirable at all events to put right what i believe was the summing up of the judge in the cyprus case when he said that the interest of the state meant the interest of the government <e> <s> i venture to think that that was erroneous <e> <s> the interest of the state is the interest of the public at large <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a few words <e> <s> i have in my hand documents which are essential reading for anyone who is to take a constructive part in this discussion <e> <s> the first is the bill a little bill of two or three pages <e> <s> next to it in a way are the amendments <e> <s> if noble lords came into this house in the ordinary way and had a bill with amendments in front of them they could on reading them be able to understand and take a constructive part in the proceedings <e>", "<cs> i wish that i had put down my name to this amendment because it is important <e> <s> as it is so impossible to understand what this is all about i must explain it <e>", "<cs> i fear that i have not made myself clear <e> <s> i cannot have done so because it is a trick of advocacy to put on your opponents lips an argument <e>", "<cs> i meant to speak a moment or two before <e> <s> i do not know whether the committee gives me leave <e>", "<cs> i was going to say that i was grateful to the noble baroness for saying how good it was to group these amendments together <e> <s> my only comment is that she gave explicit assurances as to what is going to happen which are welcome <e> <s> i only say that her interpretation and ours do not matter <e> <s> the interpretation is for those in the european court of justice and i only hope they will abide by the assurances which she has given to us <e> <s> however i feel this is such an important matter that i should like to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i shall not take a moment i want to say only a few words <e> <s> this chamber ought to be grateful to my noble friend lord bruce for tabling this amendment because the two articles nos <e> <s> and are really the crux of the new legislative proposals in the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my tribute to this excellent work done by the chairman and the members of the select committees in <e>", "<cs> my lords page paragraph the summary of conclusions reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me to express the matter sufficiently clearly for a court to apply quite easily and there is no need to complicate it by any other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefer amendment no <e> <s> to no <e> <s> za <e> <s> if you bring in or used you bring in some doubt as to the meaning of the word maintained <e> <s> the word maintained is perfectly good enough <e> <s> the courts can interpret it very well to cover any situation that arises <e>", "<cs> this problem goes back to the crown proceedings act when especially this question of crown immunity was brought in <e> <s> the particular point of interest is our armed forces and whether one soldier can sue another for driving a tractor negligently or the like <e> <s> on the whole as a matter of public policy it was thought best not to let questions as to whether there was negligence or not with all the great amounts of evidence and so on that would be necessary be thrashed out in the civil courts rather should be dealt with by a form of compensation compensation perhaps not as large as would be obtained if there was no such immunity but compensation for instance by way of pensions and so forth such as the armed services have to protect them <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that <e> <s> i think in a way it is almost too difficult to consider at this stage <e> <s> i am not suggesting it should be taken away <e> <s> all i would suggest is leave these important big questions to another bill a comprehensive bill and do not deal with it in this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say one word more <e> <s> having listened to the argument and particularly to the point made by the noble lord lord winstanley i ask whether there is any reason whatever to distinguish between the private hopsitals and national health service hopsitals <e> <s> i was hoping that we might hear something from the government but i have heard no argument on that <e> <s> as i said at the beginning i wondered whether the change could be deferred but now i question whether it can be <e> <s> i feel the same unease as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether or not the minister is aware of the importance of these proceedings because they affect the statutes of this parliament which go back to and are reaffirmed in in the value added tax legislation providing that newly constructed buildings are zero rated and are not liable to value added tax <e> <s> therefore as this parliament has passed those statutes will he not agree that it is vitally concerned in this matter <e> <s> may i ask also whether the law of the community ought not to be made similar to that of this country whereby pleadings and communications are available to all those interested or taking part in the proceedings <e> <s> is not this house more than any other body interested in proceedings which are liable to affirm that our statutes are indeed overruled <e> <s> if the noble lord looks into the law of the european community and the court of justice and i have looked as far back as i can will he not see that there is nothing whatever in those laws to say that they must be secret or should not openly be made available <e> <s> i have found nothing at all events <e> <s> will the minister press upon the european court and indeed the commission the views of this parliament that these documents ought to be made public or made available at least to the house <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word on this amendment because it involves very important constitutional issues <e> <s> i shall first say a little regarding our own constitutional law <e> <s> a treaty is made by the crown or the executive but it is in no way binding upon parliament or the people of england <e> <s> it only becomes binding in england or any part of it in so far as it is made law by our parliament by a statute to that end <e> <s> that being so perhaps i may say that in the treaty of rome that was done and in it in our european communities act of not only was it done explicitly but in section of that act it made it clear that all rights obligations or whatever under the treaty are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the united kingdom and recognised and available in law <e> <s> in other words every right and obligation in that treaty of rome was brought into our statute by parliament by section <e>", "<cs> my view <e>", "<cs> i do not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend has referred to me may i say that i would not support the amendment <e> <s> the law of scotland may be different from the law of england <e> <s> in some ways it is superior in other ways it is not <e> <s> let us consider the position in england to which this will apply <e> <s> this applies when a senior police officer has to inquire into a proposed procession whether it is going to create disorder or whether conditions should be imposed as to the time at which it is to take place or the day and so forth <e> <s> those are matters which he has to decide on the material before him probably just two or three weeks before the procession is to be held <e> <s> his decision on that matter is for his individual judgment on which we should trust that senior police officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words <e> <s> i have not had an opportunity to speak before on these matters which have arisen under both the english acts and the scottish acts but as master of the rolls i was involved in nearly all the cases arising under the housing homeless persons act and i can tell your lordships of the great difficulty of interpretation which has arisen because of the wording of it the ambiguity and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i was not here at the earlier discussions <e> <s> there are occasions when one cannot be here so i am a little late <e> <s> i have said what i have said only because i see difficulties ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords may i welcome in every detail the passing of the bill <e> <s> i should first like to thank the law commission for their excellent report which has restated in statutory form the common law as to riot affray and unlawful assembly <e> <s> previously the position was vague and indeterminent depending entirely on the dicta of judges <e> <s> now these matters have been brought into proper form and are clear and intelligible to everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the discussions on this bill will have shown the people of england and this house what important issues are involved <e> <s> my noble friend lord gladwyn said during the discussions that i was living in the past in the far past of lord palmerston <e> <s> i acknowledge the impeachment <e> <s> he was a victorian i was born in <e> <s> equally i am proud of our country and what we have done in the past to save our country from the domination outside <e> <s>

and many of my generation fought and died in those wars to save our country from domination in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords as a legal point has been raised perhaps i may say that i hope that the amendment suggested by the commons will be agreed to because it really is much more advantageous in an administrative way <e> <s> as the lords amendments left this house it would open the door to controversies in the courts many of them and at great expense perhaps on legal aid <e> <s> as now amended with the decision of the secretary of state being the governing matter i cannot imagine any application successfully for judicial review <e>", "<cs> my lords as this question concerns a decision of the european court of human rights i have taken the opportunity of reading the whole pages of the decision <e> <s> it is most instructive and having read the judgment of the judges and the dissenting judgment of the five judges my view and i think i will be supported by many is that the five dissentients were right <e> <s> i ask her majestys government to implement the views expressed by those five dissentients <e>", "<cs> my lords the law has often had to consider the confidentiality of reports <e> <s> it is important in nearly all cases that the person who makes the report should be able to do it fully and frankly without fear of a libel action being brought against him <e> <s> therefore in many cases the public interest requires the report to be kept confidential <e> <s> but there are cases when it should be made open <e> <s> it depends so much on the individual cases <e>",

bishop of birmingham and i oppose this motion <e> <s> i have given the reasons already <e> <s> it is premature to have clause in at this stage <e> <s> it should all be left as the law commission recommended to a further consideration by all concerned of the important points whether or no the child should have a right when it is to have all the particulars and whether or no the register should

warmly to support this amendment <e> <s> it is time that we all understood what these directives are <e> <s> when they are issued by the council of ministers in brussels they become part of our law

<s> like the noble lord lord morton i had to ask for it in the library they had to send down to the basement they had to get it copied <e>", "<cs> i should not have thought that that was necessary <e> <s> in the european court of justice we interpret these directives quite liberally and generally we are not defeated by technicalities <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one question <e> <s> if the english court is faced with a difficulty in the interpretation of this bill when it becomes an act is it permissible for the judges of england to refer to that council directive for elucidation of any difficult points <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e> <s> it means that they will have to get copies from somewhere in order to do so <e>", "<cs> this is not a point only concerned with product liability <e> <s> it is concerned with all the liabilities of companies throughout our field of tort <e> <s> it involves general company law and so many things outside the bill <e> <s> i believe it is better not to pursue it at this stage <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to the committee that the directive itself is of the first importance <e> <s> further-more i suggest that the english translation as given to us should be what we go by <e> <s> we do not know enough about the other languages and we ought to go by the meaning of the directive in its english sense <e> <s> it is plain to me that initial processing is very different from industrial processing <e> <s> the initial process is the beginning process the words industrial process mean all sorts of industrial operations <e> <s> that may be a very important provision in the directive in that people will be exempted from strict liability for agricultural products and the like <e> <s> in other words this word initial in the directive may be of the first importance and i very much doubt whether it is open even to this government to alter the directive in this way <e> <s> i myself feel that there is a strong case for saying that the government have to implement the directive <e> <s> it can be expanded and explained if you like but not altered and that may save a lot of trouble hereafter because the word initial can go before the european court of justice for interpretation <e> <s> it would be very unfortunate if our courts in interpreting the word industrial came to a different conclusion <e> <s> i should have thought it was much the safer course to follow the directive and to keep the word initial <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this amendment goes against the whole trend of our law <e> <s> in recent years we have extended beyond question the liability for negligence <e>", "<cs> i suggest that each of them has the same meaning but it is clearer and better to have the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to confirm that remark <e> <s> in cases which concern patents copyright trade marks and so forth it is everyday practice to use the word get-up <e> <s> the word is well known among lawyers anyway <e>", "<cs> i object to the amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first there is no difference in the meaning <e> <s> secondly the words of the directive about which we have been talking so much speak about <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment <e> <s> first there is nothing in the directive about it at all <e> <s> it is introduced entirely afresh <e> <s> next it is entirely unintelligible <e> <s> it is contradictory in itself <e> <s> i tried the clause on with two or three law lords today <e> <s> they expressed the view if i may say so as hearsay that it is quite incomprehensible and not only that but completely contradictory between the first part of subsection and the last part of subsection to which my noble friend lord allen drew attention <e> <s> if this clause means anything if it has anything to do with a defective product please let it be made clear <e> <s> at present it is hopeless and ought to be taken back and something fresh put in <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that the explanation was excellent <e> <s> i now understand what the noble lord was driving at and it is all very desirable <e> <s> but surely we ought to make this clear <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that there could be a note or an illustration as is sometimes done <e> <s> if an illustration were given of what we are driving at that might be better <e> <s> we must make things clearer than they are at

decision and that before a final decision is made there will have to be further consultation on the legal economic and social matters concerned in accordance with the statute <e> <s> have steps been considered by which the retraining of the workforce and the replacement of the men in regard to the city of plymouth can be safeguarded as far as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer and i hope all will go well <e>", "<cs> at second reading i was in favour of strict liability even for these exceptional products <e> <s> after further thought i have come round to the other view and would not accept this amendment <e> <s> the first reason is that it is most important that the law of every country in europe should be the same upon this matter because these companies which research into drugs and the like operate in germany england and italy and therefore the law and the liability ought to be the same for every country in the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord paget mentioned me and read a judgment of mine i should like to say that that judgment was given upon the evidence before the court and on what i knew then <e>", "<cs> i would just add that before creating any criminal offence it ought to be clear and distinct so that you know exactly whether you are committing a criminal offence <e> <s> these words whenever practicable have to be put in in case of argument but the position is so uncertain that i am afraid it ought not to be made a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> may i add that if this insurance is compulsory it would be only in regard to the strict liability <e> <s> if you are to have insurance it must cover negligence breach of contract and goodness knows what <e> <s> i am afraid the amendment will not work <e>", "<cs> this is an important point to decide and it is not clear in the bill as it stands <e> <s> i do not like the phrase non-corporeal losses <e> <s> that sort of phrase is used in scotland but i have never heard it in english law <e> <s> we usually refer to it as economic loss <e> <s> there are many cases about economic loss or damage and it has been the subject of much discussion in the courts and in the textbooks <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one word <e> <s> there have been many cases in the courts in which damage to property has led to loss of profits or benefits of other kinds <e> <s> so in a way it is necessary for all these aspects to be considered <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand the two or three lines at the beginning <e> <s> i should like to compare it to where an action in negligence or breach of contract still lies <e> <s> i should have thought that one would be liable under that for the loss or damage to the component itself and to the other materials in other words i think the provision unduly restricts liability in damage <e> <s> it is much better to keep it to those first two lines which

statute of and require the goods and services which i have mentioned and which are presently zero-rated to be liable to vat <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the civil justice review will have nothing to do with the substantive law on these matters namely the enormous sums of damages in medical action <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case the report of the select committee is much to be welcomed <e> <s> i express the gratitude of the house to the members of the committee who have heard arguments presented sincerely and clearly by counsel on either side <e> <s> as a result the

committees report states the action that the community should take on the environment <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords when the bill came before your lordships house on a previous occasion we all welcomed it <e> <s> indeed there were only a few outstanding points of difference to be discussed <e> <s> perhaps this evening i may mention two or three important points that have been raised so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in congratulating my noble friend lord blyth on his modest and unassuming speech <e> <s> although he is the first of his line to speak in this house for years i hope we may often hear him again <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not on the list of speakers <e> <s> however during the course of the discussion a matter of profound importance has arisen <e> <s> i refer to the imposition of value added tax on so many goods and supplies which are made on our people and of which a goodly slice is payable to the european commission <e>", "<cs> i do not mind <e> <s> i shall let you steal a minute <e> <s> i should like to say that as a fundamental principle <e>", "<cs> that is the very point <e> <s> i can understand the argument of the european commission and i can understand what the views of the european court of justice may be <e> <s> i can understand that it may make it difficult for them to enforce <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that we have a definition clause to tell us what video link really means <e> <s> we may know what closed circuit television is but let us have a definition clause and let us have clearly defined what a video link is <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will think a little more about this amendment by trying to envisage what is going to happen with the closed circuit television <e> <s> who is to be present in the other next-door room besides the child <e> <s> is the judge to be there <e> <s> are the two counsel to be there in that other room or are they not <e> <s> are the judge and the counsel to remain in the room where the jury are <e> <s> it is very important to decide what the practical position should be when a child is in the next-door room being questioned or cross-examined <e> <s> i should like to ask what is the function of the judge <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment in the strongest possible terms because it ties up with what i have recently said about closed-circuit television <e> <s> as we have heard today this will mean equipping a room next to the court where the judge and jury are <e> <s> who will go into this next door room <e> <s> as we heard in answer to my last question it will be specially equipped <e> <s> but who will be there to examine the child <e> <s> we have heard that counsel will be there presumably counsel for the prosecution and for the accused <e> <s> who else will be there <e> <s> i should have thought that the judge ought to be there so that he can ask questions of the witness or the child <e>", "<cs> i have taken part in most of the debates on this subject in the past <e> <s> may i say today that i have been much inflenced by the arguments put forward by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and indeed by the noble lords lord hutchinson of lullington and lord wigoder <e> <s> they were the sentiments which i expressed before <e> <s> i dislike the idea of the crown prosecution service <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the clauses as they stand <e> <s> i think the jurisdiction of the magistrates is a first-rate jurisdiction and should not be held up by requests from the accused for trial by jury or the like <e> <s> in other words i should like to see this comes under a subsequent clause to be dealt with by my noble friend lord elton the magistrates given the best jurisdiction that is possible and i would support the clauses entirely <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a word in favour of the amendment not only on the grounds that my noble friend lord elton has put namely that the crown court is overloaded with trivial cases and there is a long waiting list for trial with the many remands involved but because in many cases the right to trial by jury is being abused whether the offence alleged is shoplifting petty theft of or or whatever it may be <e> <s> the evidence may be reasonably clear against the accused and in practice he ought to plead guilty and be dealt with by the magistrates on that footing <e> <s> as a matter of tactics however he says through his defence lawyer i want to go for trial by jury <e> <s> that will stave it off maybe for months before it can get to the crown court <e> <s> whats more i can get legal aid and my lawyers will defend me then <e> <s> it may take a day or two i know i shall be convicted at the end but i have a chance of getting off <e> <s> therefore it is often a matter of legal tactics by defence lawyers in trivial cases to go to trial by jury <e>", "<cs> i suggest that this is not the occasion on which we should amend the law <e> <s> the case has been most persuasively submitted by the noble lords lord hutchinson of lullington lord morton of shuna and lord windlesham <e> <s> throughout the centuries murder and manslaughter have been distinguished in our common law and this is not the occasion on which to merge them together <e> <s> all through the centuries murder and manslaughter have been defined and they must remain in our common law <e>", "<cs> let me say a word in favour of this amendment <e> <s> i remember well the controversy about the national health service <e> <s> at one time it was exempt from the ordinary provisions of the law by section of the crown proceedings act <e> <s> similar principles apply entirely to our penal establishments <e> <s> large numbers of people are living in them against their will accommodated by the crown and its servants and the obligation to have proper regard to the legislation regarding health and safety should apply to prisons just as to hospitals and any other bodies <e> <s> therefore i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have never sat on a board of visitors but on the other hand the courts have had to consider the position of boards of visitors at prisons especially after the riots that took place at hull prison in <e> <s> it is important to remember that boards of visitors are not merely judicial but administrative <e> <s> they look into the management and affairs of the prison to ensure that everything is going well <e> <s> however in addition they have a disciplinary function <e> <s> i stress the word disciplinary because in such cases the court of appeal emphasised that when boards were exercising disciplinary functions they did not constitute a criminal court and were not exercising a criminal cause or matter <e> <s> the boards were exercising disciplinary powers just as do professional bodies over their members and courts martial over members of the armed services <e> <s> they are <e>", "<cs> while we should all welcome clause in regard to young offenders for myself i think that the committee would be going far beyond its functions with the amendment <e> <s> it amounts to giving directions to high court judges as well as to magistrates as to the guidelines on which they can consider sentences <e> <s> they probably consider all those guidelines at the moment <e> <s> however it is not the function of parliament to tell judges how they are to decide when sentencing <e> <s> they may do that with regard to young offenders <e> <s> but this amendment applies to everyone from high court judges to magistrates <e>", "<cs> when i read the amendment so well put by my noble and learned friend i wondered why on earth it was necessary <e> <s> the words of the section as they stand are perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> this amendment deals only with the seizing of the dog or the vehicles <e> <s> the next clause deals with the forfeiture <e> <s> if it is to be carried its whole length it should go into the following clause requiring forfeiture of the dog or the vehicle <e>", "<cs> this is a most interesting point <e> <s> for years magistrates have not always given reasons and it has often been a question of whether they should give reasons <e> <s> in that regard i often tell them the advice which lord mansfield once gave <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> it is important that such cases should be covered <e> <s> at the moment it is an offence unlawfully and maliciously to intend to endanger life on the railway <e> <s> that does not cover the case of suicide <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the committee that in the old days the offence of suicide was the most heinous crime known to our english law <e> <s> it was a felony for a man to rush unasked into the presence of his maker <e> <s> he had no christian burial his body was staked to the crossroads <e>", "<cs> may i say a word in favour of this amendment <e> <s> one of the biggest difficulties in our civil law over the past years has been whether damages are available and are given for nervous shock caused by negligence <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the house of lords has explained it as being quite worrying and damages can be given in respect of nervous shock even though the person was not present at the time and even though the negligence did not cause a psychiatric illness <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be much better to get our ordinary civil law about shock in cases of negligence into line in the same way as in the cases of criminal injuries caused by shock <e> <s> it can be done quite well by omitting these two sub-paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will not accept this amendment <e> <s> it is quite plain that the people who give evidence or make statements before a board may be liable in defamation unless they are protected by privilege <e> <s> they may also be liable for injurious falsehood if they make a malicious <e>", "<cs> as we are all expressing our views in advance of the minister i should like to say that i strongly support the right of the crown to ask a juror to stand by because the prosecution may know but they cannot disclose it openly that some of the jurors are associated with the defendants in the dock or that they have criminal records or that they may be seditious or terrorist people <e> <s> the prosecution alone knows that and it seems to me that it is quite entitled and it is its duty to ask a juror to stand by in circumstances where it cannot disclose the real reasons why the juror should not be there <e>", "<cs> may i say a word about the history <e> <s> my noble friend lord hooson referred to <e>", "<cs> let me take up a point about the drafting of this clause <e> <s> while i entirely go along with the objective to stop these youngsters from carrying knives about i am troubled about the wording of this clause <e> <s> it covers carving knives table knives in the house choppers and axes in the garden <e> <s> it covers all those most innocent articles which may be carried about anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of us all i should like to thank the noble lord lord borthwick for the enlightening speech he has given us from his great experience <e> <s> he has a family title which goes back to and he is the rd lord <e> <s> i read that the lordship was dormant from to <e> <s> how good it is that it has now become active with such a splendid speech by my noble friend <e> <s> one of the most attractive qualities of the title is that the holder is the hereditary royal falconer for scotland <e> <s> long may he continue with his falcons <e>", "<cs> when we had the sunday trading bill i was in favour of local options of the local community granting permission or not with regard to do-it-yourself centres or garden centres and so on because this is a matter which concerns a community and the attitudes in one district or county of england are different from those of another <e> <s> i do not live so very far away from a big racecourse <e> <s> it is the nuisance the congestion on the roads and matters of that kind which affect the local people <e> <s> let it be a local option <e> <s> let it be dealt with by the local authority which knows the feelings of the place <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his clear and convincing statement of the need for more judges both in the court of appeal and at first instance <e> <s> however i hope that in the course of what we are doing we will not debase the currency <e> <s> our judges are and have been the best in any country in the world and if we increase the numbers as we do unless they are also supplied by efficient members of the bar or i may add of the solicitors profession and are men of the best quality we shall not retain that high standard <e> <s> that is just a question of numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asks what action the government propose to take <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will reply positively by saying some action <e> <s> it would be intolerable if they were to say that they are content with the position as it is and are going to do nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give the bill the most enthusiastic welcome and my unqualified support <e> <s> during my life in the law i have been much concerned with copyright <e> <s> in my chambers when i was a junior at the bar i had as a pupil one john whitford <e> <s> that was years ago <e> <s> i am glad to say that years afterwards he presided over this important committee which dealt with all the problems of today in an exemplary manner its recommendations forming the basis of the white paper which in turn formed the basis of the bill before your lordships <e> <s> indirectly through my pupil i have had some connection all the time with the present bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say one word <e> <s> up to now in order to extradite a person there has had to be <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this matter in committee <e> <s> let me say that in all criminal cases and in other cases the search is for truth and justice <e> <s> we have in justice to the children brought into the bill the video link <e> <s> in the next door room at the trial there will be the child the judge the counsel and probably the solicitors questioning the child <e> <s> through the video the jury in the trial room will see what is happening <e> <s> that will probably take place six or months after the incident complained of <e> <s> the child will probably have either forgotten the incident or will have been told by those about her what she is to say in order to prepare her <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious about both these amendments <e> <s> i have tried many cases in which young children were concerned and my experience is similar to that of many judges over the centuries namely that a childs evidence is most unreliable unless it is corroborated or supported in some way <e> <s> a child may imagine things and invent situations <e> <s> parents and other adults may make suggestions to the child and when it comes to the trial six or months later the truth may sound very different <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord elton most warmly <e> <s> i am also pleased to hear that the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice and the noble and learned lord lord roskill also support the proposal although they are unable to be present <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment <e> <s> murder is still murder and the judge who has to decide the sentence for it has a most difficult task <e> <s> is it not right as when it was a capital offence <e> <s> so now that the sentence should be declared by the law <e> <s> the present word is sentenced and it should remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i just wish to repeat the arguments that i have made previously on this point <e> <s> the judge in sentencing a man who has been convicted of murder is expressing public opinion on the matter <e> <s> the judges should carry public opinion with them <e> <s> when it is a particularly horrendous murder the judge should express that opinion by saying and recommending that the man should not be let out of prison until after or years whichever it may be <e> <s> it is in answer to public opinion that the death penalty has now gone <e> <s> on the other hand of course it can be reviewed and i would deplore any private communications by the judge to the home secretary or anyone else as to what the length of time should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am nervous about this amendment <e> <s> in a way the recommendation is not a sentence by the judge it is a recommendation which is not in law enforceable and the secretary of state is not bound by it <e> <s> i think that that is expressly set out in the act <e> <s> i know that in practice the recommendation has been treated as fairly binding on the parole board but on the other hand in point of law it is only a recommendation <e> <s> therefore it is not a proper case for appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word against this amendment <e> <s> the words crime of violence are very vague and difficult for a court define <e> <s> the definition given in the bill seems to be good enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not omit subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords as the debate goes to and fro i should like to say that i strongly agree with my noble and learned friend lord havers <e> <s> i can put the matter in two sentences <e> <s> the right of peremptory challenge was abused by counsel for the defence doing what he thought to be in the best interest of his client in order to obtain a jury as favourable to his client as possible <e> <s> there was clear evidence of abuse on which this peremptory challenge has been abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i raised the question of burden of proof <e> <s> it was not dealt with and for that reason i put down amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i am quite content with the amendment now moved by the noble earl which puts the burden of proof quite clearly on the defence <e> <s> i accept the amendment and will not move my own <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e> <s> i am quite satisfied with the burden of proof as it is <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lord molloy that he is quite right <e> <s> one comes across a man in a public place who has a knife with a blade or one of these flick-knives <e> <s> what are you doing <e> <s> the policeman asks <e> <s> unless he can show he has a lawful excuse he is guilty of an offence <e> <s> that is the ordinary english language <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word on this <e> <s> i can well understand the anxiety of my noble friend lord paget to say that if a man has a knife with him for self-defence then he is not guilty of any offence <e> <s> i quite agree with that <e> <s> he wants to put it in express terms but it is really covered by the existing terms <e> <s> the man has to prove that he had good reason or lawful authority <e> <s> surely the best of reasons the good reason is that he had it with him for the purpose of self-defence or with lawful authority as the case may be <e> <s> therefore the case of self-defence is already provided for by the section that if he has it for self-defence or with any lawful authority it comes within good reason <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> the word original was in the act and also the act and it is fairly simple to understand <e> <s> original means that the author has written it himself and not copied it from someone else <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with this proposed amendment <e> <s> if one looks back to the act section included the words authorise to do <e> <s> if they are omitted in this bill we should have the lawyers saying at once that it was a deliberate omission and therefore there is a variation from the whole <e> <s> that view is supported by section which says that in the ordinary way one follows the previous wording as interpreted by the courts and one does not alter it because if there is an alteration one may suspect some alteration of meaning <e> <s> therefore in order to make it conform with the act i support this amendment in order to make the position clear <e>", "<cs> i had not examined clause before and i am brought round to the ministers point of view <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment as a matter of literary style <e> <s> instead of having which twice let us have but in the second place <e>", "<cs> when i gave judgments in the courts i gave them orally in open court <e> <s> the reporter took them down in court and transcribed them <e> <s> i always understood that the copyright was in the reporter and not in me because he was the person who had recorded the judgment permanently in writing <e> <s> i hope that at some point in the bill and perhaps this does it the copyright exists in me the person who composed the words and wrote the speech and not only in the reporter who took it down <e>", "<cs> i think that this matter requires to be looked into again <e> <s> i always understood that the shorthand writer who took down a speech held the copyright <e> <s> i think that that position ought to be <e>", "<cs> i agree that those words are there to make sure that the court does not have to inquire through experts or otherwise about artistic quality <e> <s> if the work is graphic or whatever let it be taken as such irrespective of its quality <e> <s> i am against the amendment <e>", "<cs> we all know what a moving picture is and that is good enough <e> <s> we do not want these other phrases <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any need for the word lawfully to be left out <e>", "<cs> the words published edition refer back to clause which says that copyright subsists in <e>", "<cs> let me say just a word or two about compilation and arrangement <e> <s> the law is and always has been quite clear that there is a separate copyright in regard to compilation and arrangement simply because some of the pieces that one is compiling may not be the subject of copyright <e> <s> some may be out of copyright and some may be in it <e> <s> it needs a great deal of skill to make an anthology compilation or arrangement and there is copyright in the compilation as well as copyright in the original author of the pieces <e> <s> however that is merely a sidelight on the law <e> <s> as i said before it seems to me that the government have the right approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that most disappointing answer <e> <s> but is he aware that in awarding a sum of over million in damages mr justice hirst stressed the crying need for a review of that branch of the law which judges frequently urge but which only <e>", "<cs> one question <e> <s> i shall get it right in the end <e> <s> will my noble and learned friend consider implementing the report of the pearson royal commission in favour of periodic payments in place of a large lump sum or at least refer the matter to the civil service review <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will leave the bill as it is because in a way the words are quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i remember that some years ago on the appointment of a new colonial judge lord mansfield said give your decision but

lords without a word of welcome and gladness it would be very wrong for parliament or anyone to dictate to the judges how they should exercise judicial review <e> <s> therefore i am very glad to see this subsection removed <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept this amendment <e> <s> fifty years has been the period ever since in the copyright act and there is no sufficient case for altering it <e> <s> it is quite long enough for most copyrights and i hope that the committee will not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is a much simpler way of saying that when the author is unknown copyright is protected for years from the date of the publication of the work <e>", "<cs> i hope noble lords do not accept this amendment <e> <s> it is contrary to every principle of copyright <e> <s> in any copyright case in which i have taken part you look to see whether the part which has been reproduced has been reproduced by the defendant

i agree that it does not make sense and is not correct grammar <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> there are many similar provisions as to time in regard to tribunals and the like <e> <s> it seems to me that it helps the tribunal itself if it realises that the applicant must satisfy it that there has been a material change of circumstance <e> <s> it is more definite for the tribunal to act upon <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> under the treaty of rome and in europe now we know that any abuse of a dominant position can be struck down and people made liable in regard to it <e> <s> the licensing body should surely not have a monopoly position to such an extent that if it abuses the position it can get away with it <e> <s> i support the power of the tribunal to look into it as the amendment proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords for myself i welcome this bill <e> <s> the present structure of legal aid has become rickety <e> <s> it lets in the wind and the water <e> <s> it needs restructuring in order to make the system waterproof <e> <s> this bill provides the builder to do so a new legal aid board under a new lord chancellor <e> <s> this restructuring is essential <e> <s> however my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has referred back to henry viii <e>", "<cs> i go back to the first years when i was at the bar <e> <s> i know the old system when there was no legal aid for anybody in criminal or civil cases <e> <s> in my first case before the high court a lady had gone to a dentist and while she was having treatment under gas a tooth had broken and gone down into her windpipe <e> <s> the solicitor and i did the case for nothing and we won <e> <s> it helped the young man and the young lawyer on his way <e> <s> that was civil legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my words of appreciation for the eloquent and entertaining speech of my noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> of course i am used to all this advocacy in the courts of law <e> <s> it was eloquent and entertaining then and i hope we shall have his assistance many times in the future <e>", "<cs> may i say a word on this amendment to this special part of the bill <e> <s> it gives performers rights for the first time in our law <e> <s> i happen to have been very concerned with it in the first case upon the matter <e>", "<cs> i can well see the objections to the amendment but there is a great deal to be said for its merits <e> <s> let us take a pop group <e> <s> three of its members consent and one stands out and will not consent <e> <s> is that to bar any dealings in the matter <e> <s> surely the consent should not be unreasonably withheld whatever the berne convention may say <e> <s> i do not see why we should not have a provision in english law that consent should not be unreasonably withheld <e>", "<cs> i am against this amendment <e> <s> we have had all the discussions about home taping <e> <s> although i suggested it was lawful and not an infringement nevertheless it can be done and there is no remedy and no blanket licence in respect of home <e>", "<cs> while i do not support the amendment to its fullest state it gives an opportunity for the committee to look at the objectives of this part of the bill <e> <s> it introduces into our law for the first time a design right similar to a copyright <e> <s> the matter arises from the important british leyland case which was heard in the house of lords sitting judicially <e> <s> all the law lords appealed to parliament to intervene to correct what was already shown to he wrong in our law <e>", "<cs> this amendment is far too wide in going merely on the description <e> <s> i much prefer the original definition with this qualification <e> <s> we do not have the definition of an article <e> <s> it does not include a bridge and does not include a house <e> <s> i would look upon article as chattels at the moment not real property such as bridges and houses <e> <s> if you get to chattels it does not include a chair and does not include a clock a watch or whatever it may be <e> <s> the word article is not defined <e> <s> that is another reason for rejecting the amendment but also a reason for saying that we must look carefully at each part of the bill as it goes through <e>", "<cs> i hope that noble lords will not accept these amendments <e> <s> it seems to me that the word design must be elucidated and not carried too far <e> <s> that is done by subsection excluding all those matters from design right <e> <s> as my noble friend lord howie has said it is a great help to show the extent of design right and it is helpful to the courts in that way <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept the amendment <e> <s> design right is a very special right <e> <s> we do not want it to be too long <e> <s> it should be nothing like years as in the copyright act <e> <s> let it be a short time <e> <s> any person who designs can make much of his profit within that time which may be five or years as the case may be <e> <s> do not let him have a monopoly in it for years <e> <s> in other words for the sake of competition reduce it to the time already in the bill <e>", "<cs> while i sympathise with the sponsors of the amendment i suggest that the way in which it is now stated is not a proper form <e> <s> i should first like to deal with the double negative <e>", "<cs> i do not like amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that the matter should be left to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in accordance with the general provision <e>

will he be paid or will he do it free <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i know of the work because i happen to be president of the citizens advice bureau of andover <e> <s> i know what they do i know how volunteers come and give a great deal of their time during the day for nothing <e> <s> i know that they also get in touch with solicitors if need be and those solicitors also give advice in the evening <e> <s> they do excellent work and i would support it being carried out accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken part in all discussions until now and have read the governments white paper with care <e> <s> i should like to say first and so put it on one side that i am entirely in favour of all possible research producing these new techniques such as <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i should be quite prepared to leave it to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to produce the regulations and for the committee to decide what they come to when it sees them <e>", "<cs> having heard the arguments on both sides i would support the amendment <e>", "<cs> this raises one of the most controversial matters that the courts have had <e> <s> in this simple case when a man suffers a personal injury has legal aid and gets in damages in the ordinary way the costs which the solicitor has incurred have to be recovered out of that just as if he is an ordinary litigant <e> <s> when he recovers damages the solicitor has a charge on the property recovered or preserved for his costs that is sensible enough just like any ordinary litigant <e>", "<cs> the provision relating to advice and assistance is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and which relate to the civil procedure part of the bill <e> <s> the amendments raise a matter which has been much debated in the courts and upon which the courts have prayed and hoped that parliament would intervene to cure an injustice <e> <s> we put forward that intervention in the amendments <e>", "<cs> would not this simple amendment mean that a court could do what was just and equitable at first instance <e> <s> that would remedy all the injustices <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that in our civil law at the moment the interests of the child are well protected <e> <s> we have the procedure by a next friend for the plaintiff and a guardian <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall not have anything like the class action in this country <e> <s> in the opren case the award of damages ran into millions of pounds in favour of the class <e> <s> after everyone had put in a claim each claimant had a share out of those millions of pounds <e> <s> the difference between the united states and ourselves is this <e> <s> the lawyers for the claimants there would take for themselves per cent <e> <s> of the damages <e> <s> they are the people who would gain out of these huge sums <e> <s> let us not get into that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i did not say that it operated in england and wales and i do not want it to operate here <e> <s> that was simply my comment on the opren case in america <e>", "<cs> let me say that in a way i think this amendment goes much too far in favour of the legal profession <e> <s> i am sorry to have to say it but i have to tell the committee of a matter of taxation of costs that we had to deal with in the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> i wish only to add a footnote to what my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone has said <e> <s> i did not practise at the bar in the days of legal aid <e> <s> before the advent of legal <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a word on this <e> <s> as a result of the withdrawal of the earlier amendments we have in the bill the words <e>", "<cs> it is many years since i appeared in a coroners court <e> <s> it was a case involving a man who had been killed on a railway line and i was instructed by the railway company <e> <s> the relatives of the man appeared in person and they succeeded in obtaining a verdict in their favour against me as a lawyer <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the committee should not accept this amendment <e> <s> i have not appeared before those bodies individually but in the court of appeal we heard many cases which had been before the social security commissioners and before the immigration appeal tribunal <e>", "<cs> i seem to be against all these amendments <e> <s> arbitration is a consensual matter between the two parties to the contract or whatever it may be <e> <s> the contract provides for what is to happen whether the architects certificate is to be final what will happen if there is an arbitration who will hold it and so forth <e> <s> it is a consensual process in which the state is not involved <e>", "<cs> this matter has been discussed on many occasions in this place <e> <s> it has been before the law commission mr justice hirsts committee and the like <e> <s> the argument put forward is that a poor person should be able to bring an action for defamation on legal aid <e> <s> the answer is that if it were allowed no end of people who had been perhaps defamed rightly or wrongly would put the newspapers to great expense <e> <s> many cases would take up the time of the courts indefinitely and at great expense <e> <s> it is much better to leave out defamation from the legal aid system <e>",
