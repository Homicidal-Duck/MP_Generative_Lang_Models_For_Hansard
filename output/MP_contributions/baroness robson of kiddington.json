["<cs> my lords i rise with great trepidation to follow that speech by the noble lord lord annan on medical education i am not a medical educationalist <e> <s> i have to admit my interest in this debate as the regional chairman of the only london region that has only one teaching hospital in it and therefore no doubt has less problems than some of the others <e> <s> i could have wished that lord annan had phrased his question slightly differently <e> <s> i agree with him per cent <e> <s> that co-operation between the dhss and the university grants committee on medical education is tremendously important but he left out what it is all about and that is the service we jointly give to the patient <e> <s> i wish that would have been in the question though i know it was in the back of his mind <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords therefore let us ask the department of education and science to produce the funds for that particular kind of education <e> <s> but on the whole the balance is in favour of surgery and medicine and i believe that in medical education we must look towards the future where the needs in these unpopular specialties are enormous <e> <s> for instance when i talk to consultants in mental handicap they admit that it is because there is a resistance to accepting them on the same level as consultants in other specialties and i believe that we might need to use financial encouragement <e> <s> i should think that that was the tragedy <e> <s> i believe that a change of attitude in the whole of undergraduate and postgraduate medical training could create the right possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted when i was invited by the noble lord lord greenwood to join this committee to examine the possibilities of introducing a european passport <e> <s> i must say at once that unfortunately because of many other commitments i had i was not able to be present at all the committee meetings for which i am deeply sorry but i attended some of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in congratulating the noble earl lord yar-borough on his maiden speech <e> <s> i am afraid i must admit that i shall also disagree with him but that after all is the essence of the debate and i shall welcome exchanging views with him many times in the future <e> <s> i am sure that there are many subjects on which we could agree but on this one i must take the opposite view <e> <s> i was going to finish my remarks with a certain statement but i think i shall start them with it <e> <s> it seems tragic that on a question as im <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> may i first apologise most deeply to the noble lord lord hunt of fawley for not being present when he began to address the house <e> <s> unfortunately i was engaged in an appointments committee to appoint a senior member of my region and inevitably i got stuck in the traffic and was therefore a few minutes late <e> <s> i very much regret having been late but i did arrive in time to hear at least half of his speech <e> <s> from these benches we should like to join in the feeling of regret at the announcement that the noble baroness lady masham of ilton has just made and to say how much we appreciated the work that was done by this great man and how much as a nation we owe to him and his memory <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches look forward with great pleasure to hearing the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff make her maiden speech because few people in this house are more knowledgeable about the health service than she is <e> <s> i shall deal briefly with the second reading <e> <s> first as one who is involved and i think that everyone knows that i am chairman of a regional health authority so that i need not announce my special interest i realise that the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may too repeat a question i asked <e> <s> i am not asking the noble lord for a reply now but perhaps he will be kind enough to write to me <e> <s> it relates to part i clause subsection <e>", "<cs> obviously i was very interested because of my interest in a regional health authority to hear the noble baroness express a desire that the change that is coming should be as evolutionary as possible <e> <s> i believe in that myself but only to a certain extent because i think we have got to balance very carefully the feeling of uncertainty that will hang over a large number of national health service staff if the change is too evolutionary <e> <s> i think it is essential that we set a deadline for instance for the appointment of chief officers to the new districts and that we should try in all regions to stick to that deadline as far as humanly possible <e>", "<cs> may i come in at the end of this debate <e> <s> i probably should have spoken a little earlier <e> <s> may i say that personally i have great reservatons about a national staff commission <e> <s> i have reservations because i lived through the last re-organisation of this service when the national staff commission the shortlisting and the national advertising of the jobs of all the top officers created really enormous problems and i believe great hardships for the staff involved in the national health service <e> <s> so i would hope that we would not have a staff commission which undertook duties of that kind <e> <s> i should have thought that it might be necessary for each regional health authority to have an appropriate organisation within each region to look after the interests of staff and to deal with appeals machinery within the region <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> when i suggested that the use of joint financing should be extended i apologise if i gave the impression that i thought it should be extended to all the fields which the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> i thought that freedom to use joint financing should be extended so long as there was agreement by the jcc <e> <s> the jcc consists of representatives members and officers of the health authorities and representatives members and officers of the local authority <e> <s> i should have thought that the knowledge that members of a health authority have of the limited funds available would mean that the way in which they would agree to money being used for the improvement of health education and welfare i agree that welfare is a difficult word to define within their local community was in safe hands <e>", "<cs> no am not <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether it would not be worse if the consultant was functioning in a private hospital miles away from the national health service <e> <s> in that case he would not even be on national health service premises while looking after his private patients whereas otherwise if there is an emergency in the national health service section while he is attending his private patients then at least he is on the same premises and is therefore more easily available <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness very much for her reply and for her open-mindedness on this question <e> <s> i have some reservations <e> <s> the noble baroness said it would be very expensive for the private sector to set up a training programme of their own <e> <s> i realise that and that is why there is no hope that this will happen <e> <s> that is why i have introduced an amendment for some levy to be paid by the private sector <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the reply that has been given but i am not happy about the answers because i feel that there are such grave doubts about what the government are trying to save by not allowing this amendment <e> <s> what worries me is that the noble lord who replied cannot tell me the number who are already exempt <e> <s> however despite that we have a statement saying that if we exempt everybody it will cost million or maybe million <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very vague statement and that we need more concrete facts <e>", "<cs> that was a very searching question considering that i have not lived in that country for some time now and am not per cent <e> <s> up to date on the legislation in that country but in the days when i was a young person we did get free dental treatment up to the age of <e> <s> but i am not certain and i should not like to say that this is so at this moment <e> <s> i shall have to check up and i will let the noble baroness know when i have checked with the swedish embassy <e> <s> what worries me in particular about the noble lords reply is that he implied that by levying charges we should receive an income of milliondid i understand that correctly <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e> <s> i presume this is on the assumption and this is what worries me about the schedule that all these young people went on and had their six-monthly check and looked after their teeth <e> <s> what concerns me about it is that i do not believe they will <e> <s> these are young people who are let out of their family surround <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble earl lord cranbrook and his committee on the report which they have presented to us for debate <e> <s> the moment one gets involved in environmental questions and becomes absorbed in them one realises that almost everything we do and everything that happens around us has to do with the environment in which we live <e> <s> although we have to start somewhere the environment is not only a question of pollution and noise and the ecological balance of nature but it is to do with the whole habitat of the human race and our relationships to the community in which we live <e>", "<cs> so long as we have an imbalance in the way we use the community budget we shall never be able to get enough money into an environmental fund in order to deal effectively with many of the problems that we want to tackle <e> <s> so long as the cap takes such a large proportion of the communitys funds we shall not be able to achieve it <e> <s> i know suggestions are being made that we should increase the percentage of vat that goes into the community fund but i believe that it will not happen that way so we must look at how we can change the balance of support for agriculture towards environmental policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure all members of your lordships house are extremely grateful to the noble lord lord gregson and his committee for bringing this report to the attention of your lordships house and giving us the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the minister would consider suggesting to her majesty the queen that we should institute an ambulance medal on the same lines as a police medal for long meritorious service <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in welcoming the minister upon introducing his first bill to the house following his new appointment <e> <s> he and i have met on i think at least one occasion in our different capacities at the department of health and social security and i join him in regretting that the noble lord lord butler is not here today <e> <s> from these benches we too very much welcome the governments introduction of the bill as well as the time that they have seen fit to set aside for it in the house <e> <s> it shows a recognition of the great need to increase the rights of detained patients in our mental institutions <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elton said a large proportion of the recommendations are in fact proposals that were contained in the butler committee report and in the white paper of and as such i believe deserve the support of all members of this house <e>", "<cs> perhaps we are talking about both amendments by now i am not per cent <e> <s> sure but let us assume that we are for the moment <e> <s> as my noble friend lord winstanley said i am completely behind the spirit of the amendment of the noble lord lord wallace <e> <s> i think it is highly necessary that a clause of this kind is put into the bill but i am behind my noble friend in saying that i want the word understand put in <e> <s> i think it is important despite the argument that has been going on about the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals who cannot understand <e> <s> there will be no force in the amendment unless the word understand is there whether it refers to the patient a relative or a social worker <e> <s> just to inform is not enough <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for that very helpful reply <e> <s> of course i am delighted to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord lord cullen for his long reply <e> <s> he said that it is his view that no responsible medical officer would take a decision of this kind without knowing and examining the patient <e> <s> i think that i am quoting him correctly <e> <s> if that is so what harm is there in putting <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment from the point of view of the health authorities <e> <s> i am aware of many occasions in the evenings when my regional medical officer has had to spend a whole evening in the office ringing round from one hospital to another trying to find a hospital that would agree to take a convicted patient or a patient from a court <e> <s> the power not only of the medical profession but also of the nursing staff to refuse to take difficult patients is very great today <e> <s> i do not blame them because we have changed the psychiatric <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> he has said it much better than i can <e> <s> we are looking at a bill where we are trying to ensure that the rights of patients of whatever kind are improved and we are using it to make the conditions less favourable for one section of the people within our hospitals <e> <s> it seems to me that it should not be beyond human wit to get it right <e> <s> although it says in this very clear explanatory annex that i was kindly sent by the noble lord lord belstead that <e>", "<cs> i would he most happy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is prepared at this moment to state that as a result of the sale of st georges the several millions that are to accrue to the national health service rightly belong to the south-west thames regional health authority <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord in this amendment <e> <s> unless the government are prepared to look at this aspect and give some assurances about it we are running a risk of doing for a second time something which is lessening the rights of the people whom this bill affects <e> <s> although the bill has many good points we should guard very carefully against reducing the rights that already exist <e> <s> that is why i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> obviously there is a risk that the patients own doctor will give an unfavourable report but if that is so i should think it is likely in those conditions that the hospital authorities would also give an unfavourable report and therefore it would not necessarily create a problem for the magistrates <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble lord very much for his reply and for explaining the law as it stands today <e> <s> i knew of course that any patient was entitled to get his own doctor and his own medical report <e> <s> what i was trying to prevent was exactly the same as the noble lord lord kilmarnock was attempting in his amendment that is an extension of the days up to weeks <e> <s> it was my intention by this amendment to allow a patient to apply to the court if the first days had passed and he was being remanded for a second period of days to go back to the court with his own doctors report <e> <s> having listened very carefully to what the noble lord has said i realise that this would create difficulties so i should like to read very carefully what the noble lord has said and think about how to deal with it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that this is the appropriate moment to return to the reservations that a great number of your lordships committee have about the necessity for setting up the commission <e> <s> if anybody from outside had listened to the debate that has just taken place on the various amendments proposed by different members of the committee they would come to the conclusion that there are great dangers in creating more bodies than are necessary to perform these functions <e> <s> i think we all agree with the functions that the proposed commission is supposed to perform but you need only to have listened to the debate to find that it is a fine balance between who has the authority to do this and who has the authority to do that <e> <s> even the minister had to think for more than a minute and take advice on whether the commission had power to deal with problems it discovered relating to informal patients <e>", "<cs> it is the health advisory service <e> <s> it started out as the hospital advisory service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my grateful thanks to the noble lord lord elton for introducing this alternative amendment as a result of my amendment tabled during the committee stage <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord because in actual fact this amendment achieves exactly what i aimed to achieve <e> <s> i thought that it would be easier to pick out as a separate clause at the end but i am still very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may disagree with the noble baroness lady jeger and take issue with the noble lord lord sandys about what he said <e> <s> he asked what is the good of legislating for good practice <e> <s> that is virtually what he said <e> <s> if it is standard practice and it is always done i have used this argument before there is no harm in saying so <e> <s> what i am worried about is the few occasions where good practice is not followed <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord kilmarnock and i should like first to thank the noble lord lord belstead for his long letter and to apologise for my discourtesy in not getting in touch with him or replying to his letter <e> <s> the reason was that my husband became ill and i did not attend in london so that the letter did not reach me until i returned to london yesterday <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord belstead for his long reply <e> <s> it is perhaps a little unfair to compare medical reports made on people with a physical disability with medical reports made on people suffering from a mental disability <e> <s> by the nature of things their own attitude of mind is one of suspicion of society <e> <s> that was the reason behind my amendment the fact that the patient should have the right to go to his own medical practitioner and have a report made <e> <s> in cases out of it is true that that type of person is more suspicious of his surroundings and of what is being done to him than are people with rational minds <e> <s> i believe that certain safeguards could be helpful and therefore helpful in the ultimate treatment of the patient once he himself has agreed that what he needs is the assistance of being a patient in a psychiatric hospital <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord elton very much for his reply <e> <s> i realise that some of the arguments put up by the government are difficult to defeat <e> <s> however i do not see why the argument that because a mental health review tribunal had supervised the decision to move a patient from a hospital which is not a special hospital to a special hospital would mitigate against the national health service hospital receiving the patient back <e> <s> i was not proposing that every time he goes in and out it should happen only in the first instance when he is first deprived of his freedom to the extent of being put in a special hospital <e> <s> within six months after that he is entitled to go to another tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving us the opportunity to debate this very important issue at this time <e> <s> obviously i am considering this motion as a recently retired regional chairman <e> <s> i agree whole-heartedly with what the noble lord lord hunter and the noble lord lord elton have said about our desire for an improved national health service in this country in the s <e> <s> however i think that we must look at the economic possibilities and chances of improving the services within the constraints of the economic climate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is per cent <e> <s> so i am quoting correctly <e> <s> if one wanted to make a political point one could say that it is a terrible indictment of the economic policy pursued by this country in that period <e> <s> however that would not get us very far <e> <s> what i think we should consider is what a per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms means for the national health service over such a long period of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not approve of people using national health service hospitals as private patients and not paying their bills nobody approves of that <e> <s> having been regional chairman i am afraid that i am not aware of the million to which reference has been made <e> <s> i have had the odd case brought to my attention where we have tried to take action <e> <s> however i shall take advice from my former region on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords after that very serious statement we now return to what in many cases is just as serious a subject <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble earl lord longford for introducing this subject <e> <s> like him i have had some personal experience because the noble baroness lady macleod persuaded me to join one of her voluntary organisations which is called crisis at christmas and which looks after feeds houses and clothes homeless people in london every christmas <e> <s> it was by joining that organisation that there came home to me the enormity of the problem that we have to cope with in the big conurbations in our country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware and will he say categorically to the noble lord lord molloy that the governors of the great ormond street hospital have the interests of that hospital very greatly at heart and that it is not of their choice that they are being forced into the position of closing tadworth hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords you must excuse me for relaxing and leaning back <e> <s> i was under the impression that the second statement would be presented to us before it was my turn to continue the debate on the new proposed bill <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for introducing the bill so clearly and for pointing out to us what the government are attempting to do <e> <s> i shall turn to one or two aspects of the bill and not necessarily go through all its various clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is generally accepted that the national health service needs an increase of between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> per annum for demographic changes which against per cent <e> <s> in my view does not leave anything for growth <e> <s> will the minister please ask the secretary of state not to talk about growth <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to support the amendment but i must ask a question which arose in my mind as a result of the comments of the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith <e> <s> she drew a comparison between someone living in a council house and someone living in a house and said it was not fair that their contributions should not be different because one would be better off than the other <e> <s> not everybody lives in a house even though people may own the house in which they are living <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply but i am rather disappointed that between th december and today from what i have heard him say consultations have not started <e> <s> i sincerely hope that we shall have further information on the results of the consultation at third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say something about this as a former regional health authority chairman <e> <s> the problem of funding specialist hospitals is one that has been concerning the nhs for years <e> <s> i have been party in the past to many meetings at the department when we have discussed what can be done <e> <s> within a region itself the regional specialties are funded off the top before the rest of the regional money is distributed <e> <s> but that is not enough in itself because the regions are short of money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt for just a second <e> <s> it is true that most regions in this country allocate money to the special regional specialties before they allocate to the region <e> <s> they send the money to the area to spend but there is a special amount of money for the regional specialties in every allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to take part in a debate with two such leading experts on the subject but i cannot refrain from mentioning one aspect which perhaps is not directly relevant to the introduction of the noble lord lord ashby but i believe it is something particularly today about which we should think <e> <s> for many years in my own political party i have been interested in environmental questions and i was delighted when i heard of the setting up of the royal commission and when i read its findings <e> <s> like other speakers i have been very depressed at the lack of action by successive governments since the royal commission reported <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that for a long time the particular part of the social fund which is dedicated to the retraining of women was undersubscribed by all countries and that that was the opportunity that britain had <e> <s> at that time i thought i had the opportunity to apply to the social fund through the department of employment and the department of health and social security <e> <s> i asked for permission to go to the social fund for the retraining of women doctors but it was refused me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first join in the congratulations expressed to the noble lord lord ennals on his maiden speech in this house <e> <s> i do this with particular pleasure because for some years i was an employee of his <e> <s> i should like on this occasion to say that rarely have i worked with a secretary of state who was so approachable and this is a great and desirable characteristic in secretaries of state <e> <s> also i think that he was perhaps responsible to a large extent for highlighting the position of the cinderella services within the national health service <e> <s> few people have done as much as he has done for the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill we are very grateful to him <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for raising this subject because i believe that we are meeting at a time when people in the country are concerned as never before about the future of the health service <e> <s> i was very interested in the noble lord lord ferrier saying that what we have been talking about is the past <e> <s> let us talk about the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i had forgotten about that ruling and i should have paraphrased what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for his defence <e> <s> quite apart from the management on the new proposed management structure for the nhs and as i say i have talked about some of the aspects because i feel there is an unhealthy urgency on behalf of the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mottistone sits down may i ask whether in his comparison between the national health service and the defence services he took into account that the projected growth for the nhs is if anything under half of per cent <e> <s> whereas that for the defence services is per cent <e>", "<cs> i was going to apologise for daring to take part in this all-male preserve of the agricultural holdings bill but thanks to the noble baroness lady white i am the second speaker from our side so to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord molloy for allowing us to have this debate about the plans considered by the south-west thames regional health authority <e> <s> i had better announce my interest in the authority as i was its chairman until january <e> <s> i was in fact chairman when the mental illness working party was set up <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble baroness lady macleod for putting the question in its historical context and for pointing out to us how these hospitals first came to be created and why they were situated there <e> <s> in addition may i say in regard to the question asked by the noble lord lord molloy about the six psychiatric hospitals at epsom that only four of them are administered by the south-west thames authority and horton and banstead are administered by the north-west thames authority <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the proceeds the million are going to be used to develop that land at present owned by the forestry commission but not yet <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the decision taken some time ago by the secretary of state to increase the number of consultants posts in the health service in order to alleviate the log jam for junior doctors thereby enabling the younger doctors to get into the service for which they are trained would have been helpful <e> <s> can he tell the house how many new consultants posts have been created as a result of that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving us the opportunity of discussing the future management of the nhs <e> <s> at the time of the statement on the griffiths report on th october many noble lords in this house expressed their desire for a full debate on the issues involved and so far the government have not seen fit to satisfy that desire <e> <s> i am also very grateful to the noble lord for setting out the historical background to our debate today <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister whether this amendment is not quite different from a lot of the others <e> <s> it has been said in the committee that all these amendments are dealing with the same thing trying to exempt a particular group or a particular service <e> <s> this amendment is different from the others because here is a situation where in actual fact the government fund the joint financing as part of the national health service expenditure <e> <s> they give the national health service money for the joint financing of projects between the local authority and the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to deal purely with part i of the bill as my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that despite the responsibility which the local authorities have for inspecting the premises it is only the dhss who hand out the vouchers and the social security people who are capable of knowing if a house containing rooms is housing or people <e>", "<cs> i wish to add just one or two words <e> <s> i was very interested in what has just been said about the impact of advertising on the cost of glasses <e> <s> in this committee there seem to he some who believe that advertising will help to reduce prices other noble lords say that that is a minor issue and is not important <e> <s> i am very concerned with the high standard of optical dispensing that exists in this country <e> <s> why do we have to do everything in one fell swoop <e> <s> why can we not let the advertising go through leave things for a couple of years see how that reduces the price of glasses and if it does not help think again on the other issues <e>", "<cs> i have no means of checking whether those figures are true <e> <s> i am aware that to detect glaucoma in the early stages is one of the most difficult things to do because to begin with it is virtually symptomless <e> <s> it could be that the figures which have just been quoted imply that that is the number of people who have the beginnings of glaucoma <e> <s> my experience is that when people have <e>", "<cs> while thanking the noble earl for his reply regretting that he has not been able to go any further towards meeting us in our amendments and not being certain what the noble lord lord mottistone will do with his amendment am afraid that i must press my amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply and in view of his assurances that the consumer interest will be truly consulted i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in an effort to reduce waiting lists particularly for surgical in-patient treatment it would be helpful if there was in the hands of general practitioners a computerised system of waiting time for hospitals all over britain so that the doctors could refer their patients to the hospitals which had the shortest waiting time <e> <s> what are the government doing about that <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for his explanation of the future for persons detained under the mental health act <e> <s> i agree that at the moment they do receive free service within the hospital <e> <s> however in view of what was stated by my noble friend lord kilmarnock about these people not being sufficiently capable of looking <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment because if we end up with the bill as it is we shall certainly need an amendment of this kind to put in the bill what will be the duties of the family practitioner committees <e> <s> this is therefore desperately important <e>", "<cs> we are asking for the recall system to be the responsibility of the family practitioner committees <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply but i do not find it convincing by any means <e> <s> first there is the implication that the staff of the fpcs will be just transferred as they are <e> <s> if that is so and the duties of the fpcs are not going to change at all then why do we not keep the present structure <e> <s> if they are to be the same staff in any case they will not be unhappy whether they are paid by the dha or by the fpc if we wait until but at least we would have enough time to think about what we are doing and for once in the nhs we would do things properly and would not rush into them <e> <s> however in the circumstances i do not intend to press my amendment at this stage but i shall certainly consider what to do at the report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i said that i would reserve some of my comments to this point on our agenda <e> <s> two very conflicting views have been expressed by your lordships during the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> one view has been per cent <e> <s> in favour of the independence of the fpcs and the other has been in favour of integration within the main line of the nhs <e> <s> i wish to appeal to your lordships committee to remain with the <e>", "<cs> may i also ask the noble earl why then it is important to have it specified that nurses should be part of the dhas if they do not have to be part of fpcs <e> <s> i do not see the logic <e>", "<cs> i quite understand the statement of the noble lord lord glenarthur on capital cash limits but it really does not detract from my amendment <e> <s> that kind of adjustment is done with the agreement of the health authorities anyway <e> <s> i cannot understand how any organisation be it the national health service itself or a regional health authority could ever get itself into the position this applies particularly to the department of health and social security described by the noble lord lord glenarthur because of a change in vat or the withdrawal for some reason of allocations from health authorities <e> <s> it is very unlikely to happen in the last quarter of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord longford for introducing this debate tonight <e> <s> before coming to the house i too armed myself with some statistics obtained from the department of health <e> <s> they relate to october of last year so i was delighted to hear from the noble lord lord windlesham that the situation as it now exists is an improvement on the figures that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not how i read the amendment <e> <s> the financial allocation of the department or the secretary of state goes down to the region and the impetus for any change between the region and the district comes from the allocation or the allotment or the change in allocation that is handed down through the region to the district <e> <s> it would be the region who would be objecting and who might use this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords while being grateful to the noble lord for announcing the increase in the governments contribution towards the solving of population problems in the world would the noble lord agree that in the long run the best aid that we can give to the developing world is in helping them to control their population <e> <s> india had a population of million when they achieved independence <e> <s> the population is now million and is increasing by million per annum <e> <s> india could have produced an industrial miracle had there been population control <e> <s> what i would ask the government to do is to use an even greater percentage of their <e>", "<cs> my lords i was tremendously impressed listening to the debate in which so many people with outstanding scientific knowledge took part <e> <s> when the noble lord lord ashby opened the debate and we are very grateful to him and to the noble lord lord nathan for giving us the opportunity to debate these two important reports he said that years ago the control of pollution act was greeted as a charter for the future <e> <s> he was obviously disappointed in what had happened over those years <e> <s> he said that what have spurred action at the moment largely have been public opinion and the european community involvement <e> <s> i am not a scientist <e> <s> i represent public opinion or at least that is what i like to think <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please inform me on what criteria the unanimously approved appointment of an administrator in the west midlands was turned down by the department of health and social security whether east anglia have yet appointed their administrator and how many regions have appointed their district administrators <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in view of his answer concerning i think regulation no <e> <s> where the mortgage interest can be paid either direct to the building society or to the person taking out the mortgage the government have the power to make certain that the payment goes to the right source <e> <s> i should just like to know why that is not being done because all of us in this house would like the miners to keep their houses <e> <s> we do not want them to lose them <e> <s> we are on their side in this way <e> <s> why cannot the government change the payments <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support this amendment because it appears to us that to attack the problem as it does in the bill is to attack the problem from the wrong end <e> <s> there is an additional benefit in the minister having the right to set the maximum use of pesticides <e> <s> it does not only mean that the minister can set the maximum use he can also set the minimum use and that is desperately important <e> <s> we all know that using a pesticide and using too little raises the risk of building up immunity and resistance in both pest and pathogen targets <e> <s> it is important that if the farmer perhaps is trying to save money and would use too little he realises that to do so is just as important as using too much <e> <s> i believe therefore that the amendment has a lot to recommend it <e>", "<cs> i feel i must get to my feet again to defend my minimum standards <e> <s> i am sorry if it has been understood as being a bar to experimenting on reducing the amount of pesticides you use in order to control your pests <e> <s> any pesticide that is sold has to be tested and licensed for use and it seems to me that it would be perfectly possible to set minimum standards <e> <s> all of us know that it is dangerous to use too little pesticide <e> <s> once there is no immunity against a pest it is much more difficult to control matters later <e> <s> i do not see that it militates against experiment in quantity <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider withdrawing the amendment but before doing so may i say to the noble lord <e> <s> lord stodart who questioned why we had put conditions in that there is an enormous difference between a still sunny day and a howling gale <e> <s> a farmer could be applying his pesticide when the wind was too strong and the pesticide was therefore spreading <e> <s> i do not think it is unreasonable to refer to conditions <e> <s> but with the assurance of the noble lord i shall withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am deeply grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger for having raised the subject of the national health service and social security and the anxieties which exist among both public and professional people <e> <s> we are anxious it is important to say this because as my noble friend lord winstanley said we believe that the national health service is among the best of the services we have created in this country since the last war and we want to preserve it <e> <s> i ask the government to listen most carefully to what is being said all round this chamber on the media and in the press about the national health service <e> <s> although a lot of the things that are said sound like great complaints and some of them are great complaints they are said in the spirit of trying to make the health service as good as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton for having introduced this debate and for so ably having set the historical background to it <e> <s> many noble lords have spoken and have given examples of success stories as for instance did my noble friend lord walston as regards zimbabwe <e> <s> other noble lords like the noble lord lord hams of high cross have given us examples of calamities where aid has gone wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord kilmarnock in the motion before the house <e> <s> i am delighted that he should have enabled us to discuss the very real problem that now faces us <e> <s> as my noble friend said i am going to speak mainly about private patients and private beds in hospitals but i should like to re-emphasise and support his concern about the increased prescription charges particularly for those drugs that do not cost <e> <s> it is very easy to suggest that you go back to your general practitioner and get a private prescription for which you pay or <e> <s> but how will that affect people who live in rural areas where there is not always a chemist round the corner from the general practitioners surgery <e> <s> i believe that not only is it going to cost the patient something extra to get the private prescription but it is also going to cost an enormous amount of time and effort <e> <s> this is what i find unforgivable <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i also add my thanks to the noble baroness lady lockwood for having introduced this debate today <e> <s> i should also say how much i join the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes in welcoming so many men in our chamber today <e> <s> particularly i should like to tell the noble earl lord longford that not by any means was he intervening <e> <s> i am delighted that six men are taking part in our debate on the status of women today and everybody is most welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister please care to inform the house why it appears that the british oil industry needs until to complete its research into the production of lead-free petrol in view of the fact that that type of petrol has been on sale in the united states for a number of years and in view of the fact that japan is proposing to have per cent <e> <s> of its petrol lead-free in a very short time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that the greatest incentive that can be given to health authorities to look at what properties they might have for sale depends largely on the percentage of the proceeds that goes back to the health authorities <e> <s> is the noble baroness able to tell us at this moment what percentage of the million has been returned to the health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that when they are handed to a regional health authority which she said occasionally happened it does not affect the original capital allocation to that health authority and there is not a deduction made <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first pay tribute to the way in which the noble lord lord kearton introduced this report this afternoon but above all to the way in which he conducted the committee <e> <s> he was faced at the beginning by a number of people on that committee who had widely divergent views about what european union meant and he managed by skill and by leadership to make us agree to the report that your lordships have in front of you <e> <s> there are many of us who advocated britains <e>", "<cs> my lords may we return now to the debate that we started quite a long time ago <e> <s> i should first like to thank the noble baroness lady serota for so ably introducing the report on the equal treatment of men and women in taxation <e> <s> i should also like to thank her very much for the fair and competent way in which she chaired what was a very difficult committee <e> <s> the subject is complex <e> <s> the noble baroness was a superb chairman of our committee <e> <s> i should also like to join her in thanking our legal adviser and our clerk for their able support <e> <s> without them i do not think we would have produced a report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has told us most helpfully that of the shall i say <e> <s> medical officers of health have taken senior managerial district jobs <e> <s> does she not agree that what is important to most of us in your lordships house is to find out how many community physicians are in fact part of the management team <e>", "<cs> my lords i am desperately sorry that we are not allowed to applaud this house <e> <s> may i thank the noble baroness lady cox first of all for raising the subject of our discussion this evening and also for outlining in such a professional and moving way the problems that face <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my thanks to the noble earl for raising this subject <e> <s> the question relates merely to the sizewell inquiry <e> <s> it is not a question about whether or not we believe in nuclear power <e> <s> i intend to confine myself to the question that has been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that where it is not possible to find a new sub-postmaster for a sub-post office in a rural area perhaps because the work does not justify a full-time job it ought to be possible for a bigger central post office to send out for one or two days a week a member of its staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble baroness lady david in thanking the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i join her also in objecting to the timing of the delivery of the statement <e> <s> i cannot remember whether i have before responded to a statement on behalf of these benches but i was always under the impression that one had at least minutes to half-an-hour to consider what ones contribution should be <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that in regard to any aid programme one of the greatest problems facing the third world is a population explosion <e> <s> will she assure this house that in any aid programme from this country there is a built-in percentage for family planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the right reverend prelate the bishop of truro for his very interesting maiden speech <e> <s> perhaps i may also say how interesting it has been to listen to this debate <e> <s> i have been transported from the beautiful countryside of cornwall to the centre of the midlands and up to liverpool and i should now like to come back roughly to london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister two questions <e> <s> i should first like to ask him how many planning permissions in the green belt that have been refused by local authorities and have gone to appeal have later been granted by the secretary of state <e> <s> i should also like to ask a question concerning the agricultural problem <e> <s> i was happy to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord seebohm for his introduction of this mass of reports from your lordships select committee <e> <s> i should also like to join the noble baroness lady carnegy in thanking our chairman the noble baroness lady serota for the wonderful way in which she chaired both the subjects that have been the subject of sub-committee c <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply but i cannot say that it is encouraging as i thought publication was closer than it seems to be <e> <s> can he say whether preliminary discussions have taken place with the nuclear installations inspectorate and whether it is likely that the power station will be given full safety clearance for a construction licence <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness whether perhaps the difference does not have something to do with the division of the money that the government are putting up to support essential small pharmacies and that too small a proportion is going to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness the minister please agree that we have two ways to attack this problem <e> <s> i welcome what the minister has said about the advice to the health authorities on cervical screening but perhaps she will tell us what the government are doing about the cases where women who have been lucky enough to be screened have to wait for three or four months with the awful thought hanging over them that something may go wrong in the waiting period <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to answer my question <e> <s> i asked what happens when women who have been called in have been screened and have to go into hospital have to wait for three or four months with that hanging over their heads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply and welcome the governments intentions regarding the general directive <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is great concern among the profession who are either close to or have achieved general agreement on a sectoral directive such as the lawyers and physiotherapists <e> <s> in particular the physiotherapists appear to be ready to proceed and the hold-up seems to lie with the commission <e> <s> in view of the fact that we have sectoral directives for doctors and nurses and that all the health related professions are perhaps more directly concerned with the safety of individuals in each country in other words with the safety of patients it seems that a sectoral directive for physiotherapists would be a suitable course to pursue <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether i am correct in saying that the brake on the proceedings for physiotherapists lies mainly with the commission at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a supplementary question <e> <s> i understand that the definitive text of the general directive has not yet been published because there appears to be a discrepancy <e>", "<cs> my lords there is quite a discrepancy between the english french <e> <s> german and greek texts <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether a definitive text is expected and if so when <e> <s> i understand that the council has met once and i am sure that the house would be very interested to know whether any preliminary conclusions were reached at that first meeting and when the next meeting of the council on the subject will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that the reason for the long waiting lists in london may be partly due to the rawp allocations introduced by the department some years ago <e> <s> although we are grateful for the million input of extra money to reduce waiting lists can the minister tell the house what alterations the government foresee to the basis of the allocations under rawp <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the minister in her answer to one of the supplementary questions is implying that the million injection will enable the regions that are receiving the smallest allocations under rawp to solve their problems in the future <e> <s> does that mean that the million will be repeated year after year <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment and i rise to support it as a farmer <e> <s> like all farmers i am fully aware of the various acts and regulations in existence to protect the consumer from the dangers of additives in the food chain <e> <s> i am also fully aware that if i do not obey these regulations i can be subject to criminal proceedings <e> <s> the farming community is no more and no less criminally inclined than the average person in this nation <e> <s> inevitably there will be the occasional farmer who tries to cheat the regulations <e> <s> when discovered he is subject to criminal proceedings but the person injured by his act has no redress unless we pass these amendments <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that it is perfectly legitimate for members of this house to be concerned about expenditure incurred in keeping open the options at sizewell <e> <s> ten months ago on th april the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon quoted a letter from the noble lord lord gray of contin where he stated that the cost is million per month which in a year works out at million <e> <s> since that debate took place i make the cost million <e> <s> i agree that we are happy that the report is going to be published on monday but we should also like with due respect to this house having time to debate it a decision to be taken as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the right reverend prelate but he referred to sweden which is the country i originally came from <e> <s> he is right in saying that abortion is permissible up to the th week but will he also take into account that it is permissible on demand by the woman <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to intervene again but may i ask the right reverend prelate whether those abortions that took place after weeks were performed because the risk to the mothers life was too great <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i should like to thank him very much for having pointed out as a member of the medical profession that in a foetus there may be certain grave disabilities that cannot be discovered too early <e> <s> does he agree that a mother who is faced with such knowledge should never be forced to take a decision that day as to whether she will have an abortion <e> <s> she should be given at least a fortnight to think about it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much for his long and full reply <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol for her support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider one aspect of rural revival <e> <s> i welcome any thing that moves towards giving back life to the rural community <e> <s> the minister mentioned post offices and the village shops services that are essential to a rural community <e> <s> does he agree that the most central service in a rural community is the village school <e> <s> will he advise local education authorities to stop closing them <e>", "<cs> my lords

mentioned in his speech that there are only two countries in europe which are innovators in the drug field germany and this country <e> <s> am i mistaken in believing that drugs are not protected in germany <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that helpful reply <e> <s> i hope she will agree that never has the opportunity been greater in view of the apparent slight change of mind of the soviet administration and mr gorbachevs various statements about human rights <e> <s> for the sake of his family and for the sake of all of us to find the true answer to the fate of raoul wallenberg one of the greatest humanitarians this century has seen would be very worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords

probably the best consumer protection bill that has ever come before us <e> <s> i must however join the noble baroness lady burton of coventry in regretting that we did not manage to amend the

world <e> <s> it is true that to gain entry to a veterinary college you need a higher standard of education than you do even to enter the medical profession <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that that is not what my noble friend asked <e> <s> does he also agree that there are many of us who feel that the fact that we did away with whitsun was the beginning of the end <e> <s> most of us wish to have the holidays where they were <e> <s> it is because we have changed whitsun to another bank holiday that we all object to the change <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> the eminent speakers and the depth of their speeches are a measure of the concern which the house feels about the problem of fraud against the community <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that tonnes of cfcs are likely to be released into the atmosphere over the next years <e> <s> in view of the prime ministers concern about the subject what resources are the government prepared to put in to solve that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether i have understood him rightly <e> <s> if not will he make the matter clear <e> <s> he said that in a general practitioner service with a practice that goes in for a budget holding service the administrative costs will be reimbursed by the department <e> <s> therefore can he assure me that in order to run their practice their budget and give the right kind of service a practice of six general practioners would need to employ an administrator and that that cost will be reimbursed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not often that one is present during the second reading of a bill in which there is such universal agreement in the chamber about the purpose of that bill <e> <s> on behalf of these benches i wish very warmly to welcome the bill and congratulate the honourable member in another place on bringing it forward and the noble lord lord gregson on introducing it in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i paid i am a law-abiding citizen <e>", "<cs> my lords yes duty of care <e> <s> the other firms did not seem reliable <e> <s> i have used that example because it constantly happens to legitimate operators and it interferes with their business <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with me that ajl of us in this house are worried that there is no member with practical research experience in the top management tier and that many of us feel worried that the government are relying purely on voluntary research contributions <e> <s> at the moment voluntary research money far exceeds the governments contribution to the mrc <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble earls reply about the reduction of crime in rural areas <e> <s> will he tell us by how much crimes of actual bodily harm and vandalism have decreased <e> <s> in my experience as a justice of the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the sentiments of the noble lord lord crickhowell about this excellent report produced by the noble lord lord middleton and his committee <e> <s> in my view it gives a very balanced view between the dangers of nitrate pollution and possible damage to the agricultural community <e> <s> it deals with the alternatives of blending and treatment and with the difference between preventive and curative measures as i say in a completely balanced manner <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the governments agreement to sanction another consultant posts is completely different from their actual appointment by health authorities which at present do not have the money to appoint those extra consultants <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord ennals in his prayer to annul <e> <s> all of us i believe agree that the one thing we are terribly proud of in our national health service is our general practitioner and family doctor service <e> <s> it exists in hardly any country in the world to the extent that it exists here and it is the envy of many countries <e> <s> i can speak with some feeling having been born and brought up in sweden which is well known for its good medical practice <e> <s> the one thing sweden no longer has is a family doctor service <e> <s> they managed to kill it off after the war <e> <s> there is nothing they have regretted as much <e> <s> we have a wonderful service <e> <s> it is only per cent <e> <s> of the health service budget and we want to preserve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that at this late stage in the proceedings it is not presumptuous of me to congratulate the three maiden speakers who managed to make such uncontroversial contributions to our debate <e> <s> i felt that i was present at an historic occasion when the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to protect the environment by eliminating the use of chlorofluorocarbons and requiring her majestys government to carry out an audit of the use of chlorofluorocarbons and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us her estimate of the increase expected in administrative staff as a result of the implementation of the new health and community service bill <e> <s> the noble baroness told us that there has been an increase of per cent <e> <s> between the years and <e> <s> i believe that the house will be very interested to hear how much the figure for administrative staff will increase under the new conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned what has been done for the highlands and islands and compared that with the situation of people living in the border country <e> <s> can he specify the kind of services at the disposal of the people living on the isle of barra and people living in the border country <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in congratulating the noble and gallant lord lord carver and his committee on the most excellent report that they have produced <e> <s> it has caused us to listen to an outstanding debate <e> <s> i am only sad that a debate of this importance and interest to a majority of the population of this country should have taken place so late in the evening <e> <s> with all due respect to the scottish lawyers i should have preferred it to be the first business <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister telling us that the stoppage of supplies from the one manufacturer in this country came out of the blue and that we were not given any warning to enable us to plan imports from alternative sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord reay and all other noble lords who contributed to the debate <e> <s> of course we wish the government every success in hosting the conference in june <e> <s> there is no difference between the governments response and what i am trying to do in the bill <e> <s> there is no reason at all why a country on its own should not take the kind of action that sweden has taken <e> <s> noble lords have said that it is a world problem and that what one country does has little effect <e> <s> but it has some effect <e> <s> we together create the enormous effect <e> <s> every country that withdraws and sets a timetable will help in regard to ozone depletion <e>", "<cs> she will not only have satisfied herself that she is ready for parenthood but she is also facing in the case of amendment no <e> <s> a most unpleasant experience <e> <s> in vitro fertilisation is not a pleasurable experience <e> <s> i know many women who have undergone the procedure and i believe that any woman who is convinced enough to go through that will love her child <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for introducing the debate and congratulate him on his luck in the ballot only three weeks before the third north sea conference takes place <e> <s> in his introduction he set the problem in the context of world agreements covering all seas and he rightly pointed out that the north sea countries have a special responsibility for what happens in our seas <e> <s> although we in this country are to blame for many things it is true that the discharges from the rhine are of even greater concern <e> <s> however that should not leave us feeling complacent <e> <s> everything that is done by all the countries around the north sea has an effect on the marine environment <e> <s> i and i am sure all noble lords believe that this country should set an example rather than lag behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to accept the amendment <e> <s> when i introduced the bill on second reading i was unhappy about the wording because it implied what is perhaps impossible to enforce <e> <s> i was unable to think of better wording and i am only too happy to accept the amendment suggested by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e>", "<cs> the bill has been introduced in this place and this is its committee stage <e> <s> so far as i am aware the annex to the montreal protocol does not as yet contain many of the substances to which the minister referred <e> <s> we are dealing with what the annex contains at the moment <e> <s> other countries have accepted that those substances should be eliminated by <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for sending me the translation of the order which is in force in sweden <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with the amendment of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> however i have one problem with it <e> <s> having listened to the minister i wish to emphasise that when under the reasonably tight timetable cfcs are eliminated there will inevitably be a period when a substitute will have to be used <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether he would contemplate coming back at report stage with this amendment putting a different timetable to it from the date <e> <s> in scandinavia the government contemplate something like or which might be more realistic <e> <s> in essence i am per cent behind the aim of the amendment that we should make certain that the substitutes for cfcs are not equally dangerous <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment as the mover of the bill <e> <s> i do not accept that it is impossible to follow the timetable suggested in the amendment of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> if that can be achieved in other countries it can be achieved in this country also <e> <s> that provision is already on the statute book in sweden <e> <s> it is essential that we impose a timetable in the bill that does not stretch too far into the future <e> <s> if we are to achieve an improvement as regards ozone depletion we must be quite firm about what we shall do with the gases that we have been discussing <e> <s> i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that the type of information which he tells us is being collected but which is not for publication could be made available to the committee that will be set up under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has rightly reminded the house that at committee stage i expressed great sympathy with his amendment <e> <s> my problem was that it contained no timetable <e> <s> i felt that if the amendment had been accepted at that stage and inserted into the bill it might have meant that the time limit was <e> <s> i felt that that was not possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the various stages of this bill <e> <s> i cannot hide the fact that i am desperately disappointed in the reply that the noble lord has just given <e> <s> he seems to take objection to one amendment in particular <e> <s> when the bill goes to another place it can be amended again <e> <s> it does not have to condemn the bill <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the government will think again on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that when these stamps first appeared i was told that one ought to have known that the stamps were not usable for overseas mail because inside the book there was nothing to say how much it cost to send postage to india or anywhere else <e> <s> the non-value indicator stamp books now have such information printed inside <e> <s> it therefore gives the impression that they are good for anywhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady stedman for introducing the debate <e> <s> but in view of the limited time we have to speak on this important subject i shall confine myself to one of the most unfair aspects of the poll tax legislation <e> <s> noble lords will not be surprised to know that it deals with the position of student nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee e which produced the report on <e>", "<cs> as i have been mentioned perhaps i may be allowed to quote some personal experiences having been a regional chairman appointed originally by the noble lord lord joseph at the end of <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to his appointments of regional chairmen because as far as i can see there was absolutely no political bias in those appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that whether one accepts the figures of the noble baroness lady nicol of and designated or his figures of with designated it seems a sadly small number <e> <s> he said that the next batch is in process of being designated <e> <s> how many will that next batch include <e> <s> how long will it be before we have completed consideration of those which have been put forward <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady cox has introduced the amendment in such terms that there remains very little for us to say <e> <s> she has expressed what we all feel <e>", "<cs> i too have my name to the amendment <e> <s> following the previous debate in which the government attempted to calm our anxieties and tell us that everything is being introduced gently and that it is essentially a form of pilot scheme there is one thing that we know namely that regional district and special health authorities will become purchasers of health care on st april <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support this amendment <e> <s> in the national health service we can pride ourselves that over the years we have developed a closer link between community services and the hospital services <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment most sincerely <e> <s> i think it is a tragedy that it has come up for discussion at this hour of the night because i believe that it is one of the most important amendments for the future of the health service <e> <s> in the health service we depend on the quality of the teaching and the quality of the research that goes on in our hospitals and that is particularly applicable to the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that your lordships select committee inquiry into fraud in the community relied very heavily on the evidence from the court of auditors <e> <s> one of the reports recommendations which i have not heard the noble earl mention is the necessity to give greater powers to the court of auditors <e> <s> we are approaching an inter-governmental conference on european monetary union and i understand that there will also be an inquiry into european institutions <e> <s> does the minister agree that it is most urgent that greater powers are given to the court of auditors <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have another minute <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which was originally in the name of my noble friend lord winstanley who is a gp <e> <s> unfortunately he is not here today and i am standing in for him <e> <s> i have great concern about the homeless <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> the minister said that the practice leaflet is supposed to give information to patients within the practice or to those who are looking for a new gp about the services provided by that practice <e> <s> does the minister agree that it is absolutely correct that there should also be in the leaflet something about the fpcs so that if a patient is not satisfied with the practice the leaflet explains where a patient can go for advice <e>", "<cs> i fail to understand why so many things should be secret and hidden under and behind the backs of some organisation or another within the system <e> <s> the health service is run for the patient <e> <s> i should have thought that the patient had the right to know what was happening <e> <s> i very much regret that the government cannot see their way to agreeing to this small amendment <e>", "<cs> i can see that they will need to know being the people who in the last analysis hand out the cash <e> <s> however i feel that the people living in the area of the family health services authorities are also entitled to know something of the economics of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that apart from an increase in the aid we give towards population services in under-developed countries perhaps the greatest service we could provide would be to increase our aid towards the education and training of women in third world countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i am delighted that it has changed somewhat from the answer he gave me on th april and that it is more in line with the prime ministers reply in another place <e> <s> however is he aware that the commissions anti-fraud programme includes additional annual expenditure of million ecus on anti-fraud measures <e> <s> that is exactly double the annual cost of the budget to the court of auditors <e> <s> it is rather like closing the stable door when the horse has bolted <e> <s> would not the right way forward be to make it mandatory for the council of ministers to take note of and act upon the court of auditors reports and to give the court greater finance <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect to the noble earl i did not ask that the court of auditors should produce a report i asked for the court to be given greater powers <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a great privilege to be present during this debate and to listen to three outstanding maiden speeches <e> <s> i cannot remember attending a debate which had three maiden speakers and very few debates when we had so many speeches on one subject <e> <s> perhaps that is an indication of the deep concern that is felt by all members of the house and by the population in general on the subject of environmental protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported this amendment in committee and i should like to do so again <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals poined out that the changes in the health service with self-governing hospital trusts and district health authorities would mean that health authorities would conceivably make quite a number of contracts with hospitals outside their own districts <e> <s> in my view that makes it essential for us to have an amendment of the kind which is now before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the funding for the special fraud unit is now almost double the funding for the court of auditors <e> <s> is it not rather a matter of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted <e> <s> would not the right answer be to give increased funding and powers to the court of auditors <e>", "<cs> my lords i too warmly support the amendment <e> <s> i shall not speak for more than one minute because the case was more than adequately put by the noble baroness lady cox and the noble lords lord ennals and lord walton <e> <s> one of the most important functions of the amendment is that it will help to keep the mobility of labour within the service <e> <s> inevitably national health service trusts will be dealing with the acute section of the service <e> <s> it will be increasingly difficult to staff the caring services such as community nursing <e> <s> it is essential that such a provision is inserted in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply but i regret to say that it is not at all satisfactory <e> <s> i cannot see why according to the reply we have just been given trusts will take account of service with the nhs prior to transfer to the trust subject to any new agreements made with the staff but where an employee leaves the trust and goes back into the nhs the same contractual security does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i supported the noble lord lord walton in an amendment similar to this one except that it did not include the proposed new subsection b in amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i raised that issue because i am concerned about the amount of money devoted to medical research in the present day <e> <s> at least per cent <e> <s> of the money devoted to research is raised by medical research charities <e> <s> the noble lord lord walton referred to the fact that the charities are having to spend a large amount of their funds not on pure research or clinical research but on paying for back-up services in national health service hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> it was much more helpful than i expected it to be <e> <s> i shall read the guidelines with great interest <e> <s> nevertheless i am always sad that the answer always is we cannot have it on the face of the bill <e> <s> i have the utmost confidence that what the minister says is what she intends to carry out but the provision will not be on the face of the bill <e> <s> we shall not always have the same ministers or government but the bill will remain <e> <s> that is what worries me about the legislation <e>", "<cs> i am saddened by the response of the government particularly the answer the minister gave which belittled what the country of my birth is attempting to do on this subject <e> <s> he said that there are lots of derogations <e> <s> i have studied the derogations and they are very tight <e> <s> even in our proposal there are derogations <e> <s> we are not insisting that cfcs cannot be used in the treatment of asthma or for pain-relieving purposes <e> <s> derogations are inevitably necessary in treating certain conditions <e> <s> but unless we have a timetable which is tight the effort will not be expended in meeting it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether the number of people in customs and excise who devote their time to exports has been increased during the past year and if so by how much <e> <s> can he say whether that section has now been computerised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely astounded <e> <s> i cannot express what i feel <e> <s> having used exactly what the government stated in their white paper they wanted to do i am told that it is unnecessary because it is part of the agreement on the montreal protocol <e> <s> we are a nation we still need legislation to make certain that we will obey what the montreal protocol says <e> <s> i should have thought that we would need legislation to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect we have years until the year <e> <s> we have gone a long way already towards developing alternatives <e> <s> to recycle cfcs send them out to third world countries which will inevitably release them into the atmosphere is not the right way to go about matters <e> <s> cfcs are one of the most dangerous of gases and we have no doubt as to the danger they cause to the ozone layer and their contribution to the greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sad that the government have decided that my amendment is not necessary <e> <s> i thought that the ministers reply was rather complacent as regards what we have achieved <e> <s> he said that combined heat and power capacity will be doubled by the year <e> <s> so far as i know and i stand to be corrected we have only one large district scheme in this country in nottingham <e> <s> i come from sweden where half of stockholm is heated by a district heating system using combined heat and power <e> <s> we have a long way to go <e> <s> to double the small units in this country by the year is not making the best use of its wasted heat which just goes into the air <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not taken part in this debate thus far and unfortunately i was not able to be present in committee <e> <s> i regret the fact that the debate is deteriorating and moving into matters which are not the subject of the amendments before us <e> <s> we are not discussing whether we approve of a scottish a welsh or an english body <e> <s> because we are conservationists we are worried whether or not we believe in it that when this is implemented it will be a failure <e> <s> that is the issue before us it is not whether we believe in this or that section of the bill <e> <s> we are trying to decide whether it is possible to implement part vii of the bill by st april <e> <s> i should like to join the people who are absolutely convinced that that is impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in this country we are very lucky to have an enormous amount of voluntary service given to hospitals <e> <s> although it is argued that it is difficult to consult the community does she further agree that consulting voluntary associations which work in hospitals such as the leagues of hospital friends the wrvs and the red cross would give a very good overall view of the feelings of the community <e>"]
