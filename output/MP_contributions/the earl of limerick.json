["<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would be kind enough to allow me to comment on that point because it is rather fundamental <e> <s> there are strong accounting conventions which are enforced by the auditing profession which would prevent the thing which the noble lord lord lever of manchester has premised that is that the disclosed results of one of the banks which is subject to the schedule exemptions would not run counter to the trend of profits <e> <s> in a year in which they had actually done worse they would never disclose a higher result or <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my voice to the others that have been already heard raised in admiration of the two maiden speeches this afternoon from my noble friend lord airlie and from my noble colleague if i may so describe him lord chandos sitting opposite <e> <s> i hope that the style of oratory we <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord bruce sits down i do not know whether he heard the whole of my speech but as a fellow accountant will he address himself to the question that i raised which was that the directors of banking companies should have at least the same discretion as the directors of manufacturing trading or commercial companies in assessing the value of their stock in trade namely in this case their loan portfolio and should have the same ability to convince their auditors of a proper valuation of that stock <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord bessborough has initiated a very timely discussion which might usefully have the effect of eliciting whether the political will is really emerging on both sides of the channel to enable real work to start on a channel crossing <e>", "<cs> my lords conventional wisdom has it that no back bench speech should attempt to make more than three or four points <e> <s> as there are four points that i wish to make i shall not follow the noble lord lord kaldor down his interesting avenues apart from saying that i share his scepticism about the treasury analysis and also his view of the role which the service sector might play <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the house should thank the noble lord lord rhodes for giving us the opportunity to talk about the important relationships between this country and the peoples republic <e> <s> i should like to start with a perspective of change between my first visit accompanying edmund dell then secretary of state for trade in august and my last visit in july last year and to deal not in facts and figures but more in impressions and aspirations <e> <s> what does one notice <e> <s> one notices now that per cent <e> <s> of the people are dressed casually but smartly in cotton shirts and trousers or skirts with welcome flashes of colour from the ladies <e> <s> one sees no fewer bicycles but a vast increase in four-wheeled traffic capable of producing a traffic jam on the way to the great wall a traffic jam of coaches construction traffic and motor cars that would not disgrace any nation of the world <e> <s> one sees a great increase in general activity <e> <s> as for attitudes one finds people who are friendly intensely curious eager to learn and sometimes disconcertingly well-informed on points of detail <e> <s> as to realisation of scale it is a country in which every time you see a new moon you reflect that there is a net increase of two million in the population <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give a warm general welcome to this bill <e> <s> when i arrived here i had no idea that i should be in the majority in so doing <e> <s> in expressing what are essentially my own views i see the bill from two points of view <e> <s> the first is that of a practitioner although compared with the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord obrien i was a late starter <e> <s> i have for only years been concerned with the city as an accountant and as a banker <e> <s> i see it from the point of view of the deputy chairman of a city merchant bank <e> <s> i have to express my regret that on that account i may have to depart before this debate is concluded if it is protracted <e> <s> i see the city also from the point of view of a director of a listed though unconnected investment trust <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to support the procedural point made by my noble friend lord colville <e> <s> i believe in a complex matter of this nature that that is the only practical way to make progress <e>", "<cs> that would probably be for the convenience of the committee <e> <s> the proposed new clause that stands in my name is a probing amendment that is connected with the concerns felt by the securities and investments board <e> <s> indeed it has been the subject of some exploratory discussion between the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> certainly not <e> <s> that was the problem addressed by subsection <e> <s> i hope that there may be an acknowledgment of it to ensure that whatever regulations are introduced would have regard to the necessity to minimise such undesirable cross-subsidisation <e> <s> if no other noble lord wishes to comment on the amendment i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> before the movers of this amendment dispose of it i should like to pose one question <e> <s> i speak in a slightly schizophrenic frame of mind in that i have so to speak half an interest <e> <s> for a brief period i was a practising accountant but i ceased doing that in even longer ago than the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hacking has moved the second reading with his customary clarity and command of the subject for which we are grateful <e> <s> i rise to speak in support of the bill <e> <s> i have two messages <e> <s> one is that many of these matters about which comments have been made this afternoon are for examination in the select committee <e> <s> the second is that short speeches should be the order of the day <e> <s> i wish therefore feeling myself like roman gaul to be divided in looking at the subject in three parts to make some brief comments from these three points of view <e> <s> the first is the city commercial the second is the city corporate and the third is the city property holder <e>", "<cs> i share the misgivings of the noble lord lord tryon <e> <s> despite the characteristically persuasive and eloquent manner in which the noble lord lord hacking introduced the amendments there would be considerable difficulty in importing them into the bill <e> <s> i have the clearest recollection of debates in on the insurance companies amendment bill when very much the same issue was faced the definition of a fit and proper person and the rules for determining who was to be cleared through these procedures and how it would be done <e> <s> at that time i was driven to the conclusion that despite the obvious attraction of freedom of information and natural justice all principles to which we generally adhere the practicalities of how information is received and acted upon and the faith in which it is given become extremely difficult <e> <s> the effect of pushing matters to the extent suggested would be to deny to the regulators the very sources of information on which they are obliged to depend and that would govern their proper assessment of the suitability of these people <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite churlish on my part not to acknowledge with gratitude the very substantial response to the points which i raised at the committee stage <e> <s> i find myself in some difficulty <e> <s> the points that i then raised were inspired as i freely acknowledged by the sib <e> <s> the sib has expressed itself content with the proposals from the government <e> <s> there are however other regulatory organisations the committee of london and scottish bankers isro and the stock exchange which are less wholly enamoured of these proposals and all for the basic reason that they continue to be concerned on the question of cross-subsidisation and the impact that it would have on their businesses and on their competitiveness <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the response <e> <s> given the assurance of my noble and learned friend i would naturally have no intention of proceeding with the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish merely to say that the intervention of my noble friend is extremely welcome <e> <s> it recognises the point that in the absence of the provisions that he has described to us we should have been denying the city the ability to operate competitively in an international field which is intensely competitive and where in the absence of these provisions there is a high probability that the business in question would have gone to other centres <e> <s> i greatly hope that these discussions will lead quickly and smoothly to an agreement on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought for a moment that we were back on second reading when as i recall in the course of a general welcome to this bill from all parts of the house points such as that raised in this amendment were covered <e> <s> having a little experience of the way in which questions of the nature put out in the new dewe rogerson survey are posed in the way in which they are answered i would take leave to doubt whether all of the respondents were fully <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps symbolic that we should be considering the passage of this bill on this day <e> <s> in order that silence from this quarter of the chamber be not mistaken for indifference it would be right to reflect gratitude to my noble friends on the front bench and the officials concerned for the great help that has been given in considering the extremely complex issues raised before the house <e>", "<cs> i have no objection <e> <s> i shall wish to make my own observations when we come to amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> this is a probing amendment and of course i have no intention of pressing it <e> <s> i am somewhat reassured by his words but only somewhat because they do not really address the question <e> <s> my question was this <e> <s> if the bank of england does not insist which of course it will not on such appointments where they are not appropriate and if it has no power which it might wish to have to insist upon it in cases where they would be appropriate on a holding company board would it not be better to spell out that power as provided in my amendment <e> <s> i should like to leave that question with my noble friend for further consideration because i do not think that his reply informative though it was gave the answer to that point <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment if that is his intention concerning net assets may i ask whether it would not be the case that to use that definition of net assets would mean including loan capital together with capital and reserves among the amounts to be determined <e> <s> that would have the opposite effect from the one that i thought he was examining namely whether the amount written into the bill was an adequate amount <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make this comment <e> <s> having once witnessed a run on a bank in the middle east which was precipitated by the merest rumour totally without foundation and knowing as we do that market places can become very nervous although not we hope as nervous as that in this country i find the explanation of my noble friend in relation to amendment no quite convincing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good that the question put by the noble lord lord hunter has given us the opportunity already this evening to hear five extremely well constructed speeches on this important topic <e> <s> i greatly enjoyed listening to them and cannot disagree with a single word said <e>", "<cs> in speaking for the first time on this bill perhaps i may express my regret that i was unable to he present on second reading <e> <s> i speak very briefly in support of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am seeking clarification <e> <s> i was wholly with my noble friend lord strathclyde on the reasoning which led him to prefer the wording in <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate on polytechnics is timely and for that we are beholden to the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> i must declare an interest as chairman of the board of governors of the city of london polytechnic one of the five inner london polytechnics formerly supported by the inner london education authority <e> <s> i have held the position for five years and thus have been closely involved in a rather protracted transitional phase during which we lost progressively the top-up and completive funding from the ilea <e> <s> over a three-year period our funding was reduced by around per cent <e> <s> in real terms with the concomitant necessity to reduce both teaching and non-teaching staff likewise by per cent <e> <s> payroll accounted for almost per cent <e> <s> of our budget <e> <s> non-payroll expenditure was cut even more severely <e> <s> one can only be ashamed of the current state of provision of books in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords it is helpful that my noble friend lord boardman has given us a chance to address this wide subject this afternoon <e> <s> i wish to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord de la warr on an interesting and thoughtful speech <e> <s> we look forward to hearing his future contributions <e>"]
