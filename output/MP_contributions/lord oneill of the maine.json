["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is aware that this question has been going on now for many years <e> <s> this is the main road from london to southampton <e> <s> vast articulated lorries go hurtling down what was originally a roman road the a <e> <s> all that is required is about miles of dual carriageway to join the end of the m to the northern end of the winchester by-pass <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has been some alarm and despondency in the ulster office in the last few weeks because nobody knew who the new director was going to be and that is what led to rumours that the government were considering the possibility of closing down the office <e> <s> the northern ireland office does a marvellous job in new york and i hope we shall continue to have a thriving office in london as indicated in the noble lords reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all owe a great debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord hill for raising this subject <e> <s> i am only sorry if i may say so that not more of your lordships are present to follow something which is so important as the noble lord lord boothby said to every man and woman in this country in fact it is not only more important but rather more understandable than the debate which we heard earlier today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that what the noble lord lord blease has said is perfectly correct <e> <s> it seems quite wrong to me that a body which has worked extremely well on a non-sectarian nonpolitical basis should be treated in this manner <e> <s> if it is all right for wales and scotland to have sports councils why should not northern ireland continue to have one with executive functions <e> <s> it has been a most successful body <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will reconsider the situation and see whether it is not possible to allow the sports council to continue in its present position and with its present powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make just a very few remarks as i think we are probably coming to the end of this debate <e> <s> the most heartening thing i heard from the noble lord the minister was that he hoped to be coming back to your lordships house to agree additional expenditure for industrial development <e> <s> at a time when everything is being cut down everywhere i was heartened by those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister say whether the present very successful and excellent tickets for old-age pensioners which i should think would be useful to members of your lordships house will be continued in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware how tragic it is for people like the noble lord lord blease who played such a large part as secretary of the northern ireland trade unions in his day to see the industries which were attracted to northern ireland in the fifties and sixties slowly slipping away today <e> <s> is the northern ireland office also aware how unfortunate it is with the divisions which exist in the province that these divisions should be added to by constantly rising unemployment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord banks has said and also to declare an interest <e> <s> i think that the feeling in the insurance industry is that it is not being treated in the same way as other companies <e> <s> as i understand it the banks were originally in the same position as the insurance industries now find themselves in and they in fact have had their situation straightened out <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one small point about which i should like to inquire <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now about years since i invited mr sean lemass to come and visit me in belfast <e> <s> one of the things we discussed at that meeting was the possibility of running our electricity power systems together in some way <e> <s> as a result of those discussions it was eventually decided that there should be an inter-connector set up between the two electricity systems and i remember being told by the chairman of the northern ireland electricity board as it was in those days about years ago that the situation would be reached when there would be a point of no return and that the two electricity systems would be so joined together that they could not be separated <e> <s> needless to say shortly before that event arrived the ira blew up the inter-connector and i have forgotten how many times they have blown it up since with the result that those excellent suggestions discussed years ago have not come into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to say anything and i apologise to the noble earl for not having told him that i was going to speak <e> <s> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i am fired off by the tragic closure of enkalon the final closure apparently of enkalon last night <e> <s> i remember so well being approached by a senior official in the then ministry of commerce <e> <s> i came from that area and i was asked whether i would help with the arrival of a new dutch factory which i was told would be of great advantage to the country around antrim <e> <s> so the closure is tragic <e> <s> i and the noble lord lord blease can remember well princess beatrix coming over from holland to declare the factory open <e> <s> we thought it was going to be marvellous for that district <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to start by congratulating the noble earl the minister on the span and width of his speech <e> <s> i have not previously heard speech quite like that one from the front bench in your lordships house <e> <s> i welcome it and i agree with the noble lord lord blease that it was very wise of the minister to speak in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down what i was intending to ask was whether the secretary of state would consider publishing the noble earls opening remarks as a pamphlet <e> <s> i have never heard the situation in northern ireland better described and so many people have come up to me in the corridors and suggested that a further publication should be made <e> <s> perhaps the secretary of state would give this serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say when it is hoped that the m may be completed in view of the fact that it leads to the important port of southampton <e>", "<cs> my lords will the inquiry include the possibility of developing an airport in the north of england <e> <s> there are many gateways across the atlantic into america <e> <s> must everything come to london <e> <s> could it not for instance go to manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships house long because my noble friend lord chelwood has really made my speech for me <e> <s> what i hope will happen is that some publicity will be given to the astonishing figures that my noble friend lord chelwood produced about the feelings on proportional representation held by noble lords sitting on this side of the house <e> <s> it is an astonishing figure and i hope that some publicity will be given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to welcome the fact that my noble friend lord whitelaw has become our new leader <e> <s> we are most fortunate in this <e> <s> when the history of these times comes to be written i believe it will be granted that no one made a greater effort to achieve something in northern ireland than he did <e> <s> it is not his fault that he did not succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great pleasure in supporting the motion and i hope it will be passed with a large majority <e> <s> i recently had the good fortune to attend the assemble nationale in paris <e> <s> i was surprised to find that i was sitting next to a television camera <e> <s> it was completely silent not a sound came from it <e> <s> there did not seem to be any extra lighting in the chamber and there was certainly no extra heat <e> <s> it is therefore obvious that these things can be arranged <e> <s> the prime minister m mauroy opened the debate and the camera focused on him as he spoke for nearly one hour <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the importance of this depot to the excellent country town of ballymena in terms of both the life of the town and employment there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he appreciates that the australians whose coinage does not differ all that much from ours have produced a golden dollar which i now have in my hand which is easily distinguishable from the rest of their coinage <e> <s> it seems a pity that we did not follow in their footsteps <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual in a debate of this kind i find myself in complete or very nearly complete agreement with the noble baroness lady burton <e> <s> nobody in your lordships house knows more about these matters than she does and i am sure that the noble lord the minister will take note of what she said <e> <s> to an ordinary person who is not an expert it seems that the expansion of heathrow and the second runway at gatwick would be the main ways of dealing with the problems which lie ahead <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is not here because i have frequently heard him in the past few years advocating a second runway at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be very brief partly because of the lateness of the hour and partly because i have the tail-end of a cold <e> <s> i should like as usual to support the noble lord lord blake under whose chairmanship i had the honour to serve first of all on the hansard committee some nine years ago and then on other committees and also as a member of the conservative association for electoral reform <e> <s> in my view proportional representation in some form will come to this country before the end of the century <e> <s> let us hope it will not come too late <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the excellent statement and i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> might this not be a good moment to have a review of security arrangements in the palace of westminster <e> <s> perhaps because i come from an area where these things are most important i have sometimes noticed a certain lack <e> <s> it is a very difficult question <e> <s> i have discussed it with black rod <e> <s> but perhaps the minister or his right honourable friend could consider the possibility of having a review of security as it exists in the palace of westminster today <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in the debate most of the ground has already been covered but i should like to add a few words <e> <s> like everyone else i am most grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for giving us this opportunity of considering this problem <e> <s> i have no doubt that before too long all deliberations in the palace of westminster will be televised <e> <s> i am glad to think that your lordships house has shown the way <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless those of us who have attended prime ministers question time and have seen how the prime minister has to shout to make herself heard must question whether the way we deliberate is perhaps not a little superior <e> <s> if i may mention the question of ministerial statements i appreciate the arrangements which have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that those of us who live on the bournemouth line and have the opportunity of going north from london and even more west from london are astonished by the comfort of the carriages and the smoothness of the rails whereas on this particular line in order to achieve the laudable objective of southampton in minutes we have to be rattled along on old rolling stock and on rails which are far from smooth <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the great importance of cigarette manufacture to northern ireland and the difficulty of the firms existing there in maintaining employment if they are subjected to what may be unfair competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> however i sometimes wonder whether the government appreciate that this magnificent building is at the heart of the commonwealth <e> <s> are the government aware that tourists are surprised to see a black tower emerging from a beautiful honey-coloured gothic building <e>"]
