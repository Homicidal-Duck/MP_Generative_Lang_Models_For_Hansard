["<cs> my lords today is the second occasion on which i have made a maiden speech in this chamber <e> <s> this is far from being an unique experience <e> <s> anyone who has come up to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords who have taken part in the debate which started four-and-a-half hours ago <e> <s> i should especially like to thank the noble lord lord colnbrook for his excellent maiden speech in which he gave us all an object lesson by demonstrating his old chief whip skill of how to be succinctly authoritative <e> <s> i also took much pleasure from the speech of the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> he began i thought by rebuking the noble baroness lady blackstone for having played party political ping-pong in her speech instead of applying an objective analysis to the subject <e> <s> he then went on to generalise it <e> <s> i thought her speech was a striking one <e> <s> however he then proceeded in the most entertaining way to make more party political points than i have ever heard made in any speech since i joined the house <e> <s> nevertheless it was a most enjoyable performance <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recollect that the statement is predicated on announcing a remarkable increase of per cent <e> <s> in the prison population over the past year <e> <s> the statement then points out that this is in no way related to any increase in the rate of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that when i was first home secretary just over years ago i rashly tried to solve this problem but with no more success than he has achieved <e> <s> however there did appear to be very considerable support for a fixed easter among the anglican communion and also in the roman catholic church <e> <s> as the noble earl has informed us it is the greek church that has raised difficulties <e> <s> are there not precedents where christian festivals are celebrated on different days in the greek church to the western church <e>", "<cs> my lords as we were assured by the minister on monday that there was no difference within the government on exchange rate policy as the prime minister has stated that it is ineffective and wrong to resist market forces in this field and as the chancellor of the exchequer is in washington trying to resist those market forces with the other members of the group of seven can the noble lord tell us on what basis the government do intervene in exchange rate markets the foundation of this question to what purpose and for what objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a convention of fairly recent date that your lordships house does not destroy major bills which have the weight of an elected government behind them at least i should perhaps add today so long as that government are able to preserve their normal majority in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should do so with pleasure <e> <s> however i do not think that i could easily reply to the noble lord without making an intervention which was even more in the nature of a speech than was his <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the sympathy and hope which have already been so well expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that recent developments have put building societies in a very difficult position <e> <s> as the noble lord indicated becoming a plc means going through a difficult process which may well not succeed <e> <s> if building societies do not become plcs they will not be in the right position <e>", "<cs> my lords we greatly look forward to the three maiden speeches being made today all by those who have names honoured in this house and in history <e> <s> the noble earl lord lytton who is to follow me has i understand very considerable expertise in this field as a valuer and surveyor <e> <s> i look forward to his contribution and to the others <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reinforce the remarks of the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble and learned lord approached this matter with general sympathy <e> <s> he raised two technical objections to the amendment one of which i found slightly difficult to follow but i am very happy to accept his view that there may be drafting deficiencies in it <e>", "<cs> needless to say i listened most carefully with fluctuating hope and disappointment to the speech of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am bound to say that the shafts of hope were fairly limited and that the disappointment began substantially to predominate before he reached the end <e> <s> throughout he expressed a very narrow approach to academic freedom <e> <s> he did not deploy any significant arguments against why one of the amendments before us today should be accepted without doing any possible harm <e> <s> he did not very adequately explain the powerful point made by the noble lord lord beloff who said that we were exactly here in october or november <e> <s> why has it taken so long to make virtually no progress <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that while in general i share his views against economic chauvinism and am in favour of the advantages of both inward and outward investment i regret his decision not to let the monopolies and mergers commission have a look at this case <e> <s> apart from the issues raised by the special problem of a bid from a protected and therefore unequal base consideration must also be given to the fact that as we move toward this country with its desirably open economy may be peculiarly open to predatory bids from outside the community by people who wish to establish a position here <e> <s> does his decision today and the way in which he has put it forward mean that now the only criterion for referring a bid to the monopolies and mergers commission is market share and the effect of that quantitative share upon the competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government recently considered joining the ems as <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in intervening i find it more difficult to strike the correct balance between interlocutor and respondent than on any question i have asked or answered in either house over years <e> <s> may i interrogatively assure her that the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware if that is the more acceptable form that the university of oxford looks forward to being able by its own efforts to overcome the austerity imposed upon it by the government in time for the prime minister if she is so minded i hope after consultation with the university to appoint even the noble lord lord st john of fawsley to one of those high posts <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that government help has been almost entirely directed towards replanting <e> <s> there is a prior need for clearing up the damage on the ground <e> <s> many people in the absence of assistance have been unable to afford to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords why must the responsibility for clearing up obviously rest with the individual owner as the minister has just said whereas there can be assistance with replanting <e> <s> that is by no means a self-evident proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not only to support the case most powerfully put by the noble lord lord swann but also to make an appeal to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor before his winding up speech <e> <s> like many other noble lords i have a great regard for the legal authority and scottish integrity of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> however on the occasion of the amendment in my name which was carried at committee stage to which the noble lord lord swann referred i was deeply disappointed by the speech of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it was one factor which determined me to ask the committee to divide on that issue <e> <s> i am very glad that i did so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor back to a point he made earlier in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords surely i may ask the noble and learned lord a question on his speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord swann made what to my mind was a devastating quotation from mr robert jackson implying that the days of inquiry for the sake of the pursuit of knowledge were over <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor referred to that and said in an intriguing phrase that that was <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i agree with him that the massive nature of our reserves and overseas assets make an apparently qualitative difference compared with the position in the s and early s <e> <s> nonetheless will he bear in mind the dramatic experience of the united states in the s which showed that with remarkable speed a country can turn itself from being the biggest creditor in the world to being the biggest debtor in the world <e> <s> will he therefore avoid being too complacent about the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it was entirely because the government had to ask for a postponement and not because representations were made that they had to change at some considerable inconvenience from next tuesday which had long been a date in the diaries of many noble lords most concerned <e> <s> that was inconvenient but it might have been tolerable had the noble lord been able to negotiate an alternative date <e> <s> however as i understand it the convenience of the commons received total priority over the problems of this house <e> <s> will the noble lord bear in mind that to be an even-handed leader he should give regard to the rights of this house as well as to the convenience of the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also express my gratitude to the noble lord for repeating the statement and express our welcome for the splendid last few weeks of the german six-month presidency <e> <s> can we now be assured that the prime minister is not merely acquiescing dismissively in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that having been home secretary without responsibility for broadcasting in the s and having been home secretary with responsibility for broadcasting in the s i perhaps slightly predictably prefer the latter position <e> <s> under the first arrangement the postmaster-general a relatively junior minister was responsible for the technical side leaving the wider responsibility to the prime minister of the day who perhaps preferred political considerations <e> <s> will the minister accept that the home office is better placed to give attention to <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord cledwyn in congratulating all <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that while we greatly welcome the turkish state visit today and recognise the importance of turkey as a bastion of nato <e> <s> there is nonetheless room for considerable caution about her membership of the european community <e> <s> does he not recognise that when the european commission to which he attaches omniscience almost with bated breath was considering the spanish and portuguese applications it was accepted that there were three criteria which ought to be fulfilled the desire to join the community to be a democracy and to be a european country <e> <s> does he not agree that there is room for doubt as to how many of those three qualifications are fulfilled by turkey <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur in what the noble lord lord swann said earlier except for one point i do not think that he should apologise for having caused trouble on this matter <e> <s> any trouble that he has caused has been very well worth while <e> <s> i agreed with the noble lord lord beloff when he pointed out that words in speeches are not as good as language in statutes <e> <s> we are therefore grateful that there is some statutory language before us on this important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord lord hailsham on only one point <e> <s> it is quite irrelevant that he did not raise the matter on second reading <e> <s> he raised the broad issue in a letter to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind following the supplementary question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the fact that the hotel industry makes an important contribution to the balance of payments does not mean that one wants to see many public buildings converted into hotels <e> <s> if that is going to be the criterion there is an even better riverside site on this side of the river <e>", "<cs> my lords although i never witnessed lord pearts leadership of this house i sat with him in the house of commons for years and in cabinet with him for seven years <e> <s> i think i can therefore claim to have known him fairly well over a substantial chunk of his life <e>", "<cs> my lords following my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> can the minister assure us that the government and in particular the prime minister welcomed the appearance of monsieur jacques delors at the trades union congress the terms in which he spoke and the reception which he received <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to support the motion which has been so wisely moved and so agreeably propounded by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> i also join with enthusiasm in congratulations to the two noble lords who have moved and seconded the address <e> <s> that enthusiasm is however tempered with a sense of the presumptuousness of my attempting to play a senior role in this house <e> <s> at the beginning of the last session i had not even taken my seat yet last week i found myself one of a commission for prorogation and this week i am attempting to be a prefect welcoming the new boys <e> <s> however i comfort myself that the noble viscount lord whitclaw had an even more meteoric rise five years ago when he was precipitated straight to the headmastership and achieved remarkable success in that role <e>", "<cs> my lords having attempted yesterday something of a short <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think that m delors my successor whom i regard as a good and powerful president of the commission exaggerated when he used that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that it is highly desirable not only that the map should remain in this country but that it should remain at hereford with which it has long historical associations and where it is far more likely to be seen and to arouse interest than if it went into some general collection <e>", "<cs> my lords if the cathedral is the custodian and not the owner how is it able to sell the map <e>", "<cs> my lords while awaiting the results of this research am i right in recollecting that earlier in her replies the noble baroness attempted to restore confidence in the industry by saying that nine eggs in were probably safe <e> <s> did she really mean to say that there was one chance in of catching salmonella poisoning from eating an egg <e> <s> if that is not the case would she like to correct it before it causes further difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords we all grateful to the noble lord lord blake whose absence from the list of heads of houses in the past four terms leaves such a substantial gap in the university of oxford for raising this apposite and timely debate <e> <s> he has confined himself to man-made beauty and i shall largely follow him in that although few will deny that god-made beauty today faces a new wave of menace <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for his comprehensive reply as i thank the other noble lords apart from myself who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lords lord greenhill and lord bridges for the expertise and experience that they brought <e> <s> i am also grateful for the gracious remarks which were made by the noble earl lord bessborough and by the noble baroness lady young <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why he measures comparative growth which is favourable for the government <e> <s> with absolute confidence but says that absolute levels between countries are shrouded in the miasma of obscurity <e>", "<cs> my lords is it reasonable or proper that when a piece of government legislation proves profoundly unpopular the government should greatly step up the expenditure of public money on propaganda in its favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is indisputable that this country has one of the most secretive traditions and systems of government to be found anywhere in the democratic world <e> <s> i do not believe that that results in a greater degree of efficiency or even immunity from spy and disclosure scandals in this country than in others <e> <s> however clearly the responsibility for that tradition and practice does not rest entirely with the present administration <e> <s> it was built up over many years <e> <s> it began with the act which was carried by a conservative administration and then came the ill-considered act which was of course by a liberal administration in the asquithian heyday <e> <s> none of the five labour governments who held office up to carried through any effective amending legislation <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord however i specifically said that this amendment differs in three ways from the commons amendment <e> <s> it is not enough for the individual to think that there may have been misconduct <e> <s> misconduct has to be shown to have existed <e> <s> it cannot be a matter of opinion <e> <s> it has to be a matter of reality <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the leader of the house has deployed his case most forcefully and skilfully <e> <s> nonetheless it does not meet the doubts which i have in my mind <e> <s> he talks as though this would be a charter for disloyal civil servants encouraging them to leak information in almost all circumstances <e>", "<cs> the position of chief secretary to the treasury is an important one <e> <s> i hesitate to say that there is an even more important position in the treasury but no doubt that will be taken into account by some members of the committee <e> <s> however what is undoubtedly the case is that the climate as regards leaking has changed enormously in this country from the period which i remember when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was a minister <e> <s> i was immensely struck the other day by reading in the memoirs of lord plowden how that great debate raged in the government in about whether or not the pound should be allowed to float <e> <s> the noble lord lord jay will recall what the scheme was called <e>", "<cs> yes it was the robot scheme <e> <s> the debate went on passionately for six months but nothing was ever leaked <e> <s> if that had happened in the present government or in one or two preceding governments we would have known all about the affair within hours <e> <s> it would be resounding from wapping to the house of commons and from whitehall to the house of lords <e> <s> it would be all over the place immediately <e> <s> there is a different climate nowadays and to be honest it is the case that ministers are responsible for most leaks <e>", "<cs> my lords the general case for this amendment has been most powerfully and persuasively made by the noble lord lord mishcon and by my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i intervene briefly to make a single adjacent point <e> <s> this amendment is even more tightly drafted than the equivalent amendment that i moved in committee <e> <s> i was struck when i moved that amendment by the solidity with which the benches opposite upheld the importance of secrecy in certain affairs of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with an apology to your lordships <e> <s> before this debate was arranged i had committed myself to address the all-party european group of the house of commons early this evening <e> <s> i thought that perhaps your lordships would permit me to discharge that during the course of the debate <e> <s> i should at least be able to achieve some economies of scale by making two speeches on the same subject on one afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as this day of all days we are being asked to think back over a -year span can the minister tell the house what has been the net debt reduction if any over the past years and what has been the consequent saving in interest to the taxpayer taking those years as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord chandos on having chosen this motion and also on the relevant and perceptive terms in which he phrased it and phrased his speech <e> <s> i should like to make a comment in a moment or two about his choice of the words national interest and cultural identity <e> <s> before i do that i should like to say a word or two about some of the interesting speeches that his motion has provoked <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is seriously the view of the government as the beginning of the noble viscounts last reply seemed to indicate that because we are fortunate enough in this country with the advantage of the united states in this regard as an ally to have triumphed over french as a world language it is reasonable to sit back and say everybody should speak english and we shall do nothing about speaking any other languages <e>", "<cs> my lords is it however on the whole the governments view that the bank of england should belong to the more independent group of central banks including the two mentioned by my noble friend lord ezra and the swiss federal bank or that it should incline to the group of more supine central banks of which the bank of france is the outstanding example <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what are the non-lethal arms which he believes would be appropriate to export from this country to iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of statistical interest what is the validity of previously planned <e> <s> can the minister tell us how the figures compare with what previously happened <e>", "<cs> my lords as in his original answer the noble lord referred to the generally constructive approach of the government towards europe can he tell us how officials are getting on with the somewhat intractable task which they were set after the madrid summit of preparing an alternative british plan for monetary union which <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord bruce of donington in congratulating the noble earl lord caithness on his promotion and in joining our debates on these matters <e> <s> i also found him a courteous replier for the department of the environment <e> <s> i have no doubt that he will carry over those qualities into his new department <e> <s> from the point of view of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree with the following point <e> <s> whatever small variations may be revealed in the autumn statement it is now clear that our deficit will be as bad as or worse than the worst achieved in relation to the size of the economy by the united states which was regarded as almost outside the bounds of possibility without sterling having the special qualities of the dollar to be able to finance such a deficit over a long period <e> <s> in view of his remarks about the part of investment in the budget which seems to be open to dispute will the noble earl also tell the house this <e> <s> is it the view of the government that the balance of payments has little to do with the government because it is the sum of a series of private decisions and may even be a sign of investment strength or that government measures are designed to deal with the balance of payments and that it is likely to improve in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that given that the home secretary has got this week of the year over it might be a peculiarly favourable period from the point of view of rational thought as opposed to political attitudinising <e> <s> will he not therefore encourage him to use the immediate aftermath in order to implement what is clearly the unanimous view of informed opinion all round the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm the governments position that they are resolved to enter a half-baked scheme when the time is right <e> <s> does he agree that the season of mellow fruitfulness is so long delayed that it is an almost certain receipe for getting an unsatisfactory and rather addled portion of this blackberry pie <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the leader of the house bear in mind that the matter should be seen in proportion <e> <s> for instance while mr benn for whom i hold no brief but whose diaries i have just finished reading goes into great detail about cabinet proceedings of years ago we had an example in the course of this year in which not within years but within hours the downing street press office briefed the press it manifestly so came to the effect that the secretary of state for wales whom i think was in particular disfavour at the time had not been called to participate in the cabinet discussions <e> <s> there was a grandstand commentary at the time upon cabinet proceedings <e> <s> those matters need to be seen in a certain perspective <e> <s> it does not fall strongly into the hands of noble lords opposite to throw not merely stones out of glasshouses but boulders out of crystal palaces <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscounts figures were very impressive but somewhat mystifying <e> <s> can he tell us who goes round measuring exactly how many illegal hours are spent by vehicles on yellow lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble earl for giving the house the benefit of a repeat of the statement <e> <s> i must say that the statement reveals a fairly sombre economic prospect with growth falling for as a whole to per cent <e> <s> with the normal margin of error that could put us right on the threshold of a technical recession <e> <s> inflation is to remain at nearly per cent <e> <s> even by the end of the next year <e> <s> interest rates remain cripplingly and isolatedly high to try to sustain an overvalued pound and bite the harder as profitability declines which it is doing at present and the companies sector deficit grows bigger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to support the motion which the noble lord lord cledwyn has moved with the combination of charm and wisdom which has become so much the hallmark of his leadership of the opposition if i may be permitted to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak to and indeed support the motion in the name of the noble lord lord williams of elvel which he moved in a most powerful speech <e> <s> your lordships will notice that i also have an amendment on the order paper which i propose to move after his amendment has been decided this evening but to which for the convenience of the house i shall devote part of my speech as did the noble earl lord caithness in opening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know exactly to what the noble lord is referring <e> <s> there may be cases in which there is excessive attention to detail by brussels though that can only have an impact if it is carried by the council of ministers <e> <s> the commission can do nothing on its own <e> <s> i am concerned with our attitude to the main few issues europes trading position in the world its place in dealing with money its place in political co-operation and increasingly its position in dealing with questions of ecology and the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move at the end of the address to insert but call on your majestys government to recognise how illusory are the benefits of economic sovereignty in an integrated world and urge that at this moment of flux and opportunity they should maximise british influence through full participation in all the activities of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl consider that his statement in reply to the previous question that any form of free vote would have to be arranged through the usual channels is almost equivalent to saying that any form of democracy would have to be arranged through the central committee of the communist party <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell us why the government are prepared to forecast the future course of inflation which they think may fall slightly and not the future course of unemployment which is at least as easy to forecast and which will no doubt rise somewhat <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some deaths of major public figures which are a special deprivation because of the sense of a career cut off in midstream with promise unfulfilled <e> <s> gaitskell macleod and crosland come immediately to mind <e> <s> and there are others where a life of rounded achievement has subsided and we perhaps feel more respect and admiration than shock or grief <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join with the noble lord lord cledwyn in thanking the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the statement to us <e> <s> the statement marks some changes of tone which was also apparently present in the prime ministers attitude in the council chamber at strasbourg <e> <s> the question is does it mark a change of substance as well <e> <s> that remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a remarkable statement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston indicated the government are prepared to overcome even their anti-nationalisation dogmatism in order to pursue what they regard as a higher dogmatism of pressing on with the bill which quite clearly commands virtually no support <e> <s> the banks regard it as undesirable and according to most <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second melancholy occasion within a few weeks that we have paid tribute to a departed lord chancellor <e> <s> gerald gardiner who was years older than lord elwyn-jones had not been recently among us in the way that lord elwyn-jones had been <e> <s> i do not think that i was ever present in this house with him but there was nonetheless a time when i had just as close an association with him <e>", "<cs> my lords without necessarily having enough old treasury feeling to be sure that one wants the central bank to go off on its own and without necessarily endorsing that point of view will the noble earl tell us how he pursues his argument that there cannot be independence for the central bank because the governments priority is to bring down inflation <e> <s> surely it is a striking and observable fact throughout the world that it is the countries with independent central banks germany switzerland and even the united states which have notably lower inflation rates than those with more dependent central banks <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble earl whether he can give us his guidance on one aspect of the governments handling of this matter that is troubling my mind <e> <s> we hear a great deal from the government these days about the need to defend the sovereignty of parliament against depredations from outside <e> <s> is it not also the case that the football membership scheme had almost no friends either in your lordships house or in another place but that the government were impervious to that and drove the provision through by whipped majorities <e> <s> we then had a chance and chance it was in that a lord justice of appeal was sitting because of the accident of a terrible tragedy <e> <s> the governments attitude is totally torpedoed by a lord justice of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> there now appears to be one central question and two subsidiary questions which arise from this very uneasy statement to which we have listened <e> <s> first is it not absolutely clear that a number of people in the public service knew perfectly well and have known for some years that what ministers were saying to parliament was untrue and that they did nothing about it and were therefore unlike <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept from me that while i am grateful for the solicitude of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham of saint marylebone he slightly misunderstands my concern <e> <s> it is not my reputation that i am concerned about <e> <s> i was not aware of any smears whether it was because i was not a big enough target or for other reasons that were directed at me <e>", "<cs> my lords what on earth does the minister mean in this context by new money <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that many of us will agree with him that there are great dangers and instability in the present <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> however except for the interesting description of his visit to glasgow i have no doubt to hillhead where the office is situated i do not think that he provided us with much that was new in the way of argument or information <e> <s> he based the greater part of his case on the fact that in his visit he found the student loans company to be working well <e> <s> i must say that ministerial visits can be useful for morale but in his place i would hesitate following a brief visit of this kind to pronounce ministerially upon the efficiency of the unit being set up <e> <s> i think that the noble earl may be unwise to place too much weight upon that visit before we see how the company performs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that many of the questions and criticism are made not against the management policy of british rail though undoubtedly there are some faults there but against the governments lack of a convincing overall transport policy <e> <s> in the circumstances in which almost the whole of the south-east is snarled up and where there is grave danger of such remaining areas of outstanding natural beauty as there are in southern england being concreted over will the government explain why they think that london almost unique among the great cities of the world can run an effective commuter transport system without subsidy from onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl agree that this government inherited a -year tradition of a strong invisible surplus as well as a -year tradition of a visible balance and that to have dissipated both these within four years when the oil is still flowing strongly is a remarkable achievement <e> <s> how does the minister square that with the economic miracle of the s <e>", "<cs> my lords a person winding up a debate in favour of the proposition is normally expected to have the opportunity to reply to the arguments which have been deployed against the bill <e> <s> my difficulty is that if there are to be arguments against the bill they will be put forward after i have spoken because they have not been mentioned thus far <e> <s> they may come from the noble lord lord underhill or from the minister of state but not i hope too strongly if at all from either of them <e> <s> but regarding those noble lords who spoke before me they have been unanimous in their cogency and in their support for the bill and they have been widely spread throughout the house <e>", "<cs> my lords surely he has power to initiate an application <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because i am not a great believer in second speeches <e> <s> i thank the minister for his reply which was courteous and detailed and up to a point comprehensive although from my point of view he devoted rather too much time to the question of why there was no prosecution i certainly never thought that the secretary of state had any alternative but to accept the advice of the two inspectors on this matter and substantially less time to the other issues particularly the issue of possible disqualification <e>", "<cs> my lords under mr lawson the government were forced to abandon shadowing the deutschmark <e> <s> while they hover on the brink of the exchange rate mechanism now into its th year can the noble earl say whether the government have an exchange rate policy <e> <s> if so will he tell us what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl has said is it because the government favour a strong exchange rate policy that the pound has weakened by about per cent <e> <s> in the past few months <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us regard the suggestion that the soviet occupation of lithuania in - was crucial to the allied victory in world war ii is as far fetched as the comparison between hitler in - and mr gorbachev today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while it is highly desirable that we should improve our british linguistic qualifications which alas are not high in my experience by far the most distinguished british diplomat of my generation judged by posts held and results achieved was almost as bad a linguist as myself <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the change of tone of this statement compared with some other post-summit communiques is greatly to be welcomed <e> <s> if to achieve that it is necessary that there should be tilting at windmills or pretending that the monarchy must be defended i am not sure that the spanish dutch belgian or danish monarchies are greatly in favour of winding themselves up or that even the president of france is in favour of losing his status as head of state as a smokescreen for a change of tone so be it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the problem which is to some extent a real problem does not exist at the most senior level <e> <s> it hardly could as britain has had one out of the only two secretaries general of the commission and two out of the last three directors general ofdg the external affairs directorate <e> <s> the problem exists much more at a level and below which is the rough equivalent of the assistant secretary or under-secretary level in our terms <e> <s> in order to meet this need one has to have people anxious to make a career in the service of the commission <e> <s> the position is not greatly helped if the commission is constantly represented sometimes by her majestys government themselves as being an inflated group of interfering busy-bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the conservatism of the labour party never fails to astonish me <e> <s> will he agree that there is a substantial distinction between the operations of the bank of england as a regulator of the city to which the noble lord lord bruce referred and the functions of the bank as regards inflation and dealing with monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a great believer in second speeches particularly now that the hour has reached its present point <e> <s> as the debate took a constructive and non-polemical tone which i hoped it would i do not propose to reply to the ministers second speech <e> <s> it was sometimes a little more polemical than his first speech but we thank him very much for the two speeches <e> <s> i therefore confine myself to thanking the noble lords who apart from the government spokesman took part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the sorrow and sympathy which have been so appropriately and poignantly expressed by the noble lords lord cledwyn and the leader of the house <e> <s> the house feels an exceptional sense of collective loss <e> <s> yesterday afternoon when the news of tom ponsonbys death came through there was an almost physical atmosphere of deprivation and dismay in the corridors particularly those which he most frequented such as i have never known before in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that while she has made general assertions and has denied the facts put forward by noble baronesses on this side of the house she has not provided one single piece of hard evidence to controvert anything that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up the question of the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i do not agree with him on all issues but i do on this one <e> <s> what would be the noble earls advice <e> <s> to a motorist proceeding at approximately mph in the outer lane when overtaken in the middle lane by a great lorry thundering along at nearly mph and throwing up a great spray <e> <s> should that motorist go to mph to overtake the lorry or not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have rarely heard a more irrelevent bombardment than that with which he sought to divert attention from the detailed questions put to him by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> is he further aware that across that broad segment most concerned with business and industry the transactions of the government are assuming an increasing habit of sleaziness <e> <s> will he also reflect upon the likelihood that this may be an inevitable consequence of the elevation of the pursuit of mammon into a supreme god and its achievement as a state of grace <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist saying that as i was the only chancellor of the exchequer to achieve a surplus in years that remark is a little ill-directed <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who attended an early three and half summits of this series of group of seven summits perhaps i may thank the leader of the house for having repeated the statement <e> <s> three and a half is of course a puny record compared with the prime ministers record of attending of the <e> <s> the reason for the half as some noble lords with long memories may recollect is that i had a little difficulty in getting into the first of the four <e>", "<cs> my lords i associate my noble friends with the motion which has been so excellently moved <e> <s> i notice looking back at the <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the original question which may be a slight relief to the minister i accept that it is a good thing that we should be top of the table with denmark <e> <s> germany is third <e> <s> however will the minister accept i tried to deal with these infractions for four years that the poor performance of countries such as italy is due much more to a traditionally weak infrastructure of government than to ill will or hypocrisy and that it is on the whole desirable that we would show a certain understanding of such problems <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the government can be accused of many things in relation to the erm but hardly of the diktat of government rather the total confusion and disarray of government <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the noble lord mean when he says that he cannot answer for other countries in the european community <e> <s> he and his ministerial colleagues are constantly trotting out comparisons when they happen to think they are favourable to the government whether yesterday or the day before about the number of directives implemented by different countries or about inflation rates or growth rates when the figures were favourable long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes take the view that your lordships house is entitled to assert itself more than is welcome to the government business managers <e> <s> i do so in particular at a time when centres of countervailing power are thin on the ground in this almost uniquely arrogant and incompetent government <e> <s> i do not however take the view that we should contemplate interfering in a finance bill <e> <s> although it is nearly years since i wrote a little book called <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise one point on business of which i have informed the noble lord the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord jenkins whom i did not see rise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin again <e> <s> i wish briefly to raise one point on business of which i have informed the leader of the house <e> <s> i do so before we disperse after this long hot july but without wishing to take too portentously the last rows of summer which have always been a certain feature of this stage in our parliamentary year <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord caithness for the succinctness and dignity of his speech in opening the debate this afternoon <e> <s> a redeeming feature of this long drawn out but menacing crisis is the remarkable degree of consensus which so far has been achieved and preserved in this country and in the united nations <e> <s> consensus is not one of the prime ministers favourite words but with a few exceptions she has done little to upset it <e> <s> mr hurd in giving the foreign secretaryship a higher profile than we have been used to seeing under this government has played a notable role in maintaining it <e> <s> so has mr bush <e> <s> we are lucky to have him in the white house or even in kennebunkport if he is not in the white house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will accept that i with a certain proprietary interest in the matter gratefully welcome the decision <e> <s> when hesitation has become a way of life <e>", "<cs> my lords there now seems to be general agreement in this house that the announcement that has been made is welcome and that your lordships have not been left to learn about it entirely from the conservative party conference <e> <s> as that is due entirely to the initiative of my noble friend lord tordoff in asking this private notice question will not the leader of the house consider whether he should withdraw <e> <s> it really was an intolerably portentious rebuke of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord apply himself to the point that i put to him and not to an entirely different point <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos in thanking the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> i can at least agree on the importance of the uruguay round and the duty of the community quickly to table a satisfactory negotiating offer which it has not yet done <e> <s> perhaps i may observe in passing that the difficulties associated with the cap are a year-old monument to the disadvantages for this country of not fully participating in the formative stages of european enterprises <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion of the noble lord lord cledwyn and to endorse his felicitous words about the mover and the seconder of the motion for a humble address <e> <s> i sat in the house of commons for many years with the noble lord lord kimball <e> <s> indeed my memory goes back to when i spoke against him at the by-election in the lincolnshire wolds in when if my memory is correct my noble friend lord walston was the labour candidate <e> <s> the noble lord lord kimball was thereafter always a forthright and respected spokesman on broad acres and rural values which did not fail to embrace the virtues of hunting <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i do not wish the amendment in my name on the order paper in any way to pre-empt the debate which we shall have on monetary and political union on nd november <e> <s> i regard it as vital that your lordships house should have a full and reflective debate on the most valuable report produced by the committee presided over by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble lord dismiss the latin currency union which persisted from to and which included france belgium switzerland italy and greece <e>", "<cs> rose to move at the end of the address to insert but regret that your majestys government persist in separating the single market from other european community initiatives notably a single currency
