["<cs> my lords during the early days of the last war a polish community was established in hereford <e> <s> although it is now greatly reduced in numbers this community has made a significant contribution to the life of the city of hereford and also to the rural area in which it lives <e> <s> the community still retains its links with poland and because it is in my diocese i am glad to support the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the intentions of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in re-introducing this bill <e> <s> your lordships will remember that when this house was considering the bill introduced by the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger the marriage enabling bill the bishops made it clear that their objection to that bill was that by removing all constraints on marriage based on affinity it proposed a solution which was too sweeping and which would be damaging in its consequences in eroding the delicate network of relationships within the family <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this report and hope that it will be very widely read and studied <e> <s> there are just two points that i would like to make <e> <s> the first is to bring to your lordships notice the difficulties that the small rural housing associations are experiencing in attracting grants and support for their projects <e> <s> here i must declare an interest as my diocesan council for social action set up our own housing association some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all too easy to criticise an organisation which has to accept the role of providing information or giving news and education as well as entertaining <e> <s> as has already been said by the noble lord we are very lucky in this country that the television we view is generally speaking of a high standard particularly in the education and information field <e> <s> but there are these two aspects in entertainment which cause very great concern particularly in the serials and the films which attract a far larger viewing audience than any other programmes <e> <s> these audiences may be composed of at least three generations sitting in the room at the same time <e> <s> the most important group is the group under whose experience of life is limited and who learn from television which becomes their main source of deriving what they are supposed to believe about adult behaviour and its views and attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords the churches are grateful to the noble lord lord oram for this debate because it will underline the crisis which exists and to which the publication <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord walston has already concentrated on africa <e> <s> i intend to do the same as that is the part of the third world with which i am most familiar <e> <s> the noble lord has also referred to the response of the british public to the famine in ethopia <e> <s> it has been quite remarkable <e> <s> by the end of last week the latest agency appeals for ethiopia had raised in the region of million <e> <s> the british public itself has given million since july <e> <s> for the last five months it has been giving million a month over and above normal aid donations for famine in africa <e> <s> there is a growing public response to the famine in africa petition launched by seven development agencies <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for what he has said <e> <s> our concern was that there should be some kind of guidelines about valuation on which there clearly might be confusion if there was different practice from one area to another <e> <s> in view of what the noble earl has said it is not the intention to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in the unavoidable absence of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london amendment no <e> <s> is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords are her majestys government aware that the appeal for assistance to mr waite to obtain the release of hostages from beirut came to the archbishop of canterbury at the request of the churches in the middle east and the presbyterian church of america <e> <s> further is the noble earl aware that appeals for help to the archbishop of canterbury are arranged through the extensive ecumenical and inter-faith network of which the anglican church is a part <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord kilmarnock i am glad that the word academic has been included in the debate <e> <s> your lordships will realise that the debate on the relationship between academic university clinical departments and their national health service colleagues is yet another reflection of a curious national characteristic <e> <s> it would seem that we always underestimate the value of academic expertise scientific inquiry and research carried on in our universities and other institutions <e> <s> we have an inbred suspicion that in academic research we are not getting value for money <e> <s> it always seems that we are giving our support and making available our financial resources to what is seen to be of benefit to our society in the short term and giving only lip service to the importance of those engaged in work and research that will be of benefit in the long term <e> <s> where financial resources are limited it is the former rather than the latter that receive the lions share of the resources available <e>"]
