["<cs> my lords i speak for the first time in your lordships house with a good deal of apprehension <e> <s> i know that maiden speeches should be non-controversial and i know that the subject of todays debate gives rise to strong feelings <e> <s> if what i say does likewise i apologise in advance i do not mean it to <e> <s> i shall need all your lordships traditional kindness <e> <s> at the outset i must make it clear that i hold a licence under the legislation to carry out animal experiments <e> <s> i am a physiologist and i teach medical students <e> <s> being also a university don i am forewarned having read a most helpful article by the noble lord lord ohagan that your lordships have no taste for lectures <e> <s> i shall do my best not to fall into that for me very familiar mode of address <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how glad i am that we can consider this report and how grateful we are to the noble lord lord sherfield for introducing it so clearly <e> <s> as the noble lord said the subject of the report is of the greatest importance to our future and that must be my excuse if i stray a little beyond the strictly european context of this discussion <e> <s> i am sure we should welcome this report <e> <s> its conclusions seem to me to be nicely balanced and it does not conceal many of the very real problems involved in this kind of jointly-funded european research <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to take no more than a few minutes of your time <e> <s> i should like to support the noble earl lord halsbury to whom we are all immensely grateful for the initiative that he has taken in this extremely difficult and controversial matter <e>", "<cs> i would like also if i may to add support to what the noble earl lord halsbury said and to express my thanks to the noble lord lord hill for the kind thoughts and memories he had of my father <e> <s> nearly a years work in the select committee went to creating this compromise and agreement that is embodied in the bill <e> <s> i would support the pleas that this bill should remain more or less as it stands at the moment <e> <s> i would especially ask the noble lord lord beaumont not to press his amendment to clause to leave out the advancement of knowledge <e> <s> as has been said this would strike at the very heart of the solution that the select committee achieved and it was a solution that was based on wide permitted purposes and close scrutiny of individual projects <e>", "<cs> i have on a previous occasion referred to the pain condition and at the risk of boring your lordships taking up the invitation of the noble earl lord halsbury i should like to say a few more words <e> <s> perhaps i should say first that i think the enduring pain is caused to guinea pigs in the present preparation of blackleg vaccine and not to horses though horses and cattle are subject to that particular disease i believe <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury has already asked the minister about the pain condition in the draft european convention <e> <s> in the bill before us and in particular in clause ultimate discretion is given to the secretary of state though the minister has said he would prefer an inviolable pain condition in any legislation <e> <s> in this respect i understand he deems that this bill is insufficiently rigid <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise nearly at the end of this timely and important debate to follow those who have spoken already who all have a very great deal more experience of either government or science or both than i have and they wield a very great deal more thunder <e> <s> i should like to add my tribute to the noble lord lord shcrfield who was chairman of the sub-committee <e> <s> it was for me an enjoyable and educative privilege to be a member of that sub-committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i was privileged to be a member of your lordships select committee and to take part in its work <e> <s> i add my tribute yet again to the skills and wisdom of our chairman the noble lord lord sherfield <e> <s> it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and i learnt a very great deal about an important and to a great extent hidden subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton has asked a very timely unstarred question and i think we are all grateful to him for doing so as indeed i am grateful to the noble lords lord zuckerman and lord auckland for the things that they have said about this in their speeches <e> <s> in his unstarred question lord houghton indicated that the government white paper had a mixed reception <e> <s> i do not think that that is in any way surprising in view of the very many interests that it had to satisfy <e> <s> i would have expected lord houghton to be critical of some of the proposals in the white paper although i had hoped and my hope was not unfounded that some of the proposals would meet with his approval <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should very much like to thank the noble lord lord trend and to congratulate him upon his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> it was everything that we might have expected and which i most certainly expected having sat with very great enjoyment under his wise chairmanship of the british museum trustees <e> <s> we are very lucky to have had the benefit of his speech this evening <e> <s> i am sure that i express the view of the whole house when i say that we would wish to hear him again very soon <e> <s> that he has chosen this debate in which to break his vow of silence indicates the seriousness of the issues that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for the opportunity to discuss this first joint report by the chairmen of acard and abrc <e> <s> we are grateful also to the two chairmen for their report which if it does not always make very cheerful reading is a clear statement of where we stand today <e> <s> among many important points it comments upon the dependence of technology on fundamental science and the reverse dependence that of fundamental science on technology <e> <s> again it mentions the long times the often very long times between basic discoveries and consequent shifts in technological advance <e> <s> these points are well worth making <e> <s> they are too often forgotten by high tech enthusiasts and even by scientists themselves especially when they search for support <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a university scientist and perhaps i should add that i have at the moment no formal connection with any of the research councils and so i have to speak from a general point of view without any very particular knowledge of the kind that we have had already from noble lords <e> <s> may i add my gratitude to the noble lord lord sherfield for bringing this debate to the house this afternoon and say that i agreed almost entirely with everything he said <e> <s> i have also to apologise to the house as i too have an engagement which i have not been able to avoid and i am afraid that i shall not be able to stay to the end of this important debate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations to those of the noble earl lord selkirk on the maiden speech that we have just heard <e> <s> we shall look forward to many more speeches from the noble viscount lord allenby of megiddo <e> <s> i know how delicate is the path of moderation in a maiden speech having made one of my own on this very topic eight years ago <e> <s> the noble viscount lord allenby seemed to me to have achieved that path with very great skill <e>", "<cs> may i say first of all how grateful i am to the noble lord the minister of state for having pre-empted so to speak <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which i very willingly withdraw <e> <s> i can say no more than what <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord somers i think that in some sense and certainly in the sense that it is put out even in the amended sense the decerebrate animal comes within the definition of living in this bill because it has an intact circulation one that is operating and it has not suffered a complete destruction of its brain <e> <s> the reason why i did not remove the word decerebration from the second part of the subsection was the operation of decerebration and i do not clearly wish the actual decerebration to be outside the operation of the act <e> <s> i only wish the animal to become outside the operation of the act when it has been decerebrated <e> <s> i am content to withdraw this amendment but i hope that what i have said about the teaching of medical students will be taken into account in any further guidelines or deliberations that may be made <e>", "<cs> it also seems to me that there will be many procedures under this bill if it becomes an act which do not require competence in the skills of anaesthesia analgesia or euthanasia <e> <s> these are quite mild procedures many of which are now licensed under the act <e> <s> it is necessary to have a licence to give particular diets or to keep an animal on restricted fluids for a period <e> <s> i do not see that it is sensible to require competence in the skills of anaesthesia analgesia or euthanasia for those people who do not need them for the project which they are to be allowed to carry out <e>", "<cs> faced with the greater guns of the european convention i do not propose to press this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to say that my point in raising it was not only because of my deep concern about the education of medical students and biologists which i believe begins in school and certainly in the sixth form but also to make the point that i would regard the secretary of states judgments and powers in this bill as entirely adequate to take care <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this amendment is ill-chosen on two grounds <e> <s> first inviolate is not the same as inviolable <e> <s> i am sorry to make a donnish point in this respect but inviolate in the <e>", "<cs> it would also make it difficult for research to be carried out on a number of virus diseases which are endemic among humans for example hepatitis b lasser fever and even aids <e> <s> these are diseases which certainly cause severe distress in animals but in order to investigate them and their course in humans it may be necessary to infect animals with them <e> <s> in that case anaesthesia would be inappropriate <e> <s> it may not specifically be a question of pain but it could well be construed as severe distress <e> <s> i would not wish to see this condition on the face of the bill if it prevented that kind of research <e>", "<cs> i had not directly considered the point about length of time <e> <s> some experiments under <e>", "<cs> an hour or hours conceivably hours but not longer than that so far as i know <e> <s> it would not be longer than the ordinary kind of terminal experiment to which animals are subject anyway <e> <s> from the point of view of lord melchetts question about keeping they would if kept be subject to just the same kind of regulations as they are when kept in a laboratory before being experimented on or before being subjected to a series of procedures <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reassurance <e> <s> on the understanding that it will be considered and the defects in my amendment put straight i shall be glad to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the arguments and especially the arguments of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i was delighted to see his conversion to the doctrine of the secretary of states discretion <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i expressed some doubt about this point on second reading but i have found the noble viscounts explanation entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i withdraw my hesitations because i feel that the clause as it stands would be a great deal better than the clause as the amendments suggest it should be <e>", "<cs> i find my particular concerns about the particular place that i mentioned not altogether allayed and i should like to ask whether the advice to the police with respect to especially sensitive institutions of that kind would be made public or at least would be available to the institutions concerned <e> <s> i think that in giving local advice to the local police forces it would be extremely important that the particular circumstances of the particular institutions should be made known and in a sense agreed between the institutions and the police <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on the issue of the length of time of the scientific work it is of course like a piece of string that is almost variously lengthened <e> <s> but on the issue of publication the period from the completion of a piece of scientific work to the appearance of a paper would be much more like a year very seldom would it be much longer than that <e> <s> of course a piece of work may have gone on and the project may have been allowed to proceed for longer than that <e> <s> i think it is also the case with regard to anything published in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i am partially reassured but i am beginning to learn of the very great complexities that exist in terms of the way in which public funds reach universities or sometimes do not reach universities <e> <s> i very much hope that in the relevant departments we shall see the effect of the generosity of the home office <e> <s> with that as i say partial reassurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords though this is not my amendment i should be perfectly content were the government to withdraw this amendment as it stands <e> <s> we could discuss the matter at greater length later on and possibly a more improved detailed version could be brought forward at third reading either by myself or by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> i am entirely happy with it and gladly beg leave to withdraw the present amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i repeat the thanks that i expressed to the noble lord the minister at report stage and say that the amendments as they stand now meet my points entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief but i cannot resist the temptation to say thank you on my own behalf and echo the thanks that have been given to all those who have taken part in this debate and also to the noble lord lord glenarthur for his <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been anticipated already by the noble lord lord stanley and the noble earl lord selborne i want this evening to say something about the relationship between agricultural research and environmental research <e> <s> before i do so i should like to thank the noble baroness lady nicol for introducing this debate <e> <s> if i say nothing about the difficulties faced by the agricultural research service and adas it is not because i do not recognise them <e> <s> i am directly involved in them as chairman of a governing body of an afrc- and maff-funded research institute <e> <s> it is one like many others which has had to face many difficulties <e> <s> the noble baroness has already said very much on that score and i agree with all that she has said <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak on this amendment and i am conscious that we have devoted a long time to it i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i am one of those individuals concerned with the government of a university and therefore very much affected <e> <s> indeed i am one of those whom the noble lord lord annan wants to make skip <e> <s> my present position not this particular one but my position in cambridge makes me feel as if i am skipping most of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak only briefly but as a client of the ugc i must declare an interest before i do so <e> <s> speaking for myself i cannot raise much enthusiasm for this report <e> <s> doubtless it contains much that is wise and judicious and many good if detailed recommendations but it seems to me that its wisdom and judgment are confined within the compass of our present arrangements <e> <s> there is almost nothing radical in what is proposed only the almost inevitable suggestion of yet another tier at the centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not addressed that question in my speech but since the noble lord asks me i do not take exception to those recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon we are debating post school education <e> <s> i think we are all agreed that it is a subject of major importance <e> <s> i think we are mostly agreed that post-school education is in some disarray <e> <s> we are probably disagreed on the reasons for that state of affairs <e> <s> but in the relatively short time that i have i shall like the noble lord lord blake and the noble baroness lady seear and for fairly obvious reasons confine myself to universities <e> <s> if i echo what has been said already i hope that the government will recognise this as some little force to what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords this evening i intend to confine myself to the document from the advisory board for the research councils <e>", "<cs> my letter referred to a previous committee meeting at which i thought this amendment might have been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords not being a gladiator of a political kind i shall have great difficulty following the previous two speakers <e> <s> as someone of a naturally conservative cast of mind i am inclined to view with caution a bill entitled the education reform bill <e> <s> it somehow seems intended to pre-empt the moral high ground <e> <s> surely it seems to say you cannot question what is proposed or the reasons for particular proposals <e> <s> these are reforms and <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have just ceased to preside over a small council of the senate of cambridge with members and three students <e> <s> i found the students enormously valuable and helpful <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to speak for any length of time but i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord swann <e> <s> of course it is a probing amendment though i have no doubt it will be called a wrecking amendment <e> <s> indeed if it were passed it would wreck <e> <s> however it is very uncertain what it would wreck because at the moment we are so much in the dark about the intentions of the secretary of state with regard to the universities funding council and what it will set up by way of a funding mechanism for universities <e>", "<cs> i believe that that is an increase in the funding which goes with successful generation of funds rather than a reduction in the payments which is what my amendment seeks to prevent <e>", "<cs> i should certainly hope so <e> <s> perhaps i may say how grateful i am for the support that has been given to this amendment and indeed for the sympathy with which the noble and learned lord has received it <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is brigaded with amendment no <e> <s> b and i wish to speak to it but at the same time if i may i shall also speak to amendment no <e> <s> because those two amendments in my name have a certain symmetry <e> <s> clause a concerns redundancy and arranges that dismissal for redundancy should be by a body or a <e>", "<cs> speaking as a member of a cambridge college whose visitor is i believe sitting on the front bench opposite i would very much regret it if the jurisdiction of the visitor was limited to exclude matters other than dismissal <e> <s> i accept the restriction of the exclusive jurisdiction of the visitor but i should be sorry if the amendment and i confess i was unaware that it had that effect removed the jurisdiction of the visitor from matters of internal discipline in the college <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the noble lord lord swann in this amendment to which my name also is attached i would say that i agree wholeheartedly with everything he has said and i do not propose to repeat it <e> <s> but we still need to find out what are the governments plans in terms of contract funding between the universities and the ufc <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a question <e> <s> let us suppose that the universities funding council of its motion decides to fund universities by block grant in the main as opposed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that very kind agreement to the amendment <e> <s> i also thank all noble lords who have supported it <e>", "<cs> my lords before i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i wish to respond to the noble lord lord mccarthy and to say that as regards the university of cambridge for which i think i may speak although not so directly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> if it fails i shall support the subsequent amendments <e> <s> clause f as it stands is a great deal too widely drawn <e> <s> it gives sweeping powers to the secretary of state <e> <s> as the clause is drafted it is not at all clear whose ideas or whose intellectual property it is intended that the secretary of state shall exploit <e> <s> is it anybodys or everybodys ideas and property or is it just the ideas and property of employees of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords before i address myself to amendment no <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for the amendments which he has put down <e> <s> they go a long way to meeting some of the anxieties <e> <s> i should like to apologise to him for not having been able to attend the meeting which he so kindly agreed to call <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house no <e> <s> i believe that the judgment would have to be reached by agreement between the researcher and those people who knew what he was doing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am perfectly happy that it should be left as history <e> <s> it was years ago <e> <s> it was not the dhss it was the nrdc <e> <s> i produced it as an example of the kind of delay about which i was seriously worried <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of once more being ignored i add my thanks to the minister for his great willingness to bring forward these amendments and to agree to this one <e>", "<cs> my lords however grateful i am to the noble baroness lady blackstone for initiating the debate this evening i speak with some reluctance because it appears to me in some ways an inopportune moment for me to join in a debate on higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise if i am not in my place for some of the debate because i have a commitment in cambridge in the late afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise to the house and in particular the noble baroness lady hooper that i shall not be in my place after six oclock <e> <s> i have a longstanding engagement <e> <s> indeed i am among the wardens who look forward to welcoming the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to dinner at the worshipful company of goldsmiths <e>", "<cs> i shall follow along the lines taken by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i too am concerned about the definition of terms in legislation and their meaning in the act as it will be <e> <s> we need a term to describe the early stages of the process that is after the sperm has entered the egg and the first appearance of what might in a sense biologically be called an embryo <e> <s> the word conceptus has been used by the noble baroness lady elles and by the noble lord lord walton <e> <s> it is a good term <e> <s> it is one used by embryologists when they wish to define the particular period while the chromosomal material from the mother and the father is being reorganised into the potentiality of a new individual <e> <s> the conceptus can be thought of as a blueprint and the embryo can be thought of as the individual growing which results from the blueprint having been achieved <e>", "<cs> surely what is being considered here are treatments <e> <s> that has nothing to do with research <e> <s> that is dealt with later in the bill under licences for research <e> <s> we are concerned here with licences for treatment <e> <s> the words such other practices refer to treatment practices <e> <s> i am not aware that the medical profession when considering a new treatment has to apply to parliament for primary legislation to allow it <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be a fatal mistake to ban all practices other than those that are listed <e> <s> i strongly oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister whether there is any planned intention to change the method of payment for tuition fees from that in place at the moment <e> <s> in effect is there any difficulty in accepting the amendment which implies that at least for the present there is no intention to change <e> <s> to refuse the amendment might suggest that there was such an intention <e>", "<cs> i am much in agreement with what has been said already <e> <s> however i have one further concern that is that if students who are currently at the universities or polytechnics are not to come under the operation of the loan scheme as i understand it they will lose their social security benefits whenever that is promulgated laid on the table or put forward under whatever mechanism is to be used <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down and we leave the question of the access funds can he tell us the amount of the housing benefits that will be withdrawn in relation to the size of the proposed access funds <e> <s> we know that it is proposed that the access funds should total million but i do not have a figure for the withdrawn housing benefit <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord colwyn <e> <s> perhaps in doing so i should declare an interest having been a medical student a good many years ago <e>", "<cs> in rising to support this amendment my chief feeling is one of sadness that it should be necessary to spell out on the face of this forlorn and unloved bill what should surely be the normal state of affairs <e> <s> that it is not the normal state of affairs and that it should seem necessary to oblige the secretary of state to hold consultations with institutions i believe is largely a consequence of the way matters have gone so far <e>", "<cs> i shall say no more than that i agree entirely with what the noble lords lord beloff and lord flowers have said <e> <s> at this hour of the morning i do not want to repeat their arguments <e> <s> i do not disagree that some repayment by students is appropriate but i do not agree that the scheme that has been put before us by the government or at least that part of it that we have been permitted to see is a good scheme <e> <s> indeed the more i hear of it the less i like it <e> <s> i believe that the cvcps proposals or some derivative of them are a substantial improvement on what is presently proposed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment particularly from the point of view of medical students of whom i was one a good many years ago <e> <s> it is my understanding that a principle behind the bill is that a university education gives a greater chance of earning a reasonable salary in later life <e> <s> however are doctors or dentists or others whose courses are longer than the standard three-year course conspicuously higher earners than those on three-year courses <e>", "<cs> my lords for me the difficulty about the bill is that on the face of it it does good by providing more resource for all students but not on the face of the bill indeed at the behest of a department other than the department of education and science about half that resource is to be removed from a group of students who are in substantial need because of high housing costs <e> <s> access funds will go some way to meet that difficulty but i suspect that the sums of money are such that access funds even when increased as i understand they are to be will prove inadequate to cover that group of students and their housing costs <e> <s> the amendment seems to go some way to removing that great difficulty and i support it wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke perhaps pre-emptively at committee to an amendment which anticipated the amendments moved by the noble earl <e> <s> i said then that i hoped that the secretary of state would consult with those whom he proposed to require to carry out the steps and the process of applications for loans before he promulgated the regulations mentioned in this amendment <e> <s> i am therefore extremely grateful to the noble earl for what he said in that he outlined that there will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke on this issue in committee and on report and i was grateful to the noble earl the paymaster general for saying on report that the question of payments would be on the agenda of the meeting between the universities and the des <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that anyone on these benches can speak on behalf of the cross-bench peers but i should like if i may to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak briefly as i have but one point to make <e> <s> i should first like to add my voice to those speakers and the noble baroness lady cox was the latest of several who have asked that health professionals in the widest sense such as those in medical schools and in the universities of which medical schools form a part should in some way and on the face of the bill be incorporated into the management structure of regions and districts as well as of trusts <e> <s> in doing so i must declare an interest in that i shall be at cambridge for a few more years in a pre-clinical department teaching medical students <e>", "<cs> i am the fourth person to put my name to this amendment <e> <s> as i said at second reading i believe that the proposed management boards need a more specific structure <e> <s> my direct experience in these matters is nothing like as great as that of either of the noble lords lord dainton and lord flowers but i have had some brief experience at cambridge <e> <s> in effect as has already been said many specialties provided at medical schools are made use of by health service patients in the whole of a region <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to question the decision of mr speaker on the two amendments concerning housing benefit <e> <s> i fully understand that his decision was in accordance with precedent <e> <s> however i am relieved to discover that your lordships house did not act beyond its appropriate powers in attempting to prevent the removal of housing benefit for students <e> <s> nevertheless your lordships house was persuaded to exert its influence in order to retain the existing entitlement to housing benefit for students and for graduate students <e> <s> one may wonder how wise it was to prevent another place from reconsidering the issues in the light of your lordships arguments and their decision <e> <s> at the very least i believe it looked as if the government were fearful that the arguments of your lordships might have carried weight in another place as well as here <e> <s> however we shall never know whether that is the case because another place has not been allowed to reconsider the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that he has just very kindly put me in excellent company since he had reservations about my speech and all the other speeches <e> <s> i was aware of the point that he made and i apologise if i made any implications about the speaker <e> <s> i did not intend to do so <e>", "<cs> i too support this group of amendments <e> <s> in doing so i should like to cite just one example of the kind of research done in cambridge <e> <s> however there are countless other examples that could be described <e> <s> everyone has heard of professor sir roy calne and the pioneering work he has done in liver transplants at addenbrookes hospital <e> <s> the work was developed at addenbrookes as a result of the efforts of a university professor and his team working in a teaching hospital <e> <s> the approach is now known to be successful and the work is funded by a special supra-regional mechanism through the national health service <e>"]
