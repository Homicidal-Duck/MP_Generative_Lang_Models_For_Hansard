["<cs> my lords i too should like to express appreciation of the opportunity to say a few maiden words on this important topic <e> <s> in the trade union movement and i speak as one who has spent the best part of a working life as a trade union official social security has always been one of our most basic concerns <e> <s> removal of deprivation degradation and the misery which were the lot of many working people decades ago has historically been a prime motivation for us <e> <s> in their place we wanted to put dignity and self respect decent living standards security against everyday risks such as ill health and unemployment and proper provision for mothers families and pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the vast increase in sums very largely a reflection of the increasing unemployment that we have seen in recent years among young people in particular <e> <s> i should like to direct attention to some of the publicity that we have had recently in connection with young people because it seems to me that those are the category most at risk rather than some of the exempt categories <e> <s> i welcome the exempt categories of course but the people who are at risk it seems to me are young people who have left the areas where they were born because of the high unemployment in those areas in the belief that they can get work by moving to other areas sometimes to the south coast <e> <s> but when they get there they find that unemployment still exists there and they have to have some form of accommodation <e> <s> that is where the problem lies so it seems to me <e>", "<cs> as a member of the occupational pensions board i hope that we do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the statement that has been made by the noble baroness this afternoon with particular reference to equality of opportunity for women to which we are committed <e> <s> but of course in order to enable women to take advantage of equality of opportunity as we all know it is necessary to provide certain support services such as crche and nursery facilities and so on <e> <s> could the noble baroness tell us whether the government would reconsider their attitude towards the draft eec directive on leave for family purposes because i understand that we are in fact the only government in western europe which has not been prepared to support this directive <e> <s> if we are taking seriously equality of opportunity for women this is one of the aspects we should consider <e> <s> would the noble baroness be good enough to answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that the noble baroness has effectively answered the question i put about the directive <e> <s> she simply said that she noted my point <e> <s> can i press the point and ask the noble baroness whether the government will reconsider their position on this rather important question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what special arrangements the government are considering in connection with those areas of the country where the unemployment figures are much higher than the national average <e> <s> i am speaking particularly of areas such as merseyside where according to the latest figures unemployment is over per cent <e> <s> and tyne and wear where again the figures are over per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for initiating this debate and i welcome the opportunity to comment again on the governments green paper on social security <e> <s> it is heartening to glean from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord banks for raising this issue <e> <s> i must say that when i saw his unstarred question on the order paper it led me to view this matter from a rather different angle and to consider the whole question of surrender values capital assessments and so on in respect of means-tested benefits <e> <s> in particular i am concerned about the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord believe that the gap in employment that has been created by the decline in manufacturing industry can be made up from the service industries in view of the vulnerability of those industries to developments in new technology <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot tell the noble and learned lord that <e> <s> i do not have the reference <e>", "<cs> i hope that we are not going to be less compassionate less civilised and less caring today than our predecessors were in when the shops act was passed <e> <s> for that reason i commend this amendment to your lordships <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> however in view of the fact that he has not found it possible to give the assurances that i seek i have no alternative i fear but to press the amendment <e> <s> the reason i say that is that i cannot accept the argument that things have changed and we do not now need the protections that were thought necessary in the shops act <e>", "<cs> indeed i hope to be lucky <e> <s> the reason for the amendment is that we wish to put into the bill provision for shopworkers to have a statutory entitlement to holidays <e> <s> again i refer to the auld report and to the same paragraph to which i referred earlier paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> in relation to shops and shopworkers i do not think that that is terribly relevant <e> <s> it has already been pointed out that shopworkers are among the lowest paid in this country <e> <s> indeed wage rates for women working full time in the industry were quoted at less than a week <e> <s> these are very low wage rates indeed <e> <s> if you compared them with wage rates for similar grades of people working on the continent you would find i believe that they compared very badly <e> <s> i do not think with respect that what the noble lord says is relevant to my argument so far as holiday entitlement is concerned <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister thinks that this is not an issue upon which he can come to terms with us on this side although i accept the force of some of the arguments he has made <e> <s> on the other hand it seems to me that the only real reason for pressing this amendment was our fear that if the wages councils disappear there will simply be nothing left there at all <e> <s> that is why we wanted to table an amendment that protected the position of these shopworkers <e> <s> as i said earlier when i made a statement in support of the amendment on which the committee divided deregulation of shop hours is one thing and protection of workers is quite another <e> <s> it was in that context that we put down on the marshalled list this set of amendments <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> yes we are <e> <s> if i may continue i was saying earlier that i disagree with the concept of a two-tier workforce with some employees employed on certain conditions and others employed on quite different conditions <e> <s> i may say this is also the view of the tuc which in a document it has sent to me about the provisions in the bill says <e>", "<cs> this is not an uncommon situation in industry where the employees are employed on contracts which set out the hours they work and there is an arrangment under which if an employer wants to employ people outside those hours he offers premium rates to do it <e> <s> often if he cannot get volunteers from his own workforce he will get them from elsewhere <e> <s> but he pays for it separately and the people who do it have a separate contract <e> <s> it is a separate arrangement in relation to that work and it is usually at premium rates <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but i feel that i must press my amendment because although i am not committed overwhelmingly to the wording and it has been very difficult given the schedule and its complexity to draft suitable wording i should nevertheless like to test the feeling of the committee on the principles that i have enunciated <e> <s> i shall go over them very briefly again <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the debate and have decided not to press my amendment <e> <s> on the other hand i still think that there is a great deal of validity in what has been said by a number of noble lords in the debate <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what has been said and in particular to the interesting point made by the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> i too hope that the minister will look at the points made in the debate <e> <s> the point i made was different from the point that the noble lord made in reply to me <e> <s> we are talking as i understand it about a specific provision whereby rights which exist in section of the employment protection act can be waived as a result of an agreement between an employer and an employee and an employee who is certainly not going to be in a position of equality when it comes to negotiation with his employer <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> i do so because i am concerned about the conditions of shopworkers <e> <s> i have received representations from unions affiliated to the tuc and from other associations looking after the interests of shopworkers <e> <s> i have had some submissions from a staff association representing numbers of shop employees <e> <s> they are concerned that the shops bill will greatly encourage late-night trading <e> <s> because late-night trading seems so much more likely they believe that there is a much greater need for workers to be <e>", "<cs> my lords it probably does but why increase the numbers at risk <e> <s> this is the point i am making <e> <s> why should we have a situation in which as a matter of course shops open late at night with no restrictions <e> <s> indeed the amendment proposes liberal hours <e> <s> it provides that shops can open until pm on week days and pm on sundays <e> <s> if shops are to stay open all hours much later than that without any restrictions the pressures will be on for everybody to trade in that way and far more members of the workforce will be exposed to the risks <e> <s> of course some people are exposed to risks <e> <s> people who work in night clubs or other places where they have to walk the streets in the evening on their way home late at night are at risk but we do not need to increase the numbers <e> <s> although there is much to be said for freedom for people to trade and freedom for people to shop if they wish to do so that freedom must be restrained or restricted to some extent if in so doing we are risking the exploitation of another section of our population <e>", "<cs> my lords as other noble lords have already said in this debate the past decade has seen substantial changes in public attitudes towards the employment of women and their treatment in employment <e> <s> some of us think that change has not been rapid enough <e> <s> nevertheless we have had legislation opposing discrimination in employment and the pressure continues to end discrimination in retirement ages and in pension benefits <e> <s> the equal opportunities commission of which i am a member and may i say in passing how pleasant it was to hear in the debate the noble baroness lady platt who is at present chairman and <e>", "<cs> my lords what arrangements are being made to consult the workforce in view of the fact that the opinions of the workforce were held to be of significance in the westland affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity this afternoon to participate in the debate on the economic situation <e> <s> other noble lords have dealt in detail with the technical questions relating to the fall in oil prices and the matter of exchange and interest rates <e> <s> i wish to address myself to what i see as some of the consequences of current government policies and i am emboldened to do so by the statement made earlier this afternoon by the noble lord lord young of graffham <e> <s> i do so because we are frequently being told and we were told this afternoon by the noble lord lord young that things are improving that we are on the upturn that it is simply a matter of staying with it as we are on the right road that new real jobs will be created and that popular capitalism i think it is called will see us through <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that as long ago as the occupational pensions board recommended that there should be not only equal access to occupational pensions but equality of benefits <e> <s> does he not agree that now that there is an opportunity to equalise pension ages equality of benefits ought to be looked at too <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord young said this afternoon the government are seeking to introduce this bill because of a finding of the european court <e> <s> it is a pity that our approach to legislation on sex discrimination is so piecemeal and introduced only because of european pressure <e> <s> we had difficult and complex regulations introduced two years ago in order to comply with european requirements on equal pay for equal value <e> <s> equality of treatment on taxation was discussed in your lordships house very recently <e> <s> pensions is another area where clearly something is going to have to be done <e> <s> we discussed the marshall case earlier and quite clearly we shall eventually have to come to legislation which will equalise retirement ages and equalise retirement benefits as well <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the ministers response <e> <s> i had expected that there would be a different reception to an amendment which as i said originally was intended to be helpful because we are seeking to provide a mechanism for enforcing what we believe the european court is telling us we should do <e> <s> i agreed absolutely with the noble baroness lady seear when she said that prejudice is traditional and conventional and i made that point when i first moved my amendment <e> <s> it is because that is very deeply engrained that we need some mechanism for dealing with it <e>", "<cs> i am rather disappointed with the response that we have received from the minister this evening <e> <s> he has spoken often about burdens on industry <e> <s> i draw attention to a copy of the <e>", "<cs> as far as this amendment is concerned we on this side of the committee find it admirable at least in sentiment although i agree that the noble baroness lady seear has raised a point that requires clarification <e> <s> we regard the code of practice as a good idea for the simple reason that codes of practice are as has been my experience of considerable value to negotiators <e> <s> indeed throughout the debate the noble lord opposite has often made reference to the desirability of collective bargaining and to the resolving of issues by collective bargaining rather than through legislation <e> <s> my experience is that if there are codes of practice available to negotiators on both sides of industry to people who want to do the right thing and who require some guidance then those codes of practice can provide great support <e>", "<cs> we propose to support the amendment although we think it is very weak compared with the one that we moved earlier which would have provided a proper system of enforcement of collective agreements <e> <s> we should have preferred a system whereby if the parties to an agreement felt that it was inadequate they could take it before a suitable body argue it out and have a decision and guidance at the end <e> <s> but if this is the best that can be done at this late stage we are prepared to support it <e> <s> i repeat that it seems a very weak provision to us <e> <s> it is simply that it is better than having absolutely nothing <e> <s> there ought to be a suitable method of enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity created by the initiative of my noble friend lord stallard to contribute to the debate on this important question <e> <s> i should like to say what an interesting and really moving debate we have had on this subject this evening <e> <s> there are about a quarter of a million people in the united kingdom in some form of residential care <e> <s> nearly half of them are in homes provided by the voluntary and private sectors <e> <s> a large number of those people are of course elderly and the numbers will increase as the numbers of people reaching the age and over increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed to hear what the noble lord has had to say this afternoon <e> <s> i had hoped that in the time that has elapsed since we had our discussion in committee the government would perhaps have rethought their position so far as repeal of the legislation is <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mccarthy said during the passage of the bill through your lordships house there have been some notable improvements made as a result of the amendments that have been successfully accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the opportunity to participate in a debate on this important subject but how difficult it is to follow the noble lord lord soper whose speech was so moving <e> <s> since i have been a member of your lordships house i have had the opportunity of observing at first hand the working out in legislative terms of the governments philosophy <e> <s> it must be said that it has a cohesion and consistency which are rarely found in governments <e> <s> some people might call it an ideological inflexibility <e> <s> essentially it appears to be that deregulation privatisation and the working of the free market will ultimately solve all our economic and social problems <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the comments made by my noble friend on the matter of crown immunity <e> <s> there is a strong case for repeal of a provision that has i understand existed since and that provides for total immunity to any legal action or claim for damages where negligence has resulted in serious injury or death of a member of the armed services <e> <s> i understand very well the reasons why my noble friends amendment has been ruled out of order as not apposite to the bill <e> <s> i should however like to hear the views of the minister on what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government issued the green paper last year there has been a substantial amount of discussion and a great deal of criticism <e> <s> some of it has been heeded but nevertheless the main thrust of government thinking as exemplified in the bill appears to remain the same <e>", "<cs> i have little to add to what the noble lord lord banks said in moving his amendment except to say that we on our benches support it <e> <s> the main reason is that in our view not having the differential rate that he proposes would mean that the contracted-out approved personal pension schemes would be attractive to younger earners only <e> <s> that would have a very destabilising effect in our view on occupational schemes and might leave them entirely with older people in and thus undermine them <e> <s> for those reasons we should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the view of that reply and in view of the noble baronesss explanation for which i thank her i shall not press my amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> as he says the policyholders protection act was introduced in following the collapse of a life office <e> <s> the insurance industry itself is involved in funding <e> <s> it seems to us that the need now is even greater than it was perhaps in because later this year we shall be facing deregulation in the finance industries <e> <s> that means that everybody in the industry will be able to do everything else <e> <s> building societies will be able to sell life insurance insurance companies will be able to offer mortgages and banks will be able to offer pension schemes and so on <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the debate which has been a most interesting one <e> <s> i thank all noble lords who have contributed <e> <s> i do not find the arguments for not accepting the amendment extremely convincing <e> <s> we are concerned here with the protection of people who are least able to protect themselves <e> <s> indeed this point was made by my noble friend lord williams when he referred to the kind of people who would be going on to the personal portable pension market for the first time in their lives <e> <s> for this reason it is necessary to have some kind of limit put upon what they can be charged by way of administrative expenses and by way of commission <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the very full explanation that has been given by the noble baroness <e> <s> i am glad to learn that a great deal more work will be done on disclosure and i agree that disclosure could cover much more than is listed in the amendment that i have tabled <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall not press the amendment this evening and i ask leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble viscount in relation to this amendment and the other amendments to which he referred <e> <s> i suppose that this is where we begin what could be called the battle of the bribe because bribe it is <e> <s> the government are offering a positive inducement for people to contract out of serps and also occupational pension schemes and to participate in personal private schemes <e> <s> as the <e>", "<cs> i too welcome the noble baronesss statement <e> <s> i am glad to learn that occupational schemes in future will be protected against people opting for ppps on the basis of the per cent <e> <s> incentive <e> <s> what bothers me is that it seems to me that this still leaves the state earnings-related pension exposed <e> <s> so far as i can see the incentive still exists for people to opt against serps in favour of ppps <e> <s> i do not believe that this is very fair either <e> <s> it provides an incentive for which all of us pay through the national insurance fund <e> <s> yet in order to do so we are encouraging people to opt against serps and into the ppp arena and in so doing subsidising commercial operators who will be offering ppps to a whole range of new people who otherwise might not have considered this as a possibility <e>", "<cs> it had been my intention to move that this clause should not stand part of the bill because my understanding of clause is that it provides for incentive payments to be made in respect of occupational pension schemes either salary-related or money purchase <e> <s> the noble baroness has already dealt with that matter and so there does not seem to be any point in opposing the clause <e> <s> however i still feel concerned about serps and i may come back to the matter on report <e> <s> at present i shall not oppose the clause <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> as i understand it and as set out in the very helpful documentation that we have received clause removes the requirement in the pensions act that to qualify for contracting-out a salary-related occupational pension scheme must provide so-called requisite benefits <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble baroness had to say <e> <s> i still have some fears that the clause as it stands could result in lesser benefits in certain schemes <e> <s> it certainly gives an opportunity for occupational schemes to offer less good benefits than they do at the moment and that would be a great pity <e> <s> nevertheless in view of what has been said and in view of the hour i shall not press this <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness very much for that explanation <e> <s> i shall look at the record and try to understand the position a little better <e> <s> of course i understand that there is always the difficulty of making legislative provision for pensioners in retrospect so to speak it is quite hard <e> <s> in view of what the noble baroness has said i shall withdraw the amendment and look at the record to see where we go from there <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord lord kilmarnock needed to stiffen my resolve because it is my intention to test the feeling of the committee on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do so despite the explanation given by the noble baroness lady trumpington whom i thank for her kind remarks about my services to the occupational pensions board <e> <s> i feel that clause as it now stands is really far too vague <e> <s> as i understand the noble baroness what she was saying was well its there and we will make regulations if we think we ought to make regulations <e> <s> what i am saying is that there ought to be regulations made relating to the form and content of advertisements and that this should be a mandatory provision so far as the government are concerned under clause <e> <s> i intend to press amendment no <e> <s> because it is my view that the provision is not strong enough that it has to be strengthened and that it ought to be mandatory <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment which has been moved by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> i have an amendment myself of a similar kind which we shall come to later but i am inclined to the view that perhaps the amendment of the noble viscount is rather better than mine <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to that <e> <s> i understand that that is the situation <e> <s> i was simply referring to the position that applied before it was compulsory to belong to any scheme at all <e> <s> i was speaking in support of the notion that where there is <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord swann <e> <s> as he rightly says most occupational pension schemes provide quite generous compensation for people who die while in service <e> <s> indeed the inland revenue maximum is four times the annual salary as a lump sum paid on death in service <e> <s> most schemes provide two-and-a-half times the annual salary as a lump sum and as the noble lord rightly points out there are also continuing survivors benefits <e>", "<cs> i rise to support from these benches the amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> it must be a matter of concern to everyone that the position of people who are existing simply on the basic state pension and there now are many of them should be in many instances in penury <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks has already referred to representations made by reputable organisations such as age concern <e> <s> what he is suggesting seems to us to be an extemely modest suggestion under which there would be an increase in the real value of the basic state pension for the period mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> by real value he means i take it that not only would the basic pension be increased by the inflation rate in regard to prices but there would be an increase on top of that <e> <s> i should very much like to see this and therefore i believe that this amendment should be supported <e>", "<cs> i am rather disappointed with the noble baronesss response to the amendment <e> <s> as she rightly said its effect is to retain the -year rule <e> <s> we have not sought to change the proposal to reduce the accrual rate from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> although we do not like it we have accepted that that is not part of this amendment <e> <s> we are anxious to retain the best years provision because we think that it is important <e> <s> i should almost describe it as the heart of serps <e> <s> it is one of the reasons why when serps was introduced it was welcomed on all sides of the house <e> <s> it was seen that it would provide cover for people who hitherto had not had adequate pensions cover in occupational schemes or by private provision <e>", "<cs> yes because i think that they cover much the same kind of ground <e>", "<cs> i am rather disappointed as members of the committee may not be surprised to hear with the response of the noble baroness <e> <s> i had hoped that she would have found it possible to have accepted at least one of these amendments <e> <s> so far as concerns amendment no <e> <s> that is a very wide amendment and i take the points that have been made in the debate <e> <s> i shall not be pressing it this evening <e> <s> i note that there is to be consultation and some possible steps taken in relation to disabled people <e> <s> i welcome that and we shall have to see what those steps turn out to be <e>", "<cs> i beg the committees pardon <e> <s> i do not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the motion moved by my noble friend lord ennals that clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> we have had a lot of discussion this evening about serps and the best years provision <e> <s> i repeat that in my view that provision is the very heart of serps <e> <s> for that reason it attracted a lot of support at the time that it was introduced <e> <s> like all other members of the committee i have undergone a lot of lobbying on the bill from various organisations <e> <s> i do not think that i <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> the to year-olds as a group appear to be targeted for substantial cuts in benefit in this legislation <e> <s> the government seem to assume that young single householders have families to go back to and that it is their choice to live independently <e> <s> yet as the noble lord lord banks has said there are many groups of young single people who have no choice but to live separately from their parents for example the young people who have just left care young refugees young people who have been victims of sexual abuse or violence and young people whose families either cannot or do not want to have them living at home <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend who is moving that this clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to that point <e> <s> personally i do not believe in the koreanisation of the british economy <e> <s> is that the policy of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i do not regret the comments that i made <e> <s> i do not believe in a low-wage economy <e> <s> at the age of young people are regarded as having attained majority people mature much earlier now than they used to many years ago and it is generally recognised that that is so <e> <s> many of them have families at quite a young age <e> <s> i do not regret anything that i have said in defence of reasonable living standards and a living wage for people between the ages of and <e>", "<cs> i rise from these benches to support both amendments of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> as he rightly says the principle of higher rates for antisocial hours or for an awkward shift pattern is one that has been accepted for a long time throughout industry <e> <s> in many places of course the workers are covered by union-negotiated agreements <e> <s> it is accepted that if people work these hours they should have a premium rate for doing so <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed to hear what the noble lord has said because it seemed to me that he was agreeing with me that there was or could be a problem about piece workers and of course the amendment seeks to ensure that those workers will be adequately protected <e> <s> the two amendments nos <e> <s> and seemed to be a very simple and easy way of doing that <e> <s> however at this stage i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i shall look carefully at the noble lords reply in <e>", "<cs> in that case i am so happy to give way <e> <s> i should like to hear what that is and i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i wait with great interest to hear what he has to say <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i really am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> with great pleasure beg leave to withdraw the amendment and i await his wording with keen anticipation <e>", "<cs> i should like to contribute to this debate <e> <s> i have amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name <e> <s> i have very little to add to what the noble lord lord wigoder said on the issues of principle because i think those principles are irrefutable but i should like to tell the committee that for many years i was a member of a social security tribunal which are tripartite bodies with a legally qualified chairman <e> <s> the people who came before us were in the main unrepresented <e> <s> nearly all of them were very vulnerable and extremely poor people <e> <s> we did our job as an independent tribunal <e> <s> we put them at their ease <e> <s> the whole environment was a very relaxed one <e> <s> i felt that at the end of the hearing the people who came before us felt that they had had a fair hearing and a fair deal <e> <s> sometimes we found for them and sometimes we did not but we were at least able to persuade them that they had put their case before an independent body and the insurance officer who was the official concerned had to justify his decision to an independent body <e>", "<cs> i find the response of the noble baroness a little disappointing <e> <s> it seems to me that she has not dealt with the questions that have been raised regarding what happens when one is dealing with social need where people are in desperate straits and a limit has been reached <e> <s> as my noble friends on this side of the committee have said if one relates this to the hospital service does this mean waiting lists <e> <s> one would hope not <e> <s> on the other hand the situation has been slightly changed this afternoon because the amendment in relation to provision for appeal has been passed by the committee <e> <s> that plainly means that the social fund and regulations in connection therewith may have to be looked at <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to learn that i am disappointed at the response from the noble baroness <e> <s> i repeat what i said when i moved the amendment the industrial injuries scheme was introduced in because it was accepted then and it has been accepted by governments since until this one that if one goes out to work particularly if one works in a hazardous environment and the environment of many manufacturing industries is hazardous no matter what one does about it there is a case for a special industrial injuries scheme <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble baronesss response to the previous amendment i am not really surprised at her response to this one and she will not be surprised to learn that i am not at all happy about it <e> <s> i repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> in my view there is a case for an industrial injuries scheme for those who go to work and who are involved especially in hazardous circumstances <e> <s> many countries have an industrial injuries scheme with a no-fault basis <e> <s> if there is no continuation of a separate scheme with benefits for people injured at work or their families we shall see an increase in the number of cases that eventually come before the courts as people try to get some compensation on a common law basis <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble baroness said but i still feel that the case for my amendments is strong <e> <s> this is a social benefit and it seems to me that there is a strong <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby and i do so for a number of reasons <e> <s> first we are now contemplating legislation in this field under which building societies will be taking on a whole number of other financial services duties which they have never had before <e> <s> this legislation and other legislation in the financial field will mean that everybody in the financial services area will be offering all kinds of financial services <e> <s> this also means that building societies which of

building societies functions should be emphasised <e> <s> as i understand it this is what this amendment seeks to do <e> <s> it would be a great pity if that were to be lost sight of and for those reasons i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords how many of the new jobs anticipated would be part-time and how many would be full-time <e> <s> my impression is that much new employment is part-time and in unskilled areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the minister does not feel disposed to accept our amendment <e> <s> i regret to hear what he said <e> <s> it has largely been replied to by my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> i remind the house as has been mentioned by my noble friends that we are considering rates of pay that are already extremely low <e>

for part-time employees large numbers of whom are women <e> <s> for these reasons it seems to me that it is essential that we have criteria that do not give wages councils the impression that it is their job to drive low wages lower still and to price people into employment in the way that has already been described by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise on behalf of these benches to thank the noble minister for the concession which we were promised in committee and which we are now glad to see placed before your lordships in the shape of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are very glad indeed that the arguments we were about to put to the house have been accepted by the government <e> <s> homeworkers are a particularly vulnerable set of people <e> <s> we are very glad that the

accept our amendment <e> <s> i am rather surprised because it is such an innocuous amendment <e> <s> it simply requires that the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to participate in this second reading debate on the financial services bill <e> <s> i have several reasons for wishing to do so and i had better declare my interests to your lordships <e> <s> first i am

insurance agents <e> <s> secondly i am and have been for some years one of the lay non-specialist members of the insurance brokers registration council <e> <s> thirdly i have a particular interest in pensions provision as a member of the occupational pensions board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to learn from the noble baroness this afternoon that the assurances that were given to us in committee are being honoured in this way <e> <s> she is right to say that the reference to reasonable in the speech she made in committee has aroused some speculation <e> <s> it has been asked what is meant by reasonable <e> <s> plainly this is something which must be sorted out <e> <s> as far as we are concerned on this side of the house we would expect that anybody who was in a contracted-out scheme even someone who has perhaps just joined as a result of having been taken into employment should be covered by the provisions that the per cent <e> <s> incentive would not be available because the scheme

occupational pensions board would be glad if it were passed although that is not necessarily a reason for doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord banks in his amendment <e> <s> the occupational pensions board has powers to make modification orders and does so under the present legislation but if we could have legislation which obviated the need for this to be done i am sure it would be a great deal better and would certainly save administrative time <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little to add to what has been said by the noble lord lord banks in moving his excellent amendment <e> <s> we on these benches support his amendment and we should like to see the government support it as well because that would be in line with their philosophy which i <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that these are drafting amendments and therefore i do not intend to speak to them at length <e> <s> we on this side of the house do not like the provisions in clause anyway and all that these amendments do is strengthen the provisions already there <e> <s> those are my only comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the noble lords

government would find acceptable <e> <s> protection has already been written in for the sick the disabled mothers and other carers and we commend that action <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the

"<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks and to highlight one particular aspect of what he had to say in his very technical but very interesting speech when moving it <e> <s> this amendment affords an opportunity to highlight the small but significant anomaly that affects elderly homeowners who have a home income plan to which the noble lord lord banks has referred <e> <s> i understand that about of them exist <e> <s> in conjunction with a building society or assurance company such elderly people have mortgaged their homes and used the proceeds to buy life annuities to supplement their incomes <e> <s> through taking this action and seeking to use their own resources to provide for themselves some extra income they have been put at a disadvantage with regard to income-related benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed to hear what the noble baroness had to say <e> <s> i thought i made it clear when i moved my amendment that we were not just concerned with loss of earnings because that is not what the industrial injuries scheme was originally concerned about although it was part of it <e> <s> it was an attempt to ensure that people were compensated for loss of faculty loss <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may address the house not as a lawyer but as one who has from time to time participated and who probably will again participate in demonstrations orderly demonstrations i should assure your lordships <e> <s> it seems to me that this bill gives the police additional powers <e> <s> i should have thought that the police already had substantial powers to deal with disorder <e> <s> nevertheless the bill proposes additional powers for the police <e> <s> it seems to me that giving them these additional powers places a very heavy onus on the police to make judgments in political and industrial matters <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say that the interests of employees are always taken care of

long time now the health and safety commission has been absolutely in favour of doing away with the exemptions from the provision relating to prosecutions and notices <e> <s> is the noble baroness

situation because other noble lords have done this and will i am sure continue to do so in this debate <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on some matters that concern me and that to some extent come within my own experience as a union official and as a present member of the tuc general council <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and i do not want to take up time by repeating arguments which have already been advanced in the debate <e> <s> nevertheless i must say at the outset how much i agree with my noble friend who has just contributed to the debate and the noble baroness lady seear when they said that this is a thoroughly bad bill <e> <s> it is a thoroughly bad bill <e> <s> we have to deal with it as a revising chamber but i question very much why it has been introduced at all because as a number of noble lords have said the bill seeks to remove from teachers the right to negotiate on their pay and conditions of service <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister tell the house what arrangements are being made to monitor hypothermia among the elderly <e> <s> will she respond to approaches that i understand have been made by the national pensioners convention who want to make representations to her in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to add very much to what has been said by my noble friend lady jeger and the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mcintosh <e> <s> i spoke at second reading and i do not want to make a second reading speech in support of the amendment but there are one or two comments that i should like to make <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that it is a year since the people were dismissed from news international in wapping and that that was the reason the senior trade union officials had this demonstration <e> <s> as evidence of the fact that they wanted it to be a peaceful demonstration they actually had a jazz band fixed up to play at the demonstration <e> <s> the disruption was caused by elements other than those organised and led by the official unions and therefore the statements made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in this connection are entirely unwarranted <e>", "<cs> i seem to recall that during the second reading debate a number of noble lords on the other side of the chamber made it quite clear that for the government there was nothing in the bill which prevented the teachers unions from negotiating to their hearts content if i may quote the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter at col <e> <s> in this amendment all we seek to do is to assure teachers organisations which are going to be sufficiently resentful of the bill as it now stands that that is the position <e> <s> i do not see why this amendment cannot be supported by the committee for the sake of assuring teachers who will feel a great deal of resentment about the way in which the bill has been introduced that there is still an opportunity for negotiations as was assured during the second reading debate <e>", "<cs> i am a little confused by what the noble baroness has said in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in my reading of it amendment no <e> <s> is quite different from amendment no <e> <s> and it is amendment no <e> <s> about which we have considerable reservations <e> <s> we have been opposed to any provision that would have the effect of making different arrangements for pay between different areas for people doing exactly the same sort of work <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why amendment no <e> <s> has been put down <e> <s> it states that we would not provide for other than a system of remuneration to be consistently applied throughout england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be more sensible to have an entirely different formula to cover the winter months for those most at risk instead of a formula based on temperatures which everybody concerned with the care of the elderly now believes not to be adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide new rights to information and consultation for trade unions their members and employees of companies involved in a takeover merger sale of a subsidiary or transfer of engagement <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene but the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has made a few comments which i feel cannot go without some comment from me <e> <s> first he seemed to imply that it is the teachers unions who are responsible for the disruption and that somehow or other they are not representative of their members <e> <s> like many others of your lordships i have received lots of letters on this issue more letters i think than on any other issue since i came into your lordships house <e> <s> a very large number of those came from individual teachers and from groups of teachers working in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the motion put down by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> it affords an opportunity to talk about a problem that is of increasing concern to women whether married or unmarried who need to take time out from full time employment in order to care for a family <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill seeks to provide new rights to information and consultation for trade unions their members and employees of companies involved in a takeover merger sale of a subsidiary or transfer or engagement <e> <s> the year was a record one for takeovers <e>

is before your lordships house <e> <s> i am disappointed to hear from the minister that he believes that legislation already exists to cover a great deal of what the bill is seeking to do <e> <s> if that is the case i can only say that it does not seem to be to be working very effectively <e> <s> reference has been made to the need and the preference for voluntary action and so on but it is because there has been an absence of that kind of voluntary action that trade unions have generally become extremely concerned and why i have put this bill before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reinforce what the noble lord lord banks said about elderly people <e> <s> i remember that last year we had in your lordships house a debate for which i received a briefing from the national council for voluntary organisations <e> <s> i was very impressed by the information given to me in connection with the care of elderly people <e> <s> at that time six or seven months ago the figure of was clearly regarded as totally inadequate <e> <s> now we have an additional to care for elderly people <e> <s> i feel that there is a case for looking at this again because it is not adequate in the light of the kind of services that have to be provided in looking after people who are elderly and frail and who need special care and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to commence by thanking my noble friend lord ennals for the opportunity afforded by this debate <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord peston on an admirable maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure we all look forward to hearing a great deal more from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in the debate until i heard what the minister said <e> <s> in addition to the points raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock i am concerned by the additional incentive that the government appear to be giving to personal private pensions <e> <s> noble lords will know what we on this side felt at the time of the social security bill about private personal pensions <e> <s> indeed we hold that the government by their attitude are assisting to some degree to undermine very good collective occupational pensions provision by their apparent support for ppps <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i too should like to congratulate my noble friend and distinguished colleague lord basnett of leatherhead on a very notable speech <e> <s> like the rest of the noble lords who have spoken in the debate and who have commended lord basnett on his speech i too hope that we shall hear a lot more from him <e> <s> he has a great deal to offer this house and a great deal of experience from which to offer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that nobody in your lordships house can possibly wish to object to any move to enlarge the scope of the race relations and sex discrimination acts and on that basis we welcome these orders <e> <s> indeed many people have said that this step should have been taken before now <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to comment on this important debate although i had hoped that i should not have to make the type of speech that i am making <e> <s> when we discussed the green paper on trade unions in your lordships house on th april it came under considerable criticism from all sides of the house <e> <s> my recollection of that debate is somewhat different from that of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> a number of your lordships said that there had been enough legislation and that we should let it all settle down <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord promise a debate on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for rising after my noble friend but i should like to put a question on the issue of employment because it seems to me to be a very important one <e> <s> is the minister aware that the trade unions were advised last september that there would be reductions of jobs at crewe derby and york of them being salaried posts and that those redundancies have been announced by brel <e> <s> does the minister agree that we must give some priority to trying to maintain the skilled workforce at brel and that work should be put its way wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether any creche facilities can be made available through msc schemes <e> <s> my information is that such facilities are not available <e> <s> would it not be helpful to single parents particularly very young women if such facilities were available <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether he is satisfied that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there are still unexpectedly high levels of male unemployment in those areas which were formerly dominated by heavy manufacturing industries <e> <s> should more special steps be taken to assist in that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in certain areas of the construction industry there are serious shortages of skilled employees and that these shortages are such as seriously to endanger some projects <e> <s> should not steps be taken in this area to ensure that there is proper skill training <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his explanation of this somewhat complicated order <e> <s> on our side we welcome the order and i have one or two small points to make <e> <s> the equal opportunities commission of which i am a member itself welcomes the order but hopes that when a suitable opportunity occurs it will be extended to the whole of the act and not be limited as it is at the moment to those parts directly affected by the equal treatment directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> however is it not a fact that since there have been no fewer than changes in the way in which those statistics are compiled and that on each occasion with one exception the result has been to lessen the numbers of officially notified unemployed <e> <s> as an example there was the decision to remove men aged and over from the unemployment count even though they were not necessarily out of employment and the social security bill removed men from the age of and above from the unemployment count <e> <s> will there be further moves in that direction and does the minister think that such self-deception helps anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill although short is a very important one <e> <s> it follows hard upon the heels of the comprehensive and far-reaching act of and is based on very similar principles <e> <s> i believe that it is a thoroughly bad bill with very few if any redeeming features <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank the minister for his explanation of these orders and to say from these benches that we welcome any increase <e> <s> on the other hand we regret that the government have not found it possible to up-rate the employment payments by more than the rate of inflation this year <e> <s> indeed the increases again fail to match the increase in average earnings which i understand was per cent <e> <s> last year <e> <s> in the past there has also been a failure even to meet the rate of inflation because i understand that past increases have been of the order of per cent and per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his explanation of the industrial training levy engineering board order <e> <s> we on this side of the house welcome it <e> <s> it is my understanding that it has the support of both sides of industry the trade unions and the employers <e> <s> the engineering industry training board has a good record of training and we believe that the order will help its work <e> <s> on a personal note i should like to say that i am glad that the eitb has had a significant effect upon the training of women in the engineering industry <e> <s> it has done a great deal to encourage women to take up training in the engineering industry and has recently started a range of initiatives to encourage their training in this non-traditional field <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord banks and to tell the committee that in my view it is rather better as far as the wording goes than my own amendment <e> <s> i shall therefore be withdrawing my own amendment in favour of this one <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the question that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> we are indebted this afternoon to the minister for a very full explanation of what the <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the response of the minister to the statement that i made particularly as regards mrs moran and her entitlement <e> <s> it is my understanding that it was raised very sharply in another place <e> <s> i should have thought that the information would have been available this afternoon for the committee <e> <s> i very much regret learning that it is not <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am not inclined to think again about the matter <e> <s> however i shall take it away and consider it on report <e> <s> there may be a possibility of rejigging the amendment on report to take account of some of the ministers comments <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed of course with the ministers response <e> <s> i repeat what i <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw my amendment in favour of the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord pitt because they are almost identical <e>", "<cs> i was rather disappointed to hear what the minister had to say because he spoke as though putting someone back on child benefit or extended child benefit somehow or other substituted for the benefit which might otherwise be payable <e> <s> i do not believe it does <e>", "<cs> after a period of six weeks that is the situation but it is quite important if one has lost ones employment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment this evening <e> <s> i shall look at the statement in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that much part-time employment is very low paid and is it not also true that there is very little statutory employment protection for part-time workers <e> <s> should not something be done to remedy that unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for that reply and in those circumstances i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed by the ministers response because i do not think that he has dealt with the point that i made that the individual concerned will have made a contribution through his national insurance contributions and will have made a contribution to his pension <e> <s> therefore this is in no way any form of charity or means-tested benefit but is a benefit for which contributions have been paid and it is an entitlement <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the is now worth about and therefore the difference is quite substantial at the present time <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press this to a division tonight because of the lateness of the hour <e> <s> i am not very satisfied with the reply from the minister <e> <s> again i emphasise that a review mechanism is not the same as the ability to apply to an independent tribunal <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his explanation but the concerns that have been expressed on this side of the committee remain <e> <s> we are concerned that there should be consumption of milk rather than the payment of money <e> <s> that is the difference between us <e> <s> when the national welfare milk scheme was first introduced in consumption of milk among poor families increased dramatically <e> <s> i believe that a number of diseases which until then had been endemic among our poorer citizens practically disappeared <e> <s> for example i think rickets ceased to exist some time after the introduction of the national welfare milk scheme <e> <s> its disappearance was directly attributable to that scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for those comments and in particular noting with satisfaction the increase in tourism perhaps i may ask him whether it is not a fact that hotel costs in the country are quite unacceptably high particularly in view of the low level of wages in the industry generally <e> <s> should we not try to do something to prevent visitors to our shores being ripped off in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether in view of the figures he has quoted the government are satisfied with the level of consumer protection particulary at the lower end of the package-tour industry and particularly in view of the intensive competition that exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it will come as no surprise to your lordships house that we on this side find the bill objectionable <e> <s> many of the main issues have already been debated in the house <e> <s> last year the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge and belief the bill does not have the support of trade unionists or trade union members on the contrary <e> <s> i talk now of when i was an official of my union and at that time we had a great deal of opposition to the bill coming from the grass roots of the trade union movement <e> <s> i do not believe that it is at all correct that there is support for the bill from employees generally or indeed from individual trade union members <e> <s> as for the public i believe that also is a very doubtful proposition <e> <s> i do not see any evidence that the public is anxious for a further tranche of union legislation <e> <s> there has already been a succession of trade union bills which are now acts and i believe there is widespread feeling that enough is enough and that there is no need for further legislation <e> <s> that is my belief <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord mind indicating to the house what relevance that has to the bill before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he prepared to repeat outside the house the allegations that he has made about the num election <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he agree that the closed shop is now only possible after a ballot and a very high measure of support in a ballot as well <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the decline of job opportunities in manufacturing industry is responsible for the very high rate of male unemployment as distinct from female unemployment <e> <s> according to the latest figures male unemployment accounts for per cent <e> <s> of the workforce compared with per cent <e> <s> for females <e> <s> should not something be done about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that response <e> <s> i am glad to learn that there are no plans at the present time to change the scheme <e> <s> may i seek an assurance that if at some time in the future there are plans to make changes these will only be embarked upon after full consultation with both sides of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he not agree that while a number of the acts concerned with protective legislation are outdated and probably in need of revision their total abandonment would be a very serious matter which would require the utmost public scrutiny including scrutiny by your lordships house <e> <s> can he please say when further information and a full report will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the scheme be a burden on the voluntary organisation administering it <e> <s> should this not be a government responsibility <e> <s> in view of the concern that has been expressed will there be provision for parliament to review how this government money is being spent and to do so at regular intervals <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the community care review of sir roy griffiths <e> <s> would he be kind enough to let the house know when the report is expected <e> <s> it was announced in and it was expected at the end of <e> <s> when will it be published <e> <s> in view of the general concern about the level of community care will its finding be made public in order that there can be public scrutiny of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that statement <e> <s> i am obliged to him for the suggestion that the issue will not go away and that there will be an opportunity to look at the matter again when we have the report which i gather is due later this year <e> <s> in view of that statement i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i shall look to see what the report says later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the response from the minister to my amendment although perhaps not really very surprised <e> <s> one of the reasons i think that the amendment is a fair one is that people who have been injured at work are not in the main in the higher income bracket <e> <s> so a drop in income for such people is a quite substantial matter and often a desperate one <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the amendment does not commend itself to the minister <e> <s> i repeat as i said when moving the amendment that the main purpose is to provide people with extra time in which to make alternative financial arrangements <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that making provision is often a long-term matter <e> <s> one does not get very much if one has paid into an additional scheme over a short period of time <e> <s> it is for that reason that five years is felt to be a reasonable period of notice for people in that kind of situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support the amendment and thank the noble lord lord seebohm for bringing the matter to your lordships notice <e> <s> all noble lords who have spoken have said that the retained fire service carry out an exceptional service for the community and receive very little recompense <e> <s> it would therefore be <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for his comment which is very helpful <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i wanted to learn what the view was in relation to the problems raised by the voluntary organisations operating in this area <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> however i must say that i am disappointed with the response of the noble earl <e> <s> in the real world it often happens that there may be a local action where a member feels that he is being induced to take part in a dispute at local level <e> <s> the national executive council may know nothing about that matter <e> <s> if he can push off to the court and there seek an injunction or relief without first going to the union he may be involving himself and the public purse in quite unnecessary expenditure of time and money <e> <s> if i have read the bill correctly it appears that individual members will have access to public funds in respect of some issues <e> <s> on the other hand if he had first gone to the union and given notice a court case might not have been necessary because the union might have brought its activities into line with the law <e> <s> for that reason i believe that it would have been reasonable to have accepted the three days notice that we have suggested <e> <s> in view of the fact that the minister does not feel able to do so i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however we may consider the matter further at the report stage <e> <s> those were the reasons that i advanced <e>", "<cs> t note that the minister says that the amendment is unnecessary because the wording of the proposed legislation provides for it in another way <e> <s> however the intention was not to override the discretion of the courts as the noble lord lord campbell seemed to indicate <e> <s> we refer clearly in the amendment to a member who has declined <e> <s> in other words the procedures were there and available for the member and he has unreasonably declined to utilise them <e> <s> we had thought that our wording coped with that situation just as we thought that the authority for this clause rested with the fact that the member himself in joining the union has accepted the unions rules and those rules have been arrived at as a result of the democratic decision of the members <e> <s> however in view of the statement by the minister shall not press the amendment at this juncture <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend did <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with that and i am sorry about that <e> <s> i note that the minister thinks that the first amendment no <e> <s> is already covered in the legislation <e> <s> i said that i was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> and if one looks at lines to on page one can see that a minimum is specified <e> <s> the subsection states <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i cannot agree with the minister <e> <s> it seems to me that if we have within the legislation provision for a minimum award we are removing from the courts the opportunity and the flexibility to decide on nominal amounts <e> <s> that is quite unjustifiable in the circumstances <e> <s> however i shall not press the amendment to a division at this stage but will look carefully at what has been said before report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find that a very unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> if one looks at the amendment it says that the union may apply to the court for an order and the court may make such order as it thinks appropriate <e> <s> in other words if the union is approached by a member and the information that is being requested is confidential then the union can apply to the court and the court decides to make an order if it thinks it appropriate <e> <s> that seems to me eminently reasonable <e> <s> and quite frankly when we come to talk about proper accounting records i gather that the present legislation compels the unions to keep proper accounting records with respect to their transactions assets and liabilities <e>", "<cs> on the basis of that assurance i am willing to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this time of night we do not intend to persist with our argument <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> i hope to have an opportunity to say a few words about the amendments which are in the group when they are moved <e> <s> i believe that both those amendments aim to protect contracts of employment in some other way and to that extent i support them <e>", "<cs> in replying from these benches to the debate on the amendment i should like first to say that much of the discussion has not been absolutely directed to the amendment <e> <s> the proposed subsection a specifically deals with the position of president as i said in my opening remarks <e> <s> the presidency of the num has been bothering many noble lords on the opposite benches <e> <s> that is specifically dealt with in subsection a which makes clear that it is an elected position <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the arguments advanced against the amendment very strange <e> <s> i must say to the noble lord lord renton that we are not suggesting that the rules should take precedence over the law <e> <s> we are suggesting that parliament should not pass unfair laws <e> <s> once the law is in position unions have to abide by it <e> <s> that is not in question <e> <s> we are not suggesting that the rules should take precedence <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is he not aware that the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> if there are complaints made to the certification officer would it not be better to allow the certification officer to deal with them instead of having trial by newspaper <e>", "<cs> it is unusual for members on this side of the chamber to agree with the minister but we do so on this occasion <e> <s> what he said is very sensible <e> <s> i also believe that it is unwise to embark upon legislation aimed at specific individuals which is what this measure does <e> <s> the noble lord lord wyatt made it abundantly clear in moving the amendment that that was what he was after <e> <s> i therefore support the minister in his comments on this amendment <e>", "<cs> shame <e>", "<cs> yes i think that it probably is <e> <s> i am disappointed at the way in which the minister has reacted to what i thought was a moderate reasonable and compassionate proposition <e> <s> people approaching the end of their working careers should not suddenly have the goalposts changed their contracts of employment negated and have to stand for election when their careers were based on the assumption that they had appointments and contracts of employment and were responsible to elected executive councils <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> during the course of the debate we on this side of the committee have attempted to demonstrate how misdirected and malicious is clause <e> <s> as we have tried to show it would produce unstable situations in many unions <e> <s> it would introduce elections for officials who are civil servants of the trade union movement <e> <s> it would prevent unions from developing the professional skills and expertise that are so necessary nowadays <e> <s> unions are constantly being told to modernise and clean up their act and this clause would inhibit them from doing so <e>", "<cs> i do not accept the arguments advanced by the minister <e> <s> the number of people voting is not the main consideration but it is a substantial consideration if we are concerned to ensure maximum participation by union members <e> <s> moreover under the present legislation it is necessary for unions to guarantee exactly the same degree of security for workplace voting as can be guaranteed for postal voting <e> <s> that is why unions are so careful about the way in which arrangements are made in that respect <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the ministers response to what we on these benches considered to be an extremely reasonable amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lord wedderburn has said we should prefer parity and that is our starting point <e> <s> however we tabled the amendment in an attempt to come to terms with what the government have said in another place <e> <s> in effect they said that they felt that more employers were required because they were mostly concerned with training and the kind of training that was provided was down to them <e> <s> we did not altogether agree with that but we tried to meet that point of view by suggesting that the employer should have an advisory role and in that way as we saw it maintain the balance as regards trade union input on the commission <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> he is quite right and it simply emphasises what we have said on these benches namely that trade union co-operation and input into training are very important indeed if these schemes are to proceed and everybody hopes that they will do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> to return to the arguments about parity i was glad to learn that noble lords on the opposite side the noble lords lord carr and lord campbell of alloway seem to be arguing in favour of parity <e> <s> moreover during the course of the discussions this afternoon it seems that there is a view in your lordships committee that the whole idea of parity should be reconsidered by the government even though the minister said that the government are not prepared to do that <e> <s> therefore although it had been our intention to divide on this amendment if we did not receive a reasonable response from the minister we now intend to seek to divide the committee on the question whether clause stand part which i believe we can do if that emerges as a result of the discussions in committee <e> <s> it seems to us that this has clearly emerged during the discussions on this amendment in committee <e> <s> therefore while we are not asking the committee to divide on this amendment we shall ask it to divide on the question whether clause stand part <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> nothing that the minister has said has set at rest my fears about the centralisation of power which i believe this bill indicates <e> <s> the comments that he made about delegation and about jobcentres and so on still indicate that the secretary of state will have a very substantial concentration of power if the bill goes through unamended <e> <s> it is not my intention this afternoon to press this amendment <e> <s> that is not because of what the minister had to say but because of the comments made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> he pointed out an unlooked-for result of the wording of this amendment which could mean that consultation with other bodies such as the equal opportunities commission would be ruled out if we simply specify by way of amendment that there should be consultation with the training commission <e> <s> that is not what we had intended in putting down the amendment and that is what other noble lords understood who spoke to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment was concerned to ensure that a safety net was available if young people did not obtain places within the eight weeks <e> <s> as i attempted to demonstrate when moving the amendment it is by no means certain that eight weeks will be sufficient in a number of places <e> <s> i mentioned rural areas <e> <s> there are special problems for ethnic minorities to which the noble baroness lady seear referred <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> i agree with much of what was said by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> as regards the provision in sub-paragraph iii which reads <e>", "<cs> i note what the minister has said <e> <s> in view of some of the points which he made i am surprised that he is not accepting the amendment <e> <s> it seemed to me that he was saying that it would be good cause if a trainee or a prospective trainee were to reject a place which was not suitable to his capacities aptitudes and so on <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that response <e> <s> we shall look closely at what he has said in <e>", "<cs> in view of that response i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> amendment <e>", "<cs> shame <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of the regulations which are largely uncontroversial <e> <s> however i should like to make one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested to hear what the noble earl has said particularly with reference to the kind of accounts that are regarded as necessary to be available for inspection by members <e> <s> that certainly clarifies the situation substantially because he is saying that the proposed new subsection ab is not necessary as all that is required are the accounts under section of the act <e> <s> that is the case if we have understood him correctly <e> <s> we shall be looking very closely at his remarks and having another look at that matter on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to what the minister has said <e> <s> if i have understood him aright he is saying that amendment no <e> <s> put forward by the government and just passed by your lordships house would very substantially have the effect that i am seeking <e> <s> i am asking that employees who attend to give advice and provide specialist information to the principal executive committee as required by that committee will not be required to stand for election <e> <s> i shall look in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of these government amendments <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord basnett advanced the case on behalf of his own union and on behalf of apex which is currently considering a merger <e> <s> he made the very strong point that if the unions were to be tied to the provisions of the act it would be extremely difficult for the members of the merged union to be able to make a reasonable choice when it came to election of their executive because the members of the merged union would not know the members of the other union with which they had merged <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness not aware that as regards ballot paper-stamping parties accusations there have already been retractions published in the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords on our side we cannot see that this is a just necessary or reasonable amendment <e> <s> there is no evidence to show that the individual member who has had recourse in the past to the certification officer has ever had to fear victimisation from within his union <e> <s> i had some experience of such activities in my union when i was responsible for the operation of its rules <e> <s> we had instances where individual members from time to time made complaints to the certification officer <e> <s> indeed i can remember one occasion when an individual made a whole series of complaints which i was responsible for dealing with on behalf of the union <e> <s> on that occasion all but one of the complaints were dismissed but the member concerned never complained about victimisation simply because none ever took place <e> <s> indeed that member turned up on several occasions as a delegate to the unions annual conference and carried on exactly in a normal way with no harassment or victimisation from the leadership of the union <e> <s> i think that this has proved to be the situation in many unions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the only example he has quoted so far is that of tass and he has just agreed that tass anyhow did not have time to put the matter right before it merged with somebody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord again is he not himself admitting that there has been no attempt to challenge the position from within tass <e> <s> is that not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat is it not true that there has been no attempt by any member of tass to challenge what has happened and that the certification officer has not proceeded any further against tass <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we shall support either of these amendments <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord renton that amendment no <e> <s> is the better of the two <e> <s> we supported the noble baroness lady seear when she moved her amendment in committee and we think that there is no real reason why this very sympathetic amendment should not be accepted by the government <e> <s> we hope that it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches were not quite certain what amendment no <e> <s> meant until the noble lord lord renton explained it <e> <s> having heard the explanation and the contributions of the noble lords lord mottistone and lord carr we think that there is much merit in the amendment and we should like to hear that the government have decided to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand what the minister means when he says that it would be counter-productive <e> <s> i cannot see why it should be impossible to ensure that those in receipt of training allowances and being trained are treated in equal fashion <e> <s> is he really saying that the only way in which employers will co-operate is if they are assured that they can apply unequal treatment to employees <e> <s> i do not understand what is meant <e> <s> i am most dissatisfied with the ministers response which does not come to terms with the amendment we have tabled <e> <s> nor does it meet the valid point raised by my noble friend lord wedderburn <e> <s> in my view the minister has not made a satisfactory response to that point <e> <s> however i shall not press the amendment at this hour of the night <e> <s> i should like to put on record that these benches consider that the ministers reasons for not accepting the amendment are entirely unsatisfactory and very disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> i note that he thinks that our clause would be unnecessary or dangerous <e> <s> i disagree with that <e> <s> i cannot see that it would be dangerous to give encouragement because that is what this clause would do to people to embark on self-improving courses of study or other similar activity and to try to train themselves in order to improve their opportunity of finding regular employment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that recent research indicates that there is substantial depressive illness and even suicide among the long-term unemployed which is much more than in the general population <e> <s> should not something be done about that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord mottistone as we do the amendment of the noble lord lord howie of troon who i am sorry to see is not in his place <e> <s> as he is not present i shall hope to move the amendment in his place <e> <s> i believe it is quite possible for me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to go over all the arguments that we have heard <e> <s> suffice it to say that i strongly disagree with the minister on this issue <e> <s> i believe that we have set out the case repeatedly for the amendment that is before your lordships and it is now my intention to press the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will not be surprised to learn that i am <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that may day not only celebrates organised labour and its achievements but is a folk festival of considerable antiquity dating back to pagan times would it not be a pity if we were to abandon that holiday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his very clear explanation of what this order is all about and to say that from these benches we support it because we believe it to be a sensible measure and entirely uncontroversial <e> <s> it is my understanding also that the unions involved in local government support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i also would like to express appreciation to the noble lord lord banks for putting down this unstarred question and introducing a debate on social security <e> <s> it is not very long ago that we discussed this subject at length in the context of the legislation which is now on the statute book <e> <s> as the noble lord lord banks said peers in opposition sought to persuade your lordships mostly unsuccessfully that there should be a whole series of amendments <e> <s> had some of them been adopted some of the problems which have since emerged would not now be there <e>", "<cs> so do i my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the accident rates in the construction industry are unacceptably high <e> <s> does he not also agree that adequate training could make some contribution towards diminishing those statistics <e> <s> can he give the house an assurance that health and safety training will have a special place in training in this industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that during the past year there has been considerable tightening-up of the availability-for-work test <e> <s> has that had an effect upon the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give us an assurance that the traditional may day or labour day in this country which is traditional not only in celebration of organised labour but also in our folk culture will not be moved without adequate consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a small but very useful bill a private members bill as has been said <e> <s> in accordance with what i believe to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that during the last stages of the social security bill which was recently before this houses an amendment was moved which required the government to review the level of child benefit in april of each year <e> <s> has there not therefore been sufficient time for that review to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to hear what the minister has to say <e> <s> may i follow up that question by asking her how soon this process is expected to be completed and if we can expect to see normal collective bargaining procedures put into operation during the course of the teachers pay and conditions act and perhaps by way of amendment to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that the range of consumer protection available is sufficient to protect those who may be tempted to take ppps and leave occupational pension schemes <e> <s> secondly is enough advice available for people who are confronted with the labyrinth which now exists in the pensions world in respect of personal private pensions <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that there will be continuity of contracts <e> <s> is that essentially the point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is already a great deal of concern about the possibility of young people being conscripted into the yts because of lack of financial support <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that it is even more disturbing if young people with learning difficulties are similarly treated <e> <s> does he not further agree that it would be to the advantage of the public and the taxpayer generally to ensure that such persons had income support until they were able properly to benefit from a yts place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister comment on the theory that the fly is a mutant arising from heavy use of fertilisers in farming <e> <s> if that is so could the chemical companies responsible for the production of fertilisers be approached to assist in research into this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that nowadays community care mostly falls very heavily on the shoulders of women often in late or middle age and that without adequate support services as recommended the position of such people can rapidly become quite intolerable as much of the recent publicity has shown <e> <s> would the minister care to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that before any steps are taken in relation to the national dock labour board it would be advisable to consult with both sides of the industry as to its future <e> <s> is it not also true to say that it would be lamentable if we were to return to the labour conditions that prevailed before the national dock labour board came into existence because that would be very counterproductive indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many employees in the industry are engaged on short-term contracts and therefore many of them feel very nervous about coming forward with complaints because they fear victimisation and intimidation <e> <s> should this aspect not be taken account of in the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that the calculation of those out of employment is accurate since it is based merely on those who claim and who are entitled to receive unemployment benefit especially in view of the fact that constant changes in entitlement have been made <e> <s> would it not be better to have a much more realistic assessment made of those who are available for work but cannot find it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask him to firm up some remarks that he made during the debate <e> <s> for example one of the issues that everyone has stressed during the debate is the necessity to maintain the company as an entity <e> <s> is it not possible in the course of the negotiations which we understand are confidential for stipulations to be made that the entity of the company should be maintained <e> <s> is it not also possible to ensure that the research and development facility which is so important for northern ireland stays in northern ireland no matter how privatisation proceeds <e> <s> is it not possible for that to be part of the negotiations and part of the stance that the government take in those negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the postal strike which we are all sorry about have been avoided had management been advised to adopt a more conciliatory attitude leading up to and during the course of the dispute <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the union in question is scarcely known for taking a militant stance likewise its general secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to the answer given to my question <e> <s> have the government not heard of arbitration as a means of settling disputes <e> <s> if they have why have they consistently undermined the authority of the central arbitration committee by writing it out of successive pieces of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the accident rate in the construction industry is still unacceptably high <e> <s> last year more than additional deaths occurred <e> <s> does not the minister agree that that is probably attributable to the use of unskilled and untrained lump labour in the industry <e> <s> will the minister be good enough to tell the house what arrangements are being made for safety training in the industry and for an improvement in the safety inspectorate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be good enough to look at the possibility of increasing the number of inspectors in view of the present accident rate in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that even the governments own figures show that as regards scotland the figure of unemployment is per cent <e> <s> in the north it is per cent <e> <s> in northern ireland it is per cent <e> <s> and in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many dhss offices are rather squalid and understaffed places and that poor and underprivileged people often have to wait in long queues for hours before receiving attention and being handed their benefit <e> <s> will the minister give the house assurances that steps will be taken to remedy that situation <e> <s> perhaps the minister himself might make unannounced visits from time to time to offices in some of the more underprivileged areas <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm or deny that regional health authority chairmen have been told that most appeals will either fail or be withdrawn <e> <s> if this is so does he not agree that such a statement casts doubt upon the fairness and impartiality of the grading system <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ensure that there is adequate consultation with the unions representing the workforce in the north-east to make sure that proper steps are taken to reduce the number of accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the code as at present drafted contains no fewer than steps which unions are expected to take before they can call an industrial dispute and that some of those steps go far beyond the provision of legislation <e> <s> is that part of the governments step-by-step approach to industrial action possibly rendering it illegal at some point in the future and is it their view that employees with a grievance should simply put up and shut up <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government not agree to leave may day alone in view of its tradition in this country <e> <s> after all many people like innocent amusements such as dancing round the maypole and attending may day rallies even if noble lords opposite do not <e> <s> is there not a case for leaving matters as they are for the time being and perhaps considering more holidays in line with the continent where they have far more holidays than we have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be good enough to tell the house to what extent the new business loan guarantee scheme has had an effect on new start-ups <e> <s> will he also tell the house what the effect has been on employment and exactly where new employment has been created as a result of new start-ups <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the changes in the administration of the national health service of which there have been a good many in the past few years have destabilised the staff as a whole and have made them suspicious and resentful of further change <e> <s> can he assure the house that this will be taken into consideration and that steps will be taken to ensure that staff are adequately consulted so that the resentment can be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister respond more precisely to the questions raised on these benches <e> <s> we are talking about consultation with the present staff of the nhs and about changes in the administration of the nhs <e> <s> that was the burden of the questions asked by my noble friend lord molloy and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the sierra is the second best selling car in the ford range and that per cent <e> <s> of sierras are sold in this country <e> <s> if the sierra is built in belgium there are bound to be balance of payments problems <e> <s> will this not also have an effect on employment <e> <s> is he further aware that there will be a spin-off regarding component manufacturers in that the figure of jobs to which he referred may be very much larger <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the fiesta which fords claim will replace the lost sierra will continue to be sourced from valencia and cologne and therefore the volume of jobs likely to be provided will probably not be so great <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to welcome the ministers explanation in respect of adoption allowances in england and wales and in scotland <e> <s> the minister apologised to t he house for explaining the orders in such detail <e> <s> we on this side welcome the length of his explanation a nd the detail with which it was furnished because this is an important measure <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the governments commitment to free market forces do they have any plans to negotiate a lower cost per dose of the vaccine bearing in mind that there is now more than one producer of mmr the single-shot vaccine in question <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the abolition of wages councils as proposed in the consultation paper to which he has just referred will leave britain alone of the countries of the european community without any minimum wage legislation <e> <s> does he not further agree that we are the only country in the ec to denounce the convention to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i were able to welcome the report of the select committee on visual display units <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot do so <e> <s> i had hoped that the committee would recommend support for the european directive <e> <s> as we have heard it has not done so despite the evidence it received and despite some of its own conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that matters at grimsby are currently the subject of court actions with injunctions having been issued and appeals now outstanding <e> <s> therefore would it not be better if such issues were left to the decisions of the court rather than to discussions in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that mobility is important as the minister has just said that the south-east is becoming overcrowded does he agree that we cannot all live in the south-east or the west midlands <e> <s> what steps are being taken to provide job opportunities for those areas of high unemployment from which it is not possible for people to move because there is no housing accommodation which they can afford in places where there is employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity even at this late hour to debate in your lordships house the draft code on industrial action balloting introduced by the unstarred question put down by my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> as has already been said on th january i myself put down a question <e> <s> the minister said in response to the noble lord lord rochester that it was not intended that the contents of the code should be more prescriptive than the legislation itself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is desirable in the present situation to encourage more women to join the workforce <e> <s> does he not further agree that it would be a good idea for the government to give greater encouragement to the provision of crche and nursery facilities <e> <s> with that in view can the government reconsider their attitude to taxing the provision of nursery care and so on as a fringe benefit <e> <s> moreover will not the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the paper continues with a statement for which it produces no evidence whatever <e> <s> on page it says <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that during the debate speakers on this side of the house indicated that wages councils were anomalous in some respects <e> <s> we were complaining about the lack of any kind of minimum protection <e> <s> we were not claiming that wages councils are perfect <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining in such detail the upratings and the reasons for them <e> <s> we do not offer opposition to the orders but on the other hand i should like to take the opportunity of making a few remarks <e> <s> i have referred to section of the employment protection consolidation act <e> <s> as the minister has said it would be possible for the minister to have been rather more generous in the uprating than he has been because the general level of earnings in great britain at the time of the review was substantially more than the per cent <e> <s> which is now proposed in the order <e> <s> the minister is also entitled to take into consideration the national economic <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for giving such a detailed explanation of the uprating proposed in the regulations <e> <s> we on this side of the house welcome the regulations and the fact that the intention is to maintain the value of money <e> <s> therefore the order makes provision for uprating by per cent <e> <s> it is quite true as the noble earl said that this is a horrendous disease <e> <s> it affects workers in mines and foundries <e> <s> it is progressive and is a disease which ultimately kills <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like again to thank the noble earl for the way in which he has explained the order <e> <s> on this side of the house we have no objections to offer <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches would like to express our concern as regards the illness of the noble lord lord banks and our sorrow that he is not with us tonight <e> <s> i understand that he has a serious illness and we very much hope that he makes a rapid recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those noble lords who have participated in what was an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> it has as noble lords have said covered wide ground because the terms of the motion were wide <e> <s> we could probably have gone on for a great deal longer than two-and-a-half hours had we had the time <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords could have said a great deal more had they had more than seven minutes each in which to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the opportunity again to debate in your lordships house the important subject of training <e> <s> i express my appreciation to the noble lord lord rochester for introducing the subject and indeed for the manner in which he introduced it <e> <s> i share very many of the views he expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be good enough to answer some of the points i made about the eitb <e> <s> what is the governments intention in that regard <e> <s> what special circumstances relate to the citb which do not relate to the eitb <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will not be surprised to learn that we on this side of the house do not welcome the statement on the contrary <e> <s> the statement is very much in line with the governments philosophy of deregulating everything and blaming union <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the green paper sets out a remedy for those people denied a job because they do not belong to a union <e> <s> will the minister be good enough to tell the house what plans the government have for providing remedies for individuals who cannot obtain jobs because they belong to unions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether it is the intention to produce the whole of the report rather than sections of it for the consideration of this house <e>", "<cs> is it a fact that this fly has had the effect of polluting and depleting a number of the dorset rivers <e> <s> if that is the situation can the minister tell the house whether privatisation of water will help in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the government doing to encourage employers to follow the example set by banks and provide parental leave to enable children to be looked after for prolonged periods <e> <s> what are the government doing about their own employees in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to commence by expressing my thanks to my noble friend lord mccarthy for putting down this extremely timely question <e> <s> the report of the monopolies and mergers commission on labour practices in tv and film making has recently been published <e> <s> this is a result of the first reference under section of the fair trading act <e> <s> that reference was made jointly by the secretaries of state for employment and for trade and industry and the home department <e> <s> the commission was asked to report on whether certain practices said to exist in those industries were restrictive labour practices and if they existed whether they operated or might be expected to operate against the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been possible for the government to refer the issue to the monopolies and mergers commission before coming out with their white paper <e> <s> they could have proceeded with their white paper if the mmc had recommended that they should so proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware of some of the studies that have been undertaken by voluntary organisations in the field notably the child poverty action group <e> <s> it would appear from them that the poorer people who are being offered loans frequently fail to qualify because they are not able to afford the repayments <e> <s> they are therefore considerably worse off than they would have been under the single payment system <e> <s> what steps are being taken to train sfos in the work now required to ensure that people are offered community care grants rather than loans when that would be more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the union made it quite clear that it was not supporting the strike and that it would ballot if it wanted strike action <e> <s> is it not also a fact that that ballot is now taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather disingenuous to expect there to be no industrial disaffection in a situation where employees are offered deals much below the rate of inflation and in a situation also where mortgage rates are a heavy obstacle and obligation upon employees <e> <s> is it not absurd to expect there to be no industrial disruption in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so would it not be good if the government were openly to declare their support for arbitration and arbitration processes rather than as far as one can see undermining the role of the central arbitration committee as has happened in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state tell the house whether the quota system which was in operation for disabled employment still exists and whether it is being effectively monitored <e> <s> it was my experience that it was not effectively monitored and that there was not a great deal of inspection <e> <s> can the same kind of system be applied in relation to disabled young people <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be good enough to tell the house what support is available to women who may wish to rejoin the workforce after a spell of caring for their families but who wish to do so by way of self-employment <e> <s> are any special arrangements available <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether the strategy which he has outlined will have the effect of diminishing queues at local benefit offices and generally improving efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether he envisages that there will be redundancy among the staff as a result of the introduction of this system <e> <s> if so can he say what steps are being taken to deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble countess lady mar described the bill as a ragbag of a bill <e> <s> i have heard it described in the other place as a curates egg of a bill <e> <s> certainly a number of disparate subjects have been jumbled together to form a bill <e> <s> i find some of its propositions acceptable but others are not acceptable to members on these benches <e> <s> of course we shall probe the government in committee about those propositions <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting second reading debate on an extremely rushed bill <e> <s> i emphasise that the bill has been rushed indeed many of my noble friends have said so <e> <s> i say that because until very recently indeed as recently as th march last the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is he not aware that in non-manual employment there is a whole range of what we might call voluntary redundancy arrangements <e> <s> in other words there are arrangements where the employees are not made redundant unless they volunteer to be made redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the union has denied categorically and on oath that five approaches have been made to it <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the secretary of state agree that it is very important in areas where there have been closures of mines to ensure that alternative employment is provided of a kind that the manual workers who have been made redundant can perform <e> <s> in south wales when there were pit closures the alternative work provided was often in light industry <e> <s> the miners who had been made redundant were not able to take advantage of the light industrial work available because no training was made available and no other work was available for them in heavy industry <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> would he not agree that the noble lord lord scanlon was talking about the legal profession rather than the dockers <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the remarks made by those on the committee opposing the amendment <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that this is not an attempt to reconstitute the scheme <e> <s> on the contrary it gives the government an opportunity to introduce something different <e> <s> if it is felt that the present scheme has all kinds of difficulties needs modernising and does not enable the industry to be profitable enough here is the opportunity to produce something in consultation with both sides of the industry <e> <s> in the final analysis the draft can be laid <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> it is not my intention to press this amendment <e> <s> we shall later be discussing the disposal of assets and we shall be moving a number of amendments when we have some points to be made about the disposal of assets at market rates or not at market rates <e>", "<cs> the ministers response was disappointing <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mellish said even if the government did not accept the amendment it would have been possible for them to say that they would consider seriously what had been said with a view to introducing an amendment on report which would help deal with the fears of the workforce about the re-emergence of casualisation <e> <s> that is why i tabled the amendment about convention <e> <s> many of the ministers comments do not stand up because when convention was introduced those who drafted it were well aware of the changes taking place in the industry <e>", "<cs> yes they deal roughly with the same issue <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that we have had such a disappointing response from the government <e> <s> as i said earlier we are not really wedded to the wording in our amendments and if the government would only indicate that they understood the concern felt on these benches about what happens when the dock labour scheme no longer exists we would feel a little happier than we do this afternoon <e> <s> as it is i shall not press this amendment today <e> <s> we will think further about the situation <e> <s> we may be in a very different situation by the time we reach report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers very detailed explanation but still a little disappointed by it <e> <s> as i said when i moved the amendment originally and in that respect i was supported by the noble lord lord rochester assurances had been given in the other place by the minister of state regarding dockers clubs medical centres etc <e> <s> and that being so it would be a very good thing to write it on to the face of the bill so that those who were concerned about what would happen to the property would have the reassurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking all noble lords who have participated in this very interesting and well-informed debate <e> <s> i should like to reinforce what has been said by a number of noble lords that this is really not a womens debate at all <e> <s> i am sorry that more noble lords did not participate but i am very grateful to those who did because i believe that they had a lot to contribute <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his reply and also the noble lord lord renton for his intervention <e> <s> of course i am aware that the contribution to the fund now only stands at per cent <e> <s> it was concern lest the cessation of the contribution altogether could involve some designs upon the whole system of social insurance for the future that led me to table the amendment <e> <s> i shall consider very carefully what the minister said <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find that a rather unsatisfactory response <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that the unemployment pay is up-rated which of course everyone understands <e> <s> but that is not what we are talking about <e> <s> we are speaking of people who have made a contribution and as a result of that contribution receive either a private personal pension or the benefit of an occupational pension <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what the minister said and i found it disappointing <e> <s> he described what is happening now <e> <s> if that is so what is the necessity for a change in the wording as proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> i have little to add to what has already been said in support of the amendments except that we on these benches thoroughly support them <e> <s> we agree with the noble lord lord seebohm that they give the bill a more human face <e> <s> it is compassionate to ensure that people are notified if their benefit is to be withdrawn and also that at the same time they are informed about how they should set about making an appeal <e> <s> that is important to people in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> from these benches i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i shall not add to what has been said so ably in its support <e> <s> we had a comprehensive and good debate yesterday on the question of child care <e> <s> it was agreed on all sides that child care arrangements in this country are quite inadequate <e> <s> there are not enough child minders <e> <s> those who are available are often not registered <e> <s> therefore the mother will have to make many inquiries to make sure that the childminder on offer can provide sufficiently appropriate facilities <e> <s> there is a lack of local authority provision and there are only very few workplace nurseries available <e> <s> i believe that according to a recent survey about employers were providing workplace nurseries <e> <s> those that exist are mostly in the public services <e> <s> therefore anybody looking for child care will have to spend quite a bit of time to ensure that the child care is adequate and appropriate for the child <e> <s> the amendment is therefore most sensible <e> <s> i hope that the minister will see his way to accepting it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was kind enough to send me and a number of other members of the committee a whole list of items which he said would be likely to be contained in regulations <e> <s> is he saying that among what are the reasonable circumstances of a case having regard to relevant factors and a whole list of other matters is included voluntary work <e> <s> does that include looking after people at home looking after children or whatever <e> <s> would voluntary work cover that <e> <s> i am referring to the list that the noble lord was kind enough to send <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the government are already in trouble with the international labour office in relation to legislation already on the statute book <e> <s> in the present circumstances therefore is it not unwise to contemplate further legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that less than half of occupational pensions are up-rated with the cost of living index and that to the best of my knowledge none are up-rated in line with the wages index <e> <s> it could be argued that even occupational pensioners have not shared in the general prosperity as evisaged in the question put by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> my noble friends and i decided not to move our amendment in favour of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> it is a modest amendment <e> <s> so far as we know the government have not said what they envisage will follow after the board and the scheme have disappeared <e> <s> there are still substantial hazards in the industry <e> <s> health and safety are therefore very important <e> <s> as i said in committee in london docks last year there were seven reported fatalities <e> <s> i understand that industrial injuries are still quite common <e> <s> health safety and welfare are therefore important matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that there are industries which are regarded as more hazardous than normal in respect of which there are special provisions over and above those contained in the health and safety at work act <e>", "<cs> my lords where we have a scheme such as the dock work scheme it has the effect of setting a standard for the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that response from the minister extremely disappointing <e> <s> there are alternative amendments if it is felt that the board is not the appropriate body i o make the recommendations suggested in the amendment <e> <s> we tabled an alternative amendment suggesting that the secretary of state who has a public responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome those assurances from the minister <e> <s> in view of that statement he might have accepted the amendment because that is what it amounts to <e> <s> he said that he virtually accepted more or less everything that i and the noble lord lord rochester had said <e> <s> that being the case it might have been reasonable for him to have accepted the amendment and to have written in something on third reading <e> <s> however i do not intend to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i shall read with care in <e>", "<cs> we support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> i realise of course that if the amendment is carried amendment no <e> <s> which i have tabled cannot be called <e> <s> in tabling amendment no <e> <s> i had in mind much the same purpose as the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> all the amendments in the group are concerned as i understand it with what we believe to be the governments intention to tighten up arrangements for entitlement to unemployment pay <e>", "<cs> it is consequential <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble earl lord russell in this amendment <e> <s> to some extent i spoke to it on the first amendment <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i am against this clause altogether <e> <s> however i put my name to the amendments tabled in the name of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale because it seemed to me that it would be better to have at least this amelioration of the clause rather than the clause as it stands in the bill at present <e>", "<cs> i will <e>", "<cs> if i formally move the amendment the noble earl can make his point <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord mottistone on this issue <e> <s> at second reading i said that in principle i supported the ec directive on equal treatment and of course i do <e> <s> the intention is admirable <e> <s> however we have a problem in this country which successive governments have repeatedly failed to address <e> <s> the state pension scheme has different retirement ages or different pension ages for men and women <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now reached the final stage of the passage of the bill through parliament <e> <s> we on this side of the house have never viewed it with favour <e> <s> not only do we not like the bill we strongly object to the manner in which it has been introduced <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mellish has constantly reminded the house it is after all not very long since we were told that the government had no intention of doing away with the dock labour scheme <e> <s> then quite suddenly a statement was made to both houses followed immediately by a white paper and a bill the very next day <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the committee of experts expressed the view that the cumulative effect of various pieces of legislation introduced by this government since could by virtue of their complexity and extent constitute an incursion upon the rights guaranteed by the constitution <e> <s> in view of that fact is it not unwise for the government to be considering yet further incursions into the role of industrial law as has already been indicated in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the engineering industry training board has an excellent reputation for training women in the engineering industry <e> <s> is he <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> as he said the amendment is rather similar to amendments moved from these benches when the bill was in committee except that we return to it this afternoon having had the benefit of the ministers reply last time round and as the noble earl said the wording has been amended to take some account of what he then said <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in committee that my main argument is against what is proposed in clause and the schedule <e> <s> that is still my position <e> <s> we debated this matter at length in committee and i do not wish to repeat all the arguments which were so well made by other noble lords <e> <s> however i repeat that my main objection is that we have here two systems in operation <e> <s> there is the industrial injuries scheme introduced in which is a system of no fault benefit for which contributions are paid <e> <s> to establish a right to weekly benefit which by no means compensates for loss of salary let alone any cost for pain and suffering an injured employee only has to demonstrate that the accident or injury arose out of or in the course of his employment to qualify for benefit under the scheme <e>", "<cs> hospital expenses would also be included in the provision as the noble lord says <e> <s> there is the limit of <e> <s> so there would be some amelioration <e> <s> as i said earlier i would prefer a situation where the clause simply did not exist at all because i see no justification for it whatsoever <e> <s> i say that after a great deal of discussion and consultation outside the chamber with the noble lord lord skelmersdale who has been good enough to send me some material including the touche ross report to which much reference has been made <e> <s> but in default of having a situation where the clause simply does not appear i support the amendment of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway because it provides some amelioration of a situation which i otherwise find quite unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> as i indicated earlier when i spoke on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway it has always been my intention to oppose the clause altogether <e> <s> my only reason for supporting the previous amendment was that it seemed slightly to ameliorate the clause in two major respects <e>", "<cs> of course they will have to my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour i intend to be very brief <e> <s> i simply say that i agree with what the noble baroness said in regard to this series of amendments <e> <s> of course as long ago as the occupational pensions board of which i am a member was recommending that there ought to be equal pension ages in the state retirement scheme because many occupational schemes are geared to what happens in the state scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is also attached to the amendment which i rise to support <e> <s> i supported a similar amendment in committee <e> <s> i did so because i believe that the ec directive on which the present clause in the bill is said to be based is capable of a different interpretation from that which appears to have been placed upon it by the governments lawyers <e> <s> i believe that the counsel who has advised the cbi and i have seen a copy of the advice has a very strong point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the construction industry training board to which reference has been made is extremely concerned about what happens in regard to resources <e> <s> it wants to know what will happen if there is no statutory training levy <e> <s> its belief is that the needs of that industry will require a great deal more resourcing than the government appear to think because it also has a health and safety obligation in the industry <e> <s> will the minister be kind enough to answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that although the situation may not be very good at the moment it would have been a great deal worse without any statutory boards at all <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another short bill on employment <e> <s> as with social securitywe seem to have a short bill in this area every year <e> <s> like its predecessor in many respects it is a nasty little bill <e> <s> i say that even though i welcome the ministers comments about the importance of women in the labour market <e> <s> he has claimed that it is an important measure concerned with the equality of opportunity for women and young people <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister reminded the house that he is a social <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house in view of the welcome commitment in the white paper to the need for improving training and prospects for women what is especially being done in those areas in public service and the civil service generally <e>", "<cs> my lords how do the government expect the single european market to function effectively without some degree of harmonisation on the social front particularly in relation to labour law <e> <s> how will a level playing field be established from the standpoint of freedom of movement between countries of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of sounding repetitive may i also from these benches welcome the noble lord lord henley to his new post <e> <s> we wish to say as others have said this morning how much we on these benches appreciated the unfailing courtesy with which the noble lord lord skelmersdale dealt with the often critical and hostile comments on social security from this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell the house what arrangements are being made for continuing consultation with the organisations representative of staff in the national health service <e> <s> by that i do not just mean with the bma important though that organisation is but <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform the house of the position now in relation to bridging pensions <e> <s> noble lords will recall that this issue arises specifically because we have unequal pension ages in this country <e> <s> in the debate on the report to which reference has already been made it was said on behalf of the government that this matter would be raised in brussels <e> <s> indeed we recommended that it should be <e> <s> the lack of any positive view on this question is causing a great deal of uncertainty in the pensions world <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the comments made by my noble friend lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i well remember the comments made by the noble lord lord trefgarne on second reading <e> <s> looking at them again they appear to represent a slender chain on which to suspend a heavy weight of amendments <e> <s> as has already been pointed out they constitute a large proportion of the printed matter before your lordships house <e> <s> six pages that is one-third of the marshalled list consist of government amendments which in themselves appear to constitute almost another bill in the area of industrial training <e> <s> that issue has been a matter of constant concern to this house and clearly there is a great need for debate <e> <s> it is also clear that we ought to have had a proper bill with an explanatory memorandum and a note of the financial considerations involved and should have been given the opportunity of a second reading debate <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting short debate but i must say that i found the ministers response extremely disappointing <e> <s> my noble friend lady lockwood and the noble baroness lady seear are of course right to say that we must come to terms with the demographic changes that have been referred to on both sides of the committee <e> <s> we have a workforce of which women constitute per cent <e> <s> and therefore we have to take some steps to make employment available for women who are likely to need time off to have children <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on this subject <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who contributed <e> <s> i much appreciate some of the comments made by the minister because they answer to some degree the points made by my noble friend lord stoddart and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the minister made it clear that the governments view is that there is no risk of passing on the virus at work there is no workplace risk and where there is no risk there should be no discrimination which is what my amendment is all about <e>", "<cs> i said when i moved the amendment that i was not exactly wedded to its wording and that i was aware that there were technical difficulties involved with it <e> <s> however i had hoped that the minister would give us some kind of assurance on the way in which legislation of this kind would be dealt with in future <e> <s> as my noble friend lady lockwood has said the eoc is certainly not at all backward in reviewing legislation <e> <s> it has recently reviewed the legislation quite extensively but as my noble friend has already said the government tend not to take any notice of that <e> <s> it is because governments tend not to take any notice either of the eoc or very often of the health and safety commission that i thought it would be a good <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the whole point of this clause is to emphasise the fact that the woman should have the choice <e> <s> it has nothing to do with good cause the woman must have the choice <e> <s> that is why we tabled this amendment <e> <s> the government say that women have a choice about working underground <e>", "<cs> this clause seeks to remove restrictions governing the employment of young people <e> <s> we sought to amend it through our amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we have failed to make any impression and therefore all that is left to us now is to oppose the motion that the clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may finish my argument <e> <s> we already have examples of this kind <e> <s> we all agree that they are regrettable <e> <s> these accidents happen now <e> <s> they are much more likely to continue to happen if there are no restrictions for to year-olds <e> <s> we shall have circumstances where young people are tired and therefore more accident prone than they would otherwise be <e> <s> so i think i am quite justified in referring to accidents which have already happened and pointing out that if we are not careful and if the clause stands and becomes operative we are likely to see an increase in this kind of regrettable occurrence <e>", "<cs> i have listened with some attention to the noble lord but i am afraid i remain unconvinced <e> <s> i agreed with the noble lord lord rochester when he said that and year-olds should ideally devote their time to training and certainly not to a situation in which they may be exploited by having to work much longer hours than they might otherwise have to do were restrictions in force <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment moved by the noble <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord agree that if an individual has to lose money in order to pursue these activities which can lead eventually to the employers benefit he is less likely to want to undertake them <e>", "<cs> i find that response extremely disappointing <e> <s> the tucs view is that the clause as it stands would place severe limits on the rights to paid time off both for trade union duties and for training <e> <s> the tuc points out that the clause would do so by removing the qualifying term industrial relations from the present legislation and replacing it with employer agreement on the extent to which the union is recognised <e> <s> that is the core of our argument <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the governments response to this amendment <e> <s> as the minister said we have attempted to go some part of the way towards meeting a case made by the <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention to press the amendments tonight <e> <s> i am grateful for the explanation given by the minister for opposing them <e> <s> i shall study his explanation with some care and decide whether or not we should proceed further on those questions at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy with the ministers response <e> <s> i thought that we had made a fairly strong case on this side of the chamber <e> <s> we contend that it is unfair to an individual applicant in a situation where he may feel that he had a good case simply to be subject to the decision of a chairman sitting alone <e> <s> as has been pointed out by a number of noble lords on this side of the committee there is the major question of jurisdiction which has already been raised by the law society <e> <s> with respect i do not believe that the minister answered that satisfactorily at all <e>", "<cs> why did the government take the trouble to introduce a series of pieces of legislation requiring ballots before industrial action and that such ballots should render unions able to claim immunity if such ballots did not also give any kind of protection to the employees <e>", "<cs> as the minister rightly said this commences the series of amendments to which we took some exception yesterday when we protested that the amendments went far beyond what we thought was proper for a bill of this kind and should really form the basis of an entirely separate industrial training bill <e> <s> that is still our position although tonight we do not intend to oppose the amendments in the lobbies <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to take the opportunity to raise a few questions with the minister and to make a few comments <e>", "<cs> i do not want to repeat what i have already said as regards the preceding amendments but we are given the opportunity of saying again that we are totally opposed to what the government are doing regarding the training commission <e> <s> i repeat that in our view there is little evidence that training will be any better handled under the arrangements that the government are proposing rather than under the training commission <e>", "<cs> as the minister said this series of amendments covers the governments intentions in relation to industry training boards <e> <s> the minister said when he presented them to the chamber that a new framework was needed <e> <s> i believe that he was quoting from the original white paper <e> <s> if so is this the framework <e> <s> if it is it seems to me that it needs to be greatly fleshed out <e> <s> since we have not had a great deal of time to consider these amendments we on these benches intend to reserve our position on them and come back on report <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to know that i do not find the ministers response to this amendment satisfactory <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear said this is an <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minster tell the house whether this fly is the result of a mutation <e> <s> do we know how it has suddenly arisen in the dorset area <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very disappointing response from the minister <e> <s> i am very sad that despite the fact that we debated the matter in committee and brought back an amendment to meet some of the objections raised the minister does not find our amendment acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that response <e> <s> in many respects i found it very useful and helpful <e> <s> i am very glad to learn that the updated version of <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches fully support the amendment <e> <s> in our view it is very necessary to give support to women who return to work after pregnancy and in particular to ensure that training and other special arrangements can be made for them to play a full part in employment following disruption of their working pattern <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from these benches to say that we are happy to support this amendment just as we supported the private members bill introduced recently by my noble friend lady phillips <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely surprised at the ministers response but i cannot see that the amendment if put into legislation would lead to wholesale abuse <e> <s> it states quite clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am altogether surprised at the response from the minister to this amendment <e> <s> i cannot follow his line of argument <e> <s> he seems to accept that it is necessary for an employer to take his workforce with him if he is serious about training <e> <s> yet at the same time the minister is not willing to have written onto the face of the bill an obligation on the part of the minister to consult representative organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a most disappointing reply <e> <s> the minister said that employers have not had the opportunity to offer training in the past <e> <s> on this side of the house we have repeatedly said that employers have had opportunities in preceding years and have not done what ought to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment as i do not intend to press the matter at this hour of the night <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall withdraw the amendment not because i accept what the minister has to say but simply because of the lateness of the hour and because it does not seem appropriate to divide the house at this time <e> <s> quite frankly i do not regard the response as at all satisfactory <e> <s> i do not see why it is impossible to give the sort of guarantees in relation to pensions for which we have asked in this modest amendment <e> <s> after all the individuals concerned have been covered by their present pension schemes and have not expected that there would be a change in their circumstances in quite that way <e> <s> they have not been responsible for the change in their circumstances <e> <s> it has been brought about by government policy and by a separate piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give support to the bill <e> <s> i am sure that the house is grateful and we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for introducing it and giving us the opportunity to debate this quite important issue <e> <s> there have been a number of distinguished speakers to date <e> <s> i am not a lawyer and i speak from my experience as a former trade union official <e> <s> i believe that the bill is a modest attempt to rectify an injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that in the main the wages councils which are still in existence cover relatively poorly paid and poorly qualified people often from ethnic minority groups who are the most exploitable people in the workforce <e> <s> does he further agree that it would be in the public interest to ensure that those people have some continuing form of protection <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please tell the house what evidence there is to support the statement that wages councils keep wages down <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is a slender sample upon which to base far-reaching proposals in relation to closed shops <e> <s> is it not a fact that closed shops now exist only where there has been a substantial majority in a ballot of the workforce <e> <s> i believe that per cent <e> <s> of the workforce must be in favour <e> <s> is it not an interference with democracy to try to come along now and make further changes in the current legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be aware that we on these benches have been most worried by government amendments proposed in earlier stages <e> <s> at report stage we did not press our amendments to a division but my noble friend lord mccarthy made clear that we had a number of concerns <e> <s> we were worried principally on health and safety grounds <e> <s> indeed when speaking about the exemptions the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but the whole burden of my argument is that in our opinion this is not a question of discrimination but a health and safety issue <e> <s> we are concerned about health and safety here and not discrimination <e> <s> that is the difference between us and the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i said on second reading that this was a rag-bag of a bill with a number of disparate issues jumbled together <e> <s> as it has progressed through your lordships house it has become even more of a rag-bag than before <e> <s> as several of your lordships have said we had several lengthy amendments dealing with other subjects added during the bills passage <e> <s> we had amendments dealing with industrial training added to the bill when as we said there should have been a bill on the subject <e> <s> the amendments indicated just how unsatisfactory is the governments approach to training <e> <s> the government as we know are absolutely committed to the notion that industrial training must be employer-led despite the fact that this has not led to good training in the past <e> <s> bodies with a good record in this field like the eitb and the citb are apparently to be replaced with successor bodies which will not have a statutory role <e> <s> if my information is correct and this has not been denied by the government the ending of the statutory role for the eitb and the switch to entirely voluntary training will mean the loss of money from the european social fund since it is only available to a country which itself spends some public money on training <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that small businesses have been responsible for some employment growth <e> <s> would it not be an awful pity if this employment creation were to be inhibited because of present interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that noble lords on this side of the house have always supported employment creation whether through small firms or large firms and that that remains the policy on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we welcome the order which as the minister said was unanimously approved by the board and the training commission <e> <s> i thank the minister for his explanation of the order <e> <s> he is of course right to say that the hotel and catering industry in this country is immensely important and that training in it is also of maximum importance <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not absurd to expect workers to settle for per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> as has been the situation in the national health service in the light of the large increases which are acknowledged to be paid to directors of substantial enterprises <e> <s> will the government look at the issue more from a social justice point of view than appears to be the case at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords when dealing with the question of justification do the government consider that there is a role for arbitration in these matters <e> <s> why cannot that be used in the current dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the gross disparity in employment figures in various regions of this country <e> <s> for example is he aware that in september the figure for various areas of glasgow was per cent <e> <s> and that for manchester central and for glasgow central respectively it was per cent <e> <s> is he further aware that the figures for various other areas where there has been manufacturing industry are also very high <e> <s> does he agree that although the figures in the south-east are as low as and per cent <e> <s> the gross disparity between areas where there has been heavy manufacturing industry and those where there is service employment is quite unacceptable <e> <s> what do the government intend to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return to the question that i put to the noble earl <e> <s> i asked him specifically what the government intended to do about the high unemployment rates in the areas that i mentioned <e> <s> will he be kind enough to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the bill presented to the house for the second time by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> we are all grateful to him for his persistence in bringing the bill back for your lordships attention <e> <s> i hope that in the intervening period since the last second reading debate on st october the government have had time to reflect upon the good sense and fairness represented by the proposed measure <e>", "<cs> my lords is any information available as to a possible link between the pest and pollution of our rivers <e> <s> if so what steps can be taken to deal with the pollution especially in view of the privatisation programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that response which is encouraging <e> <s> on the other hand is he aware that training disabled people is an expensive though very worthwhile process <e> <s> in fact i understand that it can cost as much as between and a year to train a badly disabled person <e> <s> would it not be a good idea to have a national tec with that kind of responsibility able to co-ordinate and with specialist resources and specialist personnel to carry out that task <e>", "<cs> my lords considering his earlier reply perhaps i may come back to the minister and ask him in view of his statement that local activity is all important whether tecs have been urged to establish contacts with their local committees on the employment of disabled people or other local groups concerned with the disabled <e>", "<cs> as the committee will know we on these benches support the bill <e> <s> we supported it in both second reading debates <e> <s> i rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> i do not want this evening in the limited time at our disposal to go over the history of the reasons for the bill which he has done very effectively <e> <s> however my recollection of the second reading debate is the same as that of my noble friend lord mccarthy and the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> a prime point made by the government was that as drafted the bill was open-ended and it would give a union the opportunity to call a dispute when the mandate that had already been given by a vote was in effect exhausted because so much time had elapsed since the ballot had taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that response is he aware that opas which does a very good job on a purely voluntary basis is currently suffering from additional financial constraints due to the fact that there has been some publicity about the governments intentions in relation to opas for the future which has meant that to some extent voluntary donations have dried up <e> <s> is the minister prepared to give consideration to some interim assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the governments position on gchq is in direct contravention to that stated in their new employment bill which quite definitely makes provision for the right to belong or not to belong <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what encouragement abta is giving to its member firms to encourage further training in the industry <e> <s> can he further say how much attention is being paid to language training <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment to which i have put my name is a further attempt to persuade the government to accept the bill which has been introduced by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> the reasons for the bill have been stated on many occasions in this house <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat them at length tonight <e> <s> as we have said the bill is an attempt to rectify an injustice which arises from the imposition on a union of the obligation to ballot yet again if the days allowed to it under present legislation have been eroded by actions initiated by the employers in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord will again give way <e> <s> does he not agree that the issue had changed <e> <s> of course it is true that the circumstances have not changed but the issue upon which the members were balloted had changed in that the offer was different <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> as i said earlier i support both amendments and i am sorry that the first amendment did not attract government support <e> <s> i should like to take the minister up on one point that he made <e> <s> he said and my noble friend has emphasised this point that he believes the four weeks are sacred <e> <s> in the dock work dispute the tgwu did not have four weeks <e> <s> the four weeks were totally absorbed by legal proceedings which is what this bill is all about <e> <s> we should be happy if the union had four weeks <e> <s> the whole point of the attempted legislation is that the union does not have four weeks unless there is a provision such as is proposed in the amendment <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it did <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that according to a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the governments own figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware particularly in the light of his last statement that according to the governments own figures the number of jobs in manufacturing industry fell by in the year to november <e> <s> does not that support the concern that the cbi expressed yesterday that manufacturing industry is standing on the brink of a recession which will result in further job losses <e> <s> is not the decline in manufacturing industry a reflection of what is happening in the regions because it is in the regions where manufacturing industry employment was strongest <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister consider that perhaps we have rather too much trade union legislation <e> <s> it might be a good idea to look at repealing some that does not seem to have had much impact <e> <s> for example the commissioner for the rights of trade union members has had little work to do <e> <s> would it not be a good idea to transfer some of the resources to the equal opportunities commission which has a great deal of work to do and very little money with which to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i should be grateful that the code we are now discussing is an improvement on the first draft <e> <s> for once in a while the government appear to have taken some measure of the criticisms levelled at their first draft not only by the tuc but by the cbi and others directly concerned with industrial relations <e> <s> however i really cannot welcome even this draft since it is based on and derives from legislation that i believe to be basically unfair and one-sided <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> can he say whether the government would consider producing a code for employers concerning good industrial relations practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank the minister for his clear explanation of this order <e> <s> we on these benches certainly do not oppose increasing these limits <e> <s> i note that workers as one would expect want an increase in line with the wages index and i can understand that <e> <s> however on the other hand i think that in current circumstances the amount which is roughly in line with current inflation figures is broadly acceptable <e> <s> with those comments we have no objection to offer to the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however will he take account of the fact that the uncertainty is creating a great deal of concern among the staff <e> <s> quite obviously morale is not improved by the uncertainties surrounding the issue <e> <s> will he bear in mind that in such circumstances very often highly skilled staff can obtain jobs elsewhere <e> <s> if we wish to maintain a reasonable standard of staff at the citb it is necessary to take account of all these factors <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back to the minister on his first reply <e> <s> he stated that there would be consultation and that such consultations were proceeding <e> <s> he referred to consultation with employers <e> <s> can he tell the house what consultations are taking place with organisations which represent employees within the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that personal pensions are currently being advertised with the statement that the incentive being provided could amount to up to <e> <s> is it not immoral to persuade people to gamble with their future in this way <e> <s> what will it cost if people seek to rejoin serps at a later date <e> <s> will it not then have been a very costly exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement and for the clarity with which he did so <e> <s> however i am sure that he will not be surprised to learn that we on this side of the house find it less than satisfactory <e> <s> it would appear that the government are continuing their policy of distancing themselves from training and leaving it to other people <e> <s> that is what is involved in the concept of employer-led training which we have discussed on innumerable occasions in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but is it not government policy at least that is the way it seems to me to run down enterprises that they would then want to privatise <e> <s> this seems to be a typical example <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reply will he say whether the government will reconsider their attitude to the european directive on parental leave <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back on the noble lords reply to my european directive question <e> <s> if the government do not believe in european directives do they believe in parental leave <e> <s> what are they doing to encourage employers to adopt parental leave systems themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> at first sight it looks very uncontroversial <e> <s> it is about public service pensions and such schemes have a record of leading the way in pension provision for employees <e> <s> public sector pensions for example are index-linked in payment as the minister indicated <e> <s> the private occupational pension sector is still far from achieving that desirable objective <e> <s> i believe that in years time perhaps even sooner our successors will not understand how we could tolerate a situation in which the worth of a pension steadily declined from the day it started payment <e> <s> we shall <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that acas has a panel of very <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to apologise for the fact that i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> unfortunately i have a long-standing engagement and i shall have to leave early <e> <s> i am very sorry for that because i think that it will be a very interesting debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take into account in his continuing consideration the fact that other member states of the ec often have a far greater number of holidays than is the case in this country <e> <s> it might aid the bunching to which the minister has referred if we had some bunching at the other end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> will the provision that is to be made cover the situation where elderly people have resources which have run out and where they simply do not have the money available to meet the costs of residential care where that is required <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble baroness for her response to my question <e> <s> will she give some attention to the interim situation before these provisions come into operation <e> <s> according to information that i have received from age concern there are a number of cases outstanding where people require this care and simply cannot find the resources to pay for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however is there not a problem that we may not be able to qualify for european social fund money if we abandon as is the intention the grant and levy system which we have at present <e> <s> i understand that one of the qualifying bases for obtaining european social fund money is that there must be an input of public funds and the grant and levy system qualified in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords this side of the house does not oppose these two orders and i would like to thank the minister for the clarity with which he has presented them <e> <s> however as he said these are very important industries and i wish to take a little time to make a few points about them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the independent scrutineer to whom reference was made has been granted two injuctions against the newspaper that orginated the story and is currently suing for libel <e> <s> in such circumstances is it not better to leave the matter in the hands of the courts <e>", "<cs> we on these benches accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that explanation <e> <s> it is not my intention to press the amendment this afternoon <e> <s> as i said when i introduced the amendment it is a probing amendment to explore further the governments view on the proposition that there should be a levelling up rather than a levelling down <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation which is extremely helpful <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are prepared to accept the ministers explanation <e>", "<cs> i gave notice of my intention to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill largely because i raised the matter at second reading as a result of representations that i had received from local government pensions advisers <e> <s> although i received an explanation from the minister at that time i am still unclear as to whether it meets the points that were made by the advisers <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that very clear explanation <e> <s> i still have some concerns because it seems to me that there will be a worsening for some people <e> <s> i do not see how that can be avoided <e> <s> i should like to ask him one question to make sure that i have it quite right <e> <s> did i hear him correctly to the effect that if people are required to rejoin the service because their skills are needed the better conditions will still be available to them <e> <s> is that what he said <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much for that extra clarification <e> <s> obviously i do not intend to press the matter at this stage <e> <s> i tabled the motion because i wanted to secure from the minister a detailed explanation of what the clause really meant in the light of the advice and recommendations i had had from the people who have been advising me <e> <s> i shall look very carefully at what the minister said and perhaps take some further advice if i need to do so <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord carter for introducing the debate this afternoon on this important topic <e> <s> most noble lords who have spoken have agreed that during the past years we have seen a widening gulf between those who are doing well out of the market-led philosophy of the s and those who are doing less well and in many instances very badly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement and i congratulate him on the very clear way in which he has presented this new scheme to the house <e> <s> i understand that the scheme has the support of the tuc and the cbi both of which i gather have wished it a fair wind <e> <s> in such circumstances we on this side of the house certainly do not want to adopt a negative attitude to it <e> <s> indeed as the house will know we have constantly raised the issue of training we have constantly pressed for further resources to be devoted to it and we have constantly raised the whole issue of training as a major question for the economy of this country and for our future well-being <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation of the regulations <e> <s> however he will not be surprised to learn that there is little connected with this monstrous system of taxation that can be welcomed by this side of the house <e> <s> yesterday we had a debate in which some of the legitimate criticisms were voiced from all sides <e> <s> i do not wish to cover that ground again today <e> <s> although the government have been compelled by public agitation and concern to make the concessions in the regulations they do not appear to benefit as many people as was indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house the steps that have been taken to persuade employers to retain older employees <e> <s> will he also assure the house that the era in which redundancy is disguised as early retirement has ended <e> <s> i am sure that he will be aware that many employers in past years made employees redundant at the age of or so but called it early retirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that over jobs about a fifth i believe of the total have been lost in farming in the past five years <e> <s> is he further aware that there is no indication that the decline has been arrested <e> <s> can the minister say what steps are planned to halt the advance of rural poverty in some of these areas which will be added to enormously by the burden of the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the social security bill which is before the house this afternoon is as other noble lords have said a mixture of provisions dealing with social security benefits and occupational pensions <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister for the way in which he has presented the bill which is quite complicated <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for his very kind references to me <e> <s> incidentally i am a member of the occupational pensions board but i am one of the lay members and would not claim to have any great area of professional expertise unlike the noble earl who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is bad for industrial morale if workers see people at the top of their companies awarding themselves large increases when the workers are told that they should keep their claims within the rate of inflation <e> <s> is it not inevitable that our competitive position will be damaged if industrial morale is damaged in that way <e>", "<cs> i rise to express my support for the amendment moved by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> as he indicated to the committee the wording of the amendment is taken directly from an article in the social charter <e> <s> we debated the charter recently in this chamber as a result of the report by the select committee of which i had the honour to be a member <e> <s> it is well known that the united kingdom government alone of all those in the community opposed the charter outright <e> <s> apparently they were not willing to accept it even as a basis for negotiation <e> <s> however there are surely aspects of the charter with which the government would be in agreement <e> <s> among them is the emphasis on equality of treatment <e> <s> that aspect is dealt with in the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government have not hesitated to do that in the sphere of employment which has surely been a bonanza for the legal professions <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> on second reading i said that i regarded this clause which abolishes future rights to the reduced earnings allowance as a further attack by the government on the industrial injuries scheme <e> <s> at present the scheme provides for a reduced earnings allowance <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised at the ministers response although i am a little disappointed by it <e> <s> i was gratified to learn from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that he still felt at least some emotional attachment to the industrial injuries scheme <e> <s> i hope that that might cause him to support the stance that we take in relation to it on this side of the chamber <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he say whether the government will be prepared to look at the possibility of instituting some form of contracting-out arrangement in respect of schemes which meet a certain minimum standard <e> <s> we still have per cent <e> <s> of employees not covered by adequate schemes <e> <s> it seems to me that if one were to pass the proposals in the bill those people would still suffer <e> <s> on the other hand in order to meet the governments point that is that there are now numerous schemes which offer a good standard of occupational provision would it be possible to have a contracting-out arrangement so that if as i said the scheme met a certain standard it contracted out and people did not receive entitlement to the benefit <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> we are anxious to protect people who have no cover <e> <s> there are still many people in that position especially in the manual industries <e> <s> for example people who have a chequered work pattern who do not work for an employer for very long and who move around <e> <s> of course that is a feature of the construction industry <e> <s> however if the minister will at least look again at the matter i shall be most willing not to press the amendments <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what he has to say on report <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i shall withdraw the amendment and consider it <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support the amendment moved by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> i do not intend at this time of night to add to the arguments that he advanced in such detail so specifically and so well except to point out to the government that a number of their own statements and documents recently before both houses indicate that they are concerned about the provision of child care and wish to encourage women back into the labour market on a part-time or even a full-time basis where appropriate <e> <s> one of the objectives of the amendment is to put flesh on the bones of that intention <e> <s> i hope that the government accept it <e>", "<cs> at this time of night i do not intend to say any more than that we on these benches fully support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister has not responded to the constructive suggestion made by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> we on this side accept that there must be some disqualification <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks there was a disqualification of six weeks for years <e> <s> it is a question of the length of period <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the general intention of the amendment moved by the noble earl <e> <s> as i understand it the intention of the bill is to ensure that pensions maintain their purchasing power at least to a limited extent <e> <s> i did not understand the bill to discriminate against final salary schemes or as providing an incentive for employers to switch or redefine their schemes as money purchase schemes <e>", "<cs> is the minister speaking to all the amendments in this grouping <e> <s> if so i have one small point to make as regards amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the point i have to make is a very small one <e> <s> the amendment proposes to leave out months rounded to the nearest whole month and insert complete months <e> <s> as i understand it that formula results in a slight reduction <e> <s> it is in fact a very small reduction being one-twelfth of per cent <e> <s> if per cent <e> <s> was the amount in question <e> <s> i wonder why it has been felt necessary to introduce a reduction into the bill even though a slight one <e> <s> i hope that my reading of what is proposed is correct <e>", "<cs> i shall reserve what i have to say about uprating until i come to my own amendment <e> <s> i cannot agree with the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone and he would not expect me to since i do not agree with the per cent <e> <s> limit proposed by the government <e> <s> i am surprised that in these days when inflation is running at around per cent <e> <s> the noble lord should think it enough to provide pensioners with only per cent <e> <s> i cannot think that he believes that all pension funds genuinely cannot afford to pay more <e> <s> many have substantial surpluses and contribution holidays have become quite an established rule in many companies <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment tonight <e> <s> i wanted to put on record the view from these benches that we think that eventually full indexation will have to be adopted <e> <s> i accept that the government proposal is a substantial step forward <e> <s> i have never disagreed with that fact <e> <s> it marks a step forward because there is a statutory obligation to index link to the per cent <e> <s> limit <e> <s> however i maintain that that will not be enough for the future as has been pointed out by the noble lord lord vinson <e> <s> he rightly makes the point that whether pension provision comes from private or public sources it has to be paid for by the people who are economically active <e> <s> that is absolutely right <e> <s> on the other hand we may be looking at different patterns of retirement for the future <e> <s> these are matters that may arise in the future and they will affect the way we look at future pension provision <e>", "<cs> i have little quarrel with this part of the bill because one of the issues with which i of ten had to deal as a trade union official was the concern of members as to who owned the surplus <e> <s> i was constantly asked who owns the surplus <e> <s> does the company have the right to take a contribution holiday <e> <s> can it do what it likes with the surplus <e> <s> is it not our money anyway <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> he is quite right i have no intention to press the amendment at this hour <e> <s> i know that in another place it was proposed that there should be both an ombudsman and a tribunal <e> <s> i deliberately did not do that because it seemed to me that my case would be strengthened if i stayed with the recommendation of the opb as i was a member of it and supported its recommendations <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will not be surprised to learn that i am not in favour of anything which encourages personal portable pensions <e> <s> the noble lord lord vinson stated that million citizens had opted to take personal private pensions <e> <s> most have opted against serps and not against occupational pensions <e> <s> they have been encouraged to do so largely by the government providing a bribe in the shape of a national insurance rebate which runs for a certain period <e> <s> that situation has enabled those who purvey personal private pensions to encourage many people to opt againt serps <e> <s> we have seen advertisements which state <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers explanation <e> <s> i did not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i merely tabled it to probe the matter of the independent trustee and the need to ensure that the welfare of members was given a very high priority in situations

explanation <e> <s> i shall study it carefully in <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i welcome the assurances he has given about the governments intentions to try to tighten up on the arrangements both in regard to notice and in regard to the disclosure of information by trustees <e> <s> i believe that these are steps forward <e> <s> we are dealing with pensions in the context of a bill and although we have put down many amendments generally speaking the main thrust of the legislation supports the policies which we advocate on this side of the <e>", "<cs> i am not at all surprised by the ministers response to the suggestion in the amendment <e> <s> however i felt that i had to put it down because on this side of the committee we feel strongly that there is a case for insisting that there should be a statutory requirement to have employee trustees on the boards of pension schemes <e> <s> i well remember that in a white paper was issued which provided for one-half of the scheme trustees to be drawn from the employees <e> <s> unfortunately that proposal never saw the light of day as legislation because the government of the day were not re-elected in <e> <s> however we hope for better things in <e> <s> when that happens i am sure that we shall move towards a situation in which employee trustees are involved under the statute <e>", "<cs> on the contrary the objective of legislation is to bring the people who are lagging behind up to the standard of best practice <e> <s> i do not see any contradiction at all in what i am saying <e> <s> unfortunately

what i am saying <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment at this hour and i had not intended to do so <e> <s> the amendment is an exploratory probing amendment as i wanted to know what the governments

at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers acceptance that there are some job losses will he say whether any steps are being taken to prevent loss of skills in the industry because it is important that we maintain skill training and skill levels in the industry <e> <s> if there is to be unemployment those skills will be lost <e> <s> are any

they were concerned about the word adequate <e> <s> i have looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he look at the text of the amendment in the name of the noble earl <e> <s> lord russell and myself <e> <s> the second paragraph states <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to learn that i regard his response as extremely disappointing <e> <s> he has not adequately dealt with the point made by myself and the noble earl lord russell that there still remains a large proportion of the working population perhaps what is now known as an underclass without any kind of occupational cover <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear made the point about the burdens being passed on to industry and commerce if everyone is now to be urged to introduce occupational pension schemes and that we would not noticeably be better served by making it a further requirement on the taxpayer or the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to learn that i am disappointed with that response <e> <s> it is quite clear that money will be saved by implementation of the clause and the government do not intend to devote the money saved to further benefits for the disabled and their carers as is proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his explanation of the governments position <e> <s> of course i understand that the main objective of pension schemes is to provide for an income in retirement <e> <s> that point is not in dispute <e> <s> however a number of pension schemes already provide for an early pension where there is sickness or disability <e> <s> all that my amendment sought to do was to nudge schemes in the direction of perhaps making this provision if they did not already do so <e> <s> that why the wording is entirely permissive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that trade unions representing workers on that project have complained about intimidation that their members face from management if they complain about standards of health and safety with threats of losing their jobs if they pursue their complaints <e> <s> is that not quite unacceptable and what do the government intend to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question that i asked earlier and with regard to the ministers response is he aware that i was speaking to a brief provided to me by the trades union congress and that i am willing to provide him with the information <e> <s> if i do so will he take some steps to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lord with the bill we have yet another piece of unnecessary legislation aimed at restricting trade union rights <e> <s> of course as was expected the government seek to justify their approach by claiming an improvement in industrial relations <e> <s> they attribute the apparent and i emphasise the word apparent decline in strikes in the private sector to the impact of their legislation <e> <s> however the past years have also seen a decline in the manufacturing sector and with that an increase in unemployment in that sector <e> <s> in my view that has had a far greater influence than the legislation which the government have introduced <e> <s> indeed that point was made with force by my noble friend lord mccarthy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> have the government yet responded to the ilo criticism of the piecemeal cumbersome and complex nature of our legislation <e> <s> will they codify and simplify in the way that the ilo propose <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the high failure rate among small businesses can the minister tell the house what action the government have taken or are taking in order to advise people who become self-employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel rather as though i have been savaged by a mad sheep <e> <s> it was with some surprise that i learnt that the <e>", "<cs> my lords after all it is the management and leadership of large companies that make the decisions <e> <s> they decide whether to close down a factory and move it elsewhere or what to do about a takeover bid <e> <s> the workers are not consulted <e> <s> all they are able to do is to react just as they react if there are price increases and rises in mortgage rates and they see the leaders of industry awarding themselves bloated salary increases <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> just to make labour party policy absolutely clear labour will also restore the right to take sympathy action in line with common practice in other ec countries <e> <s> in other words as i said in my opening speech what we propose is simply to move into line with europe <e> <s> this government may have to do so if they retain office sooner or later as a result of directives from europe <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> when <e>", "<cs> my lords was the minister not surprised to find that when the government enforced legislation which demanded that unions balloted on political funds every single union that balloted actually balloted for a political fund <e>", "<cs> they were a waste of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord dean of beswick for giving us the opportunity tonight even at this late hour to debate this important and highly topical subject and in particular for giving us the benefit of his experience of a visit to the site <e> <s> as my noble friend said at the end of june employment in tunnelling stood at about and on the project as a whole at about <e> <s> by the end of february tunnel employment had risen to and the total employed to <e> <s> we expect the figures to rise further and so we are talking about a substantial workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will not be surprised to learn that i am not at all satisfied with his response <e> <s> first he has not dealt with the argument that the -week period has not been given much of a chance to be tested <e> <s> for years the disqualification period was six weeks <e> <s> for reasons with which i do not altogether agree that was found to be unsatisfactory <e> <s> we then had a -week period <e> <s> within a very short time two or three years the -week period was change to weeks <e> <s> i do not find his explanations for that change satisfactory <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but i was not proposing to devote much time to them because i hoped the minister would explain exactly what they mean <e> <s> if i may return to my amendment no <e> <s> this is concerned as it states with the achievement of equal treatment for women in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation both in regard to the effect of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised by the response of the minister <e> <s> i did not expect the government to accept the amendment <e> <s> as the minister said and as all noble lords who have <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to write into legislation one of the propositions put forward by the occupational pensions board <e> <s> it is based on the assumption that some people would prefer the option of a lower pension with some indexation to a pension with no indexation but a higher pension to start with <e> <s> the noble viscount called it the pensioners option <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very clear explanation <e> <s> i am much relieved to learn of the way in which it is intended to fund this new office <e> <s> i am also pleased to learn that it will quite clearly be under government control without the possibility of any pressure being exerted from the industry at least that appears to be the case <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave with withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> the wording of my amendment provides that the minister may by regulation <e> <s> it does not say that he would have to require it following the quinquennium <e> <s> however in view of the assurance that the government will consider the whole issue in the course of the review and will if they think it necessary bring forward legislation there is no point in pressing the amendment at this stage <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the minister said <e> <s> what the government propose represents a substantial improvement for members of schemes and i welcome the suggestion <e> <s> my amendment goes further on the basis that pension funds are there to provide for pensioners and for the scheme beneficiaries and that there should not be any return to the employer until commitments to <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look carefully at what the noble lord said as the matter is rather complicated <e> <s> however i must say that the legal advice i have received states <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the social charters preamble makes clear and stresses that employment direction and creation must be given absolute priority <e> <s> it also states that the community must respond to the competitive challenges of the future <e> <s> that is part of the charters preamble <e> <s> is the minister aware that a select committee of this house examined the principles of the charter and made a recommendation to the government that they should cease their total opposition to it <e> <s> in addition the committee said that if the government wanted to make improvements they should do so by negotiation rather than by outright opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the tuc general council of which i was until recently a member has given unanimous support to the principles of the social charter <e> <s> is he also aware that our party on this side of the house has also supported those principles <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer and am glad to learn that the discussions are still proceeding <e> <s> is there a possibility that the youth training scheme could be abandoned altogether unless the funding is provided <e> <s> would that not be a great pity <e> <s> the building industry is still suffering from a chronic shortage of skilled workers and there has been a decline in the number of school-leavers <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too express my thanks to the minister and the noble baroness lady blatch for the way in which they have dealt with the often hostile amendments that we have put down on this side of the house <e> <s> i shall not go into the bill in detail because my noble friend has already done so <e> <s> he dealt with the clauses relating to disability carers the various social security benefits and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however is he aware that it is quite possible for an employer to provoke a dispute by unilaterally changing terms and conditions of employment and then when a dispute arises he can dismiss all the employees and take on non-union labour <e> <s> what kind of protection do union members have in such situations <e> <s> is the minister aware that this happens occasionally and has happened recently according to my information at a firm called chloride in southampton <e> <s> what protection do employees have in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for all the responses he has given <e> <s> however will he say without attempting to pre-empt the debate that will take place next week whether the government have considered issuing guidance to employers on these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which is very similar to the response that he made to the discussion on the social security bill <e> <s> has he no further information for us on bridging pensions an issue which it has become necessary to raise only because of a recent european directive and because we have unequal pension ages in this country <e> <s> can he give us any further information about that matter <e>", "<cs> on behalf of this bench i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> it is very similar to an amendment put down by the opposition <e> <s> i prefer our wording but the noble lords amendment is first before the committee <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised at the ministers response although i am rather disappointed by it because i had thought that he would look at the wording of the amendment and adopt a rather more constructive attitude to it <e> <s> the amendment states that it should be unlawful to expect an individual going for a job to accept a condition that his terms and conditions of employment shall not include a trade union representation clause <e> <s> in other words if someone who has been used to having trade union representation in his previous employment goes along and tells an employer when he is interviewed for a job look ive been used to being represented by my union and when i come here i should like the right of individual trade union representation and he is refused a job on those grounds it should be regarded as unlawful <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat disappointed that the minister even if he does not like the wording does not accept the validity of the points made by myself and the noble lord lord rochester in support of the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i cannot agree with the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that by tabling the amendment we are straining the bill because as i understand it clause relates to recruitment practices <e> <s> the amendment is clearly about recruitment practices <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that sympathy action can sometimes be altruistically motivated and that groups of workers might sometimes wish for quite altruistic reasons and not for self-aggrandisement to help other groups of workers <e> <s> is that not sympathy action <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether surprised by the noble lords response to this modest amendment <e> <s> although the government have said that they are all in favour of ballots they appear to be in favour of them only within unions and not in relation to employment itself which is what concerns most people belonging to trade unions <e> <s> people belong to unions in order to protect their conditions in relation to their employer and not in relation to the union to which they voluntarily belong <e>", "<cs> we now come to a discussion of clause as a whole <e> <s> i oppose the motion that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> we have attempted to amend the clause <e> <s> as has been said it removes immunity in tort from all secondary action i prefer to call it sympathy action other than that arising during the course of peaceful picketing by workers at their own place of work <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised at the way in which the minister has dismissed the intentions of this amendment <e> <s> i believe that it makes things much clearer for everybody <e> <s> if you have a lay executive it has to be called together <e> <s> it has to be given notice and arrangements have to be made for it to come <e> <s> it may take hours to get it together <e> <s> the executive may meet at the weekend <e> <s> it then has to make its determination and the repudiation has to be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the reasons why we are not competitive with our colleagues in western europe is that we do not have a training culture in this country <e> <s> is the tvei scheme not very important in establishing such a culture <e> <s> we have to motivate young people <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it is unfortunate that the view should get around that the government are less committed to the tvei scheme than appeared to be the case when they published their document <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the reply that the minister gave does he agree that one of the reasons for scepticism about some of the governments schemes is concern about the amount of resources that will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sad to learn that the other place regarded this matter as one of financial privilege and did not agree to accept your lordships amendment to delete clause from the bill <e> <s> your lordships will perhaps recall that in the social security act there is a provision under which all the social security benefits paid to the victim of an accident at work who succeeds in securing compensation at common law are clawed back out of the compensation payment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down he has not answered my point about the mib compensation scheme which was the <e>", "<cs> i rise to thank the noble lord the minister for the amendment that he has just moved and for the way in which he has moved it <e> <s> as he rightly said we had put down our own amendment some time before we saw the text of the governments amendment <e> <s> as noble lords will recall the reason for this and indeed the whole argument was the dock dispute which took place last year when the transport and general workers union sought to maintain its national negotiating role in the wake of the cessation of the dock labour scheme <e> <s> the union conducted a ballot which was in favour of dispute action the ballot had been conducted in accordance with the legislative requirements but the employers commenced a series of court actions in an endeavour to prevent the union from pursuing this course <e> <s> all the court actions failed but the time taken entirely absorbed the four-week period during which the union had to implement the ballot decision so there had to be a fresh ballot <e> <s> as a result a lot of the impetus was lost and the union was quite plainly put at a disadvantage <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> as the noble lord said this is a grossly unfair clause <e> <s> it is perhaps the nastiest clause in a nasty little bill <e> <s> i am totally against the clause as i am sure are most people who have concern for civil liberties <e> <s> it takes away the right of appeal <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not recognise that there is an enormous difference between selective dismissal which enables an employer to sort out people and a provision under which the employer has to dismiss all or none <e> <s> where an employer has to dismiss all or none in most cases he will dismiss nobody <e> <s> however selective dismissal gives the right to victimise <e> <s> that is what the discussion is about and that is why the labour government opposed the legislation <e>", "<cs> would the minister not agree that it would totally negate the opportunity of the employer to put into operation unsafe working conditions <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment this evening <e> <s> i am not very happy about the response of the minister either to this amendment or the preceding series of amendments relating to health and safety <e> <s> this amendment refers to the health and safety at work act and other pieces of legislation <e> <s> i am not arguing that the appropriate remedy is always by way of industrial action <e> <s> however i am saying that sometimes spontaneous actions take place on the shop floor if the employees perceive that a breach of legislation is taking place about which they are immediately concerned <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> some members might have been dismissed by then <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for the ministers assurance that he will consider what i have said <e> <s> it is very simple <e> <s> instead of having this statement in the report why can we not have the audited accounts which are published along with the report actually in the report <e> <s> the eoc and other similar bodies do that <e> <s> that is my main point <e> <s> it is small <e> <s> i do not press the amendment but i shall be grateful to the minister if he will look at it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his clear explanation of the order <e> <s> there is little that we on this side of the house can add to what he has said <e> <s> obviously if the special arrangements governing redundancy provisions in the shipping industry no longer apply the employees concerned should have the cover of the state redundancy scheme <e> <s> i therefore welcome the fact that the order is being introduced to make sure that they have that protection <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that long-time unemployment is difficult for the older worker <e> <s> is he also aware that i <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government have changed the way in which the statistics are calculated so many times about that meaningful comparisons have become almost impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little disappointed but not surprised by the response from the government <e> <s> much of it was not directed at the amendment but at different cases altogether <e> <s> the amendment is concerned with a rather narrow point <e> <s> it is not concerned with the activities of the economic league which are currently under investigation in another place <e> <s> the outcome of that for all we know may be legislative provisions far more sweeping than what the amendment suggests <e> <s> all we propose in the amendment is that if secret records are kept on people those people should have access to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add much to what was said by my noble friend lord wedderburn <e> <s> after consideration of what was said by the noble and learned lord lord donaldson in the case in question and the way in which i put the amendment in terms in which it was likely to occur in genuine industrial situations i am surprised that the government do not feel that they can do anything about the amendment <e> <s> they have not even said that they will consider it again and think about the matter between now and third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not all that surprised at the ministers response <e> <s> however i was a little surprised at the comments made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> because coming out on strike is a breach of contract even when there is proper authority from the union it is not only in relation to unofficial action that if an employee strikes he risks his employment <e> <s> that is not a new argument <e> <s> we have here a bill that introduces some new principles <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the ministers reply astonishing <e> <s> as i understand it if you are a member of a union and you take part in unofficial action even if not endorsed by your union or if a group of persons in the works are members of a union and they decide to walk off the job they are liable <e> <s> however if the same people take the same action but do not have a union card among them that is all right <e> <s> they will still have the protection of the law in relation to dismissal and so on <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is right <e> <s> in that case i still do not see the reason for including the clause in the bill <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is much i can add to what my noble friend lord wedderburn said during his intervention <e> <s> if matters are as indicated by the noble lord lord renton surely it would do no harm to write this provision into the bill so as to make it quite clear that the burden of proof in such circumstances in this jurisdictional matter rests with the employer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all reassured <e> <s> i do not understand the opposition from the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> it is not a question of being uncomplimentary to unions or their procedures but of not spending public money and utilising the time of a public official on individual complaints which could have been successfully resolved had the individual wished to do so within the unions procedures <e> <s> nor do i see why it would be incompatible with the office of the crotum as in the amendment and with the duties to be performed under the legislation <e> <s> at one time the certification officer had powers in relation to the operation of unions political fund rules <e> <s> i can well remember when i was a union official occasionally being involved in complaints to that official <e> <s> but he always satisfied himself before having a formal hearing that the individual concerned had first taken <e>", "<cs> my lords as everyone knows he has a vast amount of experience in this field of law and i am willing to believe that he is right about that <e> <s> therefore we have come back with another amendment <e> <s> i am not particularly committed to the wording but surely it is clear what we are about <e> <s> if the government find the wording unacceptable can they not find a way of giving the matter further attention because a genuine problem exists <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the assurance but i should be much happier if the provision were written on the face of the bill <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mccarthy has said the problem is one of great uncertainty <e> <s> the provision in subsection b appears to instruct everyone concerned that the rules of the union should not be taken into account <e> <s> the situation that i described in my opening remarks is real and likely to happen in practice <e> <s> the minister says as he has said with a number of our amendments that this is unnecessary <e> <s> we shall have to see how it works out in practice <e> <s> i am grateful for the categorical and specific assurance he has given which we shall study carefully in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now come to the end of this rather horrid little bill <e> <s> as we have said at various stages of its progress through your lordships house and as was confirmed this morning by the minister it is another instalment in the governments step-by-step policy of gradually undermining trade union rights in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lords lord rochester and lord boyd-carpenter in welcoming the noble viscount to the dispatch box on this first occasion however i should like to ask him whether he is aware that of over companies found to be illegally under-paying only eight have been prosecuted <e> <s> is that not a rather poor record of law enforcement <e> <s> as for the noble viscounts comment about the wages now being paid is he further aware that in some instances workers are being paid as little as an hour <e> <s> does not that refute what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had to say about wage inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that despite what is apparently to be done there are horrendous backlogs of cases particularly in the south which sometimes mean that delays of up to six months or even perhaps nine months are envisaged <e> <s> in my own union i am aware of two recently heard cases listed for the eat where the earliest date that can be given is march next year <e> <s> does he agree that that is an awful way to conduct cases that were originally meant to be quickly determined through easily accessible proceedings bearing in mind that such employment cases often involve people who have been dismissed <e>", "<cs> my lords on the issue of dismissed employees the minister will be aware that industrial tribunals have the power to order reinstatement <e> <s> sometimes that is not a widely used power <e> <s> on the other hand is it not a farce to imagine that reinstatement can be a solution if there has been <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a number of companies in this industry took the opportunity afforded by the termination of the scheme to dismiss a large number of people who had been trade union activists <e> <s> is he further aware that this has led to the longest running industrial tribunal hearing in the history of industrial tribunals <e> <s> is that not a totally unforeseen additional expense <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how many of the people who have become self-employed in small businesses following unemployment have subsequently gone bankrupt and can he say what steps have been taken to assist them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in the levels of unemployment were far lower than they are now <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the employment situation has everything to do with the general economic situation and very little to do with policies of deregulation and absence of employee benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that response <e> <s> however is he aware that the legal advice received by pensions consultants has been conflicting <e> <s> is he also aware that there seems to be a great deal of difference of opinion as to whether or not the effect of the judgment is retroactive <e> <s> there is also confusion as to what schemes should now do <e> <s> if they equalise their pension ages at they could face difficulties because they are not allowed to introduce bridging pensions for men between the ages of and <e> <s> if they try to equalise the ages at there will be difficulties with respect to women employees because many women will consider that their conditions have become worse <e> <s> is it possible to issue guidance to resolve the situation <e>"]
