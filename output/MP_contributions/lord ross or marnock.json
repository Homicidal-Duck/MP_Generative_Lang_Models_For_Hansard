["<cs> my lords this series of amendments hinges upon what the government are now prepared to do in respect of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is not only helpful <e> <s> it is sensible <e> <s> it means that the government are handing over to local authorities a responsible duty which they would not take on themselves <e> <s> perhaps the minister of state will tell me whether the government will give some guidance to the licensing authorities otherwise they may well exempt some classes in one district authority and do the very opposite somewhere else <e> <s> it affects amendments i have put down relating to second-hand dealers in which i suggest that booksellers and auctioneers ought to be left out <e> <s> this is a far better way of dealing with it but let the government not underestimate the difficulty which they are now inflicting upon the district licensing authorities <e> <s> however this is sensible and helpful and i am very glad that the government appreciate exactly the difficulties which their generalisation of this particular activity has got them into <e> <s> nevertheless i congratulate them on at least this step forward <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i have a thing about things <e> <s> i consider that it is a matter of inadequate draftsmanship of words when we resort to use of the word thing <e> <s> we come to this again <e> <s> i missed the opportunity by not being here on the last occasion that we considered the bill <e> <s> this is a fallback power <e> <s> the authority use this power only when they cannot use any other power under any other clause <e> <s> that being the case it is a very important power and a very sweeping power <e> <s> it is the roads authority which consider the thing a danger <e> <s> there is no notice to the owner of the land as i read it <e> <s> the roads authority just go in and do it <e> <s> they do what they think is necessary and then they charge the owner of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords it should have been local and that is why there is merit in the amendment that is put forward by the noble lord lord ferrier <e> <s> let the local people have another thought about it and if it is held up by an election it does not matter whether or not it is in manifestos <e> <s> people will think about it again because to my mind it would not happen in any other city in britain or anywhere else that you would build a special road to take traffic more quickly into the centre of the city <e> <s> if you do that people will use it <e> <s> of course they will and that is why the national trust is concerned and why the cockburn society is concerned <e>"]
