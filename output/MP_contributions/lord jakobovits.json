["<cs> my lords several reasons prompt me to ask for your lordships indulgence today <e> <s> i am deeply touched by the warm and gracious welcome extended to me by the noble earl which has been supported by the other speakers <e> <s> notwithstanding the reassuring words that i heard from the noble earl about maiden speeches i can assure him and other noble lords that i share with every new peer whatever his or her past experience in public life some trepidation in speaking for the first time within earshot of these venerable walls that have listened and still often listen to some of britains finest minds and most eloquent orators <e> <s> in fact i feel somewhat like my ancestor and namesake the patriarch jacob who slept on a stone which by legend is not unconnected with the early history of this house <e> <s> he awoke in the morning and exclaimed how full of awe is this place <e> <s> this is none other than the house of the lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with my maiden speech happily behind me i am no longer under the constraints which prevented me previously from speaking on controversial matters <e> <s> i need no longer resist the temptation to do so <e>", "<cs> the last speech which was for me the most heartwarming has made it easier for me to say a few words in the debate despite the fact that i rise with considerable diffidence because i face a double dilemma <e> <s> one is purely pragmatic in that my public and communal commitments are such that unfortunately i was unable to attend the entire debate on second reading <e> <s> however i made up for that by reading through the massive proceedings the -odd speeches recorded in <e>", "<cs> my lords as a representative of the other faiths that have been mentioned so often and indeed of a people who have been called the great non-conformists of history may i for my part say that when i originally read the proposed new amendments in cold print i was greatly perplexed confused and in part considerably worried <e> <s> but having now listened to the exegesis of the right reverend prelate and particularly also the interpretations given by the noble baroness lady cox the noble lord lord elton and others i feel immensely relieved and indeed encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate with its exceedingly wide range of conflicting arguments to my mind has clearly shown that we are dealing here with issues of the most profound consequence and of fundamental principle far beyond the immediate concerns of the home secretarys order and that we cannot isolate the specific situation in northern ireland from the wider issue of international terrorism of which it is an integral part <e> <s> it is therefore to those basic issues that i should like to address myself in a few remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a pacifist <e> <s> i do not reject recourse to force and violence by a nation against evils such as those we saw rise with hitler <e> <s> i have dealt with the juxtaposition of freedom of speech and civil liberties with the rights of individuals to the protection of their lives by governments appointed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords rarely i dare say have the walls of this chamber listened to a debate more sombre than this discussing as we do the continued culpability or the remission of a crime so horrendous and so unprecedented that a new term had to be invented and coined namely the term genocide to describe it as the <e>", "<cs> my lords listed as i am as speaker number in what i find a most rare experience of a uniquely enriching debate and at the same time a most fateful debate on which the generation or destruction of countless potential lives may depend it may be expected at this stage that there is little more to say on either side of the argument and that therefore my words will be correspondingly short <e> <s> alas however i find myself oppressively leaning in the opposite direction <e> <s> indeed the more i hear the more challenges there are to answer <e> <s> moreover the more complex the subject becomes the more constituents one has to address in relating to a theme of such enormity as is the subject of our discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords in exercising the right of reply i want to express above all in a few words my profound appreciation at having had the privilege of participating in what was to me a most enriching experience culminating in the magnificent presentation of the arguments by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the delightful fringe benefits in speaking in this otherwise grave and what i am sure to all of us is a painful debate is that i can wholeheartedly join the previous speaker in congratulating the noble lord who bears such a distinguished name in the annals of our people and our community <e> <s> he made a beautiful maiden speech <e> <s> in it he gave so much heart as well as thought to a problem of utter perplexity <e> <s> i have the added benefit which the noble lord lord hutchinson who followed him did not have of being able to agree with him as well <e> <s> therefore i thank him for the encouragement that he has given me <e> <s> perhaps i may say for the two of us that belonging as we do to a people described in the bible as the smallest of all peoples we are not exactly unaccustomed to being in a minority <e> <s> i appreciate the trend of view so powerfully and of ten logically expressed by speakers before me and no doubt will be again by many of those who are to come afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords as the religious head of the community that has been singled out for the special attention of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in the prayer that he has put before us i <e>"]
