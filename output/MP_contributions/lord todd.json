["<cs> my lords we would all wish i am sure to thank the noble lord lord gregson for the admirable way he has summarised and presented to us the report on electric vehicles <e> <s> i would wish particularly to thank hint for the shall i say <e> <s> masterly way in which he conducted the study on which the report is based a study made by a sub-committee of which he was the chairman <e> <s> as the noble lord has said this is the first report of your committee on science and technology <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of this report which has been so ably presented to us today by my noble friend lord sherfield and to whom i must say is due most of the credit for getting a report out at all through the magnificent way in which he handled the committee of inquiry in the chair is one which has been argued about and debated by many people for many years and particularly has it been prominent since the time of the last war and that in practically all countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the matters to which my noble friend lord hunter of newington has drawn our attention this afternoon are most important to all of us <e> <s> all of us at one time or another are users of the national health service and therefore our well-being and the well-being of the service are intimately linked <e> <s> it is for that reason that i venture this afternoon to make a few brief and rather general comments <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all thank the noble lord lord sherfield for the admirable summary that he gave of this report in opening the debate <e> <s> we should also thank him even more for the tremendous amount of work that he put into the production of this report as chairman of the committee which carried out the study <e> <s> he did a tremendous job there and i think we would all agree that he has produced a report which is not only well-composed but is of very considerable importance <e> <s> as a result of his admirable summary and what other speakers have said i do not propose to detain your lordships very long <e> <s> but i should like just to underline and perhaps amplify a little some of the things which the noble lord lord sherfield said about this problem of sewerage and sewer dereliction <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister perhaps agree that had the university of london accepted the proposals in the report of the royal commission on medical education in the question we are discussing today would have been quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to be very brief in my remarks largely because of the admirable way in which the noble lord lord sherfield introduced this motion <e> <s> the noble lord covered a wide range of points some of which i personally would otherwise have made and therefore i can be brief <e> <s> i very much welcome the fact that the noble lord has drawn our attention to this report because it is an important report and we should do well to pay attention to some of the flatters raised in it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sherfield himself remarked it is we hope only the first in a series of reports of this type which will perhaps be issued annually <e> <s> the report itself and these future ones which i expect stem largely from the report of the sub-committee of your lordships select committee on science and technology on the theme of science and government which was chaired by the noble lord lord sherfield <e> <s> that report was published almost three years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble lord lord annan for two things first for introducing a very important subject for debate today and secondly for giving us the opportunity of hearing a most excellent maiden speech by the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx <e> <s> it was if i may say so a speech in which he revealed not merely an interest in but a very considerable knowledge of both the open university and the technical universities at least coming from his office as chancellor of bradford <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl realise that whatever anyone may say about the statistics spanning about million the fact is that the closure of four units by the medical research council this year will be due essentially to lack of money and that it is just a symptom of what will happen that more units will be closed unless something is done and done pretty quickly to restore some at least of the damaging cuts which have been made in the budget of the medical research council and also in the grants made to the universities <e> <s> i do not want to throw this open to science in general but let us just think about the kind of things which the medical research council supports <e> <s> in the case of molecular biology <e>", "<cs> yes it is coming my lords <e> <s> molecular biology in which we used to be pre-eminent though now i am afraid we are not is now moving into clinical medicine and through biotechnology it is moving into industry <e> <s> i should like to know whether the government are aware of this fact and whether they are going to do anything to restore the cuts which have been made and which have resulted not merely in a loss of morale but in many of our young people going abroad to make their careers and use their talents because if it is not then in a matter of a few years time we are going to appear among the also-rans in a world where social change has occurred on a very great scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to echo earlier speakers in thanking the noble lord lord sherfield not only for bringing before us the subject of the research councils but for presenting the general problems to us in such an admirable way <e> <s> i could touch on a great many points that he made but it is quite unnecessary after his exposition <e> <s> i was particularly pleased that the noble lord should bring this matter forward <e> <s> the research councils are a vital component of the provision that we make in this country for promoting research <e> <s> especially is that true of university research which is the area with which i personally have been most concerned in my career <e> <s> they do that by being a part of what is called the dual support system a system which has been described to us already this afternoon by the noble lord lord sherfield <e>", "<cs> my lords i decided to take part in this debate not merely because as a citizen of this country i am naturally interested in the future of what has been regarded for years or so as a british colony but because i have a strong personal interest to declare in <e>", "<cs> my lords like earlier speakers this evening i should like to begin by thanking the noble earl lord stockton for bringing before us this important topic and for doing it in his own inimitable way <e> <s> it is an important subject that we are discussing for on our capacity to adapt to the radical changes which are being brought about continuously by new technologies our future as a country will depend <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one point on this matter <e> <s> the real problem of this amendment is that there is a fantastic difficulty in trying to define what we mean by a beauty preparation <e> <s> i feel that we should stick to the general idea of the bill and leave it to the home secretary with the advice of his advisory committee to decide whether or not in a particular case action is necessary <e> <s> after all what is a beauty preparation <e> <s> what do you say to a young girl who is suffering rather badly from acne and wants to put something on her face <e> <s> is that a beauty preparation or what is it <e> <s> one is up against a problem of definition here <e> <s> we should always remember that when we are dealing with a bill of this nature the more we attempt to specify precisely what shall be done and what shall not be done the more unworkable we will make the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i decided to intervene in this debate on the motion of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos because it seemed to me that the noble lord was raising a problem that had nothing to do with party politics <e> <s> the matter under discussion is the future national status of a section of the population of hong kong <e> <s> that is something which concerns such matters as natural justice fair play and human rights <e> <s> it has nothing to do with politics <e> <s> however it is a matter which concerns us in respect of the aspects which i have mentioned and they are matters which i have always regarded as being thought to be of importance in this country <e> <s> basically the question is what status should be accorded to the so-called non-ethnic chinese minorities in hong kong following the transfer of sovereignty to the peoples republic of china in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> as i said i did not know the details i merely produced an idea which seemed to me to be at any rate worth considering <e>"]
