["<cs> my lords may i begin my contribution to this important and interesting debate by thanking the noble earl lord gowrie for his extremely lucid explanation of the bill which at first sight might seem to be very complicated and also congratulate him for being able to do so in such a relatively short space of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon that is quite correct <e> <s> but i had the impression that he was in favour of the united nations levy of more than double the figure proposed in the bill <e> <s> by all means have a levy but if it is too big it will act as a severe deterrent to exploration and exploitation <e> <s> therefore at this early stage if there is to be a figure and personally i should prefer to see a figure so that we know what we are working on then let us make it a low figure at any rate to begin with <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really a question for the noble earl to answer but from my own reading of the bill i think that there would be reciprocal arrangements to ensure that there was no overlapping of licences <e> <s> however i would prefer the noble earl to answer the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> surely a time-honoured phrase such as in this connection can be regarded as a code signalling that there will be something in the budget statement which will make this amendment unnecessary <e> <s> i repeat that it is a code which some of us understand to a lesser or greater degree <e> <s> therefore it would be quite unreasonable i submit to the noble <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may join in at this stage to say that we should remember that the cork report had some sympathy with the concept of quasi trust moneys being collected but recommended that the period for which preference should be given should be reduced to that within which a reasonably diligent collector would have got the money in <e> <s> that is why my noble friend lord noel-buxton and i have suggested a period of six months <e> <s> ideally we would go along with others who say that there should be no preference at all but in framing our amendment in the way we did we thought there would be more chance of winning it on the basis of a six-month period than by pressing for no period at all <e> <s> but if the sense of the committee is interpretated by her majestys ministers as no period at all then my noble friend and i would certainly go along with that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not refreshing to find the noble lord lord bruce of donington speaking up in favour of the higher rate taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the business should be frozen until the inspectors have reported <e>", "<cs> my lords as to my noble friends reply these are not two separate matters <e> <s> is it not absolutely central to the public interest to ensure that those who seek control of british companies should be seen to be if i may use the current colloquialism squeaky clean before any bid is approved by the monopolies and mergers commission and you the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak on the rd report on nuclear energy as i was a member of the committee <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ross about how valuable it is to be a member of a select committee <e> <s> one learns a great deal and has some interesting experiences when finding out what goes on in establishments which one would never otherwise have an opportunity to visit <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord tests the opinion of the committee perhaps he will allow other members the opportunity to give their views <e>", "<cs> i know that several members on this side of the committee support the government as do i i should like to thank the minister for giving those assurances this afternoon <e> <s> they go a long way towards removing many of the doubts of a financial nature which were previously expressed <e> <s> as regards the other so-called unknowns of a technical nature <e>", "<cs> i shall go on <e> <s> apparently the noble lord does not wish to intervene at this stage and so i shall continue <e> <s> my noble friend lord peyton referred to a vast number of unknowns <e> <s> that is going a little far <e> <s> there are a certain number of unknowns but i believe that they are containable <e> <s> i believe that previous speakers tended to over-emphasise the difference between nuclear and conventional power stations <e>", "<cs> in view of the assurances which the noble lord the minister has just given about further conversations i am very encouraged <e> <s> for the benefit of those who think that is a relatively small charge i would just add that it is not <e> <s> the average cost of erecting a road sign for the automobile association is only about and even less for large quantities <e> <s> so the imposition of a fine so to speak per sign more than doubles the cost of the whole exercise which can be very serious in the case of a small rural charity <e> <s> but in view of the assurances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very cautious reply <e> <s> does he realise that time is short if a private bill for either of those <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that informative answer would it not be much more satisfactory if britain were to follow the practice of all ec countries which authorise the return of hard-core unwanted coins back to the central banks of those countries <e>", "<cs> my lords as the originator of this whole subject may i say that i tabled my question in all innocence in order to seek information about the project <e> <s> i am delighted to have learned so much <e> <s> however will my noble friend arrange for the immediate publication of an up-to-date map of where the east-west crossrail is likely to go <e> <s> at present we are solely reliant on the sketch plan in the central london rail study which was published almost two years ago <e>"]
