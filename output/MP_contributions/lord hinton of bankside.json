["<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady white has indicated there was some debate in your sub-committee as to whether the procedure which is proposed in this directive was entirely appropriate <e> <s> i do not propose to deal with that question but rather to leave it to those members of this house who are better qualified to talk about it than i am <e> <s> my intention is to confine myself to the purely practical problems of standardisation <e> <s> it so happens that i have been more than normally exposed to those problems during my career <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should first of all express my gratitude to the noble lord lord gregson for giving us the opportunity of debating the finniston report <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had many debates in which figures for energy supply have been given and there is no reason why i should spend time repeating them <e> <s> i intend only to amend them by saying that the forward position in regard to two out of our four major energy resources seems to be worse than it was when we last discussed them <e> <s> there are a great many people <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord mishcon i intend to speak only about clause of this bill <e> <s> that clause seeks to give to the secretary of state financial powers to make grants or loans and it does define the purposes for which those loans shall be given <e> <s> roughly in the words of the bill the purposes are to assist in the promotion of the practice of engineering the improvement of links between industry and education and the encouragement of young people to become engineers <e> <s> all those are laudable objectives but i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that the strings tied on to them are highly undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i emphasise that this is an extremely important point <e> <s> i am very glad to be supported in my interpretation of the wording by so distingusished a member of the legal profession as the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i would most strongly suggest tht the secretary of state and the department should consider an alteration in the wording <e>", "<cs> i willingly accepted the suggestion that these amendments should be aggregated for discussion <e> <s> it was felt that the discussion of them might become slightly convoluted if they were dealt with in the order in which they appeared on the list <e> <s> indeed i am not free at the moment from the impression that our debate is getting a little convoluted <e> <s> i believe that it is proper for me to draw attention at this stage to the amendment which i set down which is to omit clause <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i spelled out in the second reading debate the way in which those subsections could be used in order to enable the secretary of state to nominate the members of the body in perpetuity <e> <s> he has only to foreclose on the loan after which the body would have to go to the money market to raise such amount as was outstanding and the body would not be able to do that without getting a government guarantee <e> <s> i suggest that if such a government guarantee were given the subsections to which i referred could entitle the secretary of state to make nominations <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will forgive me once more i said very clearly in the second reading debate that i did not for one moment suggest that the present secretary of state would do this but that once the bill is on the statute book it could be done and the present secretary of state cannot commit his successors <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i emphatically point out that at no stage have i either suggested or implied the formation of a statutory body <e> <s> the fact that i suggested that the whole matter might have been dealt with as a separate issue in debate does not imply or i had not intended it to imply a statutory body because i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i must immediately apologise for the fact that i was not able to be in the house when the debate was opened <e> <s> i shall certainly read the speeches that were given then and particularly i shall read with interest the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord torrington <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all extremely grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury for giving us the opportunity of debating this subject tonight <e> <s> it seems to me that the debate is if anything overdue and i was certainly pleased to see as i am sure were other noble lords the statement that was made by the secretary of state in another place last week <e> <s> it may be helpful although it may involve my repeating very briefly some of the points which the noble earl lord halsbury made in his speech and other points that were made by the noble earl lord mansfield if i run over the history of what went before and which perhaps led to that statement by the secretary of state <e>"]
